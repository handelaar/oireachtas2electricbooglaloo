      <asker>Mr. Quinn</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to establish a separate Government Department of European Affairs with with its own Secretary and Estimate, independent from the Department of Foreign Affairs to promote and co-ordinate Ireland's interests within the European Community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is the member of the Government responsible for the conduct of Ireland's relations within the Community, where he represents us in the General Affairs Council which is the central forum for the conduct of the business of the Council of Ministers.  Other Ministers are responsible for EC business within their particular areas of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effective pursuit of Irish interests in the Community is further strengthened by the exercise of co-ordination responsibilities by a Minister of State for European Affairs in my Department who <Col N="1690" /> chairs the standing interdepartmental European Co-ordination Committee. The committee reflects the increasing role of the European Council which meets at Head of State or Government level twice a year or more often if necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason to change the existing arrangements which provide an integrated framework for the conduct of our EC relations and our foreign relations generally.  EC affairs and foreign relations generally are indeed becoming more, rather than less, closely interwoven.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  My question was inspired by the Taoiseach's recognition that there is an information deficit in Europe generally and among Irish people in particular. Having regard to that, would the Taoiseach agree that there is need not for a committee or some kind of integrated framework which is not accountable democratically to this House, but for a separate Department of European Affairs to address the information deficit which the Taoiseach identified during the Maastricht Treaty referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information deficit would not be solved by a change in the institutional framework, as suggested by the question.  A new Department would separate the conduct of our relations with the EC from the rest of our foreign policy leading to less co-ordination.  Establishing the new Department would also risk dissipating expertise in EC matters which the Department of Foreign Affairs have built up over the years.  I have looked at other member states and found that the Department of Foreign Affairs is primarily responsible for the co-ordination of EC policy.  None of the member states has a separate Department of European Affairs.  The Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Tom Kitt, co-ordinates the affairs of the various Government Departments more or less on a monthly basis.  The information deficit is a different problem.  Everybody must play their part in attacking that, <Col N="1691" /> not just EC institutions based here but members of the European Parliament who can improve the information flow on what is happening in the Parliament affecting the lives of ordinary citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain the philosophy behind his Government's thinking which on the one hand espouses European union while at the same time regarding it as foreign affairs issue?  At what stage will European union cease to come under foreign affairs and become a domestic affair, like every Government Department?  At what stage will that warrant a European affairs Department like the Department of Finance or the Department of Industry and Commerce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Changing the name of the Department will not correct the problem the Deputy is referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about dividing functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about an information deficit and changing the structure or the name of the Department will not solve the problem.  There are other ways of solving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about changing the name but about establishing a separate Department, separating the functions of foreign affairs from European affairs.  Would the Taoiseach agree that, given the choice of priority, international affairs and Anglo-Irish affairs have priority over European affairs in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  That is at the nub of the problem.  Until those functions are separated we will not have a Minister with exclusive responsibility for European affairs at the Cabinet table.</P>

      <P>I have to disuade Members from the notion that they may debate this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach avoid the use of phrases like &ldquo;European information deficit&rdquo; and talk about the public <Col N="1692" /> not knowing what is going on, which is what we are really talking about.  There is too much &ldquo;Euro-speak&rdquo; being introduced into the affairs of this House.  I hope we can at least correct that in this House.  Pending the implementation of Deputy Quinn's proposal, could we establish a committee on European Affairs and/or Foreign Affairs as quickly as possible, and preferably before we adjourn for the summer recess so that the committees can meet over the summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Whips will be able to put the matter to bed either today or tomorrow.  I am not holding it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that what is being proposed is a foreign affairs committee which would have a relatively minor responsibility for European affairs but what is urgently required is an Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs which would of right have responsibility for monitoring Government activity at European level and at which Ministers would be obliged to attend to explain their roles at European levels?  I believe this is the best way of closing the information gap that exists both at public and Dáil levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar proposal is being considered by the Whips at present. They are considering the establishment of two sub-committees: a sub-committee on foreign affairs and another sub-committee on European affairs.  Provision can be made for members of the European Parliament to attend and contribute to meetings.  This would go a long way towards solving the problem we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Taoiseach that we are suffering from a democratic rather than an information deficit? When major issues such as the Maastricht Treaty and European Union have to be discussed, would the Taoiseach agree that we should allow adequate time for a proper debate on a motion and that the <Col N="1693" /> matter should be debated rather than Members making a series of statements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of ongoing debate whether such subjects are dealt with by questions or in other ways.  If, as Deputy Barry suggests, we get rid of &ldquo;Euro-speak&rdquo; we should not use terms like &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; which is more &ldquo;Euro-speak&rdquo; and we should be aiming, as the Council suggested over the weekend, for more application of the subsidiarity rule and for a better understanding and clarification of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more &ldquo;Eurospeak&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not wait to hear me finish my reply.  We have to explain what the subsidiarity rule is and then clarify it.  Decisions have to be taken at the appropriate level.  If a decision is best taken at ground level, that is where it should be taken, although in certain cases decisions have to be taken at European level &mdash; in other words, we are trying to stop the growth of an anonomous super-State.  We are all aiming at that.  We are trying to make the decision process more relevant to the lives of ordinary citizens.  We are trying to transmit information on what is happening out there through the media and through the process of debates in this House and the members of the European Parliament will have to play a greater role in disseminating information to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dwelling over long on this question to the detriment of all other questions.  I will call two more Deputies on the basis that they will be very brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising directly from the Taoiseach's reply, is he aware there is no ongoing discussion between the Whips on a committee system for European affairs?  In response to the Government proposal, the Labour Party suggested setting up two separate committees.  Therefore, the matter is now entirely in the <Col N="1694" /> hands of the Government to decide to accept our proposal for two separate committees working independently, one on foreign affairs and the other on the key issues of European affairs.  Will the Taoiseach desist from telling the House that the matter is still under discussion because the Labour Party made known their views to the Chief Whip several weeks ago?</P>

      <P>Good progress has been made in implementing the review of the Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>On the economic front, Ireland's competitiveness has continued to improve, and the budget made good progress towards implementing the agreed financial and tax reform targets.  The Green Paper on Education was published last week.  The Common Agricultural Policy reform has turned out to be very satisfactory with due regard for Ireland's special interests.  Oireachtas reform proposals have been agreed and submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The social housing programme is being implemented.  The Government have made continued progress in maintaining and, where possible, improving the level of payments to social welfare recipients.  The general increase of 4 per cent next month will be well clear of inflation, now expected to be no more than 3.5 per cent.  There has also been progress on legislative reform, for example, on the Criminal Evidence Bill and the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that there are a number of commitments that remain to be implemented and that there is, therefore, a very full programme for the remaining two years of the life of the Government.</P>

      <P>A number of promises were made in the review of the Programme for Government, some of which were supposed to be implemented by the end of last year and others by early this year.  It was proposed that the White Paper on Marital Breakdown, which was to incorporate a draft Bill, would be published by the end of last year but this has not yet been published.  Will the Taoiseach state when he expects this Bill to be brought forward?  With regard to the matter of law reform, 16 pieces of legislation were promised but 12 have not yet been published.  When is it proposed to publish such legislation?  It was proposed to give emigrants the vote.  The document was to be presented to Cabinet and a decision made on this subject before Christmas of last year but we have not heard the results of that.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Deputy that not everything included in the review of the <i>Programme for Government</i> was committed to be implemented in 1992?  As the Deputy already said, four Bills relating to law reform were introduced and we will continue with this legislative programme.  It was never envisaged that this process would be completed within six months or a year, and the Government have a further two years in office.  The Programme for Government is to be completed over the term of office of this Government and it does not have to be completed within six months or a year.</P>

He is not going to distribute them.</P>

      <P>The census was carried out in April 1991 and the preliminary data was published in June 1991. Could the Minister give the reason for such a long delay?  Why should there be an 18 month delay from the time of publication of the preliminary results? Surely that is not the usual amount of time taken.  Given that the commitment in the review of the Programme for Government was for an independent commission to examine the constituencies, what is the reason for the delay?</P>

I am not aware that the 18 month delay before publication of the final figures is any longer than the time taken in the past.  The figures have to be compiled as a result of the final population figures at district electoral division level.  There have to be appropriate enumerations, summaries have to be gone through and there is also the listing of dwellings and the enumeration maps, which have to be checked throughly for consistency and completeness.  We have to ensure that they are accurate which is the reason for the delay.  I do not consider that the delay is in any way inordinate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 7, 27, 43, 51 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, members of the Defence Forces, not below the rank of petty <Col N="1705" /> officer, are sea fisheries protection officers for the purposes of that Act while serving on board Naval Service ships. Accordingly, they have statutory authority to enforce the law in relation to sea fisheries.  Responsibility, however, for inland fisheries, including salmon, rests with the Central Fisheries Board under the Fisheries Act, 1980.  In assisting in the implementation of salmon protection measures, the Naval Service do so in the context of rendering aid to the civil authority.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service involvement consists of providing a Naval Service coastal patrol vessel, either <i>LE Orla</i> or <i>LE Ciara</i>, in order that the regional fishery board inspector can carry out his task of examining the licences and nets of salmon fishing vessels.  A member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of sergeant, is also carried on board the Naval vessel to ensure that the inspector is not impeded in the exercise of his duty.  If for any reason a regional fishery board inspector is not available, a salmon patrol by the Naval Service cannot take place.</P>
    <P>The programme of salmon fishery patrols each year is planned in discussions involving the Department of the Marine, the Central Fisheries Board, the Garda Síochána and the Department of Defence, including the military and Naval authorities.  It is accepted by all concerned with the protection programme that patrol plans must remain confidential and flexible.  In the event, patrolling commenced on 22 instant and is still continuing.</P>
    <P>With regard to sea fishery protection duties, Naval Service personnel, in their capacity as sea fisheries officers, act on priorities specified by the Department of the Marine and, using intelligence gathered and experience gained over the years, plan and execute sea fishery protection patrols on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>I have to take issue with the Minister.  He did not answer my question as on the Order Paper this afternoon, which states very clearly that in the week ending 12 June a major fishing operation was cancelled.  Will the <Col N="1706" /> Minister explain why an instruction was issued by the Department of Defence to the Naval Service to cancel that patrol? Apparently it came from the Department of the Marine &mdash; that is the information I have &mdash; yet the Department of the Marine have denied they issued any such request that the patrol be cancelled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, the Department of Defence act in aid &mdash; as the Army act in aid of the Garda on the Border area &mdash; of the Central Fisheries Board and the Department of the Marine, aided by the Garda sergeant on board the vessel.  That is the structure. As I indicated, if the Central Fisheries Board inspector is not available and if a Garda sergeant is not available the patrol cannot take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

My information is that all personnel, such as the Garda, the Central Fisheries Board officer and the Naval Service were prepared to go on that patrol and it was cancelled at the last minute.  The Minister for the Marine has indicated that he had no hand or part in it, it was a matter for the Department of Defence.  There is confusion somewhere and I want it clarified.</P>

Does he consider this satisfactory?  Despite repeated requests to this House, why has he not considered extending the summer camps, in some instances at least, to 14 days?  Has he given any consideration to allocating additional Army officers to the FCA in view of the large number of captains and commandants within the Army at the moment who are hindering promotional opportunities?</P>

      <asker>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest> whether there are any grounds for recent reports that Irish UNIFIL personnel engaged in bomb disposal operations have been the target of local assailants in the Lebanon.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 22, 33, 35, 39, 52 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Explosive ordnance disposal operations are very much a routine part of the activities of Irish UNIFIL personnel. Statistics relating to the past five years in respect of the operations involved which <Col N="1709" /> include the disposal of unexploded munitions and devices are not readily available.  There has been no recent evidence that Irish personnel engaged in such operations have been the target of local armed elements.  No Irish personnel have been killed or injured in the course of bomb disposal operations at any stage of our involvement with UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>In the past five years three members of the Permanent Defence Force have been killed by an explosive device while on operational duty with UNIFIL.  All three deaths were caused on 21 March 1989 as a result of the explosion of a land mine beneath the truck in which they were travelling.  This was the last serious incident involving an explosive device which resulted in Irish casualties.</P>
    <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL is kept under constant review.  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection.  All developments affecting the safety of Irish personnel serving in UNIFIL are closely monitored and security procedures are continually reviewed.  Operational procedures in Lebanon are geared &mdash; I have had experience of this &mdash; to provide maximum safety for our troops consistent with the carrying out of their mission. Every effort will continue to be made to ensure the greatest possible protection for our troops on overseas service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 21 June 1992 which clearly stated that the Shi'ite guerillas were specifically targeting Irish UNIFIL troops in South Lebanon because of their extraordinary expertise in relation to bomb disposal and that Lieutenant Aonghus Murphy died as a result of this targeting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the <i>Sunday Times</i> article in front of me and it is quite flattering to our troops in the Lebanon. I do not have anything further to add because my reply was full and gave all the facts.  I was very pleased with the <Col N="1710" /> article because usually articles from certain sources are not very flattering to our troops.  However, that article was in touch with reality and paid a great tribute to our troops operating in the Lebanon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to South Lebanon, has the Minister received any further report or indication as to who killed Corporal McCarthy from Cork before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pursuing that with the authorities.  Lieutenant Murphy served with the 64th Battalion and &mdash; to give an idea of how far back that was &mdash; the 71st Battalion are serving in the Lebanon at present.  We are pursuing the matter of Corporal McCarthy's killing with the Israeli authorities.  The <i>de facto</i> forces in South Lebanon, if not commanded by the Israeli Army, are sponsored by them.</P>

      <P>The working group which were set up by the efficiency audit group to examine the administration in the Defence Forces, have, I understand recently submitted their report to the EAG.  The EAG are expected to consider the report at a meeting next month and to present their recommendations to the Taoiseach when they have finished consideration of the report.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister, arrange to have the report of the efficiency audit group placed in the Library or at least to circulate it to Opposition spokespersons?  This is the fourth time I have requested this and I know that Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan and Deputy McCartan have also repeatedly requested the Taoiseach, and the Minister, to furnish this report to us but to no avail.  Why is the Minister so hesitant about circulating this report as it has been under consideration by a number of people?  Is he aware of the confusion and fear among many Army families with regard to their future?  Army personnel are also concerned about their promotional opportunities.  Will the Minister agree that there is a huge question mark over the Army at present and a high level of dissatisfaction because of the uncertainty?</P>

      <P>I reject most of the implications of the Deputy's remarks.

I assure the Deputy, and the House, that my Department and the Army will ensure that full and due consideration will be given to the social and domestic circumstances of anybody who will be affected.  With regard to the publication of the report, as I said in my reply the efficiency audit group will be reporting to the Taoiseach and a decision will be taken later in regard to their recommendations.  Their work is ongoing.</P>

    <P>In addition there are five permanent Army/Garda checkpoints at various positions along the Border.</P>
    <P>Personnel from the military posts assist the Garda Síochána in patrolling the road network around the Border several times every 24 hours.  The patrols are equipped with radio and can be diverted quickly to the scene of a Border incident.  In addition stand-to parties are kept in readiness in each post at all times.  These are available to respond to requests for aid by the gardaí and can be on their way to the scene of an incident without delay.</P>
    <P>During 1991 military parties in the Border area were sent on about 11,000 patrols, established 12,000 checkpoints and assisted in carrying out over 220 searches.</P>
    <P>Air Corps helicopters are specifically allocated for Border operations and fixed wing reconnaissance aircraft are located in Gormanstown in support of operations in the Border area.</P>
    <P>Bomb disposal and specialised search <Col N="1713" /> teams are also stationed on the Border where they can provide a quick response in connection with bomb threats or the need for systematic searching of specific locations.</P>

      <P>Given that the Irish Army did not come across the British Army incursion on this occasion, does the Minister consider it most unusual that the British Army should come South, considering the different nature of their operation from that of the Irish Army?  Will the Minister agree that the Irish Army are much more visible in the Border area than the British Army who are billeted at particular posts?  The numbers of British Army personnel are substantially higher than the number of Irish Army soldiers along the Border. Will he explain to the House why he believes the British Army came South given the differing nature of their operation North of the Border?  Will he agree that it was very unusual?</P>

      <P>I agree with the substance of the Deputy's remarks.  The Government take a very serious view of all incursions by British Army personnel into this State and, when such an incident occurs, the Government do not lose any time in getting in touch with the British authorities and raising the matter with them. The Government have been in touch with them regarding the incident mentioned by the Deputy.  The explanation given by the British authorities was that the incursion was accidental and they have apologised.  While the acknowledgement of the mistake and the apology for it are welcome, incidents of this nature continue to be a cause of concern in the Border areas.  I know this very well because I represent the Border areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 21, 56 and 69 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present structure of pay and allowances for the Permanent Defence Forces <Col N="1722" /> was determined in accordance with the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission who undertook an intensive and completely independent assessment of pay and conditions of service in the Defence Forces.  In addition to basic pay, all military personnel up to and including the rank of colonel are paid military service allowance as follows: Officers up to and including the rank of colonel: £1,764 a year; privates with at least three years' service and all non-commissioned officers: £33.80 a week and privates with fewer than three years' service: £12.17 a week.  Military personnel serving in Border units are also paid Border duty allowance at the following rates: NCOs and privates: £37.87 a week and officers: £43.28 a week.  The allowances paid, in addition to basic pay, are designed to compensate personnel for certain liabilities associated with military service, such as long hours of duty due to particular operational requirements.  For reasons of security it is not the practice to disclose details regarding duties, including hours of duty, of personnel in Border units.</P>
    <P>The estimated average remuneration of personnel in Border units is as follows: private, £300 a week; corporal, £320 a week; sergeant, £350 a week; company sergeant, £380 a week; lieutenant, £18,970 a year; captain, £21,750 a year; and commandant, £26,800 a year.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson Commission's recommendations were based on comparison of military pay rates with rates in a wide range of other public and private sector employments, on the basis of duties, responsibilities, working conditions, etc. The commission noted that, while members of the Defence Force in exercise of their role of providing aid to the civil power, have regular contact with the Garda and co-operate with them on various tasks, the vast majority of personnel in the two forces have duties which are quite dissimilar.  The commission stated in their report that they did not consider that military pay should be fixed exclusively, or even primarily, by reference to the pay rates of gardaí.</P>
    <Col N="1723" />
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now almost eight weeks since a PDFORRA conference in Galway were promised that the matter of Border duty would be examined by him and the problems rectified very quickly.  What has been done to date about this matter?  Does the Minister not believe that there is a particular urgency to address this issue given that there is a huge inequity in relation to the duty allowances being paid to Army personnel on Border duty as against those paid to Army personnel on prison duty?  Has the study been completed and has a comparison been made between the two duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole ground plan for the payment of the PDF and FCA is the Gleeson report.  That was welcomed by the representatives of the Army associations and I would be reluctant to depart from it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the heavy hours of duty, the Army authorities assure me that in order to relieve that situation they have, on occasion, recruited people from other parts of the country on a voluntary basis to do service in the Border areas.  My own view on the matter is that we need more personnel up there.  As I have a special local interest in it, I am trying to work along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my visit to the Border area, I fully agree with the Minister that there is a need for more military personnel.  In addition, there is also a need to improve accommodation at Castleblayney barracks.  On the issue of Border duty there are huge discrepancies that need to be addressed. There is a high level of dissatisfaction not alone among Army personnel but among their spouses and families because of the very unsocial hours under which they operate.  Has this matter been addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of pay for Army personnel on the Border is quite commendable. A private soldier earns more than the average industrial wage.  In the nature of the job, there are unsocial hours.  The fact is that most of the people <Col N="1724" /> who are operating along the Border have been there for a long time and they know exactly what the situation is.  It is an indication of the satisfactory, if not ideal, conditions of the Army personnel that very few people are leaving the Army at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astounded by the ingenuity of the Minister for Defence in seeming to rule out the fact that there are already 300,000 people on the unemployment register as having a bearing on the fact that people are not leaving the Defence Forces.  While I agree fully with the Minister that the Gleeson Commission report is clearly the best vehicle for dealing with matters of pay, does he not have any role himself in making submissions to that body of departmental or ministerial views on pay and conditions? Would the Minister not accept that it is a cause for concern and that those soldiers, particularly those at the Border, work far above and beyond the average industrial worker and therefore deserve a fair return for the work done? Would the Minister agree at least to examine this matter and consult with the representative associations and let his views on the matter be known?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has a sense of humour.  This is the first time I saw him laughing in the House.  The fact is that soldiering is a profession and I do not think it is entirely relevant to refer to the numbers of people unemployed. My substantive input into this whole area is that I am working strenuously to provide a conciliation and arbitration service both for the NCOs and men represented by the PDFORRA and for the commissioned officers up to a certain rank represented by RACO.</P>

      <P>Ninety four amendments have been put down to the Committee Stage of the Housing Bill.  We are being asked to rush these amendments through the House before 10.30 p.m.  This is one of a number of Bills to which the Government <Col N="1834" /> have applied a guillotine since Christmas.  It is totally unsatisfactory that a matter of such importance should be dealt with in this way.  I am not saying that the Bill is necessarily contentious, but we should not pass legislation which has not been adequately debated and all amendments considered in full.  The Taoiseach is not doing this House any service by trying to push this Bill through in this short amount of time.  We object to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Barry.  This Bill was promised when the Plan for Social Housing was published in February 1991.  We have had to wait until recent weeks to see this Bill.  In view of the fact that 30,000 people are waiting for public housing it is outrageous to attempt to push this Bill through the House before 10.30 p.m.  We object to this proposal.</P>

      <P>In line with the other speakers, I think it is extraordinary that an attempt is being made to deal with more than 90 amendments in approximately five hours.  It is also proposed that the Report Stage, which will be taken in a day or two, will be dealt with in two hours.  This is a grossly inadequate way of dealing with legislation.  We have a serious housing crisis at present and rushing legislation through the House is not the way to deal with it: it is a question of dealing with the legislation properly and adequately and having a proper debate on the issues concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach if he will consider asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to brief the House on the present state of talks taking place in London involving the parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government and any subsequent developments?  It need not necessarily be today but some time between now and the recess.  I think it appropriate that we have a briefing from the Minister in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important.  I do not want to enter into an argument with you but I consider it appropriate that the Taoiseach respond to the request I have made for a briefing in this House, before the recess, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the talks in London and on the other talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry and I appreciate how important these historic discussions are but, until the House may decide otherwise, the Chair must continue to interpret what is in order and what has been repeated <i>ad nauseam,</i> and matters of his kind are not regarded as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

      <P>We have a position here&mdash;and I say this with all deference to the position of the Taoiseach&mdash;the Taoiseach is not permitted to change the Order of Business or to change Standing Orders.  No one is entitled to do that until what already exists is changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Orders do not dictate that the Taoiseach cannot respond to a request for a debate in this House.  It is for the Taoiseach to respond or not to respond.  I ask the Taoiseach, in what is, I hope, a courteous manner, to request a briefing from the Minister <Col N="1839" /> for Foreign Affairs some time between now and the recess on the talks that are taking place in relation to Northern Ireland.  I do not think that is an unreasonable request or that I am putting it in an aggressive manner.</P>

However, the Chair is indicating that requests of this kind, irrespective of the subject matter or its importance, are not traditionally regarded as appropriate.  I must comply with the tradition of the House until such time as it may be changed by the House.</P>

When ordering business for the remainder of this session, it ought to be in order for this House to have an opportunity at least of being informed of the ongoing developments in relation to Northern Ireland consequent on the Hillsborough Agreement.  It would be very valuable to Members to have such a briefing.  On another matter, may I ask the Taoiseach whether, in view of the trenchant remarks made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday, he considers he has the confidence of every member of his Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `established purchase scheme' means a scheme under section 26 of this Act for the sale of houses by a housing authority which is ongoing and under which a purchaser may, at any time, make application for the purchase of a house;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the course of the Second Stage debate I made the point that there was a very strong case for having a permanent tenant purchase scheme in place so that as the tenant's circumstances changed he or she could apply to purchase the house in which he or she is living.  In these amendments I seek to put in place an ongoing tenant purchase scheme so that a tenant could apply to the local authority at any time to purchase the house in which he or she is living.</P>
      <P>All the statements made by the Minister for the Environment and his predecessors have put a strong emphasis on the desirability of people purchasing their own homes.  That is something with which I concur.  In the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> there is a number of measures designed to attract tenants, and indeed tenant-purchasers, to surrender the houses in which they are living and instead to purchase houses in the private sector.  I have reservations about that.  The £5,000 surrender grant had a very bad effect on many local communities because in practice people who would otherwise have been quite happy to purchase the house in which they were living were forced to surrender their homes, because there was no tenant purchase scheme in operation at the time, and to purchase a house in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closing date for applications under the last tenant purchase scheme, where tenants had the opportunity to purchase their own homes on very attractive terms, was 31 December 1988.  Many people missed the closing date for very valid reasons.  For example, I know of cases where there were bereavements in the <Col N="1851" /> family, problems with literacy &mdash; when the applicant did not understand the documentation sent to him &mdash; or when misunderstandings and mistakes were made.  If the application was not submitted by 31 December 1988, the application was not subsequently considered. The Department of the Environment instructed local authorities to take a very rigid position and not to permit anybody who had not met the deadline to purchase his or her own home.  Therefore, a new tenant purchase scheme would be very attractive to the following categories: first, those who had considered purchasing their own home under the tenant purchase scheme but had failed to submit their application before 31 December 1988; second; and a more numerous group, people who since 31 December 1988 have now decided they would like to purchase the home in which they live &mdash; in some cases these people were allocated a local authority house subsequent to the end of December 1988; third, those whose circumstances have changed, perhaps their income has increased and they now feel they are in a position to purchase their own home. Indeed in many cases tenants now find that their rents are considerably in excess of what they would be paying if they were purchasing their homes and certainly if they were purchasing their homes under the terms of the 1988 purchase scheme. These people would now like to buy the home in which they live.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked about the scheme on a number of occasions in the House but his reply has been to the effect that all outstanding applications from the 1988 scheme will have to be processed before a new scheme is introduced.  In response to that let me say that many of the applications that have not yet been processed relate to applications where the local authority have put them to one side because of the families' income or circumstances and the fact that they are not in a position to proceed with the purchase of their home or in cases where the applicants themselves have decided not to pursue their application at this <Col N="1852" /> point in time.  In any event it is unfair to those who want to purchase their home to be prevented from doing so by a backlog, however large.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked on a number of occasions to introduce a new tenant purchase scheme and I regret very much that he has not done so up to now as this very much undermines the policy statements made by him and his predecessors emphasising the desirability of purchasing one's own home.  Tenants who wish to purchase the house in which they are living are prevented from doing so because there is no scheme at present which allows them to do so.  We must do something to get over the difficulty tenants may have in purchasing their house between the closing date of one scheme and the announcement of a new one.</P>
    <P>A permanent tenant purchase scheme should be built into this Bill.  I envisage simple arrangements whereby if at any time tenants, because of a change in financial circumstances, family circumstances or whatever, want to purchase their home, they would be able to go to their local authority and apply to do so.  There should be in place a mechanism that would determine and agree the sale price.  The current arrangement that stipulates an arbitrary cut-off date, with tenants falling either inside the scheme or outside its provisions, has to be abolished.  If tenants found that because their rental payments have gone up they would be better off financially to purchase or if they were able to purchase because their income level had increased, they should be able to apply to the local authority and purchase their home in the normal way.  Such a mechanism if put in place would also avoid the administrative clog-ups that occur after a scheme has been announced and a large number of people want to purchase all at once. Delays occur because it takes quite a while for a large number of applications to be processed.  These two amendments seek a permanent, established tenant purchase scheme under which tenants may at any time go to their housing authority and apply to purchase their home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of merit in the arguments put forward by Deputy Gilmore.  I wish to add some additional arguments.</P>
      <P>As I understand the position, the scheme was designed to encourage many tenants to purchase their own homes. However, by virtue of one provision of that scheme &mdash; namely that anyone who had applied to purchase would no longer qualify to have repair work done to his or her home &mdash; local authorities were able to shed responsibility for the repairs needed to be carried out on houses immediately on receipt of an application to purchase.  I consider that provision to be hardly constitutional.  People were told that once they had applied under the 1988 scheme they could not have repair work done to their homes, but at the same time many of those applicants were left waiting as long as four years &mdash; some of them are waiting still &mdash; for the completion of their tenant purchase application. In the meantime they paid rent which was not offset against the purchase price.  It is my personal belief that if that issue were challenged in the courts the Government would have to repay a lot of money to many tenant purchasers.  I do not understand the reason for that provision, but I do understand the reason for setting the deadline of 31 December in 1988.  The announcement of the scheme led to a very considerable number of applications and it has taken several years to deal with the resultant backlog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister ever considered that local authorities themselves have a vested interest in drawing out the sale of houses in such circumstances, that local authorities have got out from under their repair obligations in relation to a particular house but have not assigned the house to the prospective purchaser?  It is not satisfactory that in certain circumstances a local authority can have a vested interest in dragging out the completion of a sale.  A delay in the completion means that the local authority get more revenue.  If a person were buying a house over 20 years, with the sale period starting in 1988, he or she would finish <Col N="1854" /> buying the house in the year 2008; but if the sale period did not start until 1993 the local authority would have additional revenue for up to five years.  That is what is happening and is not satisfactory; it is a bad side effect of the 1988 scheme and the way in which it was proposed. An analogy in the construction industry would be of a spurt and then a collapse in housing construction.  The creation of a glut in demand results in an inevitable administrative choking.  There is a great deal to be said for an ongoing tenant purchase scheme under which people could make application when they were in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>In addition to the kind of cases cited by Deputy Gilmore, there have been many cases of which I am aware in which the Dublin local authority, Dublin Corpoation, have denied receipt of an application while tenants state with confidence that an application had been sent in. Although problems with mail may be unavoidable in any place that receives a large volume of mail every day, anyone who deals with Dublin Corporation knows that it is not infrequent for their mail to go astray.  In the past four years I have had experience of perhaps as many as 20 or 25 cases of tenants who, after not hearing from the corporation for perhaps a year, went to the sales section to be told, without any other recourse, that their application had not been received. Those tenants firmly argue that their applications were posted in at the time. Because of another anomaly that has arisen people have been left ineligible under the 1988 scheme.</P>
    <P>One also has to recognise that there are tenants who may have been unemployed at the time the scheme was announced and are now in employment, people who were not confident to apply within the prescribed time because they were not sure about the future.  There are also families who were going through stress at the time of the scheme, perhaps because of a marital breakdown of either a temporary or a permanent nature, which has subsequently been resolved or developed into a situation in which the family could now make an application in <Col N="1855" /> the confidence that they will be able to meet repayments.  Because of the deadline many people were and are excluded from eligibility to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Several underlying aspects make a tenant purchase scheme attractive.  The fact that so many people in this country own their houses or have the potential to own their own houses is a great social stabiliser and offsets many of the strains that derive from poverty, and especially unemployment.  From the State's point of view there is the additional benefit that the Government will not incur the very high administrative and maintenance costs associated with tenancy dwellings. That is an area of public expenditure that is a great scandal.  The way in which we spend so much money on housing maintenance is one of the great unexplained mysteries.  In fact, in Dublin city and county the money spent on maintenance is greater than the income received from rents.  Only last week the Minister told the House that the subsidy per dwelling for the most recent year for which figures are available was a scandalous £85 a week.</P>
    <P>I have raised this issue many times in my capacity as a member of Dublin Corporation.  The figures are greatly debated and are disputed by some, but not all, corporation officials.  While it may be that every dwelling is being subsidised at £85 a week on average &mdash; and one must remember that some of the dwellings in question are only one roomed &mdash; bedsitters &mdash; while others are dwellings of one, two, three or four bedrooms &mdash; no tenant is enjoying the advantage of a subsidy of £85 a week.  Where is it going?  It would nearly be better to say to tenants that we will give them their house for a nominal sum, please to take it, and look after their own repairs.  I know it is not quite so easy because there are residual costs for which money has been borrowed and which will have to be serviced into the future.  However, one of the advantages of the sale scheme is that there is less and less call on the local authorities, and therefore on the State, to foot the bill for repairs.  That is another <Col N="1856" /> reason Deputy Gilmore's amendments are worthy and should commend themselves to the Minister for acceptance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hoped the Minister would take the opportunity of these two amendments in the name of Deputy Gilmore to tell us his attitude towards introducing a tenant purchase scheme.  From what he has said up to now and in reply to questions from this side of the House asking him when he is going to bring in a tenant purchase scheme, he gave me the impression that he is not very keen on purchase schemes as such.  Perhaps that is one reason he has not shown willingness to bring in a tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Even Deputy Gilmore would not say that to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will have something to say about all housing schemes that have been brought in over the years from 1966 and the idea that this last one has to be better than the previous one which had to be better than the previous Coalition's housing scheme.  We had the sale of the century and so on.  We were approaching the position where the Minister should hand the house over to the person with whatever legal expenses the transfer would entail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last housing scheme created an anomaly.  To buy their houses young people had to get mortgages through building societies or wherever they could. In many cases they were sons and daughters of people who had availed of a purchase scheme and found themselves paying through the nose, having to get the site, planning permission and so on. Then they found their repayments were huge and put them to the pin of their collar, whereas somebody else got the benefit of a purchase scheme for buttons and a good, solid house.  It left some people wondering whether they should apply for a local authority house because in a year or two there would be a tenant purchase scheme under which they might get the house for half its cost and could then perhaps dispose of it and trade off in the future.  Housing schemes <Col N="1857" /> raise problems that have to be considered and that is one of them.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Gilmore is concerned mainly about people who, on the occasion of a tenant purchase scheme, could not afford to buy even at the cost of the house at that time.  Perhaps they were living in the low cost houses built some years ago and did not think they were very good value to buy.  In the last few years weekly rent differential soared because the rent is tied to social welfare increases and various wage increases.  People in an area like mine, with a very high level of charges for all services to local authority tenants on a weekly basis, find their rent outgoings far higher than they would be if they had saved a few pounds to get a mortgage to buy the house under a tenant purchase scheme.  Now there is no tenant purchase scheme that will relieve them of their heavy outgoings in rent. They missed the boat in the sense that at the time they could not afford to buy or did not think they would be getting a very good bargain.  Under the 1966 scheme it was sufficient to say you wanted to purchase the house; you got a little docket indicating that you had applied; the council had to carry out various repairs before the tenant was committed to purchase and then the tenant had to wait for years because certain local authorities did not repair the houses, mend a cracked chimney or put in windows or floors that were necessary before the purchase could proceed.</P>
    <P>All these anomalies in housing schemes deserve consideration.  If the Minister announced he was going to bring in a purchase scheme in the next month or two perhaps these amendments would not be necessary.  People who availed of the scheme prior to that of 1988 came to some of us and asked why we did not tell them to wait for the next one because that was by far the better scheme.  Is the Minister going to bring in something on the same lines, something different, or is he going to bring in a scheme at all?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the sentiments expressed by Deputies Gilmore, <Col N="1858" /> J. Mitchell and Kavanagh, to the effect that the amendments have a great deal to commend them.  A lady who lives in Tallaght called to see me two weeks ago.  Her rent is slightly over £40 a week and her house is pretty new.  I did not go into the details of how that rent was assessed.  It is not normal in some of the older houses to have rents as high as that.  Given her tenancy over the years it is clear that she would be buying the house under any reasonable sales scheme for considerably less than that, bearing in mind that the interest on such purchase would be allowable against income tax, which rent is not.</P>
      <P>A number of people, some very elderly, did not feel in the millenium year, the last year we had a housing purchase scheme, that they were in a position to make an application to buy their houses. Their circumstances have changed since then and now they feel, with the help of a son or daughter who perhaps, had emigrated and has now returned home, they can afford to purchase but they cannot apply to do so because there is no scheme.  An elderly lady who died recently lived at Rathdrum Road in my constituency.  I will give the address if the Minister wants to look into it.  She had a very long tenancy, something like 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions I raised with the corporation, and here in the House with the Minister by way of Adjournment debates and at other times, the question of sales schemes to allow people like her to apply to purchase.  During the millenium year this lady could not do so because she had nobody residing with her and she could not afford the extra rent. She was an old age pensioner living alone.  By extra rent, of course she meant extra repayments.  She died a few weeks ago and her daughter who has returned from Italy now cannot succeed to the tenancy because she has not had two years' continuous residence with her mother and was not there for ten of the last 15 years, nor can she apply to purchase. The mother's 40 years' tenancy counts for nothing and the corporation have repossessed the house and told the <Col N="1859" /> daughter she cannot have it.  There are many people in such circumstances, old people who &mdash; not to be heartless about it &mdash; are waiting to pass on.  They are frail, some in their eighties or maybe older, and as the biggest investment of their lifetime they want to purchase their rented house which has been their family home for all their married life but cannot do so because they could not apply during the millenium year.  Some were in a position to do so but their better judgment told them not to take on the commitment.  Old people can be very cautious and never get a second opportunity.</P>
    <P>Since 1979, when I was first elected to this House, I do not recall such a long period being allowed to pass without the announcement of a tenant housing sales scheme.  I have raised the matter here with the Minister.  All sides of the House support this.  I ask the Minister to announce a housing purchase scheme.  I know the argument in the Department is that their housing stock will be depleted and so on.  In any event, most houses pass on to a loved one or a family member living with the deceased tenant so very few of those houses come back to the local authority.</P>
    <P>The sales scheme will have a negligible effect on the number of houses available for reletting.  However, it has the effect of creating stability in a housing estate by allowing people to move into a bigger home.  Many houses built years ago had only two bedrooms and some of them did not have a bathroom.  People living in them now have stable jobs and can afford something better.  If they owned the house they could sell it and use the money as a deposit on a bigger house and people who are in the market for a smaller house at a reasonable price would purchase it and come off the housing list.  The Department's view in this regard is too narrow and I ask the Minister to re-examine it as it is causing hardship.  This is exemplified by a case in my constituency of a lady who has lived 40 years in the same house.  Justice demands that her <Col N="1860" /> application should at least be put on file. She should be told that she will be included in the scheme and that her family would have the right to succeed to the tenancy and be allowed to purchase it. However, that house has gone back to Dublin Corporation after 40 years of tenancy because that lady could not apply. There are others in the same category and I urge the Minister to take account of the strong feelings of Members in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh seemed to doubt my general position in regard to tenant house purchase schemes.  However, I agree that such schemes are fundamentally good and that, as Deputy Mitchell said, they lead to stability.  All the evidence up to now in the Department of the Environment has demonstrated that that has been the solid course which successive Governments have sought to follow.  Approximately 200,000 houses which were originally occupied by local authority tenants are now owner-occupied as a result of a variety of purchase schemes over the years. It is a very clear indication of the principle enshrined in the attitude of successive Governments to house purchase and of the response from tenants themselves in wanting to own their own houses.  There are approximately 96,000 local authority houses which do not come under any of those schemes.  Under the most recent scheme in 1988 there were 40,000 applications and about 30,000 have completed all the relevant legal matters consequent on their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also fair to point out that there was a sale of the century scheme which was intensely advertised up to 31 December 1988 and the response was fantastic throughout the country.  It would not be fair to imply that people did not have a reasonable opportunity to avail themselves of the scheme, because it was discussed by public representatives, local authorities and tenants' associations and the response was enormous over a couple of years.  We should not decry the efforts of the Department of the Environment <Col N="1861" /> in the first instance or the response from the housing executives, county councils, legal sections and so on who came together to make the scheme an undoubted success.</P>
    <P>This section amends section 90 of the Housing Act.  It streamlines local authority procedures for disposing of houses; it increases the options of housing authorities for disposals and provides especially for the sale of flats.  The outstanding applications under house purchase schemes are largely dependent on the necessary provisions in the Bill being put on the Statute Book to enable the remainder of them to go through.  The Bill also amends the conditions under which dwellings are sold.  Therefore, there is no real, fundamental disagreement between us on the principle of making sure that we have the best possible tenant purchase schemes available. All the evidence up to now sustains that belief.</P>
    <P>However, these amendments oblige the Minister to introduce a purchase scheme which should be permanently available.  I do not favour writing mandatory requirements of this kind into the primary legislation.  It has always been the accepted practice that primary enabling legislation would leave it to the Government of the day to decide whether and on what terms a purchase scheme should be introduced, having regard to all the relevant circumstances at that time. This has worked well overall and I do not think that a radical departure from this legislative approach, which would be required by these amendments, would be desirable.  The section as currently drafted would permit the making of a permanent purchase scheme &mdash; for example, a scheme without a time limit on applications to purchase &mdash; if that was what the Minister and the Government of the day decided.  While one can see merit in such an approach I would not like to rule out completely the option of having a time limited scheme, particularly for certain categories of dwellings. In short, the amendments run counter to the flexibility which is the hallmark of the section and I do not consider they would <Col N="1862" /> make good legislation.  As I said, there is not strong disagreement between us.  I indicated to the House on a number of occasions my special interest in house purchase schemes.  The present effort of the housing authorities was to be geared to try to take on board a variety of new schemes in the social housing plan.  I want as far as possible to concentrate the abilities of local authorities on getting the maximum response to this change and the implementation of these schemes, bearing in mind that in particular the shared housing scheme requires a lot of concentrated attention and contact between individual applicants and housing authorities to make a success of it. The picture in many of the authorities where the shared housing scheme is developing apace shows that this concentrated effort is required.  As soon as those schemes are up and running I will give very careful consideration to the introduction of a new house purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>Salient and important points have been made in relation to whether the house purchase scheme should continue. Obviously, we may differ in regard to certain areas; but when considering the introduction in due course of a new purchase scheme I will give an undertaking to take account of the various opinions advanced in the House on the question of whether the scheme will be open-ended.  I have already said that I would not like to enshrine this matter in primary legislation, although primary legislation gives the flexibility to do so.  If it is considered on that basis it is far better to have that flexibility and, in terms of whatever new scheme is available, to take into account as far as possible the points which have been made here.  In that way Deputies will have the best of all worlds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past I have always given an unqualified welcome to house purchase schemes.  Unfortunately, I can only give a qualified welcome to any further house purchase schemes.  The Minister rightly indicated that this Bill also provides for the sale of flats.  Dublin Corporation can now sell their flats stock to <Col N="1863" /> their tenants who are very anxious to purchase them.  The reason I can only give a qualified welcome is this.  The local authorities at present are selling off their housing stock, both houses and flats, which at any given time is limited.  If they do not add to the housing stock through the purchase of new houses, the sale of houses and flats will only result &mdash; this has been shown to be the case in Dublin already &mdash; in those on the housing and transfer lists being imprisoned for a lifetime because there will be no alternative accommodation on offer.  The Minister must bear this in mind when he comes to introduce new tenant purchase schemes. He must try to ensure that an equal number of houses and flats is both sold and built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the points raised by Deputy Doyle I should say that I neglected to deal with a point raised by Deputy Jim Mitchell.  He mentioned that a subsidy of £85 per week is payable in respect of each local authority house.  The impression might be given that this figure is based only on the cost of maintenance because, at that stage, we were referring to the maintenance of houses.  I should make the point however that it also covers the capital cost, what it would cost to build a house at current prices.  I take the Deputy's point in relation to maintenance in that problems are being experienced with regard to the cost of maintenance, its effectiveness and the question of whether the taxpayers are getting a good return on their investment. All these matters are under consideration and have no effect on the amendments we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to disagree with Deputy Doyle. It should be remembered in relation to the sale of houses that first and foremost those who have a legitimate right to own their own houses are being given that right.  Second, once they take over ownership they will be required to maintain the house, with the result that resources will be released to the local authority for other housing purposes. Third, the sale of houses in the past produced <Col N="1864" /> an annual annuity to the local authorities which they used to purchase or build new accommodation.  This means in effect that they do not have to resort directly to the taxpayer for resources for that purpose.  One could make the point that if all of the 96,000 houses which are at present occupied by tenants under the differential rents schemes were to be taken off the books of the local authorities, in a short space of time some of the problems to which the Deputy referred would most definitely emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is happening at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that this will happen, however, bearing in mind the circumstances of different categories. One way or another the majority of Deputies in this House, myself included, are of the opinion that in the long run it would be better if people were in a position to purchase and to own outright the houses in which they are living.  That is the way we intend to proceed in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's response on these amendments.  He has made a theoretical case in support of the idea of tenant purchase schemes and is correct when he states that the vast majority of the Members of this House support that concept.  Over 80 per cent of houses in this country are either occupied by owner occupiers or by those who are in the process of purchasing their house, be it privately or from a local authority.  All the evidence suggests that when tenant purchase schemes are offered they receive a favourable response from tenants. Anybody who is in a position to buy attempts to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, support that principle.  If somebody is in a position to purchase their home they should be enabled to do so. Unfortunately, what we are getting from the Minister is a policy under which local authority tenants are able to buy any house except the one in which they are living.  He is saying to them that, if they <Col N="1865" /> wish to do so, under the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> they can buy a house in the private sector under the shared ownership scheme.  He is saying to them also that they can avail of the mortgage subsidy scheme, which involves a payment of £3,300, buy a house in the private sector and surrender their own house; but unless they made an application under one of the previous schemes they cannot buy the house in which they are living.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument the Minister has made that the reason for this is that there is a backlog of applications in the local authorities.  If the Minister is concerned about the workload in the housing departments of local authorities he could make the same argument in relation to each of the schemes mentioned in the <i>Plan for Social Housing.</i> Now that he has reminded us of it, I might as well make that case anyway because it is very much the case that the implementation of the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> will depend on the housing departments of the local authorities having the staff and resources to implement it.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense for the Minister, on the one hand, to say to the housing departments of local authorities that they will have to function, effectvely, as auctioneers and estate agents to operate the shared ownership scheme and, on the other, to say to them that they cannot accept new applications from their tenants to purchase the houses in which they are living.  I have to ask the question: why is this the case?  Is the Minister contemplating introducing a tenant purchase scheme that would be radically different from the tenant purchase scheme which existed in 1988 and is he concerned that tenants would make an unfavourable comparison between any new scheme introduced and that already in place?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh is correct when he states that there are many anomalies in the system in relation to those who are renting and purchasing their houses. There are also anomalies in relation to those who are purchasing their houses <Col N="1866" /> under different tenant purchase schemes. I know of cases, for example, where, side by side with each other, tenant purchasers are paying £50 per week under a previous tenant purchase scheme while their neighbours next door are paying £25 per week to purchase their house under the 1988 scheme and side by side with this again there are tenants who are paying up to £40 per week in rent.  It is clear therefore that there are anomalies.</P>
    <P>The arguments that the Minister makes against the amendments I have tabled are not convincing.  He makes the point that section 90 of the Principal Act, as amended, will enable him to introduce a new tenant purchase scheme which might or might not be implemented on an ongoing basis.  He also makes the point that it would not be appropriate to incorporate it in the primary legislation.  In drafting the amendments I have put forward I did not set down the conditions under which a sales scheme might be operated; I simply wanted to establish the principle that there would be an ongoing tenant purchase scheme.  I believe that such a principle should be set down in the primary legislation while the various conditions under which it might be applied, including the price at which houses would be sold and the people to whom they would be sold, could be the subject matter of regulations.  However, I would have to argue that those types of areas should be subject to some debate or scrutiny by this House or by a committee of the House.</P>
    <P>My amendment is confined solely to the principle of having a permanent tenant purchase scheme.  When replying the Minister did not respond to the invitation offered him by Deputy Kavanagh to indicate when or whether he intends introducing a new tenant purchase scheme.  He appeared to say that at some stage a new tenant purchase scheme would be introduced.  He did not say when it would be introduced; neither did he say there was no time scale involved. The people who approach me about a tenant purchase scheme and who, as previous speakers have said, now pay £39 or £40 per week to purchase a house they <Col N="1867" /> could buy for £25 per week, want to know when they can buy.  They are not interested in some future promise on the part of the Minister.  They want to know whether they can go to their local authority and apply to purchase their houses.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister made a statement in relation to that matter.  Had the Minister given the House a clear indication that he would introduce a new tenant purchase scheme and when it would become operational &mdash; I would have hoped that he would have indicated the terms of such a scheme, but even if he had not gone that far but said that on a specific date he would introduce a new tenant purchase scheme &mdash; I would not have been disposed to press this amendment. But he has not given the House any such indication.  He spoke in general terms about the desirability of the principle of tenant purchase schemes.  He spoke about its theory, which is all very fine, but has not committed himself. In the absence of any such comment, given that there are many people out there who either missed participating in the last scheme, who have now reconsidered their position or whose circumstances have changed and who, for whatever reason, want to purchase a house in which they live, certainly I will be pressing this amendment.  We now have a Housing Bill the provisions of which have all to do with encouraging people to purchase houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is backed up by a large policy document.  The Government state they want people to go into the private sector and purchase houses, they want local authorities to go out into the private sector and purchase houses and that they are giving people mortgage subsidies to allow them purchase houses.  People can purchase half a house under the shared ownership scheme.  One can buy any type of house except the one in which one lives.  That makes no sense at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has not made a clear statement on <Col N="1868" /> that today.  I hope, as the debate proceeds, that the Minister will consider his position but, if he does not, certainly I will be pressing my amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I might deal with a few points before coming to the generality of what I want to say to Deputy Gilmore. He referred to some areas I mentioned which the provisions of this Bill loosen up in terms of options available to tenants of local authority houses to do a variety of things.  I am quite sure the Deputy accepts that that broad range of choice is a very good thing.  He also indicated that I had made the point that one of the reasons a new tenant purchase scheme was not being introduced at this time was because there was a backlog.  I made no such point.  I said there were 30,000 applicants, whose applications have now been approved.  That was the phenomenal success of the 1988 tenant purchase scheme.  I said there were applicants remaining who primarily were accommodated in flats and who required the passage of this Bill to enable their proceedings be developed.  In no way should that be interpreted as advancing a reason for the non-introduction of a tenant purchase scheme.  It was not advanced as a reason and I am not doing so now.  I said I wanted to release local authority resources as much as possible to deal with and put this social housing plan in place.</P>
      <P>Members should bear in mind that there is a huge difference, nationwide, in the application of the provisions of the social housing plan.  There are areas in which its provisions work like a dream but there are others where they do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I wanted to concentrate these resources on the fullest possible implementation of these provisions. I said that as soon as that was out of the way I would consider the introduction of a new housing scheme.  I said I would take on board points made here, which are possible of implementation within the present legislative provisions, <Col N="1869" /> that is the option of whether the scheme would be a continuing one.  I did not want to take from the right of a future Government or Minister for the Environment, or bind them, in all circumstances, no matter what the conditions, to having to continue a tenant purchase scheme.  I will endeavour to bear in mind to a certain extent the point made by Deputy Doyle.  He has a different view about it.  My primary responsibility is to endeavour to put in place the best possible legislation and not bind a future Government or Minister to something which might not necessarily be the best order of the day for that time, depending on the prevailing circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am able, within the provisions of this Bill, to have a scheme which would continue or, alternatively, one which might have a time limit in respect of certain dwellings.  I have not been convinced by the arguments advanced that I should insert in primary legislation an obligation, for all time, on future Ministers to have a continuous scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Much ground has been covered on this issue in relation to these amendments.  Obviously the Minister feels he has a good reason, but it has escaped me, for his reluctance to introduce another tenant purchase scheme since there appears to be so much pressure on the part of so many Members for such a scheme.  Is the reason for such reluctance an administrative one or has it to do with the belief that, if such schemes are introduced frequently, they might affect their ongoing success?  In any future tenant purchase scheme would the Minister consider inserting a proviso that would allow local authorities enter into tenant purchase arrangements with new tenants from the commencement of their tenancy, if they so wish, so that people would take up occupation of houses as tenant-purchasers rather than tenants from the beginning?</P>

      <P>To answer the second question first, certainly that is my very strong view, that we could move to the point <Col N="1870" /> at which from the very time approved applicants would take up occupation of a house they could have that option.  There are many sound reasons that should be the case.</P>
      <P>I am not reluctant to introduce a new tenant purchase scheme.  I have given the House a very clear indication of where my mind rests in relation to when I would propose to do so but I am unable to give a date.  People who have served in Government before, like Deputy Jim Mitchell, will understand that it is not a matter solely for the Minister for the Environment; it will have to be a Government decision.  Various aspects have to be considered and this will be done in due course.  There is no point in getting into a knot here, in primary legislation, about the date on which such a scheme might be introduced or the different aspects that might have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest two reasons it appears to me we do not have a tenant purchase scheme and why the Minister is delaying the introduction of one?  The first is that those people most likely to apply to purchase their homes now pay high rents under the differential rents scheme.  This means many local authorities now collect more in rent from those tenants than they would from repayments under a tenant purchase scheme.  Therefore, I suggest the first reason is a financial one.  The second reason is that the Minister has a very embarrassing problem on his plate, which is a housing waiting list approaching 30,000 applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that what is happening here is that the Minister is using the plan for social housing to attract a number of tenants out of the public housing system who would otherwise purchase their houses.  They cannot purchase the house in which they live; therefore, they will apply for the £3,300 grant, for the shared ownership scheme or whatever, and surrender the house.  In that way, the Minister gets extra houses he can then allocate.  He is depriving tenants of the right to purchase their homes, forcing them to purchase elsewhere if they want <Col N="1871" /> to do so.  What this comes down to is that these amendments would not be on this Order Paper at all today if we had a tenant purchase scheme.  I would withdraw these amendments if the Minister gave a commitment and a date for a tenant purchase scheme.  In the absence of that, I wish to have the amendments put.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the last speaker.  It is the lack of ability to buy their houses that forces tenants to go elsewhere even though their income might not necessarily justify such a move.  This has the effect of providing extra housing stock for the Department on the cheap, with no regard for the welfare of people who are forced to move.</P>
      <P>Would it not be a good time for the Minister to set out a framework for a new tenant purchase scheme which could be updated as the need arose, as was the case up to about 1977?  The lack of such a scheme results in great inconsistency and is unfair to people who are not, so to speak, in the right place at the right time.  Some people have repayments of perhaps £50 or £60 a week while others, because they happened to be in the right place at the right time, have qualified under a scheme that is very beneficial to them.  That is totally unfair.  It may be of benefit to the Government to capitalise on housing but it is of no benefit to the people themselves.  All it does is create a feeling of victimisation among people.</P>

      <P>I am puzzled by the Minister's reluctance to introduce a new tenant purchase scheme or accept the idea of an ongoing scheme.  Could this have anything to do with the possible privatisation of existing tenant purchase mortgages or future tenant purchase mortgages?  Would that be a factor in any future scheme?</P>

      <P>No matter how often I say it, it does not seem to sink in.  The scheme is not being delayed.  There is no hidden agenda.  Nothing about the provisions of <Col N="1872" /> the social housing plan is deterring me from coming forward with a tenant house purchase scheme.  I said I would give due consideration to that and I can say no more about it.  Deputy Gilmore has, from time to time, made rather wild statements and has suggested that delaying this scheme results in a gain for the local authority.  The fact is that rental income from local authority houses is about £46 million; the cost of repairs to houses is approaching £70 million and this is balanced by a percentage of the receipts from the sales of houses through an annuity purchase. These schemes are not capitalised.  Allegations that house purchase schemes are being delayed because local authorities are gaining simply do not stand up.</P>

I have gone as far as I can to meet Deputies' wishes on these amendments.  I will take on board the possibility of a continuing scheme in the context of my examination of a new tenant house purchase scheme.  There is that flexibility in this Bill but I will not tie all future Governments in primary legislation to the obligation to have a permanent scheme from day one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to react to the statement, which is obviously correct, that £70 million was paid out in repairs while there was only £46 million in rent. The Minister cannot have it both ways. The Minister believes that a tenant purchase scheme would alleviate that position but allows that haemorrhage of public moneys on repairs to continue. Would he not agree that far more tenant purchase schemes would get rid of this costly housing stock needing all these repairs?</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister should look at the method of repairs by local authorities, how they are done, how engineers are sent out to the country to look at a back door to arrive back the next day in a lorry and find that some of the materials needed are not available?  Some of these repairs could be far more cheaply done if the tenant were given a certain amount of money and told to do it himself rather than this business of sending out engineers to look at relatively minor repairs.  If one had to pay a bill for repairs to one's own house at the rates paid by the local authorities one would certainly change one's builder.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look at the method of charging for these repairs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Kavanagh, it is not altogether as simple as the relationship between the cost of maintenance and the house purchase scheme.  Having served in the Department, I am sure the Deputy is familiar with this matter.  To put it another way, even if we were to dispose of all local authority houses today many services would still be in place.  I do not want to go further than saying I am worried about the cost of maintenance, the systems which are in place and the fact that, despite much investment, the housing stock is considerably run down in various places.  This matter requires new thinking and examination, and I am doing that.  My concern at present is to ensure we have the best possible legislation which will give Ministers and Governments the flexibility in the future to do, or not to do, certain things.  If, in the <Col N="1875" /> light of circumstances they believe there should be a continuous scheme, provision is made for that.  If they decide, because of current circumstances or difficulties, that there should be a time limit on certain dwellings, provision is made for that too.  I am leaving that flexibility in place <Col N="1876" /> for various reasons.  I believe this is a more sensible approach than going down the road of absolutely providing in primary legislation that all future Governments will be bound by certain requirements regardless of the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 21, after &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including any flat or apartment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose this amendment to make clear beyond doubt that the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; includes a flat or an apartment. The Bill states: &ldquo;`house' includes any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling and any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith and `housing' shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.  That definition is loose and is open to different interpretations. I do not believe that the amendment we have tabled will tie up all the loose ends but at least it affords us an opportunity of raising the question whether the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; is a proper and complete definition.</P>
      <P>Earlier I sought to define the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; but I was ruled out of order. Is a dwelling a house?  Later in the Bill there is a definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;.  Section 25 (a) states: &ldquo;`dwelling' means a dwelling provided by a housing authority&rdquo;. Therefore, a dwelling is only a dwelling provided by a housing authority.  My amendment proposing to define &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; was ruled out of order and that was probably a mistake.  This section gives a definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo;.  What is a house? While it may seem an esoteric question, the fact is that throughout the rest of this Bill and the Housing Acts generally, the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; is used.  It is not always clear, for instance, that the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; refers to any dwelling place whether it is on wheels, a flat or an apartment.  Is a normal house shared by two or more families to be three houses or one house? Proposing the amendment affords me an opportunity to raise the question as to what is a house and what is a dwelling, and when is a dwelling not a house?  If the definition on page 29 is to stand, it would appear that a dwelling is only a dwelling owned by a housing authority or is that the case only in so far as the relevant Act is concerned?</P>

      <P>A house is a building used as a dwelling.  I am advised that this amendment is unnecessary.  A flat or an apartment is part of a building and as such is already encompassed within the existing definition of a house and in that regard I do not believe Deputy Mitchell need have any great fears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be a study in itself to go through the Housing Acts, including this one, and extract all the contexts in which the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; or &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is used, or the word &ldquo;caravan&rdquo; or &ldquo;halting site&rdquo; or the context in which the words &ldquo;flat&rdquo; and &ldquo;apartment&rdquo; are separately used.  I am not convinced that we have got our act together and have a clear definition of these words for the purposes of legislation.  We are inserting a definition of the word &ldquo;house&rdquo;.  Later we insert <Col N="1879" /> a definition of the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; which certainly does not appear to me to be an all-embracing definition.  Yet I believe most reasonable people would take a dwelling to mean a house in the sense of being living accommodation, whether it is a house, a flat, an apartment, a caravan, a mobile home or similar accommodation. It is not an idle point and it is on Committee Stage that we should be seeking to perfect legislation and to give it consistency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Six months from the date of the enactment of this Act, the Minister shall lay before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas a report listing the sections of the Act which have been brought into operation and, shall at the end of each subsequent six month period, lay a similar report until such time as the entire Act has been implemented.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment I am proposing an arrangement whereby a progress report would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas giving some indication of the sections of legislation that have been brought into operation.  One of the difficulties with much of the primary legislation that is going through this House is that the legislation has to be brought into operation by order or regulation of the Minister.  Very often what has happened over a period of time is that legislation is enacted in this House but not brought into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent examples of that would be the Child Care Act which has been raised by a number of Deputies.  Even though it took many years for the legislation to be passed and the Bill was at one stage referred to a Special Committee, critical <Col N="1880" /> sections of that Act still have not been brought into operation.</P>
    <P>Another example is that of the Local Government Act which was put through the House last year important sections of which are still not in operation. What I am proposing here is that, at six monthly intervals, a report should be given to the House after the legislation has been passed indicating what sections of the legislation have been brought into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment appears to arise from apprehensions that some provisions of the Bill may not be brought into effect or may even be delayed.  I want to assure Deputies on all sides of the House that it is my intention to see that the provisions of this Bill are implemented without any delay.  No part of this Bill, as far as I am concerned, is for the back burner.  There is a huge corpus of legislation on housing and building societies, and every single provision has been implemented with the exception of section 8 of the 1988 Housing Act and section 115 of the 1966 Housing Act.  In both cases practical issues arose which made it undesirable to bring them into force.  Therefore, it has not been the practice to have reporting requirements of this kind in law.  All of the evidence we have with regard to housing legislation is exactly contrary; the facts are as I have stated.  Of the two provisions that have not been put into effect, one has actually operated on a non-statutory basis since its enactment and the other will be put into effect arising from another provision in this Bill. Clearly there is no substantial case that can be made against any Government in relation to the putting into effect of provisions in housing and building society laws.  On that basis and on the previous housing legislation record I believe I can safely ask Deputy Gilmore to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I understand we have a very short time for Committee Stage and I do not wish to hold up the debate on this amendment.  I accept the Minister's <Col N="1881" /> point that the record in relation to housing legislation is not as bad as that in other areas of legislation.  It may well be that from time to time there are practical reasons a section of legislation cannot be brought into effect.  In this amendment I am seeking that there would be a mechanism for reporting the matter to this House.  As you will be aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there are those of us who would on occasion seek to raise the implementation of legislative measures on the Order of Business and they would find very little favour with you.  Therefore, I consider we need some mechanism for the monitoring of legislation once it has been enacted.  I do not propose to press the amendment at this stage, but I would indicate that my party colleagues and I intend to make amendments of this kind a regular feature of Committee Stage debates in the future.</P>

      <P>A number of my amendments have been ruled out of order because they involve a charge on the Exchequer.  Under section 1 I had proposed that the provisions of this Bill should apply to the travelling people and their problems.  I understand the section dealing with them is section 10, which will be discussed later.  This Bill is, obviously, very beneficial to the settled community but there is only a punitive reference to the travelling people.  The distress is taken away from the settled community and the local authorities but members of the travelling community can be imprisoned for offences they may commit. Therefore, we are going to impose distress on the travelling people.  I believe it is wrong to introduce such a concept into the Bill.  It was my intention and that of the Opposition parties to use this Bill to improve their lot and to deal with the problems with which they are faced. Since I have been told that the simple amendment which would have introduced the idea of a caravan on a halting <Col N="1882" /> site being a dwelling has been ruled out of order because it would impose a potential cost on the Exchequer, I am afraid that I have to oppose this section.</P>

      <P>We are not presuming that any of us is an absolute authority on any of these matters.  I reject out of hand Deputy Kavanagh's contention that these are punitive measures designed to inflict further problems on the travelling community. We are dealing here with what is a house.  We provide halting sites for the travelling community at costs per unit which are generally above the cost of providing a local authority house, at the request of the travelling community. They prefer to have these type of units. What would arise from another interpretation is that these would be sold off. They are designed to create the type of mobility that the travelling community require.  In essence, we would sell this halting site.  Presumably the person who owned it would like to go somewhere else <Col N="1883" /> and I have no flexibility to use it for someone else who is on the roadside. That is the essence of what we are talking about.</P>

      <P>The people involved with the travelling community have found this Bill to be offensive.  The Minister must have had a huge volume of correspondence, like the rest of us, setting out their reasons.  I hope the Minister will change section 10 without being pushed by us.  The travelling community are entitled to the benefits of this Bill. The Minister may say that that would involve an additional cost to the Exchequer, but if that is so, so be it.  It would be a great mistake to exclude the travelling community from the protection of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Kavanagh said.  Deputies Kavanagh, Garland and I tabled virtually identical amendments arising from representations from the organisations representing travellers.  They found section 10 and some sections of the Roads Bill to be quite offensive, to be anti-traveller and to put them at a disadvantage.  What we are seeking to do in section 10 is to eliminate or at least limit this section and those aspects of the Bill which were found to be offensive by the travelling community and to widen the terms of the Bill by including traveller accommodation in the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While accepting the Chair's ruling on the amendments, the question of ruling amendments out of order on the grounds that they are a potential charge on the Exchequer is probably a very extensive way of dealing with this.  It could be argued that any amendment put forward involves a potential charge on the revenue. That grounds should be looked at elsewhere.  It very much restricts the kind of debate we can have here.  A number of other definitions dealing with refurbishing of substandard accommodation and the shared ownership scheme were ruled out of order on that basis and therefore they will not be debated in the way <Col N="1884" /> in which I had intended.  Perhaps we can deal with those areas when discussing the section but it would have focused our debate had we been able to debate specific amendments.</P>

      <P>Potential charges on the Exchequer have been dealt with in this way over the years.  There is nothing different here.  The problems with regard to the travelling community have nothing to do with this Bill.  I met the local associations and received no request from the national association with regard to this Bill.  If I do, I will be happy to meet them, because I was well able to allay the fears of the local associations with regard to aspects of this Bill where they had some wrong impressions.  The problem with the travelling community has little or nothing to do with the powers in this Bill or any other Bill.  It has to do with the resistance of communities in different parts of the country to have the problem resolved. Deputies can point to nothing in this Bill which interferes with the travelling community. When we reach section 10 I hope I will be able to explain that the reasons behind the thinking here are more in favour of the travelling community than has been credited.  However, we will deal with that later.</P>

        <b>NEW SECTION.</b>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1885" />
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;It shall be a principal objective of national housing policy that, before 31st December, 1999, all families be accommodated in spacious and comfortable housing at a cost they can afford, and be located in an external environment which is pleasant and wholesome.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing to make a mission statement on our national housing policy. Notwithstanding the present difficulties and drawbacks and without wishing to minimise the crisis in housing at present, the State has an enviable record since Independence in regard to housing.  I contend that housing here is better than in any other country.  That is not an exaggeration; it is a fact.  The quality of our housing here is excellent and due to policies followed by most Governments since the foundation of the State, it is possible for the poorest family to live in comfortable and spacious housing with modern facilities at a cost they can afford. I do not think it is any harm to laud the achievements in regard to housing of past and present generations.</P>
      <P>W.T. Cosgrave as Head of Government and Minister for Local Government from 1922 played a leading role in housing development, having previously been chairman of the corporation's housing committee prior to Independence.  Every Government since have had a progressive housing policy.  However, a proportion of our citizens have no indoor running water, toilets or bathrooms.  The number is of the order of 20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant number is housed in an external environment which does not reflect credit on the public authorities. Due to bad management or the lack of thought or money, the external areas surrounding some of the flat complexes and housing estates leave much to be desired. This creates an alienating environment <Col N="1886" /> for those who reside in them.  That is a terrible pity because neglect of public areas leads to other problems.  It may lead to attitudinal problems, crime, vandalism and other anti-social activities.  People who live in such a bad environment often ask why local authorities allow such areas to be created and adopt the attitude, why should they be part of the system and why should they not rebel against it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to adopt this mission statement approach.  In the amendment I deliberately set a date which is some years off so that there would be a reasonable timescale in which to fulfil it &mdash; in other words I hope we will implement this policy before the end of the century.  A relatively small number of estates is affected and I do not wish to stigmatise any estate by naming it.</P>
    <P>If we put in place new administrative arrangements and invested a small amount of money we could greatly improve the external environment and make living conditions much more wholesome.</P>
    <P>We should take pride in the significant achievements we have made in housing without being complacent about it but we should go a step further by improving the external environment of all State housing so that people will be proud to live in such an environment.  I do not think it is over-ambitious to adopt this mission statement as housing policy.  If we succeed in implementing it we will have done a great deal to ease the pressures of living and make life happier for everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>No Member could be against this amendment and I will be interested in hearing the Minister's response to it.</P>
      <P>The trouble with mission statement is that they depend on the commitment of the missionary to implement them. However, the Government missionaries in this sector leave much to be desired. The amendment tabled by Deputy Mitchell is very similar to the opening statement in <i>A Plan for Social Housing,</i> the Government document issued some 18 months ago.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed to <Col N="1887" /> pursuing housing policies with the broad objective of ensuring that every household has a dwelling suitable to its needs, located in an acceptable environment, at a price or rent it can afford.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally this is the same statement contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which predates <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> by some months.</P>
    <P>The content of Deputy Mitchell's amendment is stated Government policy. Indeed, the stated Government policy is in many ways better than Deputy Mitchell's amendment because it does not put a finite date on its implementation. The problem, however, is that there is a big gap between stated Government policy and Government action.  It may be stated Government policy that every household has a dwelling suitable to its needs located in an acceptable environment at a price or rent it can afford but the reality is different.  There are 6,500 local authority houses which do not have a bathroom; a few thousand local authority houses do not have indoor toilet facilities and several thousand houses do not have a hot water supply and have to survive with only one tap. Many local authority houses are substandard and many are now seriously over-crowded.  Many families have to live in cramped boxrooms with their in-laws because they are waiting to be rehoused by a local authority.  At the present rate of progress they may be on the waiting list for several years.  I came across a case today of a family taken off the waiting list because they had moved in with a brother.  The local authority took the view that, because the family had not sought permission from them to move in with him, they were not entitled to be there and should be removed from the housing waiting list.</P>
    <P>There are many people who simply cannot afford to buy a house.  There is also a great variation in the price of housing between one part of the country and another.  In my constituency it is <Col N="1888" /> becoming increasingly difficult for a young family to purchase a home of their own, many families are being forced out of the areas in which they grew up and have to buy a home sometimes far away from their own family or place of work because that is what the market dictates.  At the same time there is a development that has resulted from the use of section 23 whereby people bought up houses, sometimes in large numbers, in housing estates for rental purposes in order to avail of favourable tax concessions. Some of the houses that were bought ten years ago under the provisions of that section are coming back on market because the ten year tax benefit has expired.  The owners want to sell the houses on the open market and people who have rented them are being taken to court and are being evicted.  There is increasing evidence of exploitation in the private rental sector.  People are being rented the grottiest of accommodation for very high rentals.</P>
    <P>We are a long way from the mission and objectives of either Deputy Mitchell's amendment or the Government's statement in relation to housing but have provided very little in the way of real action, certainly very little action in a form that would assist people in housing themselves at an affordable cost and in an acceptable environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like Deputy Mitchell to think that I was not in wholehearted agreement with the purpose of his amendment; I certainly am. However, I do not consider that the Bill, when enacted, will go very far down the road towards solving the housing crisis in this country.  The purposes of the legislation are set out in the explanatory memorandum.  Basically, the Bill seeks to provide for shared ownership arrangements, for the carrying out of improvements and so on.  The Bill is certainly not a blueprint for housing policy to the end of the decade.  The aspiration expressed in the amendment would certainly be lost in this Bill.  I should like the provision to be included in other legislation so that it would be able to bring <Col N="1889" /> about the change in the housing area that we all desire.  Nevertheless, one can only be in favour of the aspiration contained in the amendment.  I support it and hope that the Minister has the same high ideal for the end of this decade, providing he is in office that long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My tenure of office has been extended fairly considerably any way.</P>
      <P>I should first like to take on board the points made by Deputy Mitchell.  It would be fair to say that a very considerable investment has been made in the provision of decent housing accommodation throughout the country for people who would not otherwise be in a position to rehouse themselves.  Earlier on we talked about the relative costs and so on.  Despite all efforts made in the past, however, the Government need to make ongoing and consistent efforts in devoting the maximum amount of resources available for this very essential purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell also made the point that sometimes tenants are alienated. One of the best ways to approach that issue for the future is contained in this Bill, which provides the solid framework for new management systems that will allow for the involvement of tenants in the management and maintenance of their estates.  I consider it very important that those developments take place and that tenants be encouraged by public representatives wherever possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the comments made by Deputy Gilmore, the housing stock analysis for the period 1980 to 1990 shows a substantial reduction in the number of houses in the country without baths or indoor toilet facilities.  The number of houses without baths decreased from 19 per cent to 8 per cent and the number of houses without indoor toilet facilities decreased from 16 per cent to 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On top of those improvements, there are the £2 million provision made specifically to supplement local <Col N="1890" /> authorities in the provision of bathrooms in local authority houses, the pre-1940 refurbishment scheme and the various developments for the refurbishment of flats that are taking place in the inner city of Dublin and in other cities and towns throughout the country.  We should acknowledge that there has been a considerable investment on the part of the taxpayer, on the part of the community as a whole and on the part of individuals to arrive at the position at which the housing analysis was able to indicate very solid progress.  That does not take us away from the fact that there are still individual problems that have to be addressed.  The continuing commitment and provision of £2 million this year is an indication from the Government that we want to continue developments aimed at resolving those problems as quickly as we can consistent with the available resources.</P>
      <P>There is no indication in any evidence available to me of an upward trend in the number of repossessions.  I would not like such a trend to develop, but I do not think there is evidence to sustain that argument so far as local authorities are concerned.  When there is a repossession the local authority involved is in a position to give further consideration to the way in which the person or family concerned may be rehoused.  Building society repossessions constitute a very small number as compared with the number of repossessions in the UK and elsewhere.  I would not like to make light of even one repossession.  The repossession of a home is a traumatic event for any family and one should do all one can to avoid such a development.  I think there are about 170,000 building society mortgages, with repossessions at an extremely low figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is basically a re-statement of housing policy objectives of successive Governments, this time with a time horizon of 31 December 1999.  I referred to the general policy objectives in my Second Reading speech and outlined the broad strategy adopted to achieve those objectives.  There is no fundamental disagreement about those <Col N="1891" /> aims but there is little to be gained from writing into legislation an aspirational statement such as that contained in the amendment.  That in itself would not achieve anything.  To what extent we as a nation achieve objectives in the housing area depends on a great number of variable factors that are difficult to predict &mdash;factors such as emigration, internal migration, economic growth, unemployment, interest rates and, critically, the amount of public resources that we can afford to devote to housing.  When the amendment is considered in that context, one can recognise the futility of putting a time limit on such an objective. No sane or responsible Government would commit themselves in legislation to a time-bound objective.  Has there been a costing of what would be involved in that proposal over the next eight years? Are we prepared to say exactly where the money will come from, bearing in mind that in an earlier contribution the Deputy mentioned that in the next 20 years the average cost of every new local authority house would be about £90,000.</P>
    <P>As I said, we must try to improve housing conditions for our people where these are deficient.  The plan for social housing in this Bill is about new ways of doing that.  Success in housing will depend on the ongoing development of policies to take account of changing circumstances and the effective implementation and resourcing of these policies.  Housing policy objectives have always been spelled out in policy documents.  The specific policy measures to achieve these objectives have been provided for in legislation. I see no merit in departing from this sensible approach, as this amendment would suggest.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point also that I will do everything I can to make as many changes, first, in getting this legislation passed and, second, in ensuring that all its various provisions are implemented as quickly as possible and that over the next couple of years we make a fairly dramatic improvement in the provision of local authority accommodation at all levels.  I think that the ambition of all of us &mdash;<Col N="1892" /> and none of us can claim to be more missionary than the rest in terms of our aspirations &mdash; would be to achieve this before 1999 if resources were there and there were not other competing considerations.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Mitchell will appreciate, taking the house building sector and everything into consideration, that as long as this country is growing, as long as we have a new, growing population, there will always be a time when people are looking for housing and housing accommodation.  That is part of an ongoing, developing country and I do not think it is possible even to spell out a specific date on which everybody's problems, educational or in the health area or housing area, have reached the point where there is nothing more to do.  It is a continuing process of getting the maximum resources that the community can afford, the implementation of enlightened plans and provisions for new thinking, which allow for tenants to have a greater say themselves, where they are more involved in the management and where we can at the same time have a more efficient programme to make the kind of savings Deputies have referred to in the context of costs we are at present incurring and which certainly give ground for some questioning.</P>
    <P>On the overall principle of what Deputy Mitchell wants to achieve, everybody in this House will agree with it. Many of us would like to think we can achieve these laudable aims in a shorter period but, to specify them in primary legislation without saying where resources are coming from or knowing exactly the kind of numbers that would be involved, would not be acceptable. For instance, in the last couple of years quite a number of families who have returned to this country are now on the housing list.  If Deputy Mitchell or I were Minister here two years ago we might not have been able even to forecast that. There may not have been trends at that time that would have enabled us to do it.</P>
    <P>That does not take away from the fundamental question of trying to address the problems on the ground as quickly as <Col N="1893" /> we can.  My ambition is to achieve that with the very positive support in this House and to continue to fight to make sure we have every possible resource available to us within the constraints of national finances to deal with these problems. To go further than that would be to spell an aim in legislation when you are not in a position to go beyond an aspiration.  Nobody can argue the point that putting it into legislation actually builds a house or provides the resources. There are too many differing and potential types of situations out there which we will not be able to foresee.  We try to be prophets, but we are not.  Let us do the business of passing the legislation in the best way we can and take on board the main aims and aspirations that are there to be fulfilled at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's reply, if not surprised by it. I will try to explain why I am disappointed and why the Minister could be more adventurous.  For the elucidation of Deputy Gilmore, who is probably one of the better read Members of this House, this amendment is a direct quotation from the first paragraph of Fine Gael's housing policy statement published as part of local government policy generally last year.  I will send him a copy of it.  It is built on the very successful housing policies of successive Fine Gael Governments since 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's reply is of an Augustinian nature: &ldquo;We want good housing, but not yet, Lord&rdquo;.  His reply has done credit to St. Augustine's attitude to sin. It seems to me there is value in enshrining objectives of this kind in legislation. As Deputy Gilmore has so properly demonstrated this quotation from the Fine Gael housing policy statement was part of our local government policy last year.  It is not greatly different from the policy statement in two Government documents on housing.  However, policy statements are one thing and clear objectives of statute are another.  While they are objectives, they still have a great deal of influence on the attitudes adopted by <Col N="1894" /> decision makers.  I will take two different levels to illustrate the point.</P>
    <P>For instance, if the Maastricht Treaty had an aspiration to economic and monetary union without giving any date, I can well imagine that in 20 years' time we would still be talking about economic and monetary union.  That Treaty specifies dates in respect of different phases of economic and monetary union as, indeed, it specifies dates for other areas of the Treaty like the Social Charter etc. That means all policy makers have at least to address that objective and try to achieve it so far as is possible.  On the other hand, we have development plan objectives at local authority level.  In the case of the Dublin City development plan, which was renewed a few months ago, I myself managed to get accepted the proposal which I tabled to have an objective for the city to double inner city population within ten years.  Already the inference of that objective is manifest. The attitude of planners has changed to planning applications in respect of inner city sites.  An objective has been set in a development plan.  When we say we are trying to double the population of the inner city within ten years we are merely trying to restore the situation that existed ten years ago.  Now planners are actively saying that this is policy and asking how we facilitate and help it.  It is good policy because it is based on the belief that the inner city has been dying. Indeed, we have a number of redundant facilities there, including churches, schools, health centres, Garda stations etc. while there are huge demands for new schools, new churches, and similar facilities just a few miles up the road in the suburbs.  There is utility and there is benefit in inserting in law objectives which are stated as party policy or even Government policy.  When they are stated in law many people take them to be riding instructions and they seek to implement them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, rightly, that of course human society is a living organism and it does not always shape up as people forecast.  Housing demand might be less next year than expected or it might be <Col N="1895" /> more.  In five years' time it might be quite different from what is now felt to be the case.  Of course it is a living thing and subject to change, but what is not subject to change is the sort of standards of living conditions people have come, rightly, to expect.  This is not only in terms of the amount of floor space, bedrooms or basic facilities like running hot and cold water, bathroom, etc., but what is their vista when they go to the shop or to church? For many of our citizens it is an appalling vista and we should not baulk at setting an objective of ensuring that, before the end of this century, every citizen has running hot and cold water, a bathroom or shower and an indoor toilet and that their dwelling is located in an area which is not covered with graffiti or rat ridden or overgrown with weeds.  That is the minimum objective.  As the Minister and other speakers agree with this objective I ask him to be generous and to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response to this amendment has really angered me.  Listening to him, one would think that he did not preside over one of the worst housing crises in the history of the State.  The amendment contains an aspiration that every family in the State would be housed adequately and in an acceptable environment by the end of 1999, a policy objective which everybody in this House shares.  The Minister in responding, by what he said and his tone, conveyed an impression that everything is fine, that the Government are investing in housing, the number of substandard houses is reducing and that we are moving merrily along the way to house families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that the degree of anger and frustration existing among people living in substandard housing and in overcrowded conditions was conveyed to the Minister and the Government.  I deal daily with people who do not have proper housing, in some cases with people who live in sheds at the bottom of their family's garden.  They do not have running water or electricity and they must <Col N="1896" /> trek to the family house to go to the toilet or to get water to boil a kettle.  Families are living in overcrowded conditions.  A case which comes to mind is of a woman who telephoned me to tell me that she lives with her husband and seven children in two bedroomed accommodation.  I know of another case of a husband, wife and two children &mdash; one of whom suffers from asthma &mdash; living in one bedroomed accommodation.  People live in the most appalling conditions in the private rented sector waiting for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The area which I represent &mdash; the Dún Laoghaire Corporation area &mdash; has 500 applicants on the housing waiting list but we are permitted to build only 25 houses this year.  In the south County Dublin area 700 people are on the housing waiting list and slightly in excess of 20 houses will be built this year.  There are 600 local authority dwellings in the area which I represent which do not have a bathroom; it will take 30 years for those houses to be refurbished at the rate at which we are getting finance from the local authority. Our biggest problem is to get the Minister and the Government to acknowledge that there is a problem.  I know that the amendment we are debating seeks to insert in the Bill a general policy statement with which we all agree but it is time we heard from the Minister for the Environment or the Government some acknowledgement of the seriousness of our housing crisis and an acknowledgement of the frustration and anger felt by those on housing waiting lists and living in substandard accommodation. There should be some statement of intent or hope that something will be done about it because the half-way house measures in the Bill &mdash; and the way they are constructed and wrapped up &mdash; will not resolve the housing crisis.  It will be a bit like the health crisis which the Government suddenly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not know about the health crisis until they went on the <Col N="1897" /> hustings at the last general election.  They will not know about the housing crisis until they once again go on the hustings. I assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister, that the Government will know about the housing crisis when the next election is held because there is an enormous degree of anger, frustration and a feeling of being neglected throughout the country by people waiting to be housed.</P>
      <P>I will give a final example in this regard. In the last 12 months Dublin County Council have not housed anybody in the normal way from their housing list, every single applicant who has been housed by Dublin County Council in the last 12 months has had an address at a hostel or a bed and breakfast &mdash; they were all officially homeless.  I resent the Minister's blasé approach to this crisis and it would at least be reassuring if there was a semblance of urgency or acknowledgement of the extent of the crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for the Environment is not aware of the housing crisis he is out of touch with reality.  At a meeting of the housing authorities in north Cork I said that the Minister is out of touch.  Housing is an essential social need.  Houses must be provided for people who cannot afford to purchase them or to build their own.  The housing crisis in the rural area of north Cork, comprising the Mallow and Kanturk electoral areas, is contributing in no uncertain manner to marital breakdown because, as Deputy Gilmore said, people are living in overcrowded conditions in flats or with in-laws.  These conditions are totally unsuitable for young couples bringing up their families.  The various schemes which the Minister intends to introduce will not solve the problem. Adequate finance is required for housing to be built by the local authorities.  If the Minister approved joint venture schemes people would be re-housed and eventually they would be appointed tenants.  It would be a step forward.  It is not good enough to leave unemployed people to their own devices.  The Minister should face up to the fact that there is a housing <Col N="1898" /> crisis.  He has been written to very often from the housing and sanitary division of which I am a member and he must be well aware of the problem.</P>
      <P>The basic requirement for any family is the security of their own home.  People must be housed by the local authority at a reasonable rent or, as I said, if schemes were introduced on a joint venture basis it would mean the local authority would join builders to provide houses and would allocate them to successful applicants.</P>
      <P>In April 1991 there were 300 approved applicants in this small area, 150 of whom had been deemed to be in urgent need of housing by the housing officer for the area in Cork County Council.  Despite this only 12 to 14 houses will be built this year.  This is not good enough.  The Minister must address this question and state that moneys will be provided to the local authority.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann reiterates its previous condemnation of the operations of the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. plant at Sellafield in the UK and, in particular, condemns the proposal to extend and develop that plant further; and calls on the Government</P>
      <P>&mdash; to outline in full all actions taken to secure the closure of the Sellafield plant and, in particular, all actions taken to prevent further development of the plant</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; to prepare and initiate a campaign of representation through every possible forum, including the European Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the Anglo-Irish Conference, and contacts between relevant Departments here and in the <Col N="1899" /> United Kingdom with the object of securing the closure of Sellafield and</P>
    <P>&mdash; to outline any and all legal advice it has obtained in this matter, and to indicate what legal action, if any, it proposes to take.</P>

      <P>For many people there is a feeling when one sees a motion on Sellafield that it is almost a hardy annual which has been debated many times in the House.  What I hope will be achieved both tonight and tomorrow is for once a clear enunciation of a strategy by the Government, with the collective support of each Member and party in this House, to tackle one of the most significant health hazards and environmental pollutants faced by the Irish people.  The sum total of the Government's efforts in relation to their stated opposition to the Sellafield plant has been confined to merely making representations to the British Government and other international bodies.  All these efforts have been inadequate and have failed not only to stop the operations that they themselves, both in Opposition and in Government, have decried and condemned but have also failed to halt growth and expansion and the construction of what is now called Sellafield 2 on the Cumbrian site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's excuse for their failure to take any effective action in relation to the existing facilities at Sellafield and the proposed Sellafield 2 is that there are no legal remedies available to them; and it is apparent on reading the amendment which has been tabled in the name of the Minister for Energy tonight that the same arguments are going to be trotted out again.  The Government have failed consistently to explain the reason they do not utilise the powers given to <Col N="1900" /> them under the Treaties establishing the European Community in order to bring their concerns and those of the Irish people regarding the environmental effects of Sellafield before the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>Article 170 of the EC Treaty provides that a member state which considers that another member state has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaty may bring the matter before the Court of Justice. That is written in black and white under the terms of the Treaties.  The complaining state must first report the matter to the Commission and, if the Commission fails to act, the case can be brought directly to the Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>There is a similar procedure for complaints against a member state under Article 142 of the EURATOM Treaty. Legal advice made available to us suggests that an action under these provisions would be open to the Government in regard to concerns that the activities of BNFL at Sellafield are being conducted in breach of a number of key European environmental directives.  It is surprising therefore, to say the least, that there has never been an explanation for the inactivity and reticence of the Government to utilise these Treaties to fulfil the desire of this House, as expressed by way of motion previously, and of the Irish people, which they have expressed again and again when asked about this issue.  The concerns to which I have referred relate to directives from 1980 to 1984 which lay down basic standards for the protection of the health and safety of workers and the general public regarding radioactive contamination.</P>
    <P>Another breach of European standards which directly concerns the Government arises in relation to the 1985 directive on environmental impact assessments.  There has been a number of complaints concerning the environmental impact assessment process for the Sellafield 2 plant.  It is a matter of grave concern that no independent environmental impact study has been carried out for that project; but, more serious still, the role of the Government in the environmental impact assessment process <Col N="1901" /> has to be clarified.  I hope they will do so tonight.</P>
    <P>Article 7 of the 1985 directive requires the United Kingdom to consult with the Government regarding the construction of the plant because of the fact that the project will have significant transboundary implications.  Tonight the Labour Party call on the Minister to clarify the Government's conduct in relation to the handling of the environmental impact assessment for Sellafield 2.  In particular, I ask if the Government received a formal notification under the directive and if they were furnished with all the scientific and technical information required by the directive.  I further ask if the Government communicated formally with the planning authority concerned regarding the environmental effects of the project and, if so, what was the content of the Government's communique.  Third, I ask the Minister, if the Government failed to lodge a formal submission with the planning authority, to explain the reason for not doing so.</P>
    <P>As everybody is now aware, a new processing plant, Sellafield 2, is due to &ldquo;go active&rdquo; at Sellafield before the end of this year.  All the dangers and risks associated with Sellafield 1 will now be magnified and dramatically increased.  It is estimated that the level of radiation released into the environment may well rise by over 1,000 per cent.</P>
    <P>Sellafield 2 is a thermal oxide reprocessing plant known as THORP.  It is bigger and will deal with more deadly waste and discharge far more radiation than the current Sellafield plant.  Nuclear waste for the plant from the United Kingdom, continental Europe and Japan has already been stockpiled at Sellafield over many years waiting for the new larger facility to come into operation. This fuel is ten times more radioactive than the fuel currently being reprocessed at Sellafield.  Indeed, because of the dangers and costs involved in dealing with this fuel both Germany and the United States have decided to stop reprocessing it in their own countries.  Germany spent up to £1 billion in partially building a reprocessing plant before it was stopped <Col N="1902" /> by public opposition and concern not only about the environmental implications in relation to a reprocessing plant of this nature but also about the economics of the operation.  They are very happy indeed to offload their spent fuel to be reprocessed in a foreign jurisdiction on our doorstep.  The last time BNFL tried to reprocess this type of fuel in 1973 it led to a major radiation leak. The building involved in that particular experiment remains closed to this day. During the planned 30-year operating life of the new Sellafield 2 around 21,000 tonnes of waste nuclear fuel are expected to be reprocessed there.  This will mean importing over 600 tonnes of foreign fuel every year from the mid-nineties onwards.</P>
    <P>At this stage the history of Sellafield is known fairly well to anybody concerned with environmental matters in this country and is certainly known to the Irish public.  Sellafield began its life as a reprocessing plant in the fifties to make plutonium for the British nuclear bomb. In the reprocessing operation extremely radioactive nuclear waste fuel from nuclear reactors is dissolved in acid.  Plutonium and uranium are separated, leaving highly radioactive waste as a residue. Dissolving the rods releases radioactive gases into the atmosphere.  The liquids used during the process are contaminated and discharged into the Irish Sea.  Discharges from Sellafield since the fifties, according to the 1986 British House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment, have rendered the Irish Sea the most radioactive sea in the world, a legacy with which we will all have to deal.</P>
    <P>Reprocessing is a dirty business.  It multiplies the volume of waste received at least 160 times.  All the materials, tools, equipment, even the buildings, used in the process are prone to become contaminated.  As a result Sellafield creates 76 per cent of Britain's low level waste and 62 per cent of its intermediate level waste.  While most of its high level waste is returned to the countries of origin, all of the rest of the waste, middle and low level, is retained in the United <Col N="1903" /> Kingdom on the Sellafield site, or close to it at Drig, poisoning the land and sea not only for our lifetimes but for generations to come.  Since 1965 4,000 tonnes of waste nuclear fuel have been imported into the United Kingdom, fuels which come from Germany, Holland, Italy and Switzerland by land and sea.  They come to Dover on the ordinary roll-on/roll-off ferries.  What a way to carry such hazardous cargoes?  Much of the waste fuel comes through the Irish Sea, through the narrow St. George's Channel, to Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria to be offloaded.  It is a great irony that one can actually see those vessels if one stands in a corner of my constituency at Carnsore Point.</P>
    <P>The effects of Sellafield have been devastating for this country.  The effects of a new, expanded Sellafield 2 are unthinkable.  Radioactive discharges into the air of highly poisonous substances could rise by up to 1,000 per cent.  We are warned that radioactive sea discharges such as caesium will rise significantly also.  It is not merely accidents of which we are fearful.  The deadly pollution that pours from Sellafield daily is one that threatens our health and wellbeing even when the reprocessing plant runs normally.  There have been many finds over the years of contaminated shellfish, seaweed and sands in the proximity of Sellafield.  Reprocessing at Sellafield 2 will produce far more waste than comes into the plant.  BNFL intend to send most of the waste back to the countries of origin.  That begs the question: how will it be transported?  In regard to the residual waste, that is the waste that is not offered back, where and how is that to be disposed of?</P>
    <P>UK NIREX is the nuclear industry's waste disposal arm in the United Kingdom.  Among their plans is one to build the world's largest underground nuclear dump in west Cumbria to take, it is estimated, three million tonnes of low and intermediate level waste.  What a prospect.  NIREX hope to have the dump ready for filling in the year 2005.  I understand it will take some 50 years to fill the <Col N="1904" /> dump they propose, which will take up 500 acres of land below ground.  The waste will contain up to nine tonnes of plutonium over that period of time.  Most of it will remain dangerous for many thousands of years into the future.  Who can undertake that it will not leak or pose a threat geologically over those periods of time?</P>
    <P>There is simply no safe way of storing nuclear waste.  This country has taken its decision in relation to the nuclear industry. Yet, uniquely, we are expected to suffer the consequences of a nuclear industry expanding and growing on our doorstep, from which we derive no benefit and that daily threatens the lives and wellbeing of our people.  It is intended that Sellafield 2 will be operational by the end of the year.  What will the Minister do to ensure that that threat does not become, in the jargon of the industry, operational or live?  It is said that plutonium was to be created there.  Plutonium is one of the most dangerous substances known to man.  Already significant quantities are believed to have been dumped in the Irish Sea.  Instead of devising plans and stragegies to clear the hazards already put in place by the operations of BNFL at the Sellafield site in Cumbria we are now going to stand idly by, shake our hands and arms in pretended impotence while the threat is expanded, supposedly, for economic reasons.  The real cost of Sellafield 2 to Ireland and the Irish Sea can never be counted, or its health and pollution effects estimated.</P>
    <P>Sellafield's accident record is abysmal. Nearly 1,000 accidents or incidents have occurred in its 40-year history.  For example, between 1976 and 1980 Sellafield alone accounted for 40 per cent of all accidents and incidents in the entire British nuclear industry.  We have witnessed accidents and incidents being the subject of cover-ups.  The plant has been threatened with closure by the Health and Safety Executive because of its inefficient running over the years.  The worst include the well documented incident in 1957 when a fire broke out in one of the plutonium-producing reactors leading to <Col N="1905" /> the release of radioactivity which is estimated to have caused over 1,000 cancer deaths.  In 1973, 35 workers were contaminated and a building permanently shut down after a radioactive leak.  In 1983 a radioactive slick was discovered by Greenpeace and other local people resulting in the closure of 25 miles of beach for six months.  Members of the public were contaminated.  BNFL were found guilty of criminal offences and were fined £10,000 and costs of £60,000 on that occasion.</P>
    <P>These are the facts surrounding the operations of the Sellafield plant.  Our Government are more than aware of all the information I have provided this evening.  Indeed, they have used such information in previous debates.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one other issue.  Earlier this month Greenpeace produced an EC document showing that while the present Taoiseach was President of the Council of Finance Ministers in 1990, during Ireland's so called &ldquo;Green Presidency&rdquo;, he signed an EC agreement to increase loans to the nuclear industry from 2,800 million ECUs to 4,000 million ECUs, or about £3 billion.  Last week I tabled a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach asking whether he had signed that document. That question was transferred to the Minister for Energy and ruled out of order today in anticipation of this debate. I hope the Minister will answer that question in the course of his reply to this debate.  Significantly, this is the first time the EC has specifically mentioned loans for nuclear reprocessing purposes.  The decision had to be unanimous.  The signature of our then Minister for Finance, now the Taoiseach, ensured it was unanimous.</P>
    <P>European funding for the nuclear industry, including Sellafield, has existed since the mid-seventies.  The initial sum put aside was some 500 million ECUs but periodically this sum has been increased, in 1979, 1982 and 1985.  By 1985 the ceiling was raised to 3,000 million ECUs.  I want a simple answer from the Minister for Energy tonight.  Did the Taoiseach agree with the new recital added to that Treaty in 1990?  It was <Col N="1906" /> as follows: Whereas nuclear energy accounts for a major part of the Community's total energy supplies considerable investment ought to be made in this sector both at the production stage, in view of the safety and security requirements, and downstream of production, particularly with regard to reprocessing and storage of waste.  Did the then Minister for Finance, now the Taoiseach, agree to the increased funding of the dangerous nuclear industry across Europe and the possible funding of the Sellafield plant?  Indeed, it could be European taxpayers' money underscoring the development that threatens the health of the Irish people.  That is a simple question which should be addressed by the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>Few issues have united the Irish people as clearly and as forcefully as opposition to Sellafield.  In December 1986 this House unanimously passed a rare motion calling for &ldquo;the immediate closure of this dangerous installation&rdquo;.  That motion was moved by Fianna Fáil and supported by all Deputies in this House.  In the intervening years the plant has grown rather than contracted.  British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the United Kingdom authorities have shown contempt for the wishes of this House and of the Irish people.  The people of Ireland mapped out the way at Carnsore.  I now call on the Government and the Minister for Energy to grasp the Carnsore spirit and for once deal with this festering, menacing issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion represents the unanimous view of the people along the east coast to Sellafield.  As one who represents a coastline constituency this is an issue of great concern to me.  There is a clear overlap here between national and international concerns.  The Irish Sea has become one of the most radioactively polluted seas in the world and this has come about substantially as a result of the discharges from Sellafield over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1950 up to 1,000 accidents have been recorded.  Between 1976 and 1990 alone, Sellafield has accounted for 40 per <Col N="1907" /> cent of all accidents and incidents in the entire British nuclear industry.  In addition, there has been a number of cover-ups and, indeed, if it were not for the vigilance of a number of environmental groups in Ireland and Great Britain, particularly Greenpeace, many of the improved safety features might not have been installed.</P>
    <P>The growing traffic from all over the world in nuclear waste products to the Sellafield reprocessing plant poses an ever-increasing risk to the Irish Sea.  This traffic is set to increase with the threatened expansion of Sellafield to include a nuclear waste dump.</P>
    <P>The deadly pollution that pours out of Sellafield is a major threat to our health and environment.  Each day millions of gallons of radioactive effluent is pumped into the Irish Sea.  Up to half a tonne of plutonium &mdash; one of the most deadly substances known to mankind &mdash; has been deposited in the Irish Sea in the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>The proposal to construct and operate a nuclear waste depository is of deep concern.  This will comprise a deep shaft reaching down some 300 metres or more to a series of underground caverns and will extend out under the Irish Sea.  In effect, it is nothing more than a hole in the bed of the Irish Sea into which unwanted radioactive waste will be dumped and abandoned at the cheapest cost to the nuclear industry.  NIREX will tell us that this is a Rolls Royce solution. Who will believe them, given the record and the deception of the nuclear industry over the years?  In my opinion the Sellafield depository proposal is a once-and-for-all solution and if flawed it will not be practicable to correct it.  As far as this country and its people are concerned, there are no economic or other benefits emanating from this proposal.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this comes up for planning permission all the local authorities and the people in this area will go through the due process because this will have a devastating effect on the health and lifestyle of the people of this country for generations to come.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> I want to refer briefly to the threat to health.  On the north Lancashire coastline cases of adult leukaemia are three times the national average.  Along the west coast of Scotland levels of certain types of leukaemia in young people have reached up to twice the Scottish average. We must also look at the possible effects in the Irish situation.  I know that doctors will disagree on this but I think cancer levels along the Irish coastline have been up to twice the Irish national average and that is a factor that must be taken into consideration.  Many people would say that there is a proven link between the Sellafield plant and the occurrence of cancer along the east coast.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the diplomatic solution to this problem has failed.  I have heard Minister after Minister say in my constituency that they will resolve this problem, that they will adopt a &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; approach in relation to it.  The Irish Government were going to bring the United Kingdom to the European Court of Justice.  We have heard this before but we are still awaiting a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I hope that on the basis of the opportunity afforded to him by this motion tonight the Minister can tell this House and our people what he intends to do about this problem because it must be resolved.</P>
    <P>I now call on the Government to reject all proposals both in relation to the expansion of the Sellafield reprocessing plant and Sellafield II.  We hope to hear the outcome of the Minister's deliberations on that.  We have been waiting for a long time now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to accept that there was the basis for an all-party agreement on the closure of Sellafield in 1986 and that now, six years on, we cannot find agreement in this House not only to implement the 1986 agreement but also to respond in a unified way against the dangers which an expanded facility at Sellafield will represent.  This calls not only the Parliament here but also the Parliaments in Britain, Europe and around the world into disrepute. <Col N="1909" /> There is a great public concern about this issue.  This concern has been informed by the brave actions of groups and organisations, some of which have been referred to already.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach represented Ireland and met the British Prime Minister, John Major, on the periphery of the UNCED in Rio de Janeiro it would have been a minor but magnificent achievement if he had been able to return to Ireland and say he had extracted from Prime Minister Major a commitment to stop what was taking place in Sellafield. This calls to mind the difference between rhetoric and reality.  It is in breach of all the known codes of friendly relations between countries that one country, an immediate neighbour of another, would continue, as one writer put it, to seek refuge in the thickets of the law to avoid closing down a toxic facility.  It is extraordinary that we who have been invited to be communitaire again and again must look on while pollution of the Irish Sea continues in breach of the expressed opinions of our partners in Europe.  It is interesting to think that we will be called on very soon when we have integrated ourselves even further into Europe to take a moral position on where we stand on the testing of armaments and the sale of armaments in, for example, the Pacific.  It is also interesting to note that President Mitterrand has announced a year's moratorium on French testing in parts of the Pacific.</P>
      <P>One has to ask if we are stuck with Sellafield.  This seems to be the attitude of the Government.  If one says, as the amendment does, that there are no legal remedies open to us one must ask whether Parliament and public will mean anything at all.  Everyone who has taken an interest in this matter has called for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to Greenpeace. Sometimes I notice a certain cynicism among those who advise Government on the activities of Greenpeace. I believe that when the history of this century is being written it will recall the bravery of those on the Greenpeace ship who went to Muroroa Atoll and who <Col N="1910" /> were harassed repeatedly in their work of drawing attention to what was taking place.  Of course, it is a matter of whether we can live on this planet with, as the Rio de Janeiro Conference kept inviting us, any sense of interdependency or coresponsibility, when an individual nation says that economic interests dictate and that the law will be used to defend economic interests irrespective of their human impact.</P>
    <P>Dr. Seán McDonagh in his book, <i>To Care for the Earth</i>, published originally in 1986 by Geoffrey Chapman, wrote about nuclear waste.  It is interesting to note that this book preceded the 1986 debate in this House.  He wrote about letters which began to appear in the papers in 1982 and 1983 on the long term effects of dumping large quantities of radioactive waste 400 miles south of the Irish coast. He refers to a report made to President Reagan and to Congress by the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and the Atmosphere in July 1984.  A section of that report, which was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 23 July 1984, went as follows:</P>
    <P>The track record of the experts in managing the radioactive waste problem in the past &mdash; and in keeping the public properly informed &mdash; does not instil confidence in their present management scheme.</P>
    <P>At that time Willie Kealy and Tom Shell wrote about the earthquake in the Irish Sea, normally an earthquake free zone, and how it had sent a chill down the spine of many environmentalists.  Their article entitled &ldquo;Quake Raises Nuclear Waste Fear&rdquo; was published in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> on 22 July 1984.  There is a very interesting pattern in regard to these years, that is, one scientist after another produced what was then tentative research generating hypothesis which was met by a flat political denial.  The people making the statements were people of authority.  Dr. Peter Mitchell of the Department of Physics in UCD said that the Irish Sea held the unenviable record of being the most radioactive sea in the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> On 24 July 1984 <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that Dr. Nicholas Napier, whose practice covered 2,500 patients in the Strangford-Ardglass area, registered two deaths from acute leukaemia within a six month period in 1980.  Dr. Napier was reported as saying he was very concerned about the effects of the dumping of radioactive materials in the Irish Sea. That same day Mr. Patten, then a minister at the Northern Ireland Office, rushed out a denial and said that the plant posed no dangers for the people of County Down.  While the scientists were being careful in developing hypothesis, the political response was that there was no danger.</P>
    <P>The same edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a report by two Irish scientists, Dr. Patricia Sheehan and Dr. Irene Hillery, on the possible links between an accidental discharge of radioactivity at Windscale in 1957 and the unusually high incidence of Downs Syndrome babies born to women who were schoolgirls in Dundalk at the time.  Preliminary studies showed that six girls out of a class of 11 had since given birth to babies affected by Downs Syndrome.  At first it was thought that the virus associated with an outbreak of Asian 'flu in the area, or, at least the interaction between the virus and the raised radioactive levels, might have been responsible.  The book reports the researchers as saying &ldquo;the thrust of the hypothesis has swung towards a purely radioactivity-induced effect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is sad to think that when scientist after scientist has produced reports, when organisations have gone to the trouble of taking great personal and combined risks acting on behalf of the people, as Greenpeace and others have done, when the public have expressed their concern, when in 1986 this Parliament in unison expressed its concern and having heard a plethora of excuses, promises and commitments that this strategy or the other strategy was going to be used, that six years later this is what it has come to. The United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development was barely over when we were told nothing <Col N="1912" /> could be done to stop what is a very significant and grave danger that affects not only those people who are alive and represented by Members of the Dáil at present but which will affect generations to come.</P>
    <P>When John Major spoke at a press conference in Rio de Janeiro he said that someone had remarked on the British position as being very ungracious.  Words like &ldquo;ungracious&rdquo; wither on the lips of the people who insist on having death producing emissions being poured into the piece of water which separates one sovereign country from another.  The issue which arises and which must be resolved and justified to this House this evening is why the consensus of 1986 is being broken.  It has to be explained to this House what amendments to the legal remedies are being sought, if there is a deficiency in the law and the legal remedies. It is very interesting that when issues like these arose at the last meeting of the Law of the Seas Conference there was no significant advance towards the development of new legal remedies.  No great reference was made to these in any of the talks which have taken place on a bilateral basis between Ireland and Britain.  We have to realise that economic interests prevail over any and the most elementary moral values in relation to the British political position.</P>
    <P>The British political insistence on expanding a dangerous facility that impacts on the lives of a friendly nation is little less than an act of international terrorism.  The Irish Government have been promised support by the Labour Party and by other parties and Members of this House for taking any action necessary to at least have it recognised in Britain that we cannot continue to be cosignatories with them to treaties that have specific indications, as Deputy Howlin has shown in the case of Article 7, that they can be flouted for gain.  What was discussed at the conference on the environment and development was the inappropriateness of the North sending its toxic waste to the South, an abuse of the dependency relationship.  It is an act of arrogance and irresponsibility, an anti-European <Col N="1913" /> thought, and the crassest way of putting interests before moral values, to allow the Sellafield plant to be expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann approves the actions taken to date by the Government with a view to the eventual closure of the Sellafield plant and in the meantime to ensure the safe operation and the safe storage of nuclear waste now in the plant.  In particular, Dáil Éireann notes that the Government has fully and carefully investigated the possibility of legal action to secure closure of the plant and that the Government has been advised that a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence as to injurious effects on Ireland of operations at the Sellafield plant, does not exist at present.  Dáil Éireann notes the commitment of the Government to continue its efforts to secure closure of the Sellafield plant.</P>
      <P>The Sellafield complex, on the west coast of Cumbria, is the site of British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing plant, where spent nuclear fuel is chemically reprocessed to extract uranium and plutonium.  The complex also includes Calder Hall power station as well as the new Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) and a vitrification plant for high level radioactive waste which was commissioned in 1991. UK NIREX is concentrating investigations there for a waste repository for low and intermediate level radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>Calder Hall was the world's first industrial-scale nuclear power station, commissioned in 1956 and consists of four major Magnox reactors.  These reactors are considered to be unsafe because of a number of problems such as a lack of ability to resist earthquakes, problems with the integrity of pressure circuits, reliability of their shut down system, cooling ability during and after a fire and the lack of secondary containment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> As the House is aware, the Government have been extremely concerned for some years about the Sellafield nuclear processing plant, particularly following an incident in November 1983 which resulted in widespread radioactive contamination of the adjacent beaches, the levels of which were later found by a UK court to have been totally unacceptable at that time.</P>
    <P>On 3 December 1986 when the now leader of the Labour Party was Tánaiste and Minister for Energy Dáil Éireann unanimously agreed the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned about the repeated accidents at, and continuing discharges from, the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and conscious of the dangerous threat it poses to the life and health of the Irish people and to the whole environment on this island, calls on the British Government to arrange for the immediate closure of this dangerous installation, and urges the European Communities to decide as a matter of priority the establishment of a nuclear inspection force.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Energy in 1989 I have continuously and at every opportunity open to me expressed the Government's concern about the Sellafield plant which continues to discharge radioactive wastes in the Irish Sea, although the quantities of such wastes have reduced considerably in recent years.  The Government are also concerned about the very large accumulation of highly radioactive waste at Sellafield, together with the transport of radioactive material to and from the plant because this exposes this country to significant risks.  The Government's view remains that the only way to resolve the concerns about Sellafield is to close the plant.  We have repeatedly conveyed this view to the UK Government.</P>
    <P>I have also personally conveyed our serious concerns about Sellafield to the former UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. John Wakeham, MP, and to the former Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. Michael Heseltine MP, who <Col N="1915" /> is now responsible for Industry and Trade in the UK including energy matters.</P>
    <P>I will first deal with the new reprocessing plant which is undoubtedly of great concern to Deputies and various environmental interests.  Currently only Magnox fuel is reprocessed at Sellafield. However, BNFL have now completed a massive new reprocessing complex called the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) which will reprocess light water reactor fuel from spent fuel rods from the UK and abroad and recover uranium and plutonium in the process. This plant is due to come into operation this year and is the largest single expansion at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, the EC Commission received notification and data from the UK Government concerning their plan to release radioactive effluents resulting from THORP's operation and set up a group of Commission experts to examine this general data.  The Commission's opinion, issued recently, was to the effect that radioactive discharges from the THORP plant is not liable, either in normal operation or in the case of an accident, to result in radioactive contamination significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) have examined the consequences for this country of the operation of THORP.  The assessment has been done on the basis of data supplied by British Nuclear Fuels regarding the quantities of liquid and gaseous radioactive effluents to be discharged from this plant.  The liquid effluent normally discharged to the Irish Sea from THORP will contain predominantly tritium, but also several other radionuclides including caesium, ruthenium and plutonium.  The institute estimate that these discharges will give rise to an annual radiation dose of about one microsievert to a heavy consumer of seafood caught off the east coast of Ireland.  This will add to the dose of 4.6 microsieverts received by the same consumer in 1990 due to the accumulated <Col N="1916" /> effect of discharges up to that time, as determined from the institute's analysis of fish caught in the Irish Sea in that year.</P>
    <P>The principal radionuclide in the gaseous discharges from THORP will be Krypton-85.  It is estimated that this discharge will, at the maximum output of the plant, give rise to an annual dose to a member of the public here of about 0.1 microsievert.  The dose arising from the gaseous discharges from all activities at Sellafield is estimated to be a few times this amount.</P>
    <P>The average annual dose received by a member of the Irish public from all sources of radiation is about 4,000 microsieverts. When THORP is in full operation therefore the total radiation dose which will be received by the most exposed member of the Irish public due to all routine discharges from Sellafield will still amount to no more than a fraction of 1 per cent of that received by a person in Ireland from all natural and artificial sources of radioactivity.</P>
    <P>An additional major concern to Ireland is of course the risk of an unplanned release of radioactivity due to a serious accident at Sellafield.  The institute have considered the possible consequences of the types of accident which one could reasonably visualise as happening to THORP, and which would result in discharges into the Irish Sea, or to the atmosphere, depending on the nature of the accident.</P>
    <P>From an accident giving rise to atmospheric discharges, the estimated highest dose to an adult living at the nearest point in Ireland to Sellafield, and eating only locally produced food, would be approximately 70 microsieverts.  The dose to a heavy consumer of seafood from an accident resulting in liquid discharges to the Irish Sea would be approximately 120 microsieverts.  These doses could be reduced if short term restrictions were placed on the consumption of certain foodstuffs.  For comparison, the dose received by an Irish adult due to the Chernobyl accident was estimated as being in the range 120-150 microsieverts.</P>
    <P>The institute's net conclusion is that, while all discharges of radioactivity from <Col N="1917" /> Sellafield are undesirable and therefore any increase in them is even more so, the additional radiation doses to a member of the Irish public from the THORP plant, either in normal operation or in certain foreseeable accident scenarios, will not be such as to cause a significantly increased risk to health.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless I and the Government would wish to see all discharges of radioactivity into the marine and aerial environment progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated.  I would also emphasise that the occurrence of an accident in THORP, or elsewhere at Sellafield, with consequences more serious than those considered above, cannot be ruled out, and remains a serious and legitimate concern for this country.</P>
    <P>The institute will be continuing the intensive programme of monitoring of the contamination levels in the Irish Sea which it has been conducting for a considerable number of years to determine the effects of radioactive discharges on the Irish marine environment.  The effects are quantified in some detail through their analyses of fish and shellfish collected at the principal fishing ports and of seaweeds, sediments and seawater from selected locations around the Irish coastline.  The present situation is that significant reductions in radioactive effluents from Sellafield occurred during the early eighties and since then there has been a further slow decline in contamination levels.  Radiation doses to typical consumers of fish are now as low as 0.1 per cent of the International Commission for Radiological Protection annual dose limits for members of the public from controllable sources of radiation.</P>
    <P>While the principal objective of our monitoring programme is to obtain an estimate of the radiation exposure of the Irish public, it also enables us to detect unrecorded discharges, examine trends and generally relate the quantities reported as having been discharged with the institute's monitoring results.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the institute's monitoring programme will enable the institute to detect and quantify the effects <Col N="1918" /> of liquid discharges from THORP following the commissioning of the plant. Any large increase in atmospheric radioactivity will be detected by the national network of continuous monitoring stations which the institute operates as part of the national radiological emergency plan.</P>
    <P>It remains, apart from the liquid and aerial discharges from THORP, a matter of major concern to the Government that the risks and dangers associated with Sellafield will be increased also because of the spent fuel stockpile accumulated from abroad mainly from Germany and Japan awaiting reprocessing, the resultant by-production of greater quantities of wastes and the attendant problems of hazardous cargoes to and from the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>On 12 June this year, following the British general election, I again wrote to Mr. Heseltine, now the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, including Energy, and to the Minister for Energy, Mr. Tim Eggar, expressing my concerns on these matters.  Indeed, I had previously expressed my concern to Mr. Eggar when I met him at an Energy Council meeting and informed him that I would be formally lodging the Government's view in regard to these matters with the new Minister, as I have done. My Department will be pursuing this matter in the context of our regular meetings with the UK authorities through the Irish/UK Contact Group.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the proposed waste repository at Sellafield.  The UK Government say they are satisfied that safe disposal in a deep facility can be developed in the UK for low and intermediate-level wastes.  They believe that on-site storage is an unacceptable long term option because in general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and the public and because decisions should not be left to future generations. The UK's Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive, called NIREX, was set up with the responsibility to provide and manage a new facility for the disposal of such waste. Investigations were undertaken by <Col N="1919" /> NIREX into various disposal options and sites.  In March 1989, the UK Government announced that they had accepted NIREX's recommendation that a site should be built in the form of a mine underground.  Detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes, were carried out in the vicinity of Sellafield and in Dounreay in Scotland.  Both sites of course cause a problem to us.</P>
    <P>In July 1991 when UK NIREX announced that it planned to concentrate its future investigations at Sellafield, I immediately arranged for officials of my Department to meet on that day to discuss the matter with their British counterparts in London.  On 14 August 1991, I wrote to the then Secretary of State for Energy reiterating the strong opposition of the Irish Government to the continued operation of Sellafield and expressed our deep dissatisfaction in relation to the repository.</P>
    <P>I am aware of recent articles in the press regarding reports that Sellafield may not be a suitable location for an underground repository.  The basis for such claims apparently arises from three reports entitled: UK NIREX Ltd's &ldquo;The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield March 1992 Interpretation&rdquo;, (Volumes 1 and 2); UK Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee's &ldquo;Response to UK NIREX Ltd's revised design for Sellafield Repository&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Review of the Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield&rdquo; by Environmental Resources Ltd. for Cumbria County Council.</P>
    <P>On hearing these claims, I sought and received copies of the different documents from the UK authorities and I have asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Geological Survey Office to examine them as a matter of urgency.  It would be premature to make any definitive statement on the recent media claims until the reports which are voluminous and very technical have been thoroughly examined by the experts in both institutions.</P>
    <P>In any case, I understand that a decision by NIREX regarding a possible <Col N="1920" /> planning application in relation to the proposal has now been deferred pending the safety aspects analyses.  Any proposals for a repository will be the subject of an independent public inquiry and NIREX will have to comply with the strict safety standards laid down and enforced by the authorising and regulatory bodies.  My Department will continue to monitor all further developments in relation to the site investigation, planning and design of any such proposed repository.</P>
    <P>Within the international fora Irish uneasiness about nuclear safety and our insistence on new control measures, notably at EC level, have been raised at every opportunity.  I raised the matter at the EC Energy Council in 1990 and 1991, when I said that my concerns were exacerbated by the absence of any move in the direction of independent verification and inspection of nuclear installations which I, and of course the present leader of the Labour Party when he was Minister for Energy, have been advocating under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty.  The Government believe that the European Community in particular has a vital role to play in the problems of safety and trans-boundary effects of UK nuclear installations.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have put our view on two separate occasions to the European Parliament.  Other Government Ministers and officials of my Department have pressed home the message on every possible occasion.  In response to Irish and other pressures so far, the Commission re-introduced in 1990, after a 20 year gap, inspection of radiation monitoring facilities under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty.  While this does not go as far as we would wish or had been asking for, it is nevertheless a step in the right direction so far as Ireland's policy in this area is concerned.</P>
    <P>There have been recent calls for legal action on the question of Sellafield.  The Government have always been and continue to be committed to legal action against Sellafield if a sufficient case for it can be shown to exist, but it cannot initiate such action without a firm legal <Col N="1921" /> case based on sufficient evidence.  Any such legal action would have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.  To find convincing evidence to establish a direct cause and effect link between the operation of the Sellafield plant and damage or injuries to people in Ireland may be very difficult. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that activities at the Sellafield plant are in breach of the relevant Euratom directives and regulations.  If there was, legal action could and would be considered by this Government.  In addition to the Euratom Treaty, options for legal action which have been considered include possible action pursuant to the EC Treaty, Directive 76/464/EC, on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged from land based sources into the aquatic environment of the Community, the Law of the Sea, the Paris Convention, the London Dumping Convention and action in the UK courts and in the International Court of Justice. These have all, however, been confronted by the same obstacle &mdash; the lack of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>Although Greenpeace provided copies of two separate legal options to my Department, neither of them on examination by the Attorney General's Office provided any hope that immediate legal action can be taken.  It is important to point out that the Greenpeace presentation related solely to legal procedural possibilities and they failed to put forward any possible case which could be supported by concrete facts or evidence. The Greenpeace presentation was examined in detail by the Attorney General and the legal advice made available to me is that recourse to the International Court of Justice would be unlikely because the court would lack jurisdiction without the consent of both parties and because of difficulties in determining issues arising prior to such consent.  Even if consent and jurisdiction obstacles were overcome there would have to be non-compliance by the UK with some international law or convention if it was to have any hope of succeeding in the court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> I had previously informed the House that I had arranged with Greenpeace for their legal adviser to meet with the Attorney General and officials of my Department to go over the whole question of the legal case that they said Ireland could take.  That meeting took place on 17 April 1991 and I have already informed the House about that.  The outcome of that discussion was that their case was not supported by facts or evidence.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Greenpeace presentation has been examined in detail and the legal advice available to me is that recourse to the international courts would be unlikely to succeed.  The UK Government would not be obliged to consent to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and that court would have no jurisdiction without the consent of both parties.  Secondly, the UK would be most unlikely to accord jurisdiction to the International Court over Sellafield by giving such consent.  It is clear from discussions I had with them that they would not do so.  Even if the International Court had such jurisdiction there would have to be non-compliance by the UK with some international law or some legal norm if the Government of Ireland were to succeed in the court and there is no available legal or evidential basis for establishing this at present.  There is no legal or factual basis on which it can be established at present that the UK are not complying with any relevant international convention.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Greenpeace held a press conference on 9 October 1991 even though they had the opportunity of this full discussion in April.  At the October press conference they again presented legal procedural options and these were identical to those presented to my Department in April.  The Government are determined to pursue all means available against Sellafield, including legal means, but it is vital that the legal case is sufficiently strong to succeed.  The Government are open to information and evidence from any source for a sustainable case regarding closure of Sellafield. They are not however prepared to <Col N="1923" /> proceed to legal action without such a sustainable case or purely for the embarrassment factor involved.  One could not ask one sovereign state to take a case against another sovereign state purely to cause the other some embarrassment. Ireland would lose its integrity if it were to take such actions in the international arena.</P>
    <P>I am not the only person who has occupied this responsible post as Minister for Energy.  Members of the other parties in this House have been in this position in recent years since the Sellafield threat and concern arose.  A lot of what was said in the 1986 debate could be said here. The Members of the other parties in Government could not succeed in establishing any grounds upon which they would have advised the Government at that time to take a case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here to answer with regard to the Government's view in regard to these matters.  I am being as careful and as helpful as I can be.  I was just pointing out that others have held this position and have been faced with the same difficulties with which I have been faced in trying to make some real progress in this matter.  One must bear in mind that quite a number of our colleagues in the European Community, under which Euratom operates, are pro nuclear and use nuclear energy for their power stations and, unfortunately, they are not at all amenable to support the case Ireland has been making with regard to European wide action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has taken a very active part in the work of the Paris Commission in relation to discharges from nuclear installations <Col N="1924" /> into the Irish Sea.  In 1991 Ireland succeeded in having a recommendation adopted which requires parties to the Paris Convention, under which the commission operates, to report periodically on their use of best available technology to minimise and, as appropriate, eliminate pollution caused by radioactive discharges. I am satisfied that this reporting discipline will make a useful contribution to ensuring that discharges from Sellafield will be as low as possible as long as the plant is in operation.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that on 13 May 1992 there was a reported discovery on the sea shore at Sellafield in Cumbria of vegetation with increased levels of radioactive contamination.  At the time, it was confirmed to the RPII that British Nuclear Fuels had not any satisfactory explanation as to how the levels of contamination found in the vegetation had come about.  On 21 May 1992, the RPII told me that the levels of radioactivity found in the marine organisms at Sellafield had not been found in Ireland.  A beach scan undertaken in Dublin Bay showed that the levels of radioactivity measured were in line with levels previously found in the Irish marine environment over the past few years.  The RPII assured me that no abnormal levels of contamination were discovered. However, the occurrence of yet another incident of unexpected contamination of the Cumbrian coastline of the Irish Sea from operations in Sellafield has to be a cause for concern.  It was a cause of additional unease to me that, in spite of claims by British Nuclear Fuels of increased openness regarding incidents at Sellafield, this occurrence only became publicly known through an apparent leak to the media two months after it was first discovered.  The matter of non-notification of this incident to my Department and the circumstances of the incident have been raised with the British authorities and I am awaiting a definitive reply to my request.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances that the Sellafield plant and nuclear facilities in the UK and elsewhere continue in existence it is vital that all possible measures are taken to <Col N="1925" /> protect the Irish public.  The unsatisfactory situation in relation to many nuclear installations in central and eastern Europe gives rise to continuing concern apart from the facilities in the UK.</P>
    <P>Last year the Radiological Protection Institute was established following enactment of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.  This Act gave the institute new and expanded functions in relation to radiological protection of the public. Over the past few years the level of staffing and equipment and instrumentation in the institute has been substantially increased.  The institute is now in a position to have in place a radioactive monitoring programme which will pick up any significant increases in radioactivity.</P>
    <P>Three international Conventions which are relevant to the field of nuclear safety and radiological protection were ratified following enactment of the Radiological Protection Act.  First of all there was the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.  This Convention establishes standard protection measures, including notification procedures, escorts and surveillance to be applied to nuclear materials used for peaceful purposes in relation to their import, export and transit.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there was the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident. That Convention puts in place a formal regime for notification of accidents at civil nuclear facilities.  A state in which a nuclear accident occurs is obliged to notify other states likely to be affected by releases of radioactive material and provide them with other relevant information.</P>
    <P>The third of these Conventions is the Convention on Assistance in the case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency.  Under the Convention a state party may seek assistance in the event of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency in the form of personnel, equipment or materials from any other state party or from the International Atomic Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>These Conventions and their ratification by Ireland are positive developments in relation to our emergency <Col N="1926" /> preparedness and response to any radiological emergency.</P>
    <P>The Government have approved an emergency plan for the protection of the population in the event of an accident involving release of radioactivity to the environment.  The plan involves rapid and co-ordinated response measures from national authorities and procedures for the dissemination of information to the general public.  It has been designed with sufficient flexibility to respond to the range of nuclear accidents which might occur.  A booklet on the emergency plan is at the moment with the printers and it will be published in the coming weeks.  I hope it will be widely disseminated.  The plan and all its components are subject to periodic tests of their effectiveness.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the dangers to health from nuclear <Col N="1927" /> emissions.  Obviously, I have not enough time to cover this topic but one of my colleagues who will speak after me will deal with this matter in greater detail because it is important that the public should have accurate information rather than statements based on assumptions, inadequate research or incomplete investigation. It is important that the situation as it affects the health of people in County Louth be properly understood.  Studies have found that the annual incidence rate of acute lymphoid leukaemia in children in this country was within the range of rates found in children in other western populations.  The same applies in a number of other areas examined, but my colleague will go into that in greater detail.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am aware that the nuclear industry in Britain has an immense annual advertising and PR budget of several millions which has been spent in putting an acceptable face on the nuclear production and waste business.  I can assure the House that this Government, on the other hand, will continue to press the other side of the picture: the radioactive discharges and emissions into the environment, the continuing risk of accidents at the plant, the increasing waste management problem and the dangerous international traffic in nuclear waste.  Chernobyl demonstrated the transboundary nature of nuclear accidents and the need for countries with nuclear power programmes to take account of the legitimate concerns of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I will repeat that the only way to resolve concerns about Sellafield is to close the plant.  The Government have so far done all that they can do at this stage, but I can assure the House that future efforts will be intensified.</P>

      <P>It was an interesting development that the Minister refused to answer for the Taoiseach.  While we are all very anxious for a detailed reply, it is quite appropriate that he should refuse to answer for the actions of the Taoiseach.  I would be very pleased if our questions were accepted by the Taoiseach and that he should answer the very serious questions raised by Greenpeace to which we have had no adequate response to date. I am not surprised at the Minister's action because I notice the Taoiseach taking the Minister to task indirectly in the national newspapers about his success in the energy conservation area and how he was going to be monitoring this area very carefully.  I think we are seeing another interesting strain or stress in the Coalition Government &mdash; not that we would want to make too much of that, although we note it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the Labour Party motion on Sellafield.  I cannot accept the amendment tabled by the Minister.  Approximately one year to 18 months ago Fine Gael identified and specifically stated that the Government had thrown in the towel on the question of hazardous emissions from the British nuclear fuel industry, and from Sellafield in particular, at a time when Ireland's persuasive case was gaining ground internationally. By contrast, Fine Gael seek to make Ireland an international pioneer for protection of the public and the environment from nuclear hazards.  We believe we are well placed to do this and this role should be actively pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant fact to emerge from the Greenpeace intervention this month is that the rhetoric of the Irish Government is so much at odds with their actions.  Even tonight there is a difficulty in coming to terms with whether the plant should be closed or whether it is perfectly safe and is doing no damage to us.  We <Col N="1929" /> cannot take an incoherent approach forever. We will have to come down on one side or the other, as we cannot continue to have a foot on either side of the fence. Greenpeace recently highlighted these glaring inconsistencies.  They highlighted &mdash; Deputy Howlin dealt with this &mdash; the signing of a major loan for the nuclear reprocessing industry, which included Sellafield, at a time when the Government were claiming at home they were doing all they could to close down Sellafield.  A unanimous decision was required in order that Sellafield, one of only two such reprocessing plants worldwide, would get a loan.  The Minister should respond to the questions this raises.</P>
    <P>There were also other allegations that the Government and Ministers failed to object at EC level when increased emission levels were agreed resulting from the commissioning of THORP, the new expansion phase of reprocessing at Sellafield. The Minister outlined the evidence from the international experts and from the Radiological Protection Institute here which supports the fact that the levels of emission are not significant. However, he went on to admit that any increase in emission levels is significant. More importantly, he failed to deal with the proposed increase in Krypton emissions &mdash; it is acknowledged that they have direct consequences on the incidence of cancer &mdash; although the original proposal to eliminate Krypton emissions by the installation of extra measures in the plant was subsequently dropped.  We made no protest when this was dropped and we did not ensure that this improvement in the design was not at least retained.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear that Greenpeace and the other organisations involved give great credit to the Department of Energy and to the officials who are travelling on a regular basis to the various European institutions concerned with the nuclear industry.  They have been to the fore in achieving improvements in international conventions, some of which have been mentioned already by the Minister.  Significant improvements have been made and public credit is given for them. <Col N="1930" /> However, continuing questions are raised on how we are effectively monitoring and supervising the operations of nuclear plants.  It must be asked whether we are availing of all the avenues currently open to us in EC and international law to monitor the enormous conglomerate of nuclear activity in Sellafield, which is expanding at an extraordinary rate.</P>
    <P>It is of deep concern to the Fine Gael Party that the existing arrangements between the British and Irish authorities on monitoring and information are not being honoured.  Indeed, the Minister acknowledged, when corresponding with me, his own concern in this area, which was similar to what he read into the Official Report today.  I raised the matter of the contamination of vegetation on the Cumbrian coast on the Adjournment and he stated in reply that the Sellafield authorities had failed to notify the Irish Department of Energy of the contamination on the coast, although they had known of this for months.  The Minister confirms that this continues to be the case up to the night, that no adequate explanation of this failure has been given. How can we feel more secure in the context of the Minister's reference tonight to a new convention on the notification of incidents?</P>
    <P>Would an incident of any such scale be appropriate or qualify under the obligations that exist, either formally or informally, and would it be covered clearly under the new convention?  What comeback would we have in the event of a failure of reporting?  That aspect is most disturbing.  To an extent the British nuclear industry have been attempting to clean up their act a little, at least on the surface, and have been talking about an open-door policy.  However, I wonder whether such an incident could occur again.  As the Minister has admitted, there is a question of whether the incident would ever have been made known had it not come to the knowledge of the news media.  That development undermines any confidence one might have of a change in approach and a recognition of the seriousness of the issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> I should like to come back to an area that I consider has not been made completely clear.  Environmental groups have questioned whether all existing EC and international machinery is being adequately exhausted to ensure maximum accountability, monitoring and standards of the British nuclear industry, and Sellafield in particular.  We in Fine Gael believe that a Green Paper covering the legal case and the available options should be prepared.  The Minister has talked about the lack of a legal case. On the basis of the existing damage and the historical damage done to the Irish Sea, the increased risk of danger from accidents, which even the EC has acknowledged will arise as a result of the operation of THORP, and the passage of an alarming increase in emission levels recently, the Commission specifically advised the Irish Government and the British authorities to prepare a joint emergency plan to cover the greater possibility of accidents arising from the increased transportation of materials to be reprocessed through the Irish Sea and over land &mdash; more particularly for us, through the Irish Sea.  The Minister made no reference to that in his contribution tonight.  I should like him to fill in that gap and to refer to the publication of our own emergency plan and the publication of information to the public.  I should like him to advise us what initial steps have been taken in relation to this specific activity apart from the meeting with his counterpart that he referred to.  What are the current routes for materials to be reprocessed at Sellafield that come from power stations in the UK, Europe and Japan?  For those who might not have thought this issue out &mdash; and quite often people do not think it out unless they come to examine it clearly &mdash; it is important to write into the record that since 1965, 4,000 tonnes of waste fuel has been imported into the UK.  My figures come from details put together by Greenpeace in their latest pack for public representatives and the news media.  It is interesting that the fuels from Germany, Holland, Italy and Switzerland come to <Col N="1932" /> Dover on an ordinary roll-on/roll-off ferry with other hazardous cargo.  Most other waste fuel shipments cross the Irish Sea to go into Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria. The opening of the THORP plant will lead to a huge increase in the number of such shipments transported across the sea, most of them, it is expected, coming from Japan.  Along with the only other reprocessing plant, which is situated on the northern French coast, Sellafield will take the bulk of the increase.  There will be a huge increase in movement and, as a result, an increased danger of accidents. Certainly, preparation should be taken to provide for the possibility of an accident.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin dealt with the legal avenues open to the Minister.  I have been in the Chamber at Question Time and heard the Minister go through this aspect. To be fair to him, he has acknowledged that those channels are available but he has said that what has been missing is a substantial case to take through one of those channels.  I believe that there is a case.  The Minister is right in saying that a suggestion that Sellafield should be closed on the basis of current emission levels &mdash; given that the international experts are saying what they are saying &mdash; would be laughed out of court. However, I consider that there is a case in relation to the existing damage and the historical damage done to the Irish Sea. In the Irish Sea there are substances that will have thousands of years' life which are directly related to reprocessing and could not come from any other activity &mdash; they could not have come from the fall-out from Chernobyl or from the fallout from testing.  Substances such as caesium are directly confined to the activity of reprocessing.</P>
    <P>Other countries have taken successful actions through international courts and under the European Commission rules. The adjoining provinces of France and Germany were successful in having an operation taken out of the hands of the relevant local government and put into the hands of the European Commission after proving sufficient cause for concern. There is also the possibility of perhaps indirectly bringing about the closure of <Col N="1933" /> Sellafield by way of an international fine for the damage done to the Irish Sea. Those moneys could be used to further our own case against the expansion of a nuclear industry; to pay for the significant cost of monitoring and so on; and perhaps to pay for one of the things that would help us make our case &mdash; a national cancer register.  Because we do not have a national cancer register it is extremely difficult for us to analyse the effect of emissions on the health of our people. We are seriously remiss in not having established such a register a long time ago and having it up and running.  It is my contention that we could take a case along those lines &mdash; the case might not be all that we wanted and it might not achieve all that we wanted but it would certainly put a stopper in the way and would be an indication of our seriousness and our determination to have acknowledged the serious damage done to a non-nuclear country, Ireland, by the historic and current effects of emissions from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>For some time we in Fine Gael have been concerned about the change in the Government's tune and the change in the Minister's tune.  The Government's attitude is a history of defeat and a history of faltering which contrasts enormously with the rhetoric of the 1986 debate &mdash; and again that word keeps returning, there is a marked contrast between rhetoric and reality.  In the 1986 debate the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, was unbelievable.  His comments on that occasion were comparable with those of Deputy Higgins, who is hard to beat when he is in full flight.  The Minister himself, who was going to be the &ldquo;devil and all&rdquo; before taking his portfolio, was giving up within a very short time and was saying that that was not possible.  He had stopped raising the issue in all of the fora.</P>

      <P>The Minister raised the issue of the European inspectorate.  As early as April 1990 Deputy Richard Bruton pointed out that the Minister, having received notice of major new contracts, had not raised those contracts at any of the regular EC Energy Ministers' meetings in the intervening ten months. The Paris Commission of July 1990 was the first occasion on which we failed to press our case for the closure of Sellafield. The Minister said that he would press the case for the inspectorate.  All along there was evidence of a watering down and a softening of position.</P>
      <P>Some of the rhetoric of Deputy Higgins in the debate was not helpful.  I do accept that the Minister is operating at European level within a club of atomic powered nations whose objectives are very different from our own.  That is a very difficult environment in which to succeed in making our case.  However, that is not an excuse for a complete failure in pressing our case to the kind of conclusion sought by this motion and that Fine Gael continue to believe is possible within the limits I have outlined.</P>

      <P>Before progress was reported Deputies Gilmore, Sherlock and Mitchell reinforced their arguments in favour of this amendment.  Deputy Gilmore accused me of being less than interested in this matter.  I wish to reiterate what I said on Second Stage, that I was not interested in understating the extent of the real housing needs.  I was not denying these had increased in the past couple of years.  I spelled out what the latest assessment had shown in relation to the number of households on the approved lists at present.  I indicated also that 6,700 households on the approved housing lists were one person households and another 2,800 were couples without children.  I told the housing committee of Dublin County Council &mdash; Deputy Gilmore seemed not to appreciate this &mdash; that it was very important to house homeless people and that it was part of the local authorities' responsibility.  There seems to have been an implication tonight, as on the last occasion I met that committee, that no progress was made, when 100 or more were placed in housing accommodation by the local authority.  That is a welcome development.  We encourage that and we want to see more of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking up office a few months ago I obtained Government approval for this Bill.  I am now trying to ensure this legislation is passed so that local authorities <Col N="1936" /> can make a great effort to deal with the housing problem.  The range of options open to local authorities this year will enable them to provide 7,000 households between casual vacancies, new house accommodation, the work in lieu of local authority housing involving extensions and the tremendous developments that are taking place in the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>I listened on a number of occasions to Deputies referring only to the house building programme.  While that is very important and will remain so in the future, it is just one element of how we are trying to deal with this problem.  It will mean local authorities will rehouse under one or other of these schemes more than 2,000 more than was possible last year.  By any stretch of the imagination that is a substantial improvement and that is the way we want to keep it going. We need to put that momentum behind the passage of this Bill and how its provisions are implemented by local authorities.</P>
    <P>There was approval last year for 1,300 new house starts.  Local authorities completed 1,180 new starts, leaving a short-fall. Since my appointment I have visited a number of local authorities, met the housing committees and asked them to come up with new, more imaginative schemes.  I said I was not interested in the big peripheral schemes on the outskirts of towns without the amenities.  I met broad acceptance for that kind of thinking and I know it is supported in this House.  I also made it my business to check out the current position.  Allowing for the starts which were not commenced last year, and the approval for first starts this year, almost 1,500 new starts are available to local authorities but fewer than 300 have commenced.  At planning and tender stage there are a further 584.</P>
    <P>It is very important in the range of options we have that we ensure as public representatives that the response is better than that.  We need to address such areas particularly with reference to local elected members who seem to be concentrating on the national Exchequer with the Department of the Environment <Col N="1937" /> being the trustee of taxpayers, for more resources.  They do not look to the implementation of a social housing plan or, indeed, the other areas of development which need to take place.  I will look for the maximum resources within the context of national financial constraints. As Minister for the Environment I will fight every inch of the way to get an increase in those resources.  I have some plans to deliver on that.  I want more progress in meeting the needs of those on local authority lists for rehousing.</P>
    <P>We all agree on the broad aspirations enshrined in the policy statement but, as I said earlier, it is a policy statement which is not suitable for inclusion in fundamental legislation.  For that reason I disagree with its inclusion in the Bill. However, the non-inclusion of this amendment does not affect my desire and commitment to reaching the kind of targets possible, indeed the most <Col N="1938" /> ambitious ones possible, but there are constraints and circumstances over which we do not have control.  I want people to apply their minds to control because, while you may aspire to certain objectives and decide certain figures, in the final analysis the matter will require real effort by the local authorities.  They will need new ideas on how to solve these problems in the future and the passage of this Bill is one part of that.</P>

    <P>Question proposed &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.'</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with shared ownership leases which represents the flagship in relation to the Government's approach to social housing.  In particular I would like to draw the attention of the House to the ultimate cost of purchasing a house under the shared ownership scheme.  The section provides for a shared ownership lease covering a period of between 20 years and 100 years and for a payment of between 25 per cent and 75 per cent of the market value of the house.  The normal shared ownership lease provides for a payment of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>Let us assume that a person enters into a shared ownership lease for 25 years initially and that the price of the house is £40,000.  During the first 25 years the applicant will have two payments to make.  First, he will have to make a repayment on the loan of £20,000 to purchase his half of the house and, second, he will have to pay rent on the portion owned by the local authority.  At the end of the 25-year period he will have to set about purchasing the second half of the house.</P>
      <P>I have seen the figures which have been produced by Dún Laoghaire Corporation for applicants under the shared ownership scheme and they assume that the cost of the house is £40,000.  There are not too many of those in Dún Laoghaire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if one could find one one would have to take out a £20,000 loan for a period of 25 years while the remaining £20,000 which would be updated, would have to be paid during the second period of 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cost involved is enormous. We are talking here about people with an annual income of £12,000 or less. First, they are facing a weekly mortgage repayment of £45.28 for 25 years and a rental payment of £19.45 in the first year. If we assume that rents will increase at the rate of inflation by year 25 the weekly rental payment will have reached £50 approximately.  Second, they are facing <Col N="1941" /> repayment on the other half of the house at the end of the 25-year period. Assuming a 3 per cent rate of inflation the £20,000 will have become £41,875 by the year 2005, or £67,727 if the rate of inflation runs at 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The total cost involved for somebody, first of all, in the rent they will pay the local authority will be £42,000 over the 25 years. Then they will pay £58,000 in mortgage repayments.  In other words, they will have paid £100,000 by the time the 25 years will have elapsed, at which stage, having paid £100,000 they will own half a house only.  They must then proceed to buy the second half of the house.  The repayments on the remaining £52,000 over the following 25 years &mdash; on the normal assumptions about rates of interest and so on &mdash; will be another £150,000.  This means that somebody in receipt of an income of less than £12,000, buying a house under the shared ownership scheme in 1992, is facing into paying £250,000 over a 50-year period, that is, of course, assuming that they are still around for the 50 years to pay that amount of money.</P>
    <P>I accept fully your ruling on the matter, a Cheann Comhairle, but I had attempted to introduce a number of amendments to try to remedy that position. There are two things to which the Minister should give consideration.  First, the amount of money that should be required to be paid after the end of the 25 years should be the £20,000; in other words, I do not think that capital sum should escalate.  Second, credit should be given to a purchaser for the rent they will have paid over the 25-year period to the local authority.</P>
    <P>There are many attractions in the shared ownership scheme.  The idea in principle is a good one, enabling people to purchase their houses.  But it is just too much for many potential applicants whose income will be less than £12,000 in the first place to have to face into what will amount to a 50-year indebtedness and repayments which, in total, will run to the order of £250,000.  I would ask the Minister to address the amount that will <Col N="1942" /> ultimately have to be paid, and, second, to devise some way of crediting the rental income paid to local authorities against the final sum that must be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need to overstate the case about defects in the proposals in this and the next two sections.  As Deputy Gilmore has said, we on the Opposition benches have, by various methods, endeavoured to amend the provisions to render them more sensible and viable, but because, by implication, they would involve a charge on the Exchequer, our amendments have been ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>The arguments advanced by Deputy Gilmore are defective to this extent only, that anyone who mortgages a property almost always repays over the repayment period, whether that be 20, 25 or 30 years, a much greater nominal sum than was borrowed originally.  To that extent Deputy Gilmore's arguments rob the case of its real contention, that is, that the people at whom the shared ownership scheme is aimed, are, by definition people who can afford to buy only half a house and cannot afford to buy a whole house.  Yet, under the proposal before us, such people will be required to buy the whole house over a very prolonged period of time; in other words, they will take out a mortgage over the normal period of 20 to 30 years.  Then they will be expected to take out another mortgage on the second half of that house, in the meantime having paid rent on the second half without any allowance being made for it.  This means they are doubly penalised. First, they can obtain mortgage interest relief only on the half they are buying.  Second, if a spouse dies during the repayment period, the mortgage protection policy will cover only half the house and the surviving spouse will be left with the other half of the house and those payments to be made.  Third, such people are placed at a complete disadvantage compared with tenants who become tenant purchasers because no discount is provided in respect of the rent paid.  Those are some of the defects in the proposal before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> Deputy Gilmore was right in saying that the type of payments we are asking people to pay each month to buy half a house are extraordinary when one takes into account that, by definition, these will be people who cannot afford to buy a whole house, people who are less well off.  Deputy Gilmore mentioned a figure of £60 or £67; certainly between repayments and rent they will be meeting minimum payments in excess of £50 per week. We must remember that these are people who are less well off, who cannot afford to buy a whole house.  The Minister should reflect on this point.</P>
    <P>I suspect that a number of people, not a great many will become involved in this proposal.  For example, I know that in Dublin Corporation's Loans and Grants Section, officials, while not saying so specifically in the advice and interviews they are giving, are drawing people's attention to the drawbacks of this scheme, rightly so, because the same officials saw the difficulties of the low rise mortgage scheme some years ago which was addressed to the same market.  I know it would mean more cost to the Exchequer but our proposal would mean a more effective housing policy without &ldquo;up front&rdquo; cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>These are things the Minister should consider.  First he should consider providing that, in the case of the death of one spouse during the repayment period of the mortgage on one half of the house, some form of insurance would be provided to cover the whole cost of the house.  A widow, by definition, a poor person, without her husband and his salary, cannot continue to bear the brunt of repayments.  Second, the Minister should make provision for building into the rented half of the house the same concessions as were available to tenant purchasers under the 1988 tenant purchase scheme.  This would mean that, when so many years would have elapsed, a tenant would receive an annual discount of 3 per cent in addition to whatever other capital grants were available so as to enable people to purchase their homes.  There was a third provision I had <Col N="1944" /> in mind, which, for the moment, I have forgotten, but this scheme could be made much more workable and successful.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will be reluctant to make it too attractive.  By that I mean he will not want to push into this market people who, at a stretch, can really afford to buy a whole house of their own; I understand that.  At the same time, if those who are working but in receipt of low pay are to be assisted as is the intention under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; and basically the idea is good &mdash; amendments along the lines suggested by myself and other Deputies which have been ruled out of order, along with the suggestions made in the House this evening, should be reconsidered by the Minister, in whole or in part, or in some refined manner, for Report Stage, as they would greatly improve this shared purchase scheme.  Otherwise the description I gave this Bill, when first published, will stand, that it is half a housing policy and incomplete. It is a good idea in so far as it goes but it does not go far enough.  It would be a good day's work were the Minister to accept our suggestions.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I gave an example similar to Deputy Gilmore's of a problem I see in shared ownership.  The time lag between buying one half of the house and then some years later buying the other means that one is really putting back a very heavy burden for later years.  People are attracted to this scheme because the local authorities cannot provide them with housing.  We now know why the Minister refused to give us a date for a local authority purchase scheme.  If we saw a purchase scheme running in parallel with this shared ownership scheme the difference in the purchase price of a house as between each of the schemes would be obvious.  Under a previous purchase scheme, instead of buying half a house as under this scheme, one bought a whole house for half the price.  That was much more attractive and I do not blame the Minister for changing that.</P>
    <P>In the coming year 14 houses will be built by Wicklow County Council.  That means that of the 772 people on the housing list there, the vast majority &mdash; 90 per <Col N="1945" /> cent and more &mdash; will have no hope of being housed this year, next year or the year after.  Therefore, they have to look at what is available, and shared ownership is what is available.  This is being offered as an alternative to local authorities providing houses for people on their lists.</P>
    <P>It will all be looked at from the point of view of what people can afford out of the limited amount they have even on the maximum income.  I assume they will look at the longest term for which they can get a loan or lease.  Under this it is between 20 and 100 years.  The deciding factor will be what a person will have to pay out every week to get a house.  If these people get into trouble, will they be able to apply to a health board for a mortgage subsidy?  That may be a solution, but it is all State money and we are really going around in circles taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another.  Will the Minister explain that to us?  The weakness in the scheme is that it is in competition with the local authority purchase scheme.  It would certainly be shown up if it were similar to the last purchase scheme.  The Minister should come clean on this and say what advantages, if any, there are in being housed this way as against expecting the local authority to provide a house and waiting around for a purchase scheme under which one can buy the house for half price.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take away from Deputy Mitchell's cause of pleasant, wholesome housing.  Nevertheless, I want to make some brief comments on this important section.  As chairman of the housing committee of <Col N="1946" /> Dublin Corporation I have grave reservations about this scheme.  It will get off the ground and there are people who are anxious to avail of it although the more they learn of the implications of it the more slowly they turn towards it. Officials of Dublin Corporation have gone to great lengths to explain to intending applicants the figures involved because they are extremely concerned not to find themselves, four or five years down the road, involved in repossessions on behalf of the Minister due to people defaulting under the scheme with the resultant problem of reselling the houses and then rehousing the people concerned. What will happen is that in five, ten or 15 years the scheme will collapse and we will simply be writing off losses.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that in a section dealing with a national scheme one cannot look for particularity.  However, because of the way it is operated it exercises a very invidious discrimination against Dublin and, perhaps, other areas.  That discrimination turns on house prices.  The Minister is talking to people who are earning £12,000 per annum or under. Dublin Corporation estimate that almost 80 per cent of the people on their housing lists at whom this scheme is specifically aimed are on social welfare.  Social welfare is a national standard of living but house prices do not have the same uniformity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by Dublin Corporation officials who attended the major housing conference in Kilkenny that some local authorities who are using this scheme are accommodating people whose entire income consists of social welfare.  It is great if that is happening and people who would otherwise have little prospect of ever getting a house are getting a roof over their heads.  However, because house prices in the city of Dublin are twice if not three times the price of a comparable house in Kilkenny or elsewhere the scheme cannot work.  No one in Dublin on social welfare will qualify under the standards set by our officials trying to implement this scheme.  In that context there is an invidious discrimination and the Minister must try to <Col N="1947" /> devise some way to make this operable in the city and, most specifically, to make it universally fair so that people throughout the country will have an equal opportunity to avail of it.  The question of the price of property is central.  I do not know how the Minister can address it; I have no particular suggestion.  As it is a national scheme I did not propose an amendment. However, I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me make the point.  It is an urgent problem that requires a response from the Minister if not by way of amendment on Report Stage certainly by some indication that the scheme can be amended to deal with the problem we have in Dublin.  I understand from Deputy Durkan that this problem exists in the peripheral areas of Kildare and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The shared ownership scheme and the scheme for voluntary organisations were the two keystones of the so-called social housing policy.  These schemes are shams and should be seen as such.  This scheme exploits people who, because of the long waiting lists in all local authority areas, are unable to get housing.  They are now being offered a doubtful scheme which I believe will be a millstone around the necks of many people in the years ahead.  Deputy Mitchell and other speakers referred to the rent element of the scheme which they believe will increase over the years. The proposal put forward by my party that the rent element should be confined <Col N="1948" /> to 25 per cent of the mortgage repayments should be taken on board by the Minister.  This would give some semblance of hope to housing applicants.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McCartan said, people on social welfare are in a very awkward position.  Statistics show that nearly 80 per cent of housing applicants on the waiting list in Cork city are social welfare recipients.  This scheme offers very little hope to these people.  Recently a young couple who both worked in the same electronics company in Cork had the sanction for their loan withdrawn after they both lost their jobs; because they were on social welfare, they were deemed to have an inadequate income.  Where will these people end up?  They will go on the waiting list and will have to wait for four or five years to get a house. Worse still, they may have to emigrate.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mitchell said, there are defects in the scheme &mdash; for example, the mortgage protection element.  I should like the Minister to outline what happens in cases of marital breakdown.  If a couple want to split their joint assets, where do they stand in regard to their liabilities?  I do not think this issue has been thought out and I should like to hear the Minister's views on it.  As I said, this scheme cannot rectify our serious housing crisis. In fact, it exploits the hopes of people in a very cruel way; they will end up in a much worse position than they are at present.  I advise people who visit my clinics to think twice about taking up the scheme.  Unfortunately, most of these people have no other option.  It may be a harsh thing to say, but at times this scheme reminds me of the loans given by loan sharks.  People who borrow from loan sharks have to make inflated repayments. This scheme does essentially the same thing: people are offered a house and the rent may subsequently go through the roof, so to speak, in years to come.  I believe we will all live to regret it if the Minister's proposal is given the go ahead by this House.  I ask the Minister to re-examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members who have spoken have shown their clear under- <Col N="1949" /> standing of the rudiments of the workings of the loan system operated by local authorities. I believe all of them have practical experience of this.  My local authority studied and tried to operate the shared ownership scheme.  I have to say that there are many flaws in this scheme.  I hope the Minister recognises these flaws. The points made by Deputy Gilmore, Deputy McCartan, Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Allen have been well made and should be taken on board by the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is accepted &mdash; Deputy Mitchell alluded to this &mdash; that a person who repays a mortgage over 30 years or longer can expect to pay something like four times the original capital cost of the house.  However, under this scheme people will pay about six times the original cost of the house.  In fact, they do not have any guarantee that it will only be six times the original cost.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the second part of the equity is likely to be assessed on the basis of its value at the time of purchase, which could be in 20 or 25 years' time. This is a dangerous way to proceed. Unfortunately, the people involved are the sector of the community whom we are all allegedly trying to help.  What this scheme will do is extract more money from them and penalise them in an unbelievable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme allegedly helps people with incomes of £12,000 or less.  If one spouse has an income of £11,000 and the other has an income of £4,000 or £5,000 they do not qualify as their income limit drops to £10,000.  I have discussed this issue with officials of the Department over the past few months, as I am sure everyone here has done.  I cannot understand why a husband and wife whose combined income is £12,000 are ineligible and why the ceiling is automatically reduced to £10,000.  In order to qualify they can only earn £5,000 each.  I cannot for the life of me understand how a couple with a joint income of £10,000 can be expected to buy the second part of their equity within a reasonable time.  If the wife becomes pregnant and decides to stay at home her husband will not be able to buy out the other half of the <Col N="1950" /> equity, let alone buy the first half of it.  I hope the Minister will increase the income limit to £12,000 without any restrictions.  Indeed, it should be raised to £14,000 in order to give those people a reasonable chance of repaying their loans.</P>
    <P>Consideration should also be given to the size of the family.  I cannot understand why a husband and wife with one child are assessed on the same basis as a husband and wife with five or six children. It does not require a great deal of imagination to recognise that a husband and wife with five or six children &mdash; these families are few and far between nowadays, but there are some &mdash; need a higher income in order to repay their loan and have a reasonable standard of living than a husband and wife with one child.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a final point.  This issue was raised by Deputy Gregory in the House last week.  I do not think the social housing policy was ever meant to replace previous housing legislation: it was meant to supplement it but not replace it.  If the Minister thinks that the social housing policy enunciated in this House over a year ago is going to resolve our housing crisis then I am afraid he is going to be seriously disappointed.  There is no way in which it will resolve the present problems. In 1985 approximately 450 loans were processed by Kildare County Council for people on low incomes.  Last year only 48 loans were processed.  This year the figure will probably be 60 or 65. In 1985 there were approximately 200 people on the housing waiting list.  The number was being reduced all the time by schemes such as the HFA scheme etc. There is little possibility of reducing the waiting list at present.  The maximum income limit for annuity loans, income related loans or convertible loans is £25,000.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy McCartan, not many houses can be bought in urban areas within 50 miles of Dublin for that amount of money.  It is ridiculous to expect people to go into the marketplace and buy houses unless they receive a supplementary loan from a bank, a building <Col N="1951" /> society or elsewhere.  If they are eligible for such a loan they should not be on the housing list and should not be allowed participate in this loan scheme.  The danger is that they will be forced into getting a supplementary loan from a bank or a loan shark.  In those circumstances the real problem will begin four or five years down the road because the loan shark or lending institution who advanced the loan will demand their repayments regardless of the circumstances. Where will the husband and wife who started off with £5,000 each and only one of whom is now working find the money to repay the loan?  They will have no chance of doing so.</P>
    <P>I overheard a person speak recently about this scheme, and the comments were not very charitable.  The conclusion was that the scheme was thought up cynically, in a manner which would make it virtually impossible for some people to qualify and those who did qualify would find it impossible to repay the money.  I cannot understand the logic behind such a scheme at a time when there are more people on housing lists than at any time in the past 20 years.  I implore the Minister not to reject all the suggestions made on this side of the House on the basis of political criticism.  He should recognise that these people have first hand experience of dealing with applicants on a regular basis and not just for a period of just three or four months.  I would ask the Minister to have due regard to the points raised.  If he does not address them in this Bill, or by way of regulations, the whole system will flounder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start with a word of caution to the Minister.  If he thinks he will make his reputation as Minister for the Environment solving the housing problems by this scheme he had better think again.  He should find some other method of making his reputation and leaving a lasting mark in the Department of the Environment.  When this scheme was announced with the greatest of fanfare, Prone-speak and PR that could be mustered by the former Minister, Deputy <Col N="1952" /> Flynn, it was supposed to be the be all and end all of all our housing problems. It was interesting that the Minister launched the scheme on Valentine's Day, a rather cynical exercise considering that St. Valentine is the saint of love, caring and cherishing.  The shared ownership scheme seems to be a good scheme but there are many difficulties with it, some of which have been raised by my colleagues. I would like to tease out some more points.</P>
      <P>As regards the whole question of rent, the explanatory memorandum issued by the Department in May 1991 stated that the rent would be payable monthly and would be revised on 1 July each year by reference to the change in the consumer price index.  I assume that is still the case. House prices in the county and city of Dublin are enormously high compared with those in the rest of the country. A couple participating in these schemes could find that the rent increased month by month and year by year for the simple reason that the area in which their house is located was more highly valued on the consumer price index.  The Minister should give an assurance that there would be a maximum rent in relation to the mortgage paid for the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a meanness about this scheme.  This is a shared ownership scheme whereby the occupiers take out a mortgage to pay half the cost while the local authority pay the other half.  In these circumstances who pays the cost of insurance and maintenance?  If there is a fire in the house and part of the house is damaged, presumably the couple will have to cover the bill for maintenance and repairs.  In many cases people are unable to afford to pay insurance costs. The number of local authority tenants who no longer have household insurance is frightening.  Insurance agents in my constituency tell me that year by year they are losing insurers.  If the local authorities do their job properly they will ensure that the building is insured, but more and more households are unable to pay the price of insurance for the contents of the house with the result that week after week we hear about fund-raising <Col N="1953" /> exercises for people who had no insurance and lost all their possessions in fires.  The Minister should look again at the section which provides that the applicants be responsible for maintenance and insurance.  That cost should be shared between the two owners, the local authority and the people buying the house.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks that this is a very desirable scheme.  On 31 March 1992 there were 2,117 applicants for housing in County Dublin.  These included one parent and two parent families as well as elderly people.  Of that number 1,585 were social welfare recipients; only 495 were employed &mdash; that is a hidden figure because it included those on FÁS and social employment schemes who, because they do not have a permanent income, are not eligible to participate in the scheme; 15 were on family maintenance and 22 had no income details. Therefore, of those 2,117 families only about 1 per cent are eligible to apply for the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that the Minister is not aware of the difficulties being encountered, particularly in the case of one parent families and marriage breakdown. It is a common occurrence for men to leave women and children and in these cases if the woman on a lone parent allowance is unable to pay the mortgage repayment and the rent for the share of the council's ownership she is thrown out of the house.  She will then have to join the people on the housing list.  If the local authority sell the house will they get their share of the price?  These are the nitty gritty details that are unknown to council officials.  They have not been given the full information on the scheme by the Department, and this Bill makes it no clearer.  The Minister has a day's work in trying to sell this scheme and make it work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Minister and the Department, having looked at the figures, decided that the cost of providing and maintaining local authority housing was so great that they had to think of something else.  Consequently, they came up with this half-baked scheme <Col N="1954" /> of shared ownership.  Shared ownership is a means of enabling the occupier to purchase a portion of the equity in a house and to pay a rent to the owner. The shared ownership lease of a house may be granted to any person, including a corporate body or housing authority. The provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, do not apply in this case.  Therefore landlords will have a field day, as will the financial institutions who encourage people who previously took out loans from the local authority to remortgage their houses.  This is happening on a regular basis.  Many of them are finding it difficult to repay their mortgage under the SDA scheme, so they approach the financial institutions for remortgaging facilities in order to redeem their loans from the local authority.  This was stated quite recently in reply to a question put to the Cork County Manager.  The finance is coming back into the local authority.  I would ask the Minister to look at the local authority SDA scheme and if loans were available to people at a fixed rate of interest we would know exactly what their commitment would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that at present there is a shared ownership scheme though it has not been established on any formal basis because a high percentage of houses which were previously acquired by people who were tenants &mdash; tenant purchasers, or applicants under the scheme I referred to earlier &mdash; are now relying on the health boards, as mentioned by a previous Deputy, for supplementary welfare allowance towards their mortgage?  This is a growing phenomenon on the issue of housing and housing loans.  There are criteria for assessing the percentage of repayment they get towards their mortgage.  Many people at present are relying on the supplementary welfare allowance.  How can they be expected to make mortgage repayments and pay rent at the same time?  This point has been made by previous speakers.  It may work for a couple of years.  Could the Minister indicate if the person's mortgage will be a mortgage under shared ownership, <Col N="1955" /> if it will be recognised under the Finance Act and whether there will be tax relief on the mortgage?</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's intention to continue making provision for SDA loans in the future and is the income limit of either £10,000 or £12,000 realistic at this time, given that a person in receipt of £10,000 will have very little disposable income when tax and PRSI have been deducted? Consequently, it will be very difficult for a person to acquire their own home if their income is £10,000 or less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally disagree with this concept.  I do not believe the State should be in the business of buying houses for people who cannot afford to provide them for themselves.  The State may have a role, as referred to by Deputy Sherlock, in providing low interest loans for those who cannot afford normal commercial rates and I have no objection to that.  In my own constituency there are between 1,200 and 1,300 people on the housing list in the Dún Laoghaire Corporation area, the county area of Dún Laoghaire constituency and some of Dublin South.  People should not be discriminated against for being born in a certain area nor because property prices are such that they cannot afford to buy a house.  There is little opportunity to participate in this scheme if one comes from the Dún Laoghaire constituency; the Minister might take note of this because he might learn something about Dublin housing.  All these schemes are devised by people who do not know what it is like to live in a local authority house or represent a local authority estate in Dublin, particularly south Dublin.  If they believe these schemes are feasible, they are fooling themselves; they will not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give an example of what has happened recently in housing.  Houses provided by the taxpayers built five or six years ago and purchased under the purchase scheme brought out by the Fianna Fáil Government between 1987-89 are now being sold for £41,000 and £42,000, while the person who bought it <Col N="1956" /> under this scheme paid £14,000 for it. Therefore, the taxpayer is subsidising a profit of £28,000 in the period of three years.  I would be surprised if anyone took up this scheme in the Dún Laoghaire constituency, but the only house they can buy is the same house that is now being sold for £41,000 and which was purchased three years ago.  The taxpayer is burdened again and this is a crazy policy.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Local Government and the Environment and their advisers do not understand that many people born on the south side of Dublin are not in a position to pay £50,000 to £60,000 to purchase a house; that is why there are between 1,200 and 1,300 people on the housing list.  The cost to the State of the type of accommodation that people are now forced to live in in these parts of Dublin is the direct cause of many marriage break-ups.  The State will again have to intervene and fund deserted wives and care for children who are forced into this position by these pressures.</P>
    <P>There is no alternative accommodation for such people.  They cannot apply to the local authority because no local authority houses are being built.  What options are open to them?  They can live with their mothers-in-law, where there may be seven or eight people sharing two or three bedrooms and there may be three or four children.  This is not the best way to start a marriage.  No wonder there is a large number of marriage break-ups.  People have told me in some parts of Ireland the scheme is working for social welfare recipients.  I wish we had that luxury in certain parts of Dublin.  In Dún Laoghaire one would have to pay up to £50 a week for one room in a three storey house, sharing a bathroom, if one was lucky enough to get a room, and if one had children one would not get a room. In this case, the State is paying £50 a week to a landlord who does not provide proper facilities; people have to share a bathroom, call to the community welfare officer to obtain rent subsidies, and meanwhile the racketeering landlords are laughing all the way to the bank because <Col N="1957" /> they keep increasing the rent and the State continues to dole out more money through the rent subsidy scheme.  Is the Minister trying to convince me and others who represent Dublin constituents that this policy will work in Dublin?</P>
    <P>Now in Dublin one has little choice, one should not get married if one does not have a house and there is no point in approaching the local authority because there are no local authority houses.  The Government recently enacted the Homeless Persons Bill and everybody supported its purpose.  The local authorities were to house the homeless, meanwhile no local authority houses are being built. What is now happening is that every single casual vacancy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are not too many Dublin Deputies in to support the Minister anyway.  I support the amendment tabled in relation to this.  It does not matter whether or not it is passed because this is a crazy scheme which will not work. If it manages to house even one person I suppose it will have done some good. It certainly will not do anything for the <Col N="1959" /> unfortunates in Dún Laoghaire or in Dublin South and Dublin South-East.  If one happens to have been born south of the Liffey one is in serious trouble with this Government.  I support the amendment in that it at least makes some attempt to bring reality into the scheme. It certainly will not improve the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section must be looked at in the context of the overall problem necessitating an introduction of this shared ownership scheme.  Certain aspects of this scheme are beneficial to a small minority of housing applicants.  In the context of the crisis facing us we have to support that element of it.</P>
      <P>Like other public representatives, if a housing applicant has any option other than this scheme, I would advise him to take it.  We saw the effect that the Housing Finance Agency had on housing and the problems that arose from it.  Perhaps 75 per cent of housing applicants here would not be able to avail of this scheme because they are on social welfare benefits. With regard to the other 25 per cent the criteria is ability to pay.  In County Dublin the average price of a modest house is about £40,000.  On half that sum, £20,000, one would repay a mortgage of £200 a month.  An applicant must then pay an extra £1,000 per annum for the rented element.  We are talking in terms of at least £70 per week.  The Minister should consider the suggestions that are being made because even people who are working and who might be in a position to make the monthly repayments are reluctant to take up this scheme because of the escalating price of the rent and the mortgage after 25 years.  The rented element in a £40,000 house should remain at £20,000.  The Minister may say that that puts a cost on the State but we must consider this as part of a housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is anticipated that in the EHB area <Col N="1960" /> this year £13 million will be paid by the State to private landlords to enable people to rent houses.  That money should be re-directed to people on the housing lists who would like to avail of this scheme and some of it should be re-directed towards building local authority houses for people in need.  It should not go into the pocket of the private landlord. The rented element of this scheme should not escalate on an annual basis.  The Minister should accept our suggestion and come back to us on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Who will take responsibility for the debt if a person who has been successful in applying for this scheme becomes unemployed, or a spouse dies and the repayments cannot be kept up?  Will it be the local authority, the building society or whatever?  Will these organisations go to court to seek an eviction order for the people concerned?  Where will the responsibility lie?  Will the Minister look at that aspect and give me some guidance on it?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take our constructive suggestions on board so that this scheme, with limited appeal to a small sector of those on the housing list, can be implemented in a more attractive form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  Housing department officials are very careful and prudent when dealing with applications under this scheme.  They are anxious to consider only applicants in the income bracket between £10,000 and £12,000 because of their ability to meet their repayments.  People with an income under £10,000 are being left out.  As has been mentioned in the House tonight on a number of occasions, the cheapest house one can buy in southside Dublin costs in the region of £40,000.  A constituent of mine applied for a loan under this scheme and the housing department after interviewing her, wrote and told her that repayments on a £40,000 house would be in the region of £285 per month &mdash; between the mortgage and rent repayments &mdash; and they asked the applicant how she intended to make these repayments. I think that is a reasonable way of approaching the matter.  It is very difficult <Col N="1961" /> for applicants on this income level to meet such repayments.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in this scheme because I felt it offered an opportunity to be housed to people who were working, had an income of between £10,000 and £12,000 but had no chance of being housed from the housing list.  However, having examined the scheme in detail I saw the snags and I then asked a housing official what he thought of it.  His reply was stark.  He said: &ldquo;Deputy, I would not recommend this scheme to my worst enemy.&rdquo;</P>

We seem to place greater priority on road building than on providing houses.  We seem to be surrounded by Members from Dublin, with the exception of the Minister and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth pointing out that the average cost of a new house in the Dublin area is £62,000 &mdash; that was the average price last year, and it had fallen by £2,000 from the previous year &mdash; and secondhand houses cost £60,000. In all other areas the average price of a new house is £53,000 and £51,000 for a secondhand house, but the pressure of the demand for housing in Dublin is affecting other areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In County Wicklow we have to provide houses not only for the people of Wicklow but for <Col N="1962" /> the people of Dublin and Wicklow and as a result the average price of a house in certain parts of County Wicklow is far higher than in the city of Dublin, believe it or not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently I took it upon myself to check the scheme that was on offer on the far side of the Border with our counterparts there because I had understood that what we were proposing was on all fours with the schemes operating in the North and in the United Kingdom.  I was quite pleased to learn that the scheme we had put in place is virtually on all fours with the scheme operating in the North.  By coincidence the official I spoke to in the North had spent time with our officials in the Department of the Environment to explain how their scheme worked.  He said this was an excellent scheme which was working well in the North as there was a tremendous take up and that approximately 80 per cent of those participating in the scheme ultimately bought out their houses in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I query how the scheme has operated to date in the South but that perhaps may be because the scheme is in its infancy <Col N="1963" /> and the legislation is not in place.  I was perplexed about it and for that reason I contacted my counterparts across the Border.  I was perplexed by the temporary letting agreement and the subsequent lease arrangement, but I found out that is the way it is handled in the North and that it is working well from both a practical and legal point of view. However I query the fact that the mortgage element comes down simply to the applicant's ability to pay, and some Deputies on the far side of the Chamber have articulated the difficulties this causes for people and the local authorities. I can appreciate that.  There is no point in telling the large numbers on the housing list in receipt of social welfare that this scheme exists if they cannot avail of it because they are on social welfare. I understood the original intention was that those on social welfare as well as those who were not in full time employment could avail of this scheme; but my experience, unfortunately, is otherwise.</P>

It would be very relevant if the Minister were to state his views on this on an ongoing basis because the number who have taken up the scheme to date is few and far between.  I think it is a good scheme.  The experience in England and across the Border is excellent. For that reason we should compliment the Government for endeavouring to address the problem of the long waiting lists for housing in all our major urban areas.</P>

      <P>I know that the surveying of houses has given rise to problems. In one particular case in my own county the county council were lucky that the applicant wanted to buy a former local authority house.  The local authority sent out a valuer who valued the house but it subsequently transpired &mdash; and at this point it was too late to do anything &mdash; that when they required the recipient to satisfy himself on the structural soundness of the house it was found that the house in question was slightly defective. It was at this stage that the county council decided to send out their own engineer, even though the application had gone so far down the line that they could not turn back.  The Department should bear in mind that such things can happen.  I am not advocating that the scheme be tied up with red tape, which, unfortunately, has been the experience down through the years of anyone who has obtained a loan, particularly because in several legal actions councils have been held responsible for defective houses.  That is certainly true in my own county.  The Department and the Minister should be aware that there is a problem in that regard and that it should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In principle I give my compliments to the Minister and his predecessor for <Col N="1965" /> bringing in the shared ownership scheme. I give them credit for going to the trouble of finding out what the experience was in other jurisdictions.  That experience was good and I have no doubt that, given the circumstances pertaining in this State, our experience should be good, provided that the initial teething problems are ironed out and provided that several points that have been raised genuinely by Members in the Chamber and by people outside the House are examined by the Minister and his Department.</P>

There is no harm in telling Deputies that between 12,000 and 14,000 families are at present involved in shared ownership arrangements in the North and that those arrangements are working very satisfactorily. It appears that Deputies have made a very fundamental mistake in thinking that the shared ownership option is the only arrangement available to every single person who is on the housing list or who may come onto the housing list.</P>

Deputies should recognise how wrong it is to frighten people who have an opportunity to participate in this scheme, people for whom the shared ownership scheme is their only realistic chance to purchase and own their own house.  Earlier in the debate, when referring to the house purchase schemes, Deputy Mitchell made the point that we are talking about a group of people many of whom just miss out and who feel that they are just not able to purchase a house because the demands are too great. Deputies should remember that point. We are not talking about people who are able to buy a house fully, or people who are able to build their own house.  We are talking about a category of people for whom this is the option and those people should be encouraged to avail of that option.

      <P>Deputy Allen from Cork made a completely irresponsible statement that I reject out of hand.  Deputy Allen called the shared ownership housing scheme and the voluntary housing options contained in the scheme a sham. I want the Deputy to go to places in the north of the country.  I want him to go to the 600 people who were approved under the scheme.  He should talk to them in that vein.  Perhaps he could go to Respond or Father Coogan in Thomastown, Waterford.  In the Deputy's own constituency, Respond have applied for 40 units this year and the voluntary sector there will provide 600 units this year.  It is wrong for a Deputy who is supposed to be representing that constituency to come into the House and try to frighten away people for whom this is an option by calling the two schemes a sham.  The facts speak for themselves and the units that have been provided throughout this country by Respond, by the voluntary sector and by the number of people who are opting for the shared ownership scheme prove that the Deputy is completely wrong.  It is a good job that Deputy Allen does not have a say in housing policy if that is the way he addresses housing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably in one case a local official <Col N="1969" /> in the housing section in dealing with a question from Deputy Doyle said that he would not recommend the scheme to his worst enemy.  Such an attitude is out of touch and those who hold it should talk to somebody who is in touch.  I recommend the Deputy to talk to somebody who is in touch with reality.  I want housing officials to explain all the details.  We do not want to hide anything and we want applicants to understand all the ramifications and everything that is involved in this scheme.  We want them to understand the economic advantages presented by this scheme.  I have already said that for people for whom this scheme is an option to own their own house, and only those people, this is the course to follow.</P>
    <P>I have been recommended to freeze the remaining equity.  Deputies should face facts.  Time and time again Deputies say that they want to curtail public expenditure and the Fine Gael Party talk about their commitment to control public expenditure.

      <P>I wish to reply to Deputy Sherlock who was worried about second mortgages.  In recent times I have warned people who may be in some financial difficulty about being tempted by apparent attractive invitations to remortgage their houses.  The shared ownership mortgages will qualify for the normal income tax relief.  It was very unfair of Deputies Gilmore, Rabbitte and others when calculating the outlay involved in shared ownership to deliberately take no account of income tax relief or of the shared housing subsidy which puts a different picture on the £2,000 grant and the repayments to be made.  We have not sufficient time to deal with everything.</P>

What happens to the house if one spouse dies? What happens to the house if there is a fire?  Who pays the insurance?  Who does the repair work?  What happens after 25 years when one share is bought?  Do they get credit for each year of the tenancy as they would under a tenant purchase scheme? What about the other relevant questions that were asked?  The Minister quoted statistics about Dublin and I will not dispute some of them but he ignored the <Col N="1975" /> situation in three-quarters of Dublin and surrounding areas.  This Bill should not be rushed through the Dáil or the debate on it guillotined.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Government Policy on Political Asylum.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick-East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> I raised the matter of the Government's policy on the treatment of those who seek political asylum in this country.  My question was not answered adequately and, therefore, I bring it up here tonight.</P>
      <P>The incidence of those seeking political asylum has gone up dramatically in recent years.  For example, in 1986 the number of applications received was 19; by 1990 that had gone up to 62.  I also have information to suggest that the number of asylums granted is very low indeed &mdash; one in 1989, one in 1990 and one in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something I have an interest in because the arrangements put in place in the eighties were not satisfactory.  In 1985, when I was Minister for Justice, I met the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  As a result of that meeting a set of ten procedures was worked out which were supposed to form the basis of policy in subsequent years.  It was never put on a statutory basis because the number of asylum seekers at the time was not very great.  However, I understand now that the procedures agreed by me in my capacity as Minister for Justice in 1985 with the High Commissioner for Refugees <Col N="1981" /> are not now being adhered to and I would like the Minister to give a commitment that not only is the letter of the procedure being adhered to but the spirit.  I think, for example, that decisions are being made now by nominated immigration officers at the ports of entry, and at the airports in particular, and that these decisions are not being referred back to the Department officials for any real decision.  I know that information is referred back but I do not believe that the decisions are actually being taken at the level at which they were intended to be taken.  I believe that people who are doing their best but have no training in the matter at all are making decisions.</P>
    <P>The second area of concern is the number of asylum seekers who end up in prison here.  There has been a number of rather bad cases in Shannon where, for example, a Somali citizen ended up in Limerick Jail for several months.  Cases were cited before the High Court where the court found in favour of the applicants because the length of detention contravened the 1935 Act.  The anecdotal evidence that those of us who live near Shannon would have is now being augmented by a campaign being run by Amnesty International.  Amnesty International are a reputable organisation and they are expressing widespread concern, not so much about what the documents available from the Department of Justice state but about the manner in which they are being implemented.</P>
    <P>We had an opportunity during Ireland's Presidency of the EC, when the issue of political asylum became a European issue, of setting guidelines for the practice in Europe as a whole. However, we did not avail of that opportunity. If anything, we put our name to a more restricted regime than we had previously agreed to nationally.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be contentious in any way but I do want to express personal unhappiness at the way in which procedures which were agreed in 1985 are now being applied.  I want to reinforce that unhappiness by saying that it is not just a personal view but the view of many Deputies, especially those who are near <Col N="1982" /> Shannon Airport or other airports where there are points of entry for non-EC nationals.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is merit in the submissions many Deputies have had from Amnesty International.  I would like the Minister to take a personal interest in this.  I know he can state the letter of the procedure and, on the face of it, it is acceptable.  My point is that the procedure as laid down in the agreement of 1985 is not now being implemented in its spirit and the Minister should review the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Noonan, I also have had representations on this matter from the Limerick branch of Amnesty International.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention and the 1967 Protocol on the Status of Refugees and Government policy on political asylum &mdash; and indeed the policy of previous Governments of whatever party &mdash; is and has been fully in accordance with our international obligations arising under these agreements.</P>
      <P>A procedural agreement giving effect to our commitments at the domestic level was negotiated in December 1985 with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees by the then Minister for Justice who, as it happens, was Deputy Noonan. This agreement continues to be operative and applies in all cases where an application for asylum is being examined.</P>
      <P>The arrangements agreed in 1985 provide a comprehensive and fair framework within which the examination of an application for political asylum takes place. The provisions of the agreement set out to ensure that the applicant is given every opportunity to present his case in an environment conducive to establishing as quickly as practicable the facts of the case.  The agreement allows as well for the participation of the office of the UN High Commission for Refugees in the consideration of each application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be useful if I were to detail how the procedures work in practice. Persons who request refugee status at <Col N="1983" /> Irish ports or at the Department of Justice are interviewed initially by an immigration officer.  Every facility is afforded applicants to allow them to make their case in as comfortable a surrounding as possible and the services of an interpreter are provided where necessary.  Each application is then forwarded to the London Representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees &mdash; who is accredited to Ireland &mdash; as well as to the Department of Foreign Affairs for their observations.  When these views are obtained in due course, each case is submitted to the Minister for Justice for decision.  In the case of an applicant who wishes to travel to a third country the above procedures are also followed, in addition to consultation with the relevant embassy of the country to which the person wishes to travel.</P>
    <P>It should also be emphasised that even where an applicant for political asylum fails in his or her application they are not necessarily removed from the State. Some have been allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds while others have been permitted to remain pending their admission to a third country.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the proposals made by Amnesty International but I am satisfied that the existing procedures which were endorsed by UNHCR last year are satisfactory and continue to provide now, as they did at the time they were formulated during the Deputy's period as Minister for Justice, an appropriate means of meeting our international commitments. The policy of the Government towards refugees is to be as positive as possible in considering their status here and we take our responsibilities in this regard very seriously indeed.  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that the procedures followed in these matters were endorsed by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees last year.  One point I would also like to underline here and now, and to place publicly on record, is that no Minister for Justice has ever disagreed with the views of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees <Col N="1984" /> on whether an applicant for political asylum is entitled to such status.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the issue about which Deputy Noonan has made representations. I have received representations and I am aware of the difficult cases.  My research and probing so far has led me to believe that the difficult cases, the cases which have been highlighted, are the exception rather than the rule.  I am taking a personal interest in the matter and I will follow up on the specific points made by Deputy Noonan to ensure that the procedures are being followed in the manner intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The impending strike in the Southern Health Board area which is due to take place on 13 July next will have serious and severe repercussions for thousands of workers in the hospitals and nursing homes in that area. More importantly, the patients in these hospitals and nursing homes will suffer needlessly if commonsense does not prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the issue involved is not so great that it cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of everyone.  I realise that this House is not the place to discuss the pros and cons of an industrial dispute but it is the place to discuss the health of patients and the conditions for workers in the health service.  Previous strikes by workers in the health services caused misery and suffering for many people.  I understand that emergency services will be provided in the event of an all-out strike but, if possible, this strike should be prevented and confrontation avoided. I know the Minister does not like beating <Col N="1985" /> about the bush on such issues.  I appeal to him to intervene in this matter and seek a return to the <i>status quo,</i> thus giving the union and management an opportunity to sit down together over the next few months and tease out the problems and anomalies in the system with the objective of reaching a satisfactory conclusion. I believe there is a great deal of honour and credit in people stepping back from the brink at this junction and putting the patients' welfare first.  I know there is goodwill on the part of the workers on this very important issue.  I appeal to the management to reciprocate that gesture by deferring action until further negotiations have taken place over the next two months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan in regard to this matter.  The threat of an industrial dispute in a hospital at any time evokes great worry and concern not only among the patients and their relatives but among the staff also.  The limited number of times hospital staff have resorted to industrial action indicates their commitment to patients and to their jobs.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene to prevent this strike going ahead.  If this strike goes ahead, it will be very difficult to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vote in favour of industrial action was carried by a massive majority.  This demonstrates the uneasiness felt by the staff at the change in approach by management to the payment of sick benefit. As this is tantamount to a change in the wages structure it was bound to be resisted.  The staff accept that there are anomalies in the scheme and are prepared to discuss the issue with management. The speed and manner in which management implemented this change, and not the substance of the matter is what has given rise to the threatened industrial action.  As a doctor, the Minister is aware of the problems which can be caused in hospitals as a result of industrial action.  He should appeal strongly to both sides to come together and resolve their differences on the basis of equality and justice.  If the Minister does this, I am <Col N="1986" /> sure he will receive a positive response from the groups involved and the interests of the staff and patients will be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this very important matter.  They are doing a great service to the people involved in raising it at this time.  The escalating costs arising in the health services from the level of absenteeism among health staffs have been a cause of great concern for a number of years.  Additional costs arise both from the operation of the sick pay scheme and the need to replace staff who are on sick leave.  While there is a wide variation in the level of absence both between the categories of staff and between the different health agencies, the overall level of absenteeism has been found to be considerably higher than the level of absenteeism in other service employments.</P>
      <P>The Health Efficiency Review Group who produced the Fox report, indicated that there was considerable scope for cost savings in the areas of absenteeism and sick pay in the hospitals which they studied. Pay costs make up approximately two-thirds of the total expenditure of the health services.  Because of the high rate of replacement, either by locums or built into staff complements, absenteeism and sick pay account for a significant proportion of total pay costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sick pay schemes are particularly generous to certain grades of staff.  The level of benefit received while on sick pay can exceed 100 per cent of net pay.  In the case of staff liable for Class A PRSI, sick pay provisions generally provide for payment of normal gross weekly earnings through a combination of social welfare disability benefit and employer &ldquo;top-up&rdquo;. This often allows the employee higher net earnings while absent from work than he or she would earn while at work due mainly to the fact that the social welfare element of the sick pay is free from PAYE-PRSI charges.  Apart from the additional cost to the taxpayer which this entails, it is an undesirable incentive <Col N="1987" /> to have incorporated in employment conditions.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the financial constraints under which the health services have to operate and the need to reduce costs wherever possible, it is clear that the above situation could not be allowed to continue indefinitely.  Following the issue of the Fox report, a hospitals' value for money group recommended that absenteeism levels should be monitored in a more consistent and more systematic way.  They also recommended that arrangements should be put in place to eliminate situations where certain categories of staff, while on sick leave, receive in excess of 100 per cent of net pay.  The value for money group decided that the simplest method to achieve this was to deduct social welfare entitlements from net pay.  The precedent of deducting social welfare entitlements from net pay has already been established in both the public and private sectors.  This means that an employee, while absent on sick leave, earns normal net take-home pay through a combination of social welfare entitlements and employer's &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; payment.  A number of health boards have implemented these revised sick pay arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board informed the unions in advance by letter of the impending changes in the scheme and, in addition, met the unions to explain the overall situation.  The board then implemented the change from 8 April 1992.  Following a meeting with the union on 24 June 1992, at which the union sought a return to the <i>status quo</i>, a course to which the board could not agree the union informed the board of pending strike action due to start from 13 July next.  The board, by way of letter dated 25 June, invited the union to return for further discussions and are awaiting a response.</P>
    <P>It is my view that both parties should resume their discussions and make further efforts to resolve the <i>impasse</i> which has arisen.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commits employers, trade unions and employees <Col N="1988" /> to promoting industrial harmony and, where the parties cannot reach agreement through direct negotiations, established bodies are available to assist in such cases.</P>
    <P>Without attempting to interfere in any way in this matter. I have asked the management to initiate negotiations with the unions.  I recognise that what the Deputy has said is correct &mdash; this is the way to approach the matter.  There is an opportunity for both sides to sit down and see how they can resolve their disagreement in the best interests of the patients, the public and the staff.  I can understand what happened but I hope that a much more flexible approach will be taken in the interests of all concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister to carry out a full investigation into the sale of eight and a half acres of land by Cork County Council to a private citizen in the town of Kanturk in north Cork for the sum of £1,000, bearing in mind that this land had been bought by Cork County Council in 1987 for approximately £3,000 per acre.  My objection to this sale is twofold.  First, the money used to purchase this land was public money provided by the Department of the Environment for the installation of a new £3 million sewerage scheme in Kanturk, for which we are deeply grateful.  It has been stated on behalf of Cork County Council that this land is being sold to the private individual in question in settlement of a possible legal action by the individual against Cork County Council. It is said that the alleged action arose as a result of flooding of the individual's land following work carried out by Cork County Council.  I would like to put on record that I have lived in this area all my life and I can safely say that this individual's land has always been subject to flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I questioned this sale at a full meeting of Cork County Council held in Cork on Monday, 22 June, the council official who negotiated the sale admitted <Col N="1989" /> that he did not even get a consultant's report on the matter.  The land in question is now in the possession of this private individual.  I have been approached by many constituents in the area asking me to raise this matter in the House.  A local sporting organisation, the Kanturk Soccer Club, were interested in purchasing the land as an amenity for the people of Kanturk.  Had that club succeeded in their efforts to purchase the property a nominal price would not be unreasonable because the land would be held in community ownership and the public at large could benefit from it. However, notwithstanding this, Cork County Council preferred to make a gift of the land to a private citizen to the detriment of the community of Kanturk. This land should be held in public or community ownership for the benefit of the public at large and not sold at a loss to a private citizen.  I trust that the Minister will not only investigate this matter but will ensure that the land does not pass into private ownership at the crazy price of £1,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Kelly is a land disposal which has now been submitted by Cork County Council in accordance with statutory requirements for my consent.  The proposal was received in my Department yesterday, 29 June 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disposal of local authority property is governed by statute and is a matter for the local authority concerned in the first instance.  The statute most commonly used is section 83 of the Local Government Act, 1946, which sets out a formal procedure to be adopted by local authorities in relation to the disposal of land. Under this procedure notice must be given to the elected members of the proposal to dispose of the land; and at the first meeting of the authority held after the expiration of ten clear days from the day on which the notices are sent, the members may resolve that the disposal shall not be carried out or that it shall be carried out in accordance with terms specified in the resolution.  If they resolve <Col N="1990" /> that it is to be carried out in accordance with specified terms, the disposal may be carried out in accordance with such terms with the consent of the Minister.  This proposal was approved by resolution of Cork County Council at their meeting on 8 June 1992 and is now before me for my consent.</P>
    <P>When a proposal to dispose of land is received in my Department, it is examined firstly to ensure that the statutory procedures already outlined have been complied with.  Secondly, the merits of the proposal are assessed.  The main criterion in evaluating a proposal to dispose of land is the question of price and the need to ensure that the local authority are getting the best price reasonably obtainable in the public interest.  In certain limited circumstances this criterion would be waived, where, for example, the land being disposed of was intended to provide a community facility such as a recreation centre which would serve the public interest in some way.</P>
    <P>This proposal is for the disposal of 8.4 acres of land to a private individual for a nominal consideration.  Its terms are quite unusual and it does not fall within the normal category of land disposal. Rather than a straightforward transaction of disposing of the land for its actual worth, it seems the intention is to transfer the 8.4 acres of land to a particular person in lieu of a compensation agreement reached between the council and the person concerned.  The basis of the claim for compensation is apparently in respect of damage caused to his property arising out of work carried out by the council as part of the Kanturk sewerage and flood relief scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the proposal was only received in my Department yesterday.  It is a complex matter which will require detailed examination and I will almost certainly be seeking further clarifications from the county council.  I can assure the Deputy that all aspects of the proposal will be fully examined in my Department before I give my decision.</P>

      <P>Lough Gara is a lovely and interesting lake, or rather a combination of three lakes, on the Sligo-Roscommon border.  Great efforts are being made to improve the lakeside and general facilities in order to attract more tourists for the excellent coarse fishing there.  The Lough Gara Development Association have produced their own promotional brochure, a very good effort by a small community.  However, they have one difficulty. The low level of the lake water in summertime, especially in good weather such as we have had in recent times, is bad for fishing as the fish get trapped in shallow waters and are unable to survive. It is bad also for boating facilities.  Overall it can cause a maze of problems, even for lakeside farmers in controlling their cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lough Gara Development Association and the farmers believe that there is a simple solution &mdash; the building of sluice gates at Cuppanagh Bridge to control the flow of water from the lake into the Boyle river and onto the Shannon.  I will not go into the technical details but I understand that because of a number of factors, some natural and some manmade, this would not be an expensive project and there would be no necessity <Col N="1992" /> for day to day control.  The effect of the sluice gates would add greatly to the tourist potential of Lough Gara.  The project could possibly qualify for EC tourist related grant aid, perhaps from the Leader Programme.  I hope that the Minister will have good news on this matter tonight.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have been approached by the Boyle River Drainage Action Committee in County Roscommon to provide a mechanism to control water levels on Lough Gara. Although Lough Gara is located within the Boyle river catchment area, there is no provision in the scheduled works of the Boyle catchment drainage scheme to provide a water level control mechanism at this location.  The reasons for this request are twofold: first, lower water levels have exposed mud flats which make watering of stock difficult and the second relates to proposed fishing development.  These complaints are at present under investigation by the relevant officials in my Department and I am awaiting their report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in this House on 14 May, 1992 when introducing the Defence Estimate, I have made a decision in principle <Col N="1727" /> to end the restrictions which up to now have prevented women from serving in all areas of the Defence Forces.  The military authorities are engaged in the detailed planning necessary to implement this decision.  While it is not possible to say when this planning will be completed, I can assure the House that women are now eligible on the same basis as men for employment on operational and ceremonial duties, for assignment to military courses and for promotion.  In essence the basis of selection in all of these areas will henceforward be suitability rather than gender.</P>

      <P>For many years, strategic studies which include an international dimension have been undertaken within various branches of Defence Forces headquarters arising from United Nations service and, more recently, CSCE.  In the interests of rationalisation, the military authorities have arranged that, in future, the Military College in the Curragh will develop a central role in the conduct and co-ordination of such studies.</P>
      <P>The topics for study in the Military College are left to the discretion of the competent military authorities in accordance with general policy.  The study which has given rise to comment was chosen by the military authorities.  It is essentially an academic exercise.  It is not the practice to seek Ministerial approval for each and every academic study conducted at the College.</P>
      <P>In the course of the recent referendum campaign, the normal activities of the Military College in the Curragh have been the subject of mischievous speculation. I wish to emphasise that studies conducted at the college are not a factor in influencing the conduct of Ireland's international relations with the European Community or any other organisation.</P>
      <P>Government policy regarding the Western European Union visualises attendance in an observer capacity.  A relationship with NATO does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> Policy matters on this area are determined by Government, not by the military authorities.  The issue of Ireland's relationship with the European Community in the context of the Common Security and Foreign Policy set out in Article J.4 remains primarily with the Department of Foreign Affairs, in consultation as necessary with my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of the accommodation <Col N="1732" /> being provided in barracks for single personnel of the Permanent Defence Force in recent years is of a high standard.  An example of this accommodation is the new barracks, Dun Uí Néill, in Cavan. Further examples of improved facilities being provided are at Finner Camp, Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dun Uí Mhaoilísa, Galway and Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Where accommodation in use is not up to the required standard, steps are being taken to improve it progressively within the limits of the resources available for the purpose.  There is no rent charged for this type of accommodation now.  I am conscious of the necessity to have satisfactory accommodation available for all members of the Defence Forces.  I have asked that it will receive the priority it merits in my Department.</P>
    <P>As regards married personnel the provision of housing is primarily a matter for local authorities.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force and their families have an equal claim on such housing with other members of the community in the same income category.  My Department are satisfied that local authorities afford every consideration to such personnel.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of married quarters have been sold to their occupants in recent years.  The remaining quarters are inspected by the corps of engineers with a view to ensuring that they are maintained adequately and improvements made as circumstances permit.  A small number of older type quarters, many of which are lacking in some modern facilities, are not re-allocated when vacated by their occupants.</P>
    <P>In the Defence Vote for 1992 a sum of £8 million is provided for military accommodation requirements.  This amount is being spent on new and improved accommodation at McKee and Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin; Collins Barracks, Cork; the Naval Base, Haulbowline; Finner Camp, County Donegal and the Curragh Camp, County Kildare, as well as on the general upkeep of all barracks.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a young farmer does not benefit from the favoured nephew status under a trust will and that all stock relief is also clawed back; his views on whether this is victimisation of young farming families at a traumatic time of accidental death; if he will seek to make amendments to the next Finance Bill to deal with this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>A nephew or niece who meets the criteria for &ldquo;favoured&rdquo; nephew or niece treatment, and who receives a farm under a trust will, will qualify for the exemption threshold for &ldquo;favoured&rdquo; nephews and nieces under the Capital Acquisition tax code.</P>
      <P>Section 33 (5) of the Finance Act, 1984, provides for relief from stock relief clawback where the trade of farming is transferred by a person, either by settlement or will, to a spouse or a child (including favourite niece/nephew) of the person. The transferor (or, in the case of death, his legal personal representative) and the successor must make an election in the matter within two years of the transfer and the trade must pass in its entirety to the successor.  The legislation does not provide for any relief where the trade of farming passes to a trust in favour of minor children.  The points raised by the Deputy in regard to this latter type of case have, however, been noted and will be examined.</P>

      <P>A lessor of agricultural land who is aged 55 or over or who is permanently incapacitated is exempt from income tax on some or all of his leasing income subject to certain conditions.  In line with other reliefs in the tax code, this exemption does not apply where the lessors and lessees are connected.  A connected person would include a husband, wife or relative of the lessor.  If the exemption were not limited in this way there would be substantial scope for abuse arising from non-genuine lettings.  In the circumstances, I have no plans to make any changes in this area.</P>

      <P>The footbridge over the Grand Canal at Rahan, Tullamore, was erected circa 1914 by the then Parish Priest to facilitate access to the local primary school.  It was never required for canal purposes.  It would appear that little, if any, maintenance was carried out to the bridge since its construction, with the result that the fabric deteriorated over the years.  In view of the fact that the structure had become dangerous it was necessary in 1990 to block access to the bridge.  A number of complaints were received earlier this year from local people who <Col N="1747" /> feared that there would be an accident or injury.  In the circumstances it was decided to dismantle and remove the structure.  This was done within the past week.  There are no proposals to replace this privately erected bridge.</P>

      <P>The terms and conditions under which the Law library, which has been located in the Four Courts since about 1830, is currently used by the General Council of the Bar of Ireland are set out in two agreements with the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland dated 31 July 1968 and 1 April 1987.  These agreements provide for the payment by the council of a nominal rent and also require the council to contribute towards the cost of the provision of services. The commissioners have no plans to review or vary the terms of the agreements. The day-to-day use of the premises is of course a matter for the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 to 93, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These questions relate to Council Directive 91/67/EEC, concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals <Col N="1754" /> and products.  Member states must give effect to the Directive by 1 January, 1993.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Directive 91/67 is to remove barriers to the free movement of aquaculture animals and products, while at the same time preventing the spread of contagious diseases, particularly to those parts of the Community which are currently free from such diseases.  It is intended that the Community will be divided into zones, reflecting its fish health status, and that movement of fish species from zones of lower health status to zones of higher status will be prohibited.  There will be free movement of fish between zones of equivalent health status.</P>
    <P>In relation to shellfish, Ireland will be applying to the Commission for approval to undertake a two year programme for January 1993 to achieve approved zone status in respect of the diseases listed in the Directive.  In this regard I am aware of the concerns of the shellfish industry, and my officials have had discussions with the Irish Shellfish Association, regarding the possible introduction of brown ring disease into Ireland's clam stocks.  The position is that, while brown ring disease is not at this stage a listed disease under the Directive, which would require other member states to achieve health status equivalent to Ireland's before moving clam stocks to this country, the definitive list of diseases has not yet been finalised. My officials have already raised this matter with the European Commission, and will be continuing to make every effort in the coming weeks to ensure that brown ring disease is included as a listed disease under the Directive.</P>
    <P>As Directive 91/67 relates to animal health conditions, and therefore focuses on the prevention of spread of diseases, it contains no provision for protection from the inadvertent introduction of other species, predators or other agents along with specified shellfish.  In the circumstances, and as there are no Community harmonisation proposals in relation to this matter, my Department is urgently examining possible domestic measures to prevent such inadvertent introductions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 98, 99, 100, 102, 103, 106, 113, 114 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that I have received a request from the AGSI to have a common retirement age of 60 years in all Garda ranks.  There is already provision for a temporary extension of the compulsory retirement age from 57 to 60 years of age in the case of the garda, sergeant and inspector ranks who are due to retire up to 31 December 1992.  I will be reviewing the situation in this regard towards the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that 155 members of the <Col N="1758" /> force will retire this year and, on the basis that the temporary extension of the compulsory retirement age will end on 31 December 1992, approximately 400 will retire in 1993 and approximately 1,450 in all between now and the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Garda Síochána on 31 December 1985, including recruits in training, was 11,396.  The projected strength of the force on 31 December 1995 would be 10,507 on the basis just referred to regarding the compulsory retirement age.  In addition to that there will be approximately 245 Garda trainees at various stages of the training programme at that date.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to recruiting 1,000 gardaí over the next few years.  The first intake of 65 successful candidates took place in April and further intakes of a similar number will take place at three-monthly intervals.</P>
    <P>There are also 585 civilian clerical staff employed in the Garda Síochána at present which is the highest number ever. A further 105 civilian staff will be recruited this year and they will be assigned to posts which will release an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties.  There is scope for further civilianisation in the Garda Síochána and a review is being carried out at present to decide on the areas within the force where civilians could be employed.  I plan to increase significantly the numbers of civilians employed in the force over the next few years which will supplement the recruitment of 1,000 gardaí.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will ensure that the strength of the Garda Síochána is adequate to meet the policing needs of this country in the years ahead.</P>

Specifically, the promotion of wider awareness and support for families affected by AIDS is already being undertaken by voluntary agencies such as the Dublin, Cork and Galway AIDS Alliance and CAIRDE.</P>
      <P>The statutory services of the Regional Health Boards also provide important prevention and support services.

      <P>The future of St. Fintan's Hospital is the responsibility of the Midland Health Board in the first instance.  The Midland Health Board is developing a psychiatric service in line with the recommendations of the report Planning for the Future published in 1984.  This will lead to the replacement of some older psychiatric hospitals by psychiatric units attached to general hospitals and services in the community. I consider the provision of an acute psychiatric unit at the General Hospital, Portlaoise is a high priority and discussions are under way between officials of my Department and the Midland Health Board to finalise arrangements for the detailed planning of the unit.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that there is no question of St. Fintan's Hospital, Portlaoise or any other psychiatric hospital being closed until adequate community based facilities and services in general hospitals are provided to replace them.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159, 161, 165, 170 and 171, together.  The Deputy will be aware that the Review of the General Medical Service is now underway and that in the context of that review a wide range of issues of concern to participating general practitioners are under consideration.  These issues include the manner in which withholding tax is applied to general practitioners, the implementation of the 17.5 per cent arbitration award to GMS doctors, the possibility of introducing innovative pilot projects such as prescribing budgets for individual practices and the question of adapting the existing GMS contract to <Col N="1782" /> reflect the particular difficulties being experienced on the ground in different geographic locations.  While I do not wish to comment in detail on any specific matter currently under discussion in the context of the Review, I can assure the Deputy that all of the issues raised in his questions will be given full and detailed consideration by the management side representatives.</P>
      <P>I received Government approval to the acceptance of the Arbitrator's findings on GMS doctors' fees on the basis that the implementation of the findings would be negotiated in the context of the current GMS contract discussions, as suggested by the Arbitrator in his report and that on the successful completion of these discussions, the revised rates will be paid on 1 December 1992 with full retrospection on 1 January 1993.  This decision has been conveyed to the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reimbursement of medical indemnity insurance the position is that arising out of the recommendations of the 1990 Interim (Horgan) Review of the 1989 GMS contract all participating doctors have a portion of their medical indemnity insurance refunded.  Following a recent meeting with the Association of General Practitioners I decided, in equity, to extend this arrangement to the small number of fee-per-item doctors not comprehended by the 1989 contract.  At that meeting I was presented with a submission from the Association in relation to the withholding tax issue which I agreed to forward to the Minister for Finance and to the GMS Review for consideration.</P>

      <P>In <Col N="1783" /> general computer systems are far superior at restricting access to information than manual systems.  With computerisation, an opportunity is provided whereby sensitive information can be made available strictly on a need to know basis.  All computerisation in the hospital services to date has incorporated this feature. In the past, stringent security measures were implemented where personal information was concerned and particularly in the case of medical records; this will continue to be the case. Furthermore, the Data Protection Act places particular responsibilities in relation to confidentiality of personal information on all agencies processing such information by computer.</P>

      <P>The 65 hour working week was introduced following a Labour Court recommendation in 1988.  The introduction of the 65 hour week resulted in the development of new rosters and working arrangements. Where these were not achieved, the matter was referred to a monitoring committee.  However, the terms and conditions under which non-consultant hospital doctors are employed are presently under review and these issues will be addressed within the context of this review.</P>

The patient is requested to telephone the hospital on the morning of the proposed admission, for confirmation that a bed is available on that day.</P>

    <P>The position regarding this patient is that he was given provisional admission <Col N="1789" /> dates for 16 October 1992, 12 February 1992 and 10 June 1992.  On these dates, when the patient contacted the hospital on the morning of the proposed admission, he was advised that a bed was not available.  Provisional admission dates for 4 December 1991 and 11 May 1992 were cancelled by the patient himself.  The hospital has no record of the patient arriving at the hospital and being refused admission.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the measures and research which has been funded by his Department since the onset of HIV-AIDS in Ireland; whether the increasing spread of the HIV virus is due to sexual intercourse and the sharing of dirty needles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current epidemiology of AIDS emphatically states that abusing intravenous drugs particularly by sharing needles and sexual intercourse with an infected person are high risk behaviours. The epidemiological development of AIDS and HIV infection in Ireland is similar to that experienced in other Western European countries.  From 1981 to 1985 cases were reported in homosexuals and haemophiliacs and the condition was seen as a largely imported disease.  When sero-prevalence monitoring became possible in 1985 it was apparent that the HIV virus was indigenous in the country and that a particular problem existed in relation to the spread of HIV infection in IV drug abusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date we have 276 cases of AIDS reported which meet CDC-WHO definition. <Col N="1791" /> Some 1,214 people have tested HIV positive.  In common with other countries in the EC the spread of transmission in homosexuals is slowing down, presumably due to changes in the lifestyle of homosexuals in the mid eighties.  The percentage of IV drug related cases is now 40 per cent of all cases as compared to 10.5 per cent in 1986.  This movement of the epidemic towards the drug abuser has led to a steady increase in the number of heterosexual cases.  The figures for heterosexual cases show a rise from 6.6 per cent in 1986 to 9.4 per cent in 1989 in the EC countries.  Nine per cent of Irish cases are heterosexual.  In 1986 we had no heterosexual case in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the context of the evolving epidemiology of the disease in Ireland the National AIDS Strategy Committee have recently adopted a series of recommendations under the following headings:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the care and management of persons with HIV-AIDS;</P>
    <P>&mdash; HIV-AIDS surveillance;</P>
    <P>&mdash; education and prevention strategies;</P>
    <P>&mdash; measures to avoid discrimination.</P>
    <P>These recommendations are now being implemented and investment in this process is on-going.  As the Deputy is aware the Government have made available substantial additional resources services this year totalling £3.3 million.  The measures being implemented build upon the AIDS strategy which has been progressively implemented since the 1980s. This strategy consists of:</P>
    <P>&mdash; research into the prevalence of the disease through monitoring of AIDS cases, deaths from AIDS and prevalence of HIV;</P>
    <P>&mdash; research into paediatric AIDS cases</P>
    <P>&mdash; education and prevention programmes on AIDS through a range of programmes implemented primarily <Col N="1792" /> by my Department's health promotion unit;</P>
    <P>&mdash; specific services for the care and management of persons with AIDS or HIV;</P>
    <P>&mdash; general services provided and funded by my Department through the allocations to health agencies.</P>
    <P>Evaluation of prevention, treatment and care programmes is on-going and an essential ingredient of current strategies. Such evaluation ensures that services are effective, are adequately tested and in line with best international practice and developments.</P>
    <P>My Department are also supporting the research and development unit in primary care for HIV and AIDS of the Royal College of Surgeons which is currently assessing the strength and difficulties associated with the provision of a comprehensive primary care service in Dublin to persons with HIV and AIDS. Evaluation of the community care service will provide important assessment on costs, manpower and quality of care of primary care services.</P>

The specialities involved are medical and surgical.  No speciality service is discontinued as a result of these measures.  Bed closures are planned to coincide with periods when staff are on annual leave and has <Col N="1793" /> been the practice for a number of years. All emergency and urgent services will, of course, continue to be provided.  The board estimates that it is intended to save £75,000 to £100,000 through summer bed closures.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the housing needs as ascertained in the latest assessment carried out by Drogheda Corporation.  Approval has issued to the corporation to invite tenders for a seven house scheme at Chord Road/Oulster Lane which was the nomination of the corporation in response to the &ldquo;starts&rdquo; for which they were given authorisation for 1992.  As the corporation did not nominate the houses at Marley's Lane as &ldquo;starts&rdquo; for their 1992 programme the question of approval does not arise at this stage.</P>

      <P>While I am aware of the newspaper report referred to, a copy of the study to which it relates has not yet been received by me or my Department.  The report refers to a drop of 13 per cent in real terms in Government funding for non-national road maintenance between 1988 and 1992 but I am at a loss as to how this figure was arrived at.  The facts are that in 1988 a total of £10.1 million was allocated in grants for the maintenance of non-national roads while the corresponding figure in 1992 is £12.3 million. This is an increase of 1.65 per cent in real terms using the inflators laid down in the Annual Construction Industry Review and Outlook Document.  In addition, State grants for the improvement of non-national roads have averaged £59.752 million over the 1988-1992 period, as against an average of £26.246 million in the previous five-year period.</P>

      <P>The application of low speed limits on sections of national roads, where these are not warranted in the interest of road safety, can lead to pressure for development along these sections of road, thereby reducing their traffic carrying capacity and their effectiveness as national routes.  It was for this reason that, following consideration of the speed <Col N="1799" /> limit proposals presented by Limerick County Council and Limerick Corporation for the city and county generally, I decided not to approve the proposal to apply a 40 mph limit on national road N69 at Kilcorman.</P>

      <P>Since 1930, the texts of agreements to which the State has become a party &mdash; whether by way of signature, ratification or other procedure &mdash; are published by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the Treaty Series which is available in the Dáil Library.  This series does not, however, include agreements of a purely technical and administrative character nor does it include multilateral agreements drawn up under the auspices of international organisations such as the UN, the Council of Europe or the European Communities since these agreements are available from these bodies.</P>
      <P>The Treaty Series is regularly updated. The most recent issue is No. 9 of 1992. The series also includes an index published at regular intervals, the most recent of which gives a tabular chronological list of international agreements to which the State is a party.  It provides details up to the end of 1986; and a new index to bring the series up to date is in preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these arrangements at national level every international agreement must be registered with the UN under Article 102 of the Charter.  The UN publishes a Register of Treaties giving information on such agreements.  This register includes the bilateral and multilateral agreements to which Ireland is a party.  A print-out from the register up to mid-1985, which runs to 600 pages, is <Col N="1800" /> available for inspection at the Department of Foreign Affairs if the Deputy should wish to see it.  No separate register is kept by the Department of Foreign Affairs of international agreements which have been signed on behalf of the State but which have not yet been ratified.</P>
    <P>The implementation measures to give legal effect within the State to international agreements and conventions to which the State has become a party involve a very great range of legislation, Government orders, ministerial orders and administrative practice.  For the most part, these measures do not involve the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I consider that the compilation of a comprehensive list showing every agreement to which Ireland has become party since the foundation of the State, together with a listing of the extent to which they have passed into law through legislative and other measures, would require a disproportionate allocation of time and resources for the necessary research and consultation and this, I think, would not be justified.  However, if the Deputy wishes to table a question on any specific agreement I will be glad to furnish the most comprehensive information available to me on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Government are very concerned about the situation in Southern Africa, where an estimated 40 million people are under threat of starvation following one of the worst droughts of this century.  The situation is compounded by the presence of huge numbers of refugees fleeing civil war and famine. The combination of drought and civil conflict has had a devastating effect on crop production.  Most of the countries in the region are in urgent need of food supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has contributed almost £1 million to disaster relief this year.  Much of this has been directed towards the Horn of Africa.  However, since January Ireland has allocated a total of £300,000 from the Disaster Relief Fund to Southern Africa.  In June, £100,000 was allocated to Tanzania and £50,000 to Lesotho in response to the Consolidated UNSADCC Appeal for Drought Emergency in Southern Africa.  This was additional to an earlier allocation of £100,000 to the UN World Food Programme for their supplementary feeding programme in <Col N="1803" /> Zambia and an allocation of £50,000 to Trócaire for emergency food programmes in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P>The crisis in Southern Africa has also brought a swift response from the European Community.  Of the 800,000 tonnes of cereals which have been allocated to Africa and other regions of the world under the Special Emergency Programme, 350,000 tonnes are destined for the countries of Southern Africa. Ireland's contribution to this operation is estimated at £1 million.  This contribution, through the European Community, is additional to the amounts we have contributed directly as outlined above.</P>

      <P>The Government is strongly committed to supporting the UN Secretary-General's plan for the organisation of a referendum for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.  The Secretary-General is endeavouring to implement that plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that (a) an unspecified number of settlers from Morocco have moved into the Western Sahara and (b) there have been violations of the cease-fire by the Moroccan Army.  In his periodic reports to the Security Council the Secretary-General has attributed most of the cease-fire violations to Morocco. However, the Secretary-General has <Col N="1804" /> noted with satisfaction that there have been no exchanges of fire between the two sides and no deaths resulting from internationl hostile action since the deployment of MINURSO, United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, began in September 1991.  Most of the cease-fire violations have involved the strengthening of military position which is prohibited under the terms of the plan.  I am also aware that MINURSO has experienced both logistical and local administrative difficulties in carrying out its mission but the Secretary-General has intervened personally in order to secure the full cooperation of the parties with MINURSO.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr. Yaqub Khan, made a tour of the mission area and neighbouring countries from 19 to 30 April 1992.  He held meetings with the King of Morocco and the Secretary-General of the Polisario Front and concluded that their respective positions remained far apart and continued to present serious obstacles to the implementation of the plan. He was encouraged to find, however, that both parties were still committed to the plan as a framework for a just and permanent solution to the Western Sahara conflict.</P>

      <P>The person named was deemed ineligible for grants under the 1991 special beef premium scheme as four of the 38 animals on which he applied for premium had already been paid in his own herd and one other was a female. This exceeded the tolerance laid down by EC Regulations.  However, the applicant has submitted a medical certificate, part of which is illegible and which requires clarification before my Department can make a decision in the case.  My Department's decision will be conveyed to the applicant as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>A special departmental task force was set up earlier this year to examine problems being encountered in the operation of the special beef premium and other livestock headage schemes.  Certain recommendations were made by the task force in regard to the operation of the special beef premium scheme and these recommendations were accepted by me. Applications lodged under the scheme in June 1991 were reviewed by local offices of my Department in the light of these recommendations and as a result the number of applicants paid under the 1991 special beef premium scheme who lodged their applications in June 1991 is now over <Col N="1807" /> 88,300, that is, over 200 more than the number paid for 1990.</P>

Under the relevant Community legislation to be found in Article 3a of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 857/84 such quota could only be granted where the applicant satisfied the Department of his or her ability to produce milk to the extent of the special quota applied for and gave undertakings to resume milk sales or deliveries and not to apply for assistance under any programme for the abandonment of milk quotas.  In refusing to sign the requisite declarations and undertakings constituting part of the relevant application form the producer in question indicated that the level of the quota (60 per cent of the premium gallonage) was useless to him and that he also needed to be compensated for being without a quota since 1985.  His application had eventually to be turned down for persistent failure by him to give the necessary undertakings, and he was so informed.</P>

    <P>The 27 per cent reduction in the level of the first advance of the 1992 ewe premium compared to the previous year is based on an estimated premium which will be amended in the light of market developments within the Community between now and the end of this year. The amount of the rural world premium paid to producers in disadvantaged areas has been increased from £3.52 per ewe to £4.83 in 1992.  The combined value of the rural world premium and the first advance of the ewe premium, which will be paid together, is estimated at £39 million for 1992 as against £42 million for 1991.  A breakdown of the 1992 figure on a county by county basis is not available at this stage.</P>

      <P>The person in question was in receipt of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, including a weekly rent supplement, concurrently, while awaiting determination of her application for lone parent's allowance. This resulted in an overpayment to the person concerned of £964 which is recoverable from her.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the North-Eastern Health Board, who are responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in County Monaghan, that when the overpayment came to light the person in question agreed to forego her rent supplement until such time as the overpayment was cleared.  She subsequently withdrew this agreement.  The health board will contact her with a view to devising suitable arrangements to recover the amount due. In the meantime the rent supplement will be restored.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline (a) the amount of money due to his Department because of overpayment in each of the years between 1987 and 1991 and (b) the amount of such money written off as unrecoverable in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are set out in the following tabular statement.  Comprehensive details an analysis of overpayments and recoveries are presented in the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are published together with the certified Appropriation Accounts.  In addition, in his report for the year 1990, the Comptroller and Auditor General deals at length with the accounting treatment of overpayments and with the recent changes in the write-off policy which was sanctioned by the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very substantial increase in overpayments written off in 1990 is directly related to the introduction of revised accounting procedures for overpayments. Up to and including 1989 there was no facility to write-off outstanding balances on benefit overpayments while <Col N="1820" /> there were limited facilities in relation to assistance overpayments.</P>
    <P>This resulted, over the years, in the accumulation of very large balances of outstanding overpayments, on which there was little or no chance of recovery. In order that these balances should more realistically reflect realisable sums, my Department applied for and obtained Department of Finance sanction to introduce a comprehensive write-off policy.</P>
    <P>As a result £11,952,392 of outstanding social insurance overpayments and £4,150,388 of social assistance overpayments were written off as an exceptional measure in the year 1990.  These amounts represented, for the greater part, overpayments arising at various times since 1952 on which there had been no recent recovery activity.  As the social insurance amounts had been charged in the accounts of the year in which they occurred, their write-off did not involve any additional charge.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that this new time-based write-off facility is essentially an accounting adjustment, designed to ensure that figures for outstanding overpayments are more in line with what can reasonably be expected to be recovered. I might add that even where an overpayment has been written-off, recovery action is taken when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>Additional benefits such as free electricity allowance are available to pensioners over 66 and to persons under 66 who are in receipt of invalidity pensions or disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>An invalidity pensioner who transfers to widow's pension scheme and who is under 66 years of age, would lose her entitlement to additional benefits as she would not be in receipt of a qualifying payment.  She could, however, opt to remain on invalidity pension after becoming a widow.</P>
      <P>There are a number of situations in which widows under 66 lose entitlement to additional benefits.  Any extension of entitlement to such benefits would, however, have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  The cost of extending the free schemes to widow pensioners generally is estimated at £12 million per annum.</P>

The concessions available and the ages at which they apply differ as between different member states.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has not yet received a decision on his application for occupational injury benefit, even though the application was submitted in January 1992, and especially in view of the fact that he was promised a decision when the medical report was obtained from the South Infirmary in Cork.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disablement benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme on 31 January 1992 in respect of occupational deafness.</P>
      <P>Deafness is one of the occupational diseases prescribed under the occupational injuries scheme.  However, one of the qualifying conditions for benefit requires the claimant to have been working in one of the employment categories prescribed in respect of the disease and to have made a claim within five years from the date last employed in that employment.</P>
      <P>The claimant was employed with a firm of tool makers from 1972 to 1987.  Inquiries made from his employer indicated that he was last employed in 1978 in an occupation prescribed in respect of the disease and that after that time he was employed in a different occupation which would not come within the prescribed categories.  On that basis he failed to satisfy the conditions for disablement benefit.  The claimant is now being asked whether he agrees with his employer's statement regarding his employment from 1978 onwards and, if not, to furnish evidence to show his employment came within the prescribed categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decision regarding the claimant's deafness will arise until it is determined whether his employment from 1978 onwards came within the prescribed categories. <Col N="1825" /> He has furnished a medical audiogram report in relation to his deafness. He has also been examined by a consultant surgeon attached to the South Infirmary in Cork but a copy of this report has not been forwarded to my Department as yet.</P>

      <P>The requirement to take account of board and lodging has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants in different family circumstances, between applicants whose parents are well-to-do and those whose parents are in poor circumstances.  Otherwise persons living in affluent circumstances would become entitled to the same level of assistance as those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
      <P>The value of the benefit of free board and lodging is assessed by reference to the net income of the persons providing the free board and lodging divided by the number of non-earning members of the household.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has not provided details of any specific cases he has in mind. However, I am satisfied that the underlying principle of relating the value of board and lodging in any case to the income level of the household in which an applicant resides is essentially a good one and that it should remain a feature of the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that there are a variety <Col N="1826" /> of means tests for different schemes and my Department are attempting to rationalise the assessment procedures.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the granting of maternity benefit calculated at 70 per cent of the amount the woman was earning in the reckonable year within two tax years before the claim was made can result in a serious loss of her income if she was also on maternity leave during the reckonable year; and if he has any proposals to remove this anomaly.</Quest>

      <P>The weekly rate of social insurance maternity allowance payment is 70 per cent of the claimant's average reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant tax year, subject to a minimum payment of £60 per week and a maximum payment of £154 per week.  The relevant tax year is the last complete income tax year before beginning of the benefit, i.e. calendar year in which the first day of maternity leave occurs.</P>
      <P>Maternity benefit is not treated as income for the purposes of determining average reckonable earnings.  However, the minimum payment of £60 under the scheme assures that recipients whose earnings in the relevant tax year are low do not have their entitlements reduced below the level of other analogous social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>An EC Directive concerning the protection of pregnant workers is currently under consideration.  It is expected that this Directive will be adopted before the end of 1992.  The maternity benefit scheme will be reviewed in the light of the Directive once it is adopted and the issue raised here will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>As part of arrangements made in 1986 for implementing EC Directive 79/7 on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security, the then Government put in place a number of temporary alleviation payments.</P>
      <P>These alleviation payments, initially £20.00 per week for a person whose spouse was receiving a social welfare payment in her own right and £10.00 per week plus half rate increases for children where the spouse had income of over £50.00 per week from employment, were made from November 1986 for a period of one year.</P>
      <P>During 1987, the Government decided to continue the alleviation payments beyond the 12 month period set by the previous Government but to phase them out over a period of time.  Phasing out began in 1988 with the payments being gradually reduced each year to their present level of £12.00 and £6.00.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from recent decisions of the European Court of Justice, it has emerged that these alleviation payments are in conflict with the principle of equal treatment.  These payments are being discontinued, therefore, with effect from 30 July 1992, coinciding with the date of implementation of this year's budget increases.  However, many of the families affected by the discontinuance of these payments will be entitled to payments under retrospective legislation arising from the delay of the then Government in implementing the 1979 EC Directive on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security. Accordingly, married women who were affected by this delay will have equal treatment arrangements applied to them retrospectively for a period between December 1984 and November 1986.  In <Col N="1829" /> 1992 £22 million has been provided for these extra payments which will be made on a phased basis between 1992 and 1994.</P>
    <P>Figures of the number of people in receipt of alleviating payments by social welfare payment category are not readily available.  Overall, some 10,000 people are in receipt of alleviating payments, of whom approximately 6,000 are in receipt of the £12 alleviating payment.  Approximately 4,000 people are in receipt of the £6 alleviating payment, of whom some 1,400 are also in receipt of an alleviating payment in respect of child dependants.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will review the request of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 7 for a free electricity allowance in view of the fact that she was a previous recipient under her late husband's name.</Quest>

      <P>In order to qualify for a free electricity allowance a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and be living alone or with certain &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; categories of people.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a qualifying payment but is residing with her son who is in full-time employment. The &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; condition of the scheme was not satisfied in her case and her application for the allowance had to be rejected on these grounds.</P>
      <P>However, under an extension to the scheme introduced with effect from 1 October 1990, pensioners aged 80 years or over are allowed to retain the free electricity allowance in a situation where someone comes to live with them. Furthermore, the allowance can be restored to any person aged over 80 where she/he had previously lost it on these grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned has just attained 80 years of age.  Unfortunately, as she was never in receipt of a free electricity allowance in her own right, the terms of the scheme do not permit award of the allowance in her household circumstances. Any development of the scheme to provide for cases such as hers would <Col N="1830" /> have a cost implication and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1977 allows parties to a recommendation to appeal to the Labour Court not later than 42 days from the date of the recommendation. Because of the complex issues involved in the case considerable notice of the hearing date was given to facilitate the parties concerned in preparing their submissions.  The appeal is scheduled to be heard by the court on 7 July 1992.</P>
