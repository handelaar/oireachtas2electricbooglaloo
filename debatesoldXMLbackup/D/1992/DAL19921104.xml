      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 5, 12 and 13.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) the proceedings on the Committee and remaining Stages of No. 12, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7.00 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment; (2) The proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 13 shall be brought to a conclusion at 9.15 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate, notwithstanding the resolution of the Dáil on 3 November 1992; (i) the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes and (ii) the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be called upon not later than 9.05 p.m. to make a speech in reply not exceeding ten minutes; (3) on the conclusion of the Second Stage of No. 13, Item 5 shall be decided without debate and the Committee and remaining Stages of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1992 shall be taken forthwith, and shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments <Col N="1922" /> include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs; (4) the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. today; (5) business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight; (6) questions for oral answer shall not be asked tomorrow and, accordingly, Government business shall not be interrupted at 2.30 p.m. on that day and (7) private Members' Business shall be No. 19 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>We all probably have reservations about some aspects of No. 12, the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, which is an important reforming measure. However, there are 180 amendments to it including certain critical amendments which everybody would like to see dealt with.  Would the Taoiseach be agreeable to the spokespersons dealing with the Bill agreeing a schedule with the Whips to ensure that certain amendments are reached during the course of the debate? Some amendments need to be debated and it would be helpful to the House if agreement could be reached.</P>

Having said that, there is important business to be done on behalf of the nation at present, namely, the completion of the Northern Ireland talks which must finish this week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I seek clarification on a matter?  I am sure the history books will give the Taoiseach a certain amount of credit for causing the election.  It is my understanding that the order in respect of the referendum was signed by the Minister for the Environment on Monday evening of this week even though the Taoiseach promised us yesterday that it would be signed some time this week. May I ask the Taoiseach, therefore, if a general election is called tomorrow will both be held on the same day or will we have the general election with the referenda being postponed?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say to Deputy Barry in response to his question yesterday whether it would be signed yesterday, as it was the last day, that following the Order of Business I telephoned all the people concerned just in case someone thought that I was trying to mislead the Dáil, something I have been accused of before, but I was not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Northern Ireland talks, a serious situation is developing in that it has been indicated that if the Anglo-Irish Conference meeting scheduled for 16 November proceeds the participants on the Unionist side may withdraw from the talks this day week.  In view of the fact that we will be in the middle of a general election campaign on 16 November would the Taoiseach give an undertaking to defer that meeting so as to give the talks some possibility of success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that 16 November is the date set and agreed by both the British and Irish Governments for the next Anglo-Irish Conference.  If some parties decide to withdraw from the talks prior to or after that date that would be a matter for them, but I want to assure the House that there is no deadline.  I have made it clear previously that if more time is required after 16 November I will be forthcoming and provide more time but I wanted to have the principle and practice clearly established that the Intergovernmental Conference would not be set aside or undermined.  I do not know whether any <Col N="1927" /> of the parties concerned are going to withdraw from the talks before 16 November but that is their prerogative.  As I said, that date will not mark the end of the talks nor is it a deadline but rather it is the date set and agreed to by both Governments for the next Anglo-Irish Conference.  I refer Deputy De Rossa to Question No. 7 on today's Order Paper to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this subject.</P>

The intention of amendments 2 and 3 is to ensure that the Bill will be brought into effect in time for the forthcoming general election, which we all know is going to take place.  If the Minister assures me that these provisions will be in effect for 26 November, or whatever date is set for <Col N="1929" /> the election, I would be happy to accept that and would not proceed with the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposition that we schedule our business in such a way that we do not delay unduly on certain matters.  One of the most important provisions in this legislation is the increase in the deposit paid by people standing for election.  That matter is way down on the list of amendments and I hope we take a little time to debate it.  I have not put down amendments to this section, and I support the view put forward by Deputy Dukes.  I take it from the Minister's response to the debate last week on the abortion referendum Bills that he intends that this legislation will be in place in time for the referendum on 3 December.  I presume that undertaking still stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely anxious to ensure that every provision of the Bill is brought into effect as soon as possible, particularly those provisions relating to the more serious aspects of the legislation. There is a timescale to be met as Deputies on all sides of the House, particularly those with experience in Government, will appreciate.  However, as many provisions as possible will be brought into effect, particularly those which I have already indicated to the House are essential.  Deputies have my continuing commitment and undertaking in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1930" /> In page 12, lines 5 to 9, to delete subsection (6).</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to ensure that the Bill comes into effect as soon as it is passed in this House and that no Cabinet decision, ministerial order or discussion in the House can change that position.  It should apply to any referendum or election that may take place in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I intend to withdraw a large number of amendments down in my name.  In the Seanad there were eight days of discussion on Committee Stage of the Bill. A Bill such as this which will apply to elections for many years to come deserves thorough scrutiny in this House. All of us agree that the supplementary register should be in place to allow the maximum number of people to vote in an immediate election.  One of the main reasons our party have agreed that this Bill be put through the House as soon as possible without proper surveillance over its many provisions is to ensure that it will be in place for the forthcoming general election.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> I think Deputy Kavanagh will appreciate that in all legislation of this kind there has been a standard provision for commencement orders which bring into effect different parts of the legislation as soon as is necessary.  I gave a commitment in this regard last week, which I intend to meet in so far as is possible.  I wish there was no time constraint to discussion of this Bill because I am as concerned as Deputies are to ensure that the matter is fully dealt with and that we have the best possible legislation.  It is a long time since we considered electoral legislation and these reforms are very necessary. However, we are faced with a time constraint over which none of us has control.</P>
    <P>In relation to the supplemental register, all the resources of the local authorities will be used in putting such a register in place.  However, in circumstances in which application forms must be prepared, where the local authority have to put a system in place and where the appeals must be deposited with the returning officer &mdash; and dealt with a clear 12 days before election day &mdash; it would be unfair to have a provision in the Bill which does not allow for manoeuvre.  I would dearly like this provision to be included because, too often, people who have voted all their lives are not included on the register and one of the reasons for this change is that that could not arise again.  I have looked at every option available to me but it cannot be included.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment, very few Acts have the requirement that all provisions would be in place immediately, disregarding any other contingency or circumstances.</P>

Will the Minister indicate whether the provisions in the Bill in relation to the harassment and obstruction of voters at polling stations, <Col N="1932" /> the provisions in relation to special voters and the amended provisions in relation to the deposit will be in place in time for the election on 26 November?</P>

In regard to Deputy Dukes's queries, I intend to implement all the matters to which he referred.  Last week we discussed whether canvassers should have to remain 50 or 100 metres from polling booths.  I have decided that 100 metres is more suitable.  I have checked the matter thoroughly and I am advised that I can meet the wishes of the House in this regard.</P>

We must remember that we are not just dealing with the system in place, the application which must be made and adjudicated on, because if we rushed matters in this area in regard to a general election or a referendum, this House would be taking more than a risk by rushing it through without complying with the normal requirements of equity and fairness.  I sought, by every means open to me within the time constraints, to see if it was possible to implement it because it is a provision I should like to <Col N="1933" /> see effected but, with the best will in the world, it is extremely &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; unlikely that we can implement this provision at present.</P>

There are also other important provisions but this is the most important and a number of Deputies thought it would be in operation.  The way we are dealing with the Bill means that we will have less time to give it the attention it deserves and if its most important provision cannot be implemented we will be merely making cosmetic changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), to delete lines 1 to 4.</P>
      <P>Because we are dealing here with the interpretation section this amendment really forms the basis for action further on in the Bill, in particular, affecting the provisions of section 50 (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has to do with the delivery of nomination papers and the days in which returning officers must make themselves available.  I am worried that continuing with the practice of excluded days in some cases may shorten the period available to candidates between the date which they lodged their nomination papers and actual election day.  It is reasonable to propose that we simply remove this idea of excluded days from the Bill in order to give candidates as much time as possible during the course of an election to talk to and canvass voters.  My feeling is that providing for excluded days, in the manner in which we do here and in section 50 (3), will give rise to circumstances in which the time available to candidates will be reduced. I do not wish to sound at all offensive in saying this, I know it is the normal practice that Sundays and public holidays are days on which people do not normally work.  But I would suggest that, in the course of any election covered by the provisions of this Bill, but more particularly a general election which occurs less frequently, certainly somewhat less frequently in recent years than they did in 1981 and 1982 &mdash; it is not unreasonable for us to ask returning officers to make themselves available on the few occasions on which it would happen on a Sunday <Col N="1935" /> or public holiday for the convenience of candidates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 contains a definition of the expression &ldquo;excluded day&rdquo; which is used throughout the Bill specifying how periods of time are to be calculated for various processes, such as the period allowing for nominations, or notification to returning officers of details of persons appointed by candidates to act as personation agents or to attend at the count and or adjournment of the poll in the case of obstruction of the poll by violence.  An &ldquo;excluded day&rdquo; is defined as a Sunday, Good Friday or a day declared to be a public holiday by the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  Every circumstance which excluded days are not counted in calculating periods of time is specified in the Bill.</P>
      <P>These amendments provide for the deletion of the definition of &ldquo;excluded day&rdquo; in section 2 and deletion of the reference to it where it occurs in the Bill. In my view Deputy Dukes has got it wrong; having excluded days not counted I contend lengthens rather than shortens the period of opportunity for nomination. That is the first point I would make.  Therefore, instead of having nine clear days with no exclusions, for the sake of argument, there could be at least 11 days and, if there were a public holiday, 12, during which time a candidate was afforded an opportunity of meeting the requisite obligations in this regard.  I do not know whether Deputy Dukes has had the opportunity I have had of having a nomination handed in on an &ldquo;excluded day&rdquo;.  A returning officer can, if he or she so wishes, accept a nomination any time, and will agree a time with a candidate taking into account whatever constraints of time may obtain.  Having regard to that fact I appreciate what the Deputy wishes to do, with which I agree, but I do not think he achieves it as well as I do in the provisions, as they stand, which I contend should not be amended in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say I disagree <Col N="1936" /> with the Minister.  The Minister achieves what I want to achieve, as the law stands at present, only by the grace and favour of returning officers.  I accept that there are cases where returning officers themselves allow a certain amount of leeway. Section 50 (3) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>(3)  The returning officer shall attend to receive nominations at the place specified in that behalf in the notice of election between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon and between the hours of 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on the day (disregarding and excluded day) before the latest date for receiving nominations and between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon on the said latest date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the latest date for receiving nominations were to be, for example, a Monday, that would mean that a returning officer could not accept nominations on the Sunday; he could accept them on the Saturday or Monday but not on the Sunday.  I understand that returning officers like to have Sundays at home with their families which would be the wish of most of us in this House and which we will not have for the next few weeks. I am saying simply that if we delete this provision for an &ldquo;excluded day&rdquo;, on the one hand, people presenting nomination papers will know that they can present them on the day before the last day, or on the last day, whatever day that happens to be.  The returning officers would then know there were no such excluded days and would not be placed in the position of having to make an exception which I know they do frequently for the convenience of candidates. In such circumstances everybody would know where they stood.  Since the events about which we speak happen theoretically once in every five years, in practice once in every three and a half years, sometimes three times in a year and a half, I contend they are not that hugely frequent as to disturb the normal, even tenor of family life of returning officers.  I contend the inconvenience occasioned for candidates would outweigh <Col N="1937" /> the disadvantage to returning officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I must still argue the fundamental point, that excluded days are used only for the purpose of calculating the time and, in effect, extend the time of opportunity.  I cannot accept Deputy Dukes contention that, in some way, it makes it somewhat more difficult.  In fact, once the Deputy has had an opportunity to rethink the provisions here, I predict he will realise that what we are doing is affording a better opportunity than would be the case under his proposal.  I still believe that in holding the line I am doing a better job than would be the case if I accepted Deputy Dukes' amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In this respect I must agree with the Minister in that I contend he is quite correct when he says that it extends the time.  In any event I do not believe that I or any of my colleagues would want to submit their nominations on a Sunday or public holiday.  In rural areas we would still prefer to avail of the opportunity presented at after-Mass meetings and so on.  In any event I do not think a press call would be answered on a Sunday.  Therefore I think Deputy Dukes should give up on this amendment and let us proceed to the next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 18 to 25, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where regulations or orders under this Act are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House, save in the case of orders proposed to be made under section 96.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a long standing hobby-horse of mine.  I say &ldquo;long standing&rdquo; as it never seems to get a decent gallop because Ministers and Governments by their nature do not like this type of amendment.  The Minister did, indeed, refer to this in his reply on Second Stage. He made the point that there were so many different kinds of orders and regulations to be made under this Bill that he thought it would be rather onerous to bring all of these measures before this House.  I do not agree with that.  In cases such as this where the House has gone to the trouble of passing fairly detailed legislation, the House should be able to keep a track of that legislation as it goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The form of order that I provide for in this amendment is far more in keeping with a democratic parliamentary procedure than the kind of passive order to which we are accustomed.  What is most common in this Bill is that where the Minister makes an order or regulation, it is laid before each House of the Oireachtas and, unless a motion to annul it is passed by either or both Houses within 21 sitting days, it comes into effect. If it is annuled obviously it cannot come into effect but nothing previously done under its terms can be challenged.  That is not a good way to legislate.  If there are issues which we, in passing legislation <Col N="1939" /> want to see coming into effect we should specifically legislate for them and, if necessary put dates or time periods on them.  If there are issues which, by their nature, require a judgment to be made as to the quality or timing of what is to be done &mdash; that is typically the case in relation to orders and regulations &mdash; it should be a conscious act of this House, and not the legislative equivalent of a sin of omission, to let it pass through there.</P>
    <P>That is a better type of order and if we adopted that procedure we would also adopt a different procedure for the provisions in Bills which we want to see passed automatically without further question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see the two amendments are not the same. Deputy Dukes' amendment is a better one.  This point has been debated many times in the House in relation to other Bills.  We need to give more power to this House and not allow regulations to slip through without being noticed.  An important matter such as this should be dealt with in the manner recommended by Deputy Dukes and, therefore, I support his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision along the lines proposed in both these amendments would be inappropriate in this Bill. Section 3 already provides for the laying of regulations, other than regulations made under section 20 amending the Second Schedule, before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made.  Quite rightly any regulations to be made under section 20 amending the registration rules set out in the Second Schedule would have to be approved in draft by both Houses before they are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had this argument over and again and I am proud that the Department <Col N="1940" /> of the Environment have taken up approximately 25 per cent of the Dáil time in 1992 by introducing a range of reforming legislation.  In the Utopian or ideal world there is no argument against Deputy Dukes' proposal.  It provides for more transparency and opportunity for debate.  However, in practical terms &mdash; Deputy Dukes and Deputy Kavanagh have had the experience of serving in Government &mdash; there is a need, particularly in the climate in which we live and bearing in mind the demands that are made on Governments and the decisions that have to be taken, to maintain these provisions.</P>
    <P>Speaking from experience I do not honestly know how this House would cope with such a provision in this Bill. Deputies, for genuine reasons, would want greater transparency for everything. However, in reality it is not practical although there may not be anything fundamentally wrong with it.</P>
    <P>In essence, Deputy Dukes is saying we need more power in this House and Deputy Garland's idea of more power is different to what I would have expected from him.  What this house and, indeed, Central Government need to do is to be prepared to relinquish power and trust local communities more.  Our job is to pass legislation.  We should not interfere in the way Deputy Garland suggests in regard to legislation debated here.  If we do we will clutter up the system even more.  We have had similar queries but today is not the day to argue about this. Nobody is being blamed for the fact that we are constrained in regard to time but on many occasions debate on a whole range of amendments has been curtailed.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan pleaded earlier to have one provision of this Bill covered. He made that plea before as I did when on the other side of the House.  Deputies want all amendments debated but that is just not practical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>For as long as I have been in politics I have been making these points about legislation because I believe the system we use, with respect to the Minister &mdash; I am not criticising him in this regard &mdash; is one that we have lazily slipped into.  It is handy, it is convenient for Governments and it is something perhaps that Parliaments do not pay as much attention to as they should.  It is a sloppy, unsatisfactory and basically undemocratic procedure.  For as long as it continues to arise in Bills, and I am a Member of this House, I will continue to make that argument.  I hope that after some period, whether it is by water dripping on the stone or by me having command of the mill-wheel, we will get a change.</P>
      <P>The Minister did say that he would think it appropriate for a type of Utopian situation.  He should know, as well as I do, that it is part of our job to bring the form of legislation as near to administrative perfection as we can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Minister &mdash; he will not have much time over the next few weeks &mdash; but at a later stage on the Opposition <Col N="1942" /> benches he will have an opportunity &mdash; to reflect on what I said.</P>

I applaud that.  There are cases where this other form of passive order is provided for where I believe the form of order I am proposing and that figures in legislation is more appropriate.</P>
      <P>There are yet other cases where Government have used this form of passive order where it was appropriate and where it was open to this House, if it wanted certain things to happen more or less as a matter of course once an Act is passed, to define circumstances in which these things might be done, and gave these powers to the Minister.  What I am arguing for is a clearer definition of where the boundaries of ministerial discretion lie so that we do not have Bills that include in them rather curious provisions which make matters in practice questions of ministerial discretion, which can be overturned by this House if it is awake enough and can manage to pass a resolution to do something different within 21 sitting days.  That is the only point.  I take it that this is not an issue on which the Minister will give now.  Even if the Minister wished to give now, which he does not, it is not the kind of procedure that would be appropriate for some of the things we want to do between now and 26 November, so I do not intend to press a division on this matter.</P>

      <P>My amendment has the same purpose as that of Deputy Dukes.  The Minister said that if every order had to be tabled the system would be clogged up.  The Department of the Environment have modern techniques and if it is a question of putting computers into the House to allow us to call up these <Col N="1943" /> orders in the Library we should be able to do that and it would not clog up anything. We are agreed that we want this Bill through today but the orders should be laid before the House because this Bill is not getting the appropriate level of discussion it should in this House.  If the Minister makes orders under this Bill we would like to know about them.  The Minister should agree to these two amendments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Kavanagh's amendment would make matters worse.  From reading subsection (2) of this section it seems that quite clearly every regulation made under this Bill must be laid before the Dáil.  The difference between what the Minister wants and what Deputy Dukes wants relates to how the regulation is dealt with after it reaches the Dáil.  The Minister proposes that the regulations shall have effect unless a resolution proposing their recision is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Towards the end of the subsection it says that the regulation shall be annulled but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.  Surely the procedure should be stayed for the 21 days to enable a motion to rescind the regulation to be tabled.  Deputy Dukes' amendment covers that point.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.  Under the Bill we are faced with the double problem that the Minister may act under the regulations and then have to unscramble whatever has been done if a subsequent recision of the regulation is made.  Deputy Dukes' proposal is the clearer proposal.  The draft regulations should be put before the House and they can be debated if necessary when a formal resolution is being proposed.  This is a very simple amendment.  It is a pity that we will have no Report Stage on this very important Bill but that it will be railroaded through here today.  I am sure <Col N="1944" /> Opposition amendments will not be accepted and it is most unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to be totally confused as to what this is about.  This is about taking powers from the Minister and the civil servants.  That is not the principle of subsidiarity to which the Minister refers.  The principle of subsidiarity is a major focal point of the Green Party.  We have always maintained the principle of subsidiarity.  We do not want the Oireachtas, the Minister or the civil servants interfering unduly in local affairs, but this is not a local matter, it is a national matter.  It is a question of the interconnection between the Parliament and the Minister.  As much power as possible should be devolved on the Oireachtas in this and in many other areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), line 37, to delete &ldquo;was, on the qualifying date&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;is&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to give a vote to a person who is 18 years of age.  The introduction of qualifying dates means that people who are 18 on the date of an election but who were not 18 at the qualifying date are not able to vote, even though they may have been aged 18 for nine months or so.  All young people expect to have certain responsibilities and rights, one of those rights being the right to vote in an election, on the attainment of their 18th birthday.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will say that there has to be organisation, that we have to do things in an orderly fashion and that the Department of the Environment have always shown organisation during the Minister's time of office and, indeed, under the administration of former Ministers for the Environment.  We are now in the age of technology and it is my contention that we can take steps to ensure that where possible, within the matter of a few weeks, those people who have attained the age of 18 are not deprived of their right to vote in an election and be part of making a decision that will affect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enforcement of the qualifying date will exclude hundreds and thousands of young people from participating in an <Col N="1947" /> election, including the upcoming election. The establishment order has provided that a person has to be 18 on a particular date in April.  We are now in November so the imposition of a qualifying date in April will exclude many people from the right to vote.  I could perhaps accept the Minister saying that he will consider my proposals maybe not for the forthcoming election but as a point worth examining.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should address this issue in the workings of the Bill.  The amendments concern a very disturbing aspect.  I am sure that every one of us when coming up to an election and taking a campaign from house to house has been presented by a disappointed young person who says that he or she has reached the age of 18 but will not be entitled to vote because he or she is not on the register.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister must have a date from which to operate, that there must be a qualifying date.  Some means has to be devised whereby people can go through the act of registration and be included in a printed list.  All of these requirements have to be met; they are reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In meeting the desire that Deputy Kavanagh has, would it not be possible to rearrange the legislation so that when a person reaches the age of 17 years or an age less than 18 years and will be 18 years by the qualifying date or thereafter he or she will be entitled to register?  I wonder whether one's entitlement to registration could arise as and of the date of age of 17 whereas one's entitlement to vote would not arise before attainment of the age of 18.  In that way a person from the age of 17 years would be entitled to be on the register.  Already many different status of voters are marked on the register. For example, a note is made of a person who is entitled to vote only in local, European or Dáil election, depending on his or her circumstances and, more particularly, origin.  We can identify status on the register and we could identify people who are 17 years <Col N="1948" /> and upwards.  Persons so noted would then be required to produce at the polling station a birth certificate or some other document that would prove that on election day they had reached the age of 18 years and were therefore entitled to vote. This is an important matter.</P>
    <P>In general, we say that the right to vote is achieved at the age of 18 years yet there is the problem that people are not entitled to register until they reach the age of 18 years, which in many cases means that people have to wait for the following year before they can be included on the register.  That is basically unfair.  The system as we operate it works against people.  We should try to accommodate and encourage people to come in.  We have to be extremely anxious that as many young people as possible become involved in the election process.  It is uppermost in the minds of many young people when they reached the age of 18 that they will be able to have a say in the way in which their country is run, that they will be able to vote.  Nine times out of ten when 18 year olds present themselves at the polling station with a view to voting they are told that they have to wait, which is a great disappointment to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. I particularly support the idea put forward by Deputy McCartan.  There should be a very simple way of resolving this problem.  The legislation provides for a date on which the process of drawing up the register shall start.  It also provides for a date on which the register should come into effect.  It would be a very small matter to provide that instead of being aged 18 years, as is provided in the present legislation, people who had reached the age of 17 years and X months on the qualifying date or on the date that the process of compiling the register began would be eligible for registration. We could require evidence of age to be produced.  In some jurisdictions the register of electors includes the number and an indication of the address of the person, the elector's name and his or her date of birth.  That information could be <Col N="1949" /> requested on the application form.  We could get over the problem of young people who have reached the age of 18 years not qualifying for a vote.</P>
      <P>That problem will be experienced in the upcoming election.  We will be faced with young people who reached the age of 18 in May, June or July but will not be allowed to vote in the forthcoming election.  It is very difficult to explain to an irate young person in that position that because the register came into effect at the beginning of April they will not be allowed to vote, when everybody believes that they should be allowed to vote on reaching the age of 18.  If we were to specify that persons would be entitled to vote from the coming into effect of a register if they had reached the age of 17 years and the appropriate number of months when the process of registration started we could resolve any problem in that regard.</P>
      <P>The only difficulty that might arise, which could be dealt with by the proper wording of the legislation, is that there might be some people who, in the event that an election was called very quickly, would have to wait for a vote.  I do not consider that has ever been a problem that should concern legislators in this instance.  If we were to specify that people who had reached the age of 17 years and the appropriate number of months on the date that the registration process started the problem would be solved.</P>

      <P>There is a fair degree of sense in what has been said all round.  By means of these amendments the Deputy cannot achieve his stated objective. There are a number of ways in which this matter can be approached.  First and foremost, there is no requirement to be 18 years on 1 September but rather 18 years of age when the register comes into effect.  That covers part of the problem outlined here.  I should like to outline some of the problems that can emerge. If we had, say, the American system of election every four years one could do a great deal on the lines suggested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us deal with the sense of the amendment because that is what is involved.  I would be anxious to have further discussions at some other time, but I do not think it is appropriate here now, to see what further measures could be taken.  There are strict limits in our Constitution <i>vis-á-vis</i> general elections <Col N="1951" /> and so on as to where there will be a cut off point.  A person does not have to be 18 years on 1 September but rather when the register comes into effect.  I take the point that that fact is not well known and people need to know that is the position. We will have to await other circumstances and other major reforms until we get to the point which the Deputy is seeking.  If there is any scope by way of regulation open to me to enhance the possibilities for young people to cast their vote within the constraints we have, I am very anxious to facilitate the House in doing that.</P>

This is happening.  The Minister should take an early opportunity to rationalise what is now the practice.  The Minister knows this as well as I do and everybody in this House is aware of the practices which take place.  One does not get on the Government benches with the number of votes which Fianna Fáil get without knowing every detail of an Electoral Bill.  We are all aware of what takes place.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, or</P>
      <P>(c) now resides outside the State but was ordinarily resident in that constituency within the period of the preceding five years.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to address one of the signal failures of this Coalition Government in their last few hours.  It is appropriate that some focus is put on the commitment made by the Coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to examine and report on the position of emigrants and their entitlement to vote under the laws of the land.  The Joint Programme for Government promised that at the end of 1991 a report would be made to Government on the position of emigrants.  It was to be prepared by the Attorney General.  I understand the Government have received that report but have not yet made it public for people to consider it or to understand the grounds on which the Government have been advised.  Whatever they were, they have led the Government to the position where they do not intend at any stage to address the position of emigrant voters. I propose in the Electoral (No. 2) Bill that we add a third ground of right for persons to be registered for the purposes of voting in our elections, be they Dáil, presidential or otherwise.  The existing legislation as proposed by the Minister states:</P>
      <P>... if he has reached the age of 18 years and if he was, on the qualifying date&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) a citizen of Ireland, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1954" /> (b) ordinarily resident in that constituency.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>They shall be entitled to vote.  I propose on behalf of Democratic Left that a further right exist for those people who now reside outside the State but were ordinarily resident in a constituency within the period of the preceding five years.</P>
    <P>Basically we propose that emigrants &mdash; to our shame, I do not think the Minister or anyone else knows the number of Irish people who have emigrated &mdash; who were ordinarily resident here during the five years preceding the holding of an election should be entitled to vote.  This is a reasonable amendment.  It proposes that people who, through no fault of their own, are obliged as a result of the impact &mdash; I will not use the emotive word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;&mdash; of the Government's economic and jobs policies to go abroad to look for work should be given at least one opportunity to vote and comment on the Government who forced them to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I think the period of five years is reasonable.  It is conceivable that there could be any number of elections within a five year period &mdash; under our Constitution at least one general election must be held every five years.  It is only reasonable and fair that people who have had to emigrate in search of employment should be given the right, at least on one occasion, to pass judgment on the Government whose policies have forced them to emigrate.  I acknowledge that some emigrants may not ultimately return to this State to take up residency and I accept that such people should not be entitled to vote <i>ad infinitum</i> in elections as they occur here; there must be some link with the State and the Government in power.</P>
    <P>It is arrogant in the extreme for a Government who fail to create the proper climate to keep our citizens here &mdash; the creation of jobs should be the objective of all Governments &mdash; to say that emigrants automatically lose the right to vote in Irish elections.  It has been suggested on previous debates that giving emigrants <Col N="1955" /> a right to vote in Irish elections would require some amendment of the Constitution, but I understand that this is not so.  Article 16 of the Constitution refers to the right of citizens to vote in elections and recognises circumstances in which people may have to live abroad for whatever reasons.  Section 15 of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986, provides that diplomats and other consular personnel working abroad on behalf of the State are entitled to vote; it can be clearly established that once they go abroad their ordinary place of residence is at the consulate or diplomatic residence provided for them by the State. Ambassadors are appointed &mdash; I am open to correction on this point &mdash; for a minimum of four or five years.  Therefore, the argument that the period cannot be as long as five years does not stand up.</P>
    <P>The other interesting provision which exists in our law is section 5 (4) of the Electoral Act, 1963.  This has been a forgotten and ignored provision in the debates which have taken place here, but it has been referred to by the group who are campaigning for emigrants to be given the right to vote.  It provides that a person whose work obliges him to go abroad and who is likely to return here within a period of 18 months, is entitled to be maintained on the electoral register and to vote here.  That provision has survived our constitutional requirements and has not been challenged.  That principle could easily be accommodated in this amendment &mdash; it recognises that there is a likelihood of return.  It is arrogant for any Government who have forced people to go abroad in search of work to suggest that they do not think these people ever intend to return here. I believe it is the aspiration and hope of every emigrant, particularly those who are forced to leave, to return home at the earliest possible opportunity when work is available for them here.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes that all emigrants who go abroad should be given the right on at least one occasion to comment on the performance of the Government whose record ultimately led to their <Col N="1956" /> departure in the first instance.  It is a matter for us to ensure that a Government survive for five years, the constitutional maximum.  It is no fault of emigrants that Governments are cobbled together, in the way the present Government have been cobbled together over the past two years, and cannot survive. This is a very important issue.  I am very happy on behalf of the Democratic Left during, so to speak, the dying hours of the 26th Dáil to make what I regard under the law as an unanswerable case for giving emigrants the right to pass judgment on the performance of the Government who have forced them to emigrate in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. I do not think we need to go into this issue in great depth in the sense that we do not need to debate why so many people have emigrated; such a debate would take a long time.  The fact is that Irish emigrants are effectively being disenfranchised at present.  It is very important that this matter is rectified. One could argue about whether the period should be three, five or ten years, but the Minister must surely accept the principle behind this amendment.  If he suggests a limit of three or four years I would not necessarily disagree with him. I await the Minister's response to see if he is really concerned about our emigrants.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 11 is being discussed with this amendment. One of the disappointing failures of the Government is that having made a commitment to young emigrants that something would be done to ensure that they would have a say in the running of this country has been done in this regard. To my knowledge, the vast majority of people do not want to emigrate and those who have emigrated would willingly return here if proper and gainful employment was available for them.  It strikes me as very strange that American people living in Ireland can register to vote in American elections while young Irish people living in America cannot register to vote in Irish elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not just the Minister's problem. <Col N="1957" /> If it is a decision of the outgoing coalition Government, the promises that something would be done in regard to voting rights for emigrants are clearly not being carried out.  All attempts by my party, particularly by my colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, to raise this problem have met a response outlining the difficulties it would present.  Our amendment on this point was defeated in the Seanad and I imagine the Government will not change their views.  There are many ways that voting rights can be given to emigrants.</P>
    <P>I would have no hesitation in withdrawing this amendment if I knew that the Government were serious about implementing their promise, but since we do not know what the state of affairs will be following the election, I am asking the Minister to accept this amendment.  He has said he will allow for a supplementary register.  We are aware that acceptance of our proposal would not mean that emigrants could vote in the forthcoming election, but the Minister should at least indicate that this is a promise he intends to keep.</P>
    <P>Many people are concerned about this matter and have made representations. A very vociferous group in America and in Britain are looking for a move by the Minister.  I am a member of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and I have met emigrant groups in London, Edinburgh and elsewhere.  This is a priority for them.  There is no great cost involved.  We are simply asking that people who, because of economic circumstances, have had to leave the country be allowed to retain their voting rights.  I am prepared to accept a time limitation such as five years.  I seek an earnest commitment from the Minister that he will accept an amendment on these lines to allow emigrants the right to vote in future elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all persuaded, nor are my party, by the case made for this amendment.  My party proposed a different amendment in the Seanad which would have allowed for the representation of emigrants in that House.  I <Col N="1958" /> have met a great many of the emigrant groups in the United Kingdom and the United States who are pressing for a measure of that kind.</P>
      <P>The situation in which Irish emigrants find themselves cannot be compared with the situation of people who are external voters in United States elections or the election in other countries.  The example of the United States is most frequently given.  The nature of the emigrant population from the United States is very different from the nature of our emigrant population.  It is not the case in the United States that a great many people are forced to go abroad to find employment. Nor in a practical sense would that non-resident electorate constitute anything like the proportion of the overall electorate domestically as would be the case here.  I note that both Deputy McCartan and Deputy Kavanagh are proposing a five-year period, which is considerably less than most of the groups involved are seeking, but that does not change the nature of the problem.</P>
      <P>I do not see the difficulties in terms of how the emigrant population might vote in a political or party sense.  If this House were to take any step of that kind, I hope it would do so because it was considered justified in terms of the rights of individuals, not in terms of our feelings about their political opinions, erroneous as those feelings might be.  The nature of the problem is put in the wrong context by the kinds of comparison which have typically been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the amendment my colleagues put down in Seanad Éireann was not accepted.  I have not tabled the amendment here because I do not see any prospect that it will add anything to the debate.  Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy McCartan were right to point to the undertaking in the Programme for Government, contained in both the Mark I and Mark II versions.  The Government deserve to be condemned for not having done anything about it but they deserve more rightly to be condemned for having put that phrase into the Programme for Government when they knew they would never act on it.  In all their pronouncements <Col N="1959" /> since, they have claimed to be totally opposed philosophically to the concept.</P>

      <P>This issue has been debated for quite some time.  It was also debated in the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and some lengthy reports were produced.  The scarey aspect for the Government is that some hundreds of thousands of voters would be voting without knowing about conditions in this country at the time.</P>
      <P>The Government and Fine Gael are not taking into account the enormous change in emigration patterns.  A man will go to London for a job on a building site lasting three or five months and when it is finished he will return home.  People are even coming back from America after six or eight months.  There has been an enormous change in the pattern of emigration in that people go abroad to take up a job for a specified time and then return.  The idea of a five-year period is probably a very reasonable compromise. Certainly people are being deprived of the vote.  I know of people who are not on the new register when they come home after perhaps nine or ten months aboard trying to earn some money for their families.  They might go abroad again a year or some months later.  There is a very repetitive pattern and probably the emigrants are keeping Aer Lingus going.  There is an enormous flow of people to and from Britain and Europe.</P>
      <P>These amendments will probably not be acceptable but the appropriate Ministers should look at this matter.  It is an issue of justice for people who do not quite see themselves as emigrants in a permanent sense but see themselves as going to earn some money, knowing they will be back.  An election may take place and they will not be on the register.  This involves a matter of simple justice.  It is not a question of trying to get hundreds of thousands of Irish Americans or Irish Australians or Irish people in Britain to vote in elections here.  As a matter of straighforward justice for citizens, the Government should rethink this issue.</P>

      <P>There are obviously differences of opinion on the solving of this problem.  Deputies would have to be under the misapprehension that I was Solomon to think that I could meet the variety of proposals which have been put forward.</P>
      <P>The type of circumstances Deputy Mac Giolla envisages are catered for under another provision of this Bill whereby for the first time, it is proposed that a supplemental register to put in place to allow anybody living in the country, and eligible to vote, 12 days before election day in which to have their name put on that register.  That proposal has been welcomed on all sides and should have been in place before now.  It not only takes account of the circumstances outlined by Deputy Mac Giolla, but of circumstances in which people who have voted all their lives have had their names taken off the register.  Deputy Mac Giolla referred also to people returning to this country while Deputy McCartan referred to those in the Diplomatic Corps &mdash; employees of the State and virtually all of whom return after a period of approximately four year. The Deputy suggested also that some provision be made for people who leave the country for a period of not more than 18 months, people who are normally resident here but who, in the course of their work, have to go abroad.  There is provision in the Bill for people in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>What was clearly outlined was that this matter would be examined and I want to put on the record that it was examined.  Papers were prepared and submitted to the Government and the Attorney General's advice was that it was not possible to interpret our Constitution in a way which would allow voting for emigrants on the basis of what is expected in this area.  In reply to Deputy Dukes, even if we were to go down the road <Col N="1961" /> proposed by Fine Gael in the Seanad, we are still talking about a constitutional amendment and it still would not be anything close to what is being sought.  I am not saying that the proposal is not a reasonable one &mdash; perhaps it could be considered in due course but it would involve a constitutional amendment.  Any constitutional amendment in this area would have to take a number of factors into account, for example, the matter of the people who live, work and pay taxes here.  It would also have to have regard to the circumstances of emigrants.  I do not propose to get involved in an argument regarding who is for or against giving the vote to emigrants.  I have given careful consideration to the matter and I have met with emigrant groups in America and in the United Kingdom.  Any Government would be anxious to find a vehicle by which Irish people living abroad, interested in the affairs of this country and wanting to maintain their ties, would be entitled to vote.  However, the proposals put forward here would not represent the correct way of dealing with the issue.  The Attorney General's advice to the Government is that it would require a constitutional amendment, and that is not in dispute.  Other suggestions have been made but they could not be sustained.  I do not know what options are open to me when I am asked to accept something here which requires a constitutional amendment.  It would be disingenuous to pretend it is a simple matter to resolve.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify the question with regard to the Government.  It is untrue to say that the matter was not examined. It was examined very thoroughly and when the Attorney General's advice was given, other advice was available to the Government to the effect that his interpretation might not be the correct one. For that reason, it was doubly checked and was reaffirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to a number of points made by the Minister. He referred to there being varying opinions on this side of the House, I have no difficulty in agreeing with him in that <Col N="1962" /> regard.  Varying opinions have been expressed but that is no reason for the Minister not to do anything.  This is not a new issue.  As has been pointed out, the Government and their partners mentioned an undertaking in this regard in the Joint Programme for Government.  I said it was proposed to examine the matter, but that examination should be carried out with a view to leading somewhere. It should not be merely an academic exercise to examine the matter and then leave it on a shelf.  The expectation was that having examined the matter the Government would move forward and take some action.  I merely repeated what I knew to be stated in the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding of the Attorney General's advice which, regrettably, is based on second or third hand information, originates from a submission to me from emigrants' rights groups such as, Glór na nDeoirithe.  Their understanding of the issue is that, while the Attorney General believes the matter would have to be facilitated by a constitutional amendment, a number of legislative proposals exist within which the Government could manoeuvre.  For example, in regard to personnel in the diplomatic service, if there is a question of a four year period abroad but with a right, during that time to vote while they are abroad, it is on the understanding that they would have to give notice of a &ldquo;definite intention of returning&rdquo;.  However, the difficulty in regard to emigrants &mdash; those forced to go abroad &mdash; is that there is no certainty as to when they will return. There is a substantial difference in the two interpretations.  People employed directly by the State are given one benefit, in other words, accommodated in our legislation because they have a definite intention of returning while people who are forced to go abroad for economic reasons are in a different position because nobody knows exactly when they will return although 99 per cent of them go in the belief and hope that they will return as soon as possible.  Most emigrants who leave this country, particularly those forced to do so for economic <Col N="1963" /> reasons, have a burning desire to return home as quickly as possible.  Therefore, I do not understand why they are discriminated against compared with people in the direct employment of the State. More importantly, they should not be treated differently from people currently accommodated under the 1963 legislation whereby those who go abroad for reasons of their work &mdash; contract work abroad or whatever &mdash; no longer than 18 months can remain on the register and, obviously, are entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>While the issues are complex, the Minister must be criticised to some extent for not seeking to address them in the legislation.  There were many options open to him.  He could have extended the postal voting system to people who are ordinarily resident here but who, for whatever reason, are working abroad. It is clear that the Government, having examined the matter, have closed the book on it because they do not want to give a voice and a right to people who, by and large, have been badly done by by this Government in the area of jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply must be a great disappointment to people who have had to emigrate and are working abroad.  The Programme for Government promised that this would be examined.  Therefore, there was a real expectation that there would be an initiative after that examination, whether on the basis of the amendment put forward by Fine Gael in the Seanad or by introducing a postal voting system as suggested by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government now say that, because there is a constitutional problem, they will do nothing about it.  Yet, when the Minister and his colleagues met emigrants abroad, they left people with the clear impression that action would be taken.  What the Minister said is on record and I could quote it if he wished. It appears that the Minister wants to get on to other sections as quickly as possible. He knows he left people with the clear impression that action would be taken to enable emigrants to register <Col N="1964" /> their votes.  If the Government had the will to do something in regard to this they would have used a Bill like this to do so.</P>
    <P>We tabled two amendments with different emphases and we knew when we did so what the reply would be, but the Government will not get away with just saying that they examined the situation and it was not feasible to do anything. The Government will hear in the next few weeks from the many people whose sons and daughters were forced to go abroad and who feel they were misled. They are annoyed as are many others. There is very strong feeling both at home and abroad that the Government let the people down by not taking the opportunity afforded by this Bill, and the various referenda that are to be held, to introduce a provision or amend the Constitution to allow people who are working abroad to vote here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Constitution does not provide for a Dáil vote for emigrants.  It would require a constitutional amendment to give emigrants the right to vote. We must ask ourselves if it would be fair to the people who are living, working and paying taxes here to give somebody living in another country equal voting rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the fundamental question.  Do the people of this country wish to give Irish people living permanently in another country the same voting rights as they have?</P>
      <P>On Deputy McCartan's question, it is possible to extend voting rights to those who recently emigrated and have a clear intention of returning.  That is the essence of what is contained in the vote for the Diplomatic Corps and those who will return within 18 months.  However, the groups who are seeking the vote for emigrants envisage different cut off points and, in one of the amendments, it is open ended.  They suggest that people who have been living outside this country for more than ten or 20 years should be allowed to vote.</P>
      <P>First, there is a constitutional problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> Is this something we want to ask the people to adjudicate on?  Second, there are the limited circumstances in which one can allow for the vote which, in my view, are not acceptable to these groups. Third, is it appropriate or fair that people who live on a long term basis outside the country should have exactly the same voice in running this country as those who live, work and pay their tax here?</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that people have to emigrate and many of us would like to change the course of history.  However, this Government cannot be accused of not examining the feasibility of this matter to see what the constitutional or other problems were and, ultimately, come to a final decision.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to what American citizens living outside the US do in an election.  This comparison is rather childish in the context of the differences between the electoral systems and so on. Our electoral system is much more <Col N="1966" /> precise and small numbers in given constituencies will decide the destination of seats.  That has always been the case and I do not think there is any great appetite to change that.  Comparisons between countries that have different electoral systems, and talk of the numbers of people who emigrate and why they do so, are not helpful to this debate.  We looked diligently at this question and we sought the advice of the Attorney General. We looked to see if that advice could be tailored to meet individual needs.  The only area where there is room for manoeuvre is where residents leave this country for employment with the clear intention of returning.  Provision could be made in those circumstances.  That is as far as one can go within the limits of our Constitution.  If we want to go further the people must be consulted.  There is no other way.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw attention to the drafting of this and subsequent sections.  Unfortunately I did not have an opportunity of putting down amendments but I would ask the Minister to consider the wording of this section which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person shall be entitled to be registered as a presidential elector in a constituency if he has reached the age of eighteen years and if he was, on the qualifying date, a citizen of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is not oddball, feminist talk.  It is in a document which is expected to become law and which deals with citizenship, the right to vote and the registration of electors. As section 7 and the subsequent sections, 8, 9, 10 and 11, are drafted only males have the right to be registered to vote.</P>
      <P>There is no mention in the definitions that where the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; occurs it also covers &ldquo;she&rdquo;.  There is nothing to the effect that &ldquo;he&rdquo; covers anyone but the male person.  It would be very simple for the drafters to state that a person shall be entitled to be registered as a presidential elector in a constituency if that person reached the age of 18 and was, on the qualifying date, a citizen of Ireland.  It is quite a simple drafting procedure, but the drafters have in their minds the old male kind of theory, that only men vote. Surely it would be simple to redraft that and subsequent sections, including those dealing with the diplomatic corps where there is reference to &ldquo;his spouse.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill has been put through the Seanad and is now going through the Dáil but nobody seems to give a damn that women are not encompassed in the legislation. Any such wording could be contested in court on the grounds that rights for women are not specified.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P>In page 39, subsection (5), line 10, to delete &ldquo;the expression `Non-Party' &rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any expression, which in the opinion of the returning officer&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) cannot be confused with the name of any political party registered in the Register of Political Parties as a party organised to contest a Dáil election;</P>
      <P>(b) is not misleading or likely to cause confusion; and</P>
      <P>(c) is not unduly long;&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would allow an Independent candidate to put something other than &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; opposite his name on the ballot paper.  He or she should be allowed to put any description, within reason, such as &ldquo;fascist&rdquo;, &ldquo;communist&rdquo;, &ldquo;environmentalist&rdquo;, &ldquo;anti-drugs candidate&rdquo; and so on.  There are many precedents for this in other countries, particularly in Britain, in which Screaming Lord Sutch and his Monster Raving Loony Party stand in elections.  If people want to describe themselves in that way on a ballot paper they should be allowed to do so.  It would obviate the ridiculous practice which obtained in the case of our former colleague calling himself &ldquo;Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus&rdquo;. Do we really have to ask people to go to the trouble and expense of changing their names so that the issues for which they stand are apparent to electors when they come to a polling station to vote?  It would be much easier to allow candidates to use a simpler description.  I have gone to a lot of trouble in wording this amendment, which I hope will be accepted as it stands. The provisions of my amendment are very reasonable.  Independent Deputies suffer many drawbacks in the run-up to elections, and indeed after, in the way they are treated in this House.  They <Col N="1971" /> deserve a break, and democracy would be served by accepting this amendment. The Minister should use a little imagination. What possible harm could result from accepting this amendment?</P>

      <P>The Bill as drafted, which repeats existing law, provides that a candidate of a registered political party may have the name of the political party concerned shown in relation to his name on the nomination paper and on the ballot. It provides that a non-aligned candidate may adopt the expression &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; or leave the relevant space blank.  Two of the amendments in this group would allow the non-aligned candidate to describe himself &mdash; or herself &mdash; as &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; or leave the relevant space blank.  The other amendments would enable such a candidate to use any description of his own choice which the returning officer does not find objectionable on specified grounds.</P>
      <P>I should like to explain that the system of registration of political parties was introduced in 1963 on the recommendation of an all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Electoral Law.  The purpose of the measure was to enable the political affiliation of candidates to be shown in an ordered way on ballot papers.  It would have been possible to achieve that objective in another way. For example, it could have been decided, as is done in the neighbouring jurisdiction, to allow each candidate to use a description of his choice, subject to limitation on the number of words used in the description.  This approach introduced to the British public such delights as the &ldquo;Monster Raving Loony Party&rdquo;, Freddie's Alternative Medicine Party&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;Miss Whiplash's Corrective Party&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas of the day wisely decided that the proper approach was <Col N="1972" /> to provide a system for registration of political parties.  It appears to be generally acceptable that, on the whole, the system has worked remarkably well.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of Deputy Garland's amendment we would be apting for both approaches, superimposing the British system on our existing one.  Perhaps the hope is that this would give us the best of both worlds.  In practice it would be more likely to give us the worst of both worlds.  I do not see that any worthwhile purpose would be served by this change and I think the amendments should be rejected.  It is rarely a good policy to change horses in mid stream; it is even worst to try to ride two horses simultaneously.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed by Deputies Kavanagh and Gregory would give a non-aligned candidate three choices &mdash; to leave the space blank; to use the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; or to use the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;.  I do not see any practical necessity for providing this range of choices.  I might stress that the use of the description &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; is entirely at the discretion of a candidate. Any candidate who does not wish to use that description need not do so and the relevant space on the nomination paper and ballot paper may be left blank.</P>
    <P>I consider the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; to be the most appropriate description for a candidate who wishes to make it known that he or she is not a member of a registered political party.  It indicates briefly and clearly that the person does not belong to a registered party.  It is a neutral expression whereas the description &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; could be regarded as a definite political statement.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1963 the name of a political party could not be included on the ballot paper.  There was a polite fiction that each candidate was contesting the election as an individual.  The Electoral Act, 1963, recognised the reality that most people vote on a party basis.  The provisions of that Act introduced a system for registration of parties.  Candidates who wished to contest as individuals or did not wish to register their supporting organisation as a political party could describe themselves <Col N="1973" /> as &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; or leave the space blank.  The present section continues this arrangement without change.  The arrangement has worked remarkably well for almost 33 years.  It would not appear to be an area in which there is any great clamour for change; it is basically sound.  We shall not copy systems obtaining in other places for obvious reasons. Clearly our present system places nobody at a disadvantage; they may opt to use it or not as the case may be.  We should change the system only if there are compelling reasons for so doing which I do not recognise exist.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response was very inadequate.  I am not familiar with the minutiae of the British electoral law not do I believe that to be necessary here.  I mention it merely as an aside.  It is quite clear that here at present political parties are entitled to insert the name of the party opposite a candidate, which practice I fully support; I do not think anybody has any problem with that.  But, when it comes to Non-Party or Independent candidates the Minister is being extremely complacent.  I would remind him that very severe tests are imposed on new political groupings wishing to be registered as political parties, as I know to my cost when it took us some months to be registered in 1981 as the &ldquo;Ecology Party&rdquo;, as we were then known.  In fairness it should be said that it is good that we do not make it too easy for political groupings to form themselves into political parties almost instantaneously.  I accept that and that reasonable obstacles must be put in the way, along with reasonable requirements and regulations being laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That having been said, there are people who have a particular cause or issue to fight and who are being denied the right to state that issue or cause.  We are very happy with our description &mdash; the Green Party &mdash; in that when people go to vote and see the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, they know immediately what that is about, which is of great benefit to us.  I do not know what people think the description &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; stands <Col N="1974" /> for but people are very clear, when they vote for the Green Party, what that stands for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 62:</P>
      <P>In page 39, lines 26 to 30, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;47.  &mdash;(1)  A candidate at a Dáil election, or someone on his behalf shall, before the expiration of the time appointed by this Act for receiving nominations, deposit with the returning officer&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" />  (a) the sum of five hundred pounds, or</P>
    <P>(b) the sum of one hundred pounds and nomination papers signed by not less than 30 persons (being persons registered as Dáil electors in the constituency for which the said candidate proposes to seek election),</P>
    <P>and if he fails to do so his candidature shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Three or four major provisions of this Bill stand out, the question of a £500 deposit to allow candidates stand for election being one.  We have heard the Minister refer to the &ldquo;Miss Whiplash's Corrective Party&rdquo; and other such parties in the United Kingdom.  I contend that our system has served us reasonably well in that we have not had the lunatic fringe standing as candidates here.  But there have been individuals referred to, such as Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus, who, quite rightly, stood as a candidate in order to highlight issues of burning importance to him.  Probably he was the only former Deputy whose title, in addition to his Christian and surnames, was slightly different from that of the rest of us.  Indeed those other types of funny candidates who emerge on the British scene also appear on the Continent; there is no shortage of them.  Therefore we should make every endeavour to deter such people from standing as candidates in that they undermine the whole democratic process by making it totally laughable, which it most certainly is not.</P>
    <P>Part of our amendment seeks the retention of the £100 fee when a candidate can obtain the signature of 30 persons living in the constituency in which they intend standing for election.  There are probably famous cases on the record here of people who stood for election and who, at the end of the day, received eight votes, not even having persuaded their family members to support them.  Those of us who have been involved in politics for any length of time will be familiar with <Col N="1976" /> the voluminous correspondence received from time to time from eccentrics or others seeking to highlight what are burning or very important issues to them and who use all avenues open to them to highlight or expose such issues.  I received correspondence today and yesterday from an individual who is threatening to go public with his case, to picket hospitals and ministerial offices, and who is also planning to stand for election.  Such people should not be encouraged.  If the system is as open as it is, it is possible that lunatic types &mdash; lunatic is not the correct word&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The fact that we are seeking 30 persons to be joint signatories to a candidate's application is a safeguard that can be embodied in the legislation.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, a deposit of £500 on its own as is proposed in this Bill is a retrograde step and we are opposed to it. In order to give recognition to the fact that we should not deter, in any undue manner, participation in the electoral process by serious people who wish to change society, the requirement in amendment No. 62 (i) (b) should be accepted by the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know and if the Deputy tries to ride two horses he will get into serious trouble.  There are people who want to include signatures in this regard. I have a very simple view on this which is that I oppose the Government's attempt to raise the deposit from £100 to £500.  I oppose that outright.  I am not prepared to go along with any of the frills and furbelows that are being proposed by other Members to obtain 30 or 1,000 signatures.  The idea of increasing the deposit from the current £100 to £500 is an unnecessary and a rather silly proposal. I cannot see any good reason for increasing the deposit.  The Minister on Second Stage told us that if the deposit was now to be fixed at the same level, in real purchasing power terms, as it was in 1923, it should be £3,000.  I could see some case for doing that if the Minister wished to be consistent with what was done in 1923, but I would oppose it also because I do not believe this has anything to do with real purchasing power.  There is nobody in this House, and there are very few people in Fianna Fáil or in the <Col N="1978" /> well-heeled Progressive Democrats, if I may say so, Sir, who would agree with increasing the deposit to £3,000.  I believe all Deputies would rightly reject such a proposal.  I do not agree that there is any need to increase the deposit nor is there any need for these other frivolous measures that are being proposed, such as signatures of 30 persons, a person who is not the first nominated candidate of any other political party, or a petition of nominations signed by 1,000 electors.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe in the principle that it should be the right of every citizen in this country to present herself or himself for election if that is what they wish to do. Much of the chat that takes place concerning frivolous candidates is very misplaced. I know there have been some cases, but it is a relatively rare occurrence here.  Some of the candidates we might sometimes regard as frivolous have gone through all types of contortions to change their names, to add phrases to their names, etc. and one or two of them have turned out to be relatively serious.</P>
      <P>There was one such candidate who was a Member of this House at one stage who I understand took a decision on a particular night in January 1982 that he subsequently regretted.  That had nothing to do with the frivolity or otherwise of changing his name.  He changed his name for various other eccentric reasons best know to himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

      <P>I do not think we are entitled to label him as frivolous. However, I did not agree with him; I did not agree with him on that night in January 1982 and there were a great many other issues on which I disagreed with him.  However, I would not for a moment regard him as frivolous.  If the Government are of the view that by increasing the deposit to £500 or by making a corresponding increase in the deposit for local election candidates they would deter frivolous candidates, I believe they are mistaken.</P>
      <P>There was a case, not too long ago, in a constituency which is not represented by any Deputies in the Chamber at present &mdash; I beg your pardon, Sir, in your own city &mdash; where a candidate was elected in a local election, a candidate who could be fairly described as a frivolous candidate. If the deposit had been raised to ten times its then level, given the type of people who were behind the candidate, that person would have been sponsored, would have been a candidate and might even have been elected.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this question in relation to the deposit is the only or necessarily the key question in deciding whether &ldquo;frivolous&rdquo; candidates are kept out of the electoral process.  If there are people who wish frivolously to present themselves as candidates, then I do not believe that an increase in the deposit from £100 to £500 would make any difference. That being the case, Sir, the Government's proposal here is totally unnecessary, very unwise and should be resisted straightforwardly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure, Sir, how you are going to go about putting this group of amendments to the House.  Given what I have said I would not support Deputy McCartan's amendment because I do not believe we should agree under any circumstances <Col N="1980" /> to an increase in the deposit and, therefore, I could not agree with the second part of Deputy McCartan's amendment, which would require a deposit of £100 to be accompanied by 30 signatories.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what Deputy Garland is seeking in amendment No. 63 and, therefore, I would not support that amendment.  I do not support Deputy Kavanagh's proposal that we should keep the deposit at £100 only if the names of 1,000 electors accompanied the nomination.</P>

      <P>I would have liked to discuss the other two amendments in my name, but I am prepared to withdraw them to allow us deal with the amendment to delete £500 and substitute £100. When £100 was suggested as a deposit in the early twenties it was done to exclude certain individuals and parties.  A sum of £100 at that time was twice what my father earned for one year.  I wonder why Governments since did not change the amount of the deposit.  Although it has not been changed we have not seen frivolous candidates such as those who contest by-elections and general elections in Britain.  People who might be regarded as being frivolous did not make a habit of going around all constituencies, although some people will seek cheap publicity, the sort one could not buy for £100, by adding their names to a ballot paper.</P>
      <P>Some genuine people will find the increase in the deposit exorbitant.  We suggest our amendment to meet the wishes of all Opposition parties.  We do not know the views of the Progressive Democrats on this but nonetheless I presume all parties, with the exception of Fianna Fáil, are in favour of it.  I will withdraw my other amendments so that we can concentrate on amendment No. 65.</P>

      <P>Deputies Dukes and Kavanagh should have done me the courtesy of waiting to hear me speak to my amendments before they dismissed them out of hand.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 67 is separate from what we are talking about. It deals with how the deposit is to be paid.  I hope we will not all go in with £500 in £1 coins weighing down our pockets.</P>
      <P>I will explain the purpose of my three amendments.  One is simply to oppose the increase in the deposit.  In order to broaden the debate it is reasonable to put other suggestions.  Deputy McCartan's suggestion is excellent in many ways but I take issue with him on the number of people whom he feels are necessary before a person can be nominated.  Thirty people is a little thin.  Deputy Kavanagh talked about 1,000 electors but that is too many.  A very strong case can be made for a signature system and 0.5 per cent of the electorate in any constituency would be a reasonable number for that. These people would state that in their view the candidate was a candidate with a serious political agenda.  I suppose at the end of the day these arguments are not very important.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that the purpose of my amendment No. 63 was patently obvious.  I will explain it to Deputy Dukes.  The point we are trying to get across is that each registered political party would be entitled to nominate one candidate per constituency and if they wished to nominate more than one they must pay the deposit.  That is not unreasonable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, it is very difficult for a group to be registered as a political party here and any political grouping that succeeds in being registered here is by definition a serious political party.  There should not be obstacles to putting up one candidate in each constituency. That is not an unreasonable proposition.  We will be totally inhibited by this increase.  In talking about the substantive issue Deputy Dukes is making the debate a very simple one and perhaps he is right in the last analysis because the Minister will not for one minute look at any signature system or at any of the amendments I have tabled.  That does not mean that they should not have been put down.</P>
      <P>What case is being made for the increase in the deposit?  I went through the records of the last election in 1989. We have 41 constituencies and there were 49 non-party candidates.  That is a very significant number.  The ballot papers are not being cluttered with 20 or 40 no hope candidates.  There is no problem.  The Minister is inventing a problem.  One or perhaps two non-party candidates on a ballot paper will not be an unreasonable burden for people to accept.  We would have to consider the matter if 20 or 30 Independent candidates were standing. We could decide to leave the fee at £100 and if we found at the election that now looks inevitable later this month that ten, 20 or 30 Independent candidates stood in each constituency we could reconsider that decision.  However, there is no indication to suggest that that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Merely increasing the deposit from £100 to £500 will not deter wealthy eccentric candidates who are on some kind of ego trip and who have no serious political agenda.  For such people a deposit of £500 would be buttons.  Those who will be deterred by the imposition of a £500 <Col N="1984" /> deposit will be the unemployed &mdash; as was referred to by Deputy Kavanagh in one of his amendments &mdash; small political parties such as the Green Party and other small Independent groups.  They are the people who are being targeted by the Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder where the Progressive Democrats will stand on this issue.  Without any doubt the Progressive Democrats are the most wealthy party in Dáil Éireann.  They would have the least to lose in the increase of the deposit from £100 to £500, so I presume that in the interests of their own party they will support the Government on this provision.  The final nail in the Government's coffin will be the likely attitude of the Progressive Democrats. Progressive Democrat Deputies have not bothered to have even one of their number in the Chamber to deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill in order to put some kind of a different gloss on the Government.  Do we have a Fianna Fáil Government or a Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Coalition Government? Where are the Progressive Democrats? They are not in the House.  At this last moment I appeal to the Progressive Democrats to do the right thing for democracy by supporting this amendment and thereby opposing the proposed increase in the deposit from £100 to £500.</P>

      <P>During the Second <Col N="1985" /> Stage debate I spoke fairly strongly on this issue.  Amendment No. 65 is the only amendment I have put down to this Bill. I did not have to wait for Deputy Kavanagh's amendment to put down an amendment which proposed a reduction in the deposit from £500 to £100.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly on this issue and it is my opinion that the House should feel very strongly on the issue.  At a time when the Dáil and the Oireachtas are becoming more and more remote from the people and people are becoming more and more alienated we should make every effort to have more participation in the electoral process and the democratic process than ever before.  The democratic process should be extended outwards so that representatives can be with the people and the people can be with the Dáil and the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>No reason has been given for the increase in the deposit.  I would love to know the thinking of the Government in providing for the increase.  There is no reason for this measure.  No reason has been demonstrated in any election. There has been no problem and no one has ever raised the issue before.  All of the Opposition parties oppose the increase. We should strive to involve communities around the country in different areas in the whole process.  More communities are beginning to get involved in the process and are putting up candidates on local issues in an area that has a particular problem &mdash; whether the problem concerns a planning matter, a dump or something else &mdash; and they are quite entitled to do so.  Those candidates may not expect to be elected.  One does not have to expect to be elected when one stands as a candidate in an election.  The vast majority of people who have their names on the ballot papers do not expect to be elected; they expect to make a point and they expect to build up an area, an issue, a party or a process by way of the electoral system.  The vast majority of candidates do not expect to be elected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is nonsense to <Col N="1986" /> say that people should have their names put forward only if they expect to be elected.  That is the way in which the whole electoral process will be destroyed. That is the way in which the elite club will be provided for.  People already recognise the political system as being an elite and exclusive system because of the difficulties experienced in coming forward and winning against the big parties. The increase in the deposit proposed is a deliberate decision to exclude, and it comes right before the election that seems inevitable in the coming weeks.  I presume that this exclusive measure will be pushed through and signed so that it will be in time for the upcoming election. I am sure that the Minister has that thought in mind.</P>
      <P>There are many good measures in the Bill.  On the Second Stage debate I commended most of the Bill.  Much of the Bill is concerned with bringing forward existing legislation and much of it is concerned with the introduction of new features, such as keeping polling booths uncluttered, all of which I commended previously.  However, the Minister should really consider the way in which this proposal is perceived by the public and the way in which it is perceived by those who feel that the wrong people are representing them and that they should be doing something locally, which they are entitled to do, to ensure that better people are elected, local people or people who understand a particular issue.  He should consider the way in which it is perceived by those who are for political parties and by those who are against political parties.  All sorts of people have rights to have their say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are substantial reasons for increasing the deposit they have not yet been put before the House.  They were certainly not put forward on the Second Stage debate and I have not yet heard the Minister speak on this section.  The Minister will need to give very good reasons for the increase.  It is nonsense to speak of monster raving loony parties. Here in Ireland we have never had a problem with that kind of candidate; and even if we did in one election, would that <Col N="1987" /> destroy the whole electoral process?  For a great number of years and through a large number of elections, through different political parties and various processes, the Irish electorate has become quite sophisticated.  Our electors will be the quickest to write off any monster raving loony parties.  As has been pointed out already, there is an assumption by the Government that frivolous candidates &mdash; we do not know what the meaning of the word &ldquo;frivolous&rdquo; is &mdash; come only from the poorer sections of the community, candidates who could afford a deposit of £100 but not a deposit of £500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in support of the amendments before the Committee.  The whole idea of a deposit was clearly to discourage people from standing for election. Clearly, as has been said already, there is no necessity for that in our electoral system because we do not have a record of frivolous candidates standing for election. We do not have a record of ballot papers being cluttered with the names of large numbers of candidates.  That has not happened even since the sum of £100 lost its value as compared with the time that that fee was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to question the whole idea of a deposit because it seems to be a very discriminatory way in which to seek to control the numbers of people standing for election.  The sum of £500 is hardly <Col N="1988" /> likely to discourage a potential Ross Perot appearing on an Irish ballot paper but it would certainly discourage representatives of a local community organisation who had a particular point of view they wanted to have articulated through an election campaign.  The idea of a financial deposit is a discriminatory method of discouraging candidates which penalises people and organisations which do not have the money.  I do not think it should be part of our electoral system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment sought to introduce a new idea, which was to have a number of people sign a nomination paper.  Clearly that amendment was tabled at a time when most of us anticipated there would probably be a greater length of time to debate and to tease out the idea.  It would not appear we will now have that opportunity. The central issue that has to be decided today is whether the deposit remains at the present level or is increased to £500.  I am of the view that it should remain at its present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who are looking in on the practice of politics, particularly during the past couple of weeks, are bewildered at the extent to which Members of this House, including very senior Members, can engage in political antics which bear no relationship whatever to the real problems that people are facing in their homes and in their communities.  The last thing people need in the dying days of this Dáil and facing into a general election is for the Government to put through this House a measure which makes it more difficult for people, particularly those on lower incomes, to challenge the Government in the course of the election.  The Government would be giving a retrograde signal to the public and adding to an already heightened degree of cynicism at the practice of politics in this country if they decide to increase the cost of standing for election, literally pulling up the ladder on those people who wish to <Col N="1989" /> challenge the Government or any Member of this House in the course of the coming general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a variety of proposals and it is interesting to note that none of them came to the nub of the question.  What is a deposit?  It is an earnest of public support; it is refunded if that support materialises.  Nobody was gracious enough to admit that.  Yes, there has been an increase, the first in 69 years. We will not talk about equivalent comparisons of what it was like then; we were not there, we do not know the circumstances. It is not an almighty hike over 69 years.  It is refunded if the required public support materialises.  I have reduced the requirement for refund of the deposit.  Up to now one had to receive a third of the quota, but now I have reduced that requirement to a quarter, so that it is much easier to reach the stage where one gets a refund of the deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-serious candidates, people who have no interest in a Dáil seat, have reasons other than representation for standing.  This will perhaps act as a little disincentive, but I will not decide that today.  We have before us legislation which sets out to do a number of things. It updates the electoral law in this country, the first reform for 25 years.  It deals with all the matters relating to a supplemental register, the question of interference with voters going to poll and it proposes an increase in the deposit.  The great majority of candidates have the deposit refunded.  This is not a charge. <Col N="1990" /> This is not a sum of money which people are just being asked to pay.  If you consider yourself a serious candidate, if you have a serious message, if it is reflected in public support and if you obtain a quarter of a quota, the deposit is refunded.  Do not try to exaggerate what is involved here.  I do not have all the wisdom to say where the figure should lie today.  The deposit has been at the rate of £100 for 69 years.</P>

They have misunderstood, deliberately or otherwise, what a deposit is for, how it is refunded when you obtain the public support you expect and how I have rearranged the situation so that it is now much easier to obtain a refund than it was heretofore because you do not require the same percentage of the poll.

      <P>Allow me to make the point.  We are all aware of the fact that certain deposits are refunded if one achieves a certain amount of support.  The fact is that, even though there is great enthusiasm, many first time candidates in an election do not get the required support, because of pressure from other parties, insufficient money for posters, leaflets, etc, and they do not have their deposits refunded.  Those who are well organised and who have the money probably will get one-quarter of the quota and will have their deposits refunded.  The Minister is missing the nub of the question, which is that of raising the initial deposit to £500.</P>

      <P>That would be the only realistic way to deal with it at this point. I wish to say to Deputy Mac Giolla that I have represented my constituency for approximately 21 years and that during that time few candidates lost their deposits.  On any occasion on which it did happen, only one candidate out of five was concerned.  A high percentage of candidates in constituencies in my part of the country have their deposits refunded.  I accept that the picture would be slightly different in Dublin but the overall percentage would not be very high.  I do not have exact statistics.</P>

      <P>In page 39, subsection (1) (e), lines 42 and 43, to delete &ldquo;one quarter of the quota&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two per cent of the valid poll&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 68, 69 and 70 are basically the same.  While we accept that the Minister has reduced the figure for return of deposit from 33 per cent to 25 per cent &mdash; we appreciate that this gesture is a move in the right direction &mdash; nevertheless it it still very high.  For example, it means that a candidate in a three-seat constituency would have to get over 6 per cent of the total poll before he would get a refund.  This figure is far too high.</P>
      <P>There are two ways of dealing with this issue, one of which is to talk in terms of a percentage of the quota.  Deputy Kavanagh proposes a figure of 20 per cent of the quota while Deputy McCartan suggests 12.5 per cent of the quota.  The figure of 12.5 per cent would be more reasonable than the figure of 20 per cent. However, I would prefer the issue to be decided on the basis of the percentage of the valid poll a candidate gets.  This would iron out the differences between three, four and five seat constituencies.  It is more logical to talk about a percentage of the valid poll.  It is arguable whether the figure should be 1.5 per cent, 2 per cent or 2.5 per cent.  I think the Minister would have to concede that a candidate who gets 2 per cent of the electoral vote is a serious candidate.  I hope we can make some progress on this matter.</P>

      <P>These amendments propose that candidates who get less than one-quarter of the quota, as proposed in the Bill, should have their deposits refunded.  The point is that the valid poll in city areas can be a very small percentage of the total poll: it can range from 50 per cent in some constituencies to 80 per cent in other constituencies. This does not seem to be a fair way to decide the matter.  My amendment No. 69 proposes that a candidate who receives one-fifth of the quota should be entitled to have his deposit refunded. This is a move in the right direction.  I am always afraid to move too far from what the Minister wishes to do as I believe he will reject our proposals out of hand.  I regard this proposal as a small improvement, and I hope it is acceptable to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 70 proposes that a candidate who receives one-eighth of the quota should be entitled to have his deposit refunded.  The Minister proposes that a candidate should receive one-quarter of the quota before his deposit is refunded.  The quota in my constituency is 9,000-10,000 votes. Therefore, the Minister's proposal would require a candidate in my constituency to receive 2,500 votes in order to have his deposit refunded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much reference was made in the debate on the previous amendments about frivolous candidates; the Minister referred to &ldquo;serious&rdquo; candidates.  A person who receives 1,500, 2,000 or 2,500 votes is a serious candidate; he has a point of view to express which is supported by a very large number of people, even though it may not be sufficient to have him elected.  I do not know what the Minister's personal experience has been but I lost my deposit on the first occasion I stood for election to this House.  I thought I had done reasonably well by receiving 1,400 or 1,500 votes.  Under Deputy McCartan's amendment a person who stands for election in a constituency similar to the one I represent &mdash; he may be an Independent candidate in a local area who wishes to highlight an issue of <Col N="1996" /> considerable importance to that area and to give people an opportunity to identify with it &mdash; would have to get in excess of 1,000 votes before his deposit would be refunded.  That is a fair achievement for first-time candidates and candidates standing for small and large parties who find themselves trailing at the bottom of the list of candidates.  I would ask the Minister to reduce the level at which the deposit can be returned.</P>

      <P>It looks as if all my good deeds for today have been done.  I tried to go as far as I could to give a positive response in regard to the earlier provisions, but I am not minded to make changes here.  We have already cut the level from one-third of the quota to one-quarter of the quota.  Setting the right balance is a matter of judgment.  We have sought to make a positive change in the direction Deputies are seeking, although not going as far as Deputy Kavanagh is suggesting.  There is not a great difference, however.</P>

    <P>What kind of name can be put down?  Is it the Christian name, the Christian name and surname or just the surname?  Years ago there was a candidate whose Christian name was not widely known.  He was simply known as Backers Byrne because he was fond of betting on horses, as he still is.  There were so many Byrnes in Wicklow that each had to have a nickname. Is the Minister suggesting that if the candidate's actual name is not commonly known his nickname will have to be given?  It could lead to some strange names on the ballot paper.  In the case of names like Byrne or Murphy it is an old custom to use certain characteristics or traits to distinguish one from the other.</P>

      <P>In page 42, subsection (1), line 31, after &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to any combination of such persons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing law in relation to free postage for candidates at Dáil, Presidential and European elections is that each candidate is, subject to regulations to be made by An Post, entitled to send free of any charge for postage to each person on the register of electors for the constituency one postal communication containing matter relating to the election only, not exceeding two ounces in weight. Section 57 as drafted restates the provision of existing electoral law in relation to a candidate's free postage entitlement. There has been certain dissatisfaction with the present arrangements relating to free postage facilities, particularly the requirement that election material must be addressed to individual electors.  Some parties and candidates would wish to send <Col N="2000" /> election letters to each household rather than each elector or, possibly, to vary the arrangements by addressing the election material to each elector in one area and to each household in another.</P>
    <P>Consultations have taken place between the parties and the consensus is that free postage provisions should be amended to allow for more flexibility in its operation.  Accordingly, amendment No. 76 provides for the amendment of section 57 by giving a candidate at a Dáil election the option of sending an election letter to every person on the register as at present or to any combination of such electors.  The other amendments in the group provide for similar amendments to legislation relating to presidential and European elections.  The official amendment will, I believe achieve the same objective as the amendment tabled by Deputy Dukes.  It also has the advantage of avoiding the use of the word &ldquo;household&rdquo; which might be difficult to define in practice.  The existing arrangements whereby two or more candidates of the same political party in a constituency are treated as single candidates for this purpose and are entitled to issue a single election letter only are continued in this section.</P>

It is an appalling waste of time, envelopes and trees by each political party to have <Col N="2001" /> people addressing envelopes.  Surely it should not be beyond the wit of politicians to develop some system under which all political literature could be sent out to every household at the same time.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difficulty when parties with multiple candidates deploy a large number of counters, agents and so on at counts.  Parties with one candidate or independent candidates are unable to do a proper check or assessment during the count.  Some limitations should be put on the number of people involved in the counts?  The idea of, perhaps, 50 people turning up for one party, 30 for another and so on leads to difficulties at counts. There cannot be the surveillance to which each candidate is entitled because of the multiplicity of candidates.  My amendment seeks to have a minimum number prescribed by the county registrar.  This difficulty arises, in particular, at the count <Col N="2002" /> which can become quite a brawl, to put it mildly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>I can visualise circumstances where a minimum number would, be required but this is really a practical matter.

If a minimum number was set the figure would probably be so low as not to add anything to the corpus that already exists.

      <P>My reason for proposing this amendment is partly anticipation and partly sense.  This amendment is designated to benefit from the fact that I hope people will no longer canvass outside polling stations.  We will then have people from all the political parties carrying out the various duties we are used to carrying out inside the polling station.  That would mean that the people carrying out duties inside the polling station would not have to remain there all day.  If we are going to have the liberation of people who would otherwise be outside polling stations it might help the comfort of people who work for the parties if they could replace others or take terms of duty inside polling stations.  My amendment seeks to ensure that will be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 60 allows each candidate to appoint one personating agent to attend at each polling station for the purpose of assisting in the detection of impersonation.  A provision to this effect has been part of the electoral law since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment would permit the <Col N="2003" /> appointment of four personating agents by each candidate for each polling station.  If this amendment was accepted and candidates were to avail of their full rights in this regard, an impossible situation would be created in the polling stations where space is often at a premium. In practice many candidates are not in a position to avail of their present right to appoint one agent for each station.  A typical situation at a polling station is that two or three major parties each have one agent.</P>
    <P>The point is sometimes made that the personating agents have a long day and that there should be some arrangement to give them a break for meals.  This is provided for in section 59 in the appointment of one deputy agent for each polling district.  One of the functions of the deputy agent will be to fill in, as necessary, for personating agents.  Some personating agents may be in a position to serve for only part of the day, morning or afternoon.  The provision in section 60 allowing the appointment of a personating agent to be revoked and another to be appointed could be used in this situation.</P>

My amendment proposes that instead of the present position where, strictly speaking, it is either a nominated personating agent or an authorised subagent who can replace that person we allow the appointment of up to four personating agents, not more than one of whom should be present at any time. Since, I think, the Minister agrees that we should relieve people of these duties outside polling stations we will have more person power available to do the job inside the polling station.  Therefore, we should provide for a rota of persons to carry out these duties inside the polling station.  I am not proposing that four people should be available for each party at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have put down a related amendment to a later section to allow people to leave the polling station, and return with <Col N="2004" /> the permission of the polling officer.  I am simply asking the Minister if he would not make life a little bit easier for the activists of all the parties by not requiring them to spend all day in the polling station but that we have the humanity that we are allowed to have now by banning canvassing outside to give us more flexibility inside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Government statement of 1 October 1992, which refers specifically to the funding of county enterprise partnership boards and to the establishment and membership of the boards.</P>
      <P>Funding for the boards will be provided as follows: by way of an additional £50 million of public funds; by way of additional EC Structural Funds through the EC global grant for local development being arranged with the European Commission and contributions of over £100 million from the financial institutions by way of loans and equity.  In addition, a specific expenditure position statement will be prepared by the relevant State agencies for each county. These will be incorporated into the county action plans which will be based on an assessment of the needs and requirements for each county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidence of commercial relevance will be required in respect of enterprise ventures and the bases of selection and policies whereby individual projects are approved locally will be established. <Col N="2006" /> Guidelines will be agreed by an interdepartmental steering group, representative of all relevant Departments, for the policy basis of selection &mdash; for example in relation to sensitive sectors &mdash; by the boards of individual projects. The boards themselves will be the final decision-makers for those individual projects within the guidelines.</P>
    <P>Enterprise projects submitted to county enterprise partnership boards for funding will be evaluated in terms of commercial viability by an enterprise subcommittee of the board.  Personnel designated by the financial institutions will assist in the evaluation and the board will decide the most appropriate method of funding, whether by direct grant, loan, interest subsidy or equity for approved projects.  Officials of my Department are now liaising, and will continue to liaise, with the financial institutions on the detailed implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Loans by the financial institutions will be made available on favourable terms, including no guarantees in the case of incorporated entities, and the underwriting criteria will reflect a balanced view of the financial institutions' good commercial practice and social responsibility in playing their part in achieving the aims of the county enterprise partnerships in tackling the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Discussions are continuing with the financial institutions, in particular with building societies and with the insurance companies on further contributions to the overall enterprise fund.  The Government are satisfied that there will be a further positive response from the financial institutions arising from these discussions. Equity capital will be included in the further contributions, in particular from the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Each county enterprise partnership board will comprise a chairperson and 15 directors on rural boards and 11 directors on urban boards as detailed in the statement of 1 October.</P>
    <P>An establishment team, consisting of representatives of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> secretariat, the special projects officer of the <Col N="2007" /> Department of Finance, and the county Development officer or a nominee of the relevant county manager will, in co-operation with myself, work together in the various counties/areas to establish the new boards.</P>
    <P>Full consultation will be undertaken at local level with the county development teams, with State agencies and other groups as appropriate.  In particular, the establishment team as part of the local consultative process, will consult with the area partnership companies and Leader groups on the structures which would be most appropriate in a particular area.</P>
    <P>Nominees for representation on the boards will be appointed from the public and community sectors.  A meeting of delegates from all local community organisations will be convened, at which the concept of the county enterprise partnership boards will be fully explained. Delegates will be requested to nominate three community representatives to the boards.</P>
    <P>The employer, agricultural and trade union organisations were asked to nominate their representatives for each partnership board.  The employer organisations will nominate two representatives and one will be appointed to chair the board.</P>
    <P>The establishment team are now in contact with the relevant people in each county and the new enterprise initiative is proceeding rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very feeble attempt at getting people back to work and it will be seen as such.  Let me ask a straight question.  Will the commercial banks have the final or only say in whether or not a project is commercially viable or can the county enterprise <Col N="2008" /> boards themselves decide that a project is commercially viable so that the banks would have to invest in it?  I want a straight answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There could not be a straight answer to the ambiguous question the Deputy has asked.  The Deputy asked whether or not the banks will have the final say on the viability or non-viability of a project.  The boards will have the final say on that.  The boards will decide whether or not to give a project grant aid, to take equity in that project, to give an interest subsidy to a project or to recommend a project to the banks for funding.  The enterprise boards will have the final say and the banks will advise accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me get this straight.  Is the Minister telling the Dáil today that the enterprise boards have the final say even though the banks will be involved commercially?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Deputy in misinterpreting what I have said.  The position is that the new enterprise structure being put in position will have a number of options available to them to assist a project.  They will have to take into account national sensitivities, the viability of a project&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they will have to assess that project and after their assessment they can decide to give it grant aid, to take equity in the project, to give an interest subsidy to the project, to recommend the project for loans.  That will be the decision of the enterprise partnerships boards.  The Deputy has inferred that we are putting wings on this as we go along.  No such thing is happening.  It is a <i>de facto</i> decision as of 1 October.  The Deputy used the word &ldquo;feeble&rdquo;.  If the Deputy thinks our effort is feeble let him look into the mirror and ask himself what his party have done, a party that refused to participate in the Oireachtas Committee <Col N="2009" /> on Employment, a party that denigrated our initiative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a function of any Minister to sit in and impose his will on any committee.  It is a matter for the Members of this House.  We are responding to the recommendations of that committee. The Deputy's party have condemned the enterprise initiative at Oireachtas level.  However, funnily enough, Fine Gael members around the county have warmly welcomed it.  In the Deputy's own county the distinguished mayor of Galway and the distinguished chairman of Galway County Council have given it a warm welcome and are proud to sit as directors of the new Galway board.</P>

Would he not accept fully that his enterprise boards were designed solely to give the appearance of activity on the part of a Government who are totally bereft of any policies to cope with our appalling record on job losses?

As I have said, it will be the responsibility of the banks to provide loans on the recommendation of the county enterprise partnership board.

      <P>As I am sure the Minister of State is aware, details of the report have been leaked in recent times which indicate it is to be proposed that, apart from the family home, all property, income and assets other than assets acquired prior to the marriage should be commonly owned.  Can the Minister of State indicate &mdash; if it matters at this stage &mdash; what the Government's view would be if such proposal was made and would be accept that such an approach would be of help in the debate on the divorce issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's position is already on the record.  As the Deputy said, I am aware that there have been leaks.  Unfortunately, the commission are not in a position to issue their report, having regard to the fact that there were approximately 600 submissions. This is indicative of the interest <Col N="2013" /> which has been engendered.  As the Deputy is aware, the commission's first recommendation in their first statement was that &ldquo;legislation should be introduced immediately giving each spouse equal rights of automatic beneficial ownership in the family home and household chattels&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice has given a firm commitment in the recently published White Paper on Marital Breakdown that &ldquo;legislation is being drafted as a matter of priority to give each spouse a statutory entitlement to an equal share in the ownership of the family home and household chattels&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that issue.  As I understand it, the commission will propose that this right should be extended beyond household chattels to income and assets acquired after marriage as distinct from assets such as land acquired by either spouse before marriage. During the last referendum campaign on divorce fears were raised in relation to the question of ownership of land.  Can the Minister of State tell us if the Government have any view on the question of the extension of common ownership within marriage of assets, apart from chattels acquired after marriage?</P>

They will make a number of important recommendations and legislative action will be required.  I am not privy to their deliberations, even though there have been leaks.  While I understand the point the Deputy is making I am not in a position to give a response on behalf of the Government.  Suffice it to say that, as Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, I will be co-ordinating the efforts of and working with various Ministers.  I am not in a position to make any further comment.

For instance, if it was proposed that Article 40.2.2º, which states that a woman should not be obliged to seek work outside the home, should be deleted from the Constitution as it casts a patronising and unnecessary reflection on women, would the Government agree to such a deletion?</P>

      <P>Provisional results of the 1991 Census of Population were published in three preliminary reports last year.</P>
      <P>The publication of the definitive results is proceeding on a county by county basis at present in a series of local population reports.  Reports for Counties Carlow, Laoighis, Longford, Kildare, Louth and Wicklow have been published to date.  A further seven reports, including those for Dublin County and County Borough, are planned for publication before the end of the year.  These local population reports contain population details classified by age, sex, marital status and family situation at the level of DEDs and towns.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the purpose of my question is to elicit, late in the day, a response from the Government. A commitment was given in the Joint Programme for Government that an independent boundaries commission would be established as soon as the final figures were made available.  In June of this year I was told in a reply to a question I had tabled that these figures would be available by the end of this year, but I am now told that we will not have them before the end of the first quarter of next year.  Can the Minister of State outline the reason for the delay?  There has been an inordinate delay of 18 months so far and it is extraordinary that the Central Statistics Office do not appear to be able to complete their work.  This census was taken in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the delay is that the enumeration summaries, listings and maps covering approximately one million dwellings have to be examined in detail and thoroughly checked for consistency and completeness.  This is time consuming.  Resources are limited and there is a limited number of people available to do the work which, unfortunately, is taking longer than expected. The Deputy is quite right that in response to his question in June we said the figures would be available before the end of this year, and I am assured they will be ready before the first quarter of 1993.  I am also informed that there is not an inordinate delay and that the figures are being produced quicker than was the case after previous censuses.</P>

      <Quest>Ireland's policy in relation to Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia; whether any proposals have been made directly, or through the UN or EC, for a resolution of the conflict there, or to assist the inhabitants of Sarajevo and elsewhere who face a winter of death and starvation; whether the Secretary General of the UN has requested a supply of peace-keeping troops for service there; and if so, the response, if any, given to such a request.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy in relation to former Yugoslavia continues to be based on the main elements which I set out in my replies on 7 July, namely: support for the peace process, now underway within the framework of the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia under the auspices of the European Community and the United Nations; support for and involvement in efforts on the ground in the region to establish the conditions for a negotiated settlement; support for international action against Serbia and Montenegro <Col N="2017" /> and support for humanitarian action to assist displaced persons or refugees and for besieged communities in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
      <P>I advocated, and very much welcomed, the establishment of the International Conference of Former Yugoslavia, which had its inaugural meeting in London at the end of August 1992 and which has been meeting continuously in Geneva since then.  The international conference is co-chaired by the United Nations and the European Community.  The conference is representative of the wider international community.  It aims at a comprehensive settlement, both of the problems between the former Yugoslav republics and also those which are internal to those republics.  It is guided by a clear set of principles which we agreed in London.</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council, with our encouragement and support, is also fully involved and is assisting the efforts of the international conference.  Some 5,000 additional peace-keeping troops are being deployed in Bosnia-Hercegovina to protect humanitarian convoys.  This is in addition to the 1,500 troops already in Bosnia and some 15,000 UN personnel already deployed in Croatia.  Military flights over Bosnia have been banned by the Security Council, though there have been disquieting reports of such flights continuing.  The last Yugoslav army units in Croatia have recently been withdrawn. A commission of experts has been established by the UN Secretary-General to investigate violations of human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We condemn utterly the violence and so-called ethnic-cleansing which has continued in Bosnia-Hercegovina, but the international conference has made some progress, particularly towards the normalisation of relations between Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that is Serbia and Montenegro.  In addition, the conference made proposals on 28 October for a constitutional structure for Bosnia-Hercegovina. However, it is clear that the peace process will be long and difficult, as has been demonstrated by the negative reaction of some Bosnian Serbs <Col N="2018" /> to these proposals.  We will continue to use our influence to ensure that the momentum is maintained.</P>
    <P>We are making a practical contribution to activities on the ground which support the peace process.  In response to a request from the Secretary-General, Ireland agreed to provide six military observers and 20 gardaí to the United Nations peace-keeping force in the former Yugoslavia &mdash; UNPROFOR.  In addition, there are six Irish military personnel serving with the European Community Monitor Mission in Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and in Bulgaria.</P>
    <P>The members of the European Community have not recognised the federal entity of Serbia and Montenegro.  These republics bear primary responsibility for the tragedy in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  We believe that the economic sanctions imposed by the European Community and by the UN Security Council must be maintained until commitments made by Serbia and Montenegro have been realised.  We are, therefore, supporting the joint EC-CSCE programmes in countries bordering on the former Yugoslavia to tighten the economic and arms embargos.  Serbia and Montenegro have been denied the seat of the former Yugoslavia in the UN General Assembly and they now face exclusion from other international fora.</P>
    <P>The Government are gravely concerned at the human tragedy unfolding in the former Yugoslavia, which is being exacerbated by the onset of winter.  This was a major preoccupation for the European Council at its 16 October meeting in Birmingham.  The Council agreed that steps should be taken urgently to provide winter shelter and to ensure the prompt delivery of relief supplies.  Community assistance is being accelerated; further staff and resources are being deployed to strengthen UNHCR's capacity and an EC task force has been set up.</P>
    <P>Ireland is contributing to the vital effort.  In addition to the £100,000 given to UNHCR in July 1991, £200,000 has now been allocated for humanitarian aid to the region.  Ireland will also supply up to four logistical officers to assist the UN <Col N="2019" /> High Commission for Refugees in order to strengthen the effectiveness of humanitarian aid operations in the Yugoslav region.  Following the admission to Ireland of a group of 178 Bosnian refugees in September, consideration is also being given to the admission of close family members of this group.  I apologise for the length of the reply.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious matter on our doorstep.  Would the Minister accept that the European Community has been divided and ineffective in the face of naked aggression, particularly from Serbia?  There is also evidence of clear breaches of human rights by Croatians and others involved in this conflict.  Would he accept that the European Community has been relatively helpless in view of the prospect that tens of thousands of our European neighbours may die of starvation and cold during the coming winter?  Is there anything further that can be done at this stage at national level in terms of taking a more open approach to increasing the number of refugees who come here or at European Community level in terms of providing food and fuel supplies?  Could further steps be taken within reason at EC or UN level, particularly considering the danger of an extension of the conflict into Kosovo where the Albanian majority are under severe pressure from the Serbs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Deputy's concern.  It is a concern that motivates European Community partners at this time.  As the Deputy is aware, Cyrus Vance and David Owen are doing their very best in difficult circumstances to bring about a resolution to this ongoing obscenity.  As the Deputy quite properly suggests, the events on the doorstep of <Col N="2020" /> Europe are disgraceful.  It is difficult to give a full answer to the question but much has been and is being done.  I take note of the Deputy's suggestion in relation to providing relief aid to ensure that tens of thousands of people do not die during the winter.</P>
      <P>Arising from the London conference at which I represented the Government, one item moved me, that was the proposal to remove the heavy guns overlooking Sarajevo, but tragically that has not happened. The battle continues.  From time to time relief aid gets through the airport at Sarajevo with the &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo; of the fighting groups.  In those circumstances the Deputy will realise that the European Community and the United Nations continue to do their best, albeit without much success, to bring a resolution to this dreadful situation.</P>

The Government and I are aware of the need to take further refugees, particularly relations of the refugees who are already here.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 11 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to brief the Dáil on my two visits to Somalia, the most recent being when I accompanied President Robinson there.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I had a meeting with the Irish Aid Agencies who are particularly active on the ground in Somalia. They told me that a grave human catastrophe was unfolding.  At their request, I visited Somalia last August.  Although I had been warned of what to expect, the situation which I witnessed in Somalia was horrifying beyond description.  I came away convinced that more must be done.  I immediately contacted the Secretary General of the United Nations and my fellow EC Foreign Ministers and urged them to step up their efforts on behalf of Somalia.  Subsequently, I made the situation in Somalia the main theme of my address to the UN General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accompanied the President to Somalia and from there to New York where we reported on the situation to the United Nations Secretary General, Dr. Boutros Ghali.  We briefed him on what we had seen, on the inadequacy of the supplies getting through to those in need and on the unacceptable security situation.  We made clear the necessity for a greater, and better co-ordinated, humanitarian effort.  We emphasised that <Col N="2023" /> excellent work was being done by nonGovernmental organisations, including many Irish representatives and by organisations such as the Red Cross, Concern, Trócaire, Goal, UNICEF, World Vision and many other organisations who have committed themselves to alleviating the devastation in Somalia.</P>
    <P>At the Birmingham Summit, following a proposal which I made to my colleagues, the European Council adopted a strongly worded declaration on Somalia.</P>
    <P>Throughout, it has been my concern: to encourage the developed countries to maintain and increase their rate of disbursement of aid; to address the security issue and in particular to press for the quickest deployment of the UN security personnel authorised by the Security Council; and to give all possible support to the efforts under way to achieve a political resolution.</P>
    <P>I regret that the security situation has continued to deteriorate.  Troops said to be loyal to former President Siad Barre have attacked and seized the town of Bardera, badly disrupting the relief effort there and spreading despair in the surrounding area.  Today, the newspapers report direct threats to the safety of aid workers in Somalia.</P>
    <P>Progress in the deployment of United Nations troops in Somalia continues to be extremely slow.  The first 500 UNOSOM troops have arrived in Mogadishu.  I have stressed to the Secretary General of the UN the necessity for the urgent deployment of more troops and will continue to do so.  Reports from Mogadishu indicate that the situation at the port and at the airport continues to be extremely bad and supplies are not getting through.</P>
    <P>Agreement has yet to be secured from the factions concerned to enable the deployment of the troops at Kismayo and Hargeisa.  The UN is in discussion with the Kenyan authorities on the deployment of troops on the Kenyan side of the border near Mandera.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that Ambassador Sahnoun, the Special Representative of the Secretary General, has resigned from his position.  I hope that his successor, <Col N="2024" /> Ambassador Kittani, will pursue the achievement of peace and the delivery of humanitarian assistance with the same determination and courage as Ambassador Sahnoun.  I regret the resignation of Ambassador Sahnoun and share his dismay at the inability of the developed world to respond properly to the tragedy of Somalia.</P>
    <P>The Government have made available a total of £655,000 from the disaster relief fund to the relief agencies working in Somalia and with Somalia refugees.  I have also allocated £125,000 from the bilateral aid fund for an agricultural rehabilitation programme in Baidoa.  In addition, of course, Ireland contributes its proportionate share to the cost of EC programmes in Somalia.</P>
    <P>As regards the idea of the Government matching contributions raised by the voluntary agencies on a pound for pound basis, I repeat my commitment to achieving the UN target of devoting 0.7 per cent of GNP to ODA as quickly as improving economic and financial circumstances permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks may appear to be critical but I congratulate the Minister for his personal interest in this matter.  We are also proud of President Robinson in relation to what she has done in Somalia.  However, will the Minister agree that the Government have been less than forthcoming in supporting the effort he made on a personal level? Our efforts at national level are a disgrace and this has been mirrored by what happened at the United Nations, where there seems to be hopeless bureaucracy.  The ambassador who was trying to do something was fired and security for protecting food in transit is terrible.  Will the Minister confirm that there is not a supplementary budget to provide extra money for Somalia and that we have been involved in robbing hungry Peter to pay starving Paul?  Similarly, there has not been effective action at international level to cope with the greatest calamity in the world for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the <Col N="2025" /> Deputy as, with respect, he has not painted a fair picture.  On the question of increasing overseas development assistance, I do not disagree that 0.7 per cent is low.  I would have thought that the Taoiseach's Bodenstown speech would have put the matter in perspective in that regard when he indicated that we would be increasing our overseas development aid to a relatively reasonable figure next budget time.  He said it was hoped thereafter to have an annual increase based on the financial exigencies of the day. Whoever might be my successor in office I should like to foresee a .05 per cent increase on an annual basis.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if, by reducing the costs of passports in the winter months, he intends to encourage more applications in this period so as to alleviate the strain on the system in the peak summer period; if he will bring the Cork office to full passport status as this will also help to relieve pressure in the Dublin office.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the £10 reduction in the standard passport fee during the months of October and November is aimed at encouraging more applications during the low-season and so relieve the strain on the system during the peak summer period.</P>
      <P>The response to date has been quite encouraging.  Overall there has been an increase of about one-third in standard passport applications received during the month of October compared to the same month last year.  We are continuing to advertise the scheme.  We hope that as many people as possible will avail of it.</P>
      <P>As to bringing the Cork office to full passport status, I agree that this would help to relieve pressure on the Dublin office.  For a number of technical reasons, it would not be possible to implement such a change immediately.  However, a major computer upgrading project for the Passport Office is currently at an advanced stage of planning and, as part of this project, it is envisaged that computer facilities will be installed in the Cork office in late 1994.  At that time, I would anticipate a positive decision on upgrading the Cork office to the status of a full passport-issuing office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that in 1992, over 20 days in Dublin, there were 6,187 applications; in 1991, over 22 days, there were 5,060 applications.  The daily average in 1992 was 309 and the daily average in 1991 was 230.  Therefore it will clearly be seen that the low-season reduction offer has been <Col N="2027" /> an outstanding success.  I predict that that type of offer would have been equally successful in other areas.  I should like to confirm that we are reviewing the passport position nationwide, for example to render it easier for people in the Munster area to have as their headquarters the Cork office without the inconvenience of having to travel to Dublin.  We are taking a look at Galway as headquarters for Connacht and so on.  We would hope to satisfactorily restructure the position for the convenience of citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the Cork passport office has been a success and has considerably relieved the pressure on the Dublin office?  Would the Minister now consider upgrading the Cork office to a full passport office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do consider the Cork office as having been a success.  It is my intention to upgrade it to a full office in late 1994.  While that might not be considered satisfactory from the Deputy's point of view it is the best we can do bearing in mind what we have been endeavouring on the computer front.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>I have just said that that is my intention.  There is a plan afoot in my Department aimed at rendering passport offices user citizen friendly.  It is my intention to upgrade the Cork office to render it easier for the people of Munster; to upgrade the Galway office to render it easier for the people of Connacht and so on.  It would be my hope, or that of my successor, whoever he or she may be, to have that in place by late 1994.</P>

      <P>May I first congratulate the Minister on having tackled some of the difficulties encountered in the Passport Office last summer.  Bearing in mind that the months of January and February tend to be those months when people start booking holidays would he consider initiating another reminder campaign, warning people not to leave passport applications until the months of May or June, thereby obviating long queues? What efforts can the Minister undertake to provide passports to approximately 2,000 Americans who applied for them under the citizenship Act approximately five years ago?  That might well be the last task he might undertake before leaving his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 12 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> The Government have followed with great concern the growing violence in South Africa.  Following the killings in Bisho in early September I expressed the Government's revulsion at the loss of life and the numbers injured, and I condemned those responsible.  At the same time I called on the South Africa Government to exercise full control over the security forces.  The Foreign Ministers of the European Community also condemned the killings.</P>
    <P>The Government have regularly conveyed to the South African authorities our views on apartheid, our belief in peaceful negotiations as the path to a new South Africa and the need for all parties in South Africa to address seriously the problems of political violence.  The Bisho killings were an example, unfortunately not unique, of the violence which is part of the legacy of apartheid.  As the Deputy will be aware, Justice Goldstone, Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into Public Violence and Intimidation, has reported that several parties were to blame for the deaths at Bisho.</P>
    <P>Ireland, has joined with our partners in the Community, in offering to help the South Africans address the continuing problem of political violence.  The Community and its member states have sent a number of observers to South Africa, to work in co-ordination with the UN observer force established under Security Council Resolution 772.  These observers, two of whom are Irish, are working with the structures set up under the National Peace Accord, signed on 14 September 1991 by the South African Government, the ANC and Inkatha, as well as other political parties and movements.</P>
    <P>I hope to visit South Africa in the near future.  In my meetings with the South African Government, the ANC and other parties and movements, I will urge a return to the path of peaceful negotiations which, I believe, is the only way to a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister raised with the South African authorities <Col N="2031" /> the allegation that the troops of the South African police collaborated with the Ciskei troops in facilitating the massacre and, if so, what was the response he got from the authorities in relation to that? Has the Minister pressed with the South African authorities the urgent need to have a non-racial interim Government established before the end of this year as a genuine means of having peace restored or of having a peaceful path to a solution? Has the Minister indicated to the South African Government that until such time as that is done, we will insist that existing remaining sanctions will remain in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not brought any of those matters to the attention of the South African Government, but if I get the opportunity of going to South Africa in the near future I will bring those matters to their attention.  The Deputy's allegation in relation to troops is a very serious allegation.  I do not have any information in that regard.  It is something I would have to investigate thoroughly before I could make any definitive response to it.  Taking into account that either myself or somebody else may be going to South Africa in the near future, it would not be appropriate to comment in relation to a non-racial interim Government.  Quite frankly, I do not think there is time to have a non-racial interim Government between now and the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt the integrity of the views which the Minister will pursue in South Africa but I put it to him that either he or his successor would be ill advised to visit South Africa before reforms of the security forces have taken place, or at least before talks in relation to reform of the security forces have been advanced, and that the likelihood is that a visit of a Foreign Minister of a member state of the European Community would be abused rather than it being helpful to the resolution of the crisis in South Africa at this time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would not necessarily be guided in my response by that visit, I will base it on my own judgment, which is, with the greatest respect to Deputy Higgins, that I should go to South Africa in the near future. There are many issues to be addressed, issues which have been referred to by the Deputies.  In those circumstances the way to deal with them is face to face rather than by long distance diplomacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my concern and the concern of many that it is important that neither Ireland nor any other EC country would prematurely give a total stamp of approval to the South African Government before real progress has been made towards non-racial Government?  For that reason will the Minister confirm and perhaps clarify for the House if a member of his staff recently visited South Africa with a view to opening an Irish Embassy there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in that a member of the staff visited South Africa in anticipation of my visit.  In relation to the opening of an embassy, that is a decision that would have to be made arising from a first time visit by a Minister, based on advice given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, no decision has been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was seeking to establish that an embassy, which has significance in that it gives recognition to the existing regime, will not be established in South Africa under the existing regime without a transitional Government having been put in place and without a number of the issues on the talks having <Col N="2033" /> reached the point of resolution between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <Quest>if the Government will support the calls made at the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Jakarta in September, 1992, for reform of the United Nations, including the ending of the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council and wider representation for regional groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the wide-ranging statement issued by the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at their conference in Jakarta last September.  Ireland is not a member of the non-aligned movement, as the Deputy knows, and would not necessarily subscribe to all of the proposals or formulations contained in that statement.</P>
      <P>Discussion is taking place at the United Nations on reform of the Secretariat, General Assembly reform and on proposals submitted by the Secretary-General in his report entitled <i>An Agenda for Peace,</i> which is currently under detailed examination in the Security Council and in the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that the Government support the principle of UN reform, to mirror more closely the current realities in international relations. In the course of my General Assembly address, I stated that:</P>
      <P>... the question of reform of the UN, and in particular of the Security Council, is a sensitive issue that touches the very essence of post-war international co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2034" /> But after almost fifty years, it is reasonable to ask if the structures and methods of work agreed then correspond fully to contemporary realities &mdash; to the UN's growing and now almost universal membership, to its new tasks, to the great changes that have taken place in economic and political relations.</P>
    <P>The time has come to take up these issues frankly, here, within the UN itself.  We could only profit from such a discussion.  Our aim should be to ensure that the decisions of the Organisation are truly authoritative and representative of the will of the entire international community.</P>
    <P>Article 23 of the Charter provides for the election of ten non-permanent members of the Security Council, in addition to the five permanent members.  Equitable geographical distribution is among the criteria applied in electing the non-permanent members.  The ten non-permanent seats are currently distributed as follows: Africa and Asia, five; Eastern Europe, one; Latin America, two and Western Europe and others, two.  Geographically, therefore, the Security Council can be said to be broadly representative of the general membership.</P>
    <P>Views have been expressed to the effect that the allocation of permanent seats and the power of veto in the Security Council, as provided for in the Charter, should be altered to take account of the changes in international relations since the foundation of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Any change in that regard would require an amendment to the Charter. Article 108 provides that any proposed amendment must command the support of two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly and be ratified by two-thirds of the members of the Security Council.  In practice no amendment can be carried without the agreement of all five permanent members of the Council.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Could the Minister indicate his or the Government's view <Col N="2035" /> with regard to the five permanent places on the Security Council and whether or not he considers that the current system gives an unwarranted power to those five states, namely the US, Britain, China, France and Russia, to a degree which excludes to a significant extent larger parts of the world in terms of decisions, particularly with regard to the veto they have and have sometimes used on critical issues?  Will the Minister not agree that this House, either by way of debate on the floor or through a Foreign Affairs Committee, should properly be addressing this issue and our attitude to how the UN operates, given that we play a significant role in peace keeping under the auspices of the UN and that we have a very particular concern about how it evolves in the future.</P>

It will be a matter of the sooner the better that we have a committee to take account of what Deputy De Rossa requests.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is scope for Ireland to take a very positive and active role in reform of the United Nations?  Would he agree that such reform might focus on the present obvious inefficiencies of that body and some of its subsidiary agencies, as highlighted in Somalia and elsewhere? Would he also agree that Ireland should have a planned, positive approach to the amendment of the Charter of the United Nations?  I think particularly of Article 7 &mdash; this being an old hobby-horse of mine &mdash; in that the United Nations is prevented from interfering in many instances of blatant denial of human rights, and indeed genocide, because of the provision that the United Nations cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a member state.</P>

      <P>I recommend for the Deputy's delectation and reading the recent publication by Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali, <i>Agenda for Peace.</i>  That treatise was produced in June of this year and contains several important proposals for reform in the area of preventive diplomacy, peace-making and peace-keeping. Ireland and our European Community partners are among the countries that made submissions to the Secretary General earlier this year and a number of the ideas put forward are reflected in that excellent report.  The Government, both nationally and at European Community level, have welcomed the Report of the Secretary General and I in my address to the United Nations' General Assembly of 25 September last endorsed the direction of the thinking of the Secretary General in that booklet.  Earlier, on 30 June, the Community issued a statement of support for the ideas contained in the report.  If the <Col N="2037" /> House wished I could leave a copy of the report <i>Agenda for Peace</i> in the Oireachtas Library or I could give Deputies who so desire individual copies of the report which is well worth reading. Given the kind of agenda that I believe this Government should be pursuing, the booklet is a catechism &mdash; if I may use that expression.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister in his support of the booklet <i>Agenda for Peace,</i> which was inherited by Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali and to which many countries contributed.  I wish to ask the Minister two small questions.  Would be not agree in regard to the tragedy in Somalia, for example, that on the occasion of the resolution dealing with Somalia the African representatives were outvoted and that the reason for a weak resolution was an abuse of their position by the five permanent members of the Security Council?  My second question is more important.  Would the Minister agree that if reform of the United Nations is to take place Ireland should ideally initiate or at least support such resolutions as come for the reform of Article 108?  The five permanent members of the Security Council will always refuse to give away their power unless the initiative is started with reform of Article 108.  Is it the Minister's position that if such resolutions come before the United Nations General Assembly Ireland will support reform of Article 108 to enable reform of the United Nations to take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question in relation to the reform of Article 108 is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The first part of the Deputy's question related to the permanent members of the Security Council and their responsibility for Somalia.  I would not go so far as the Deputy has gone in the circumstances, but certainly as far as the international community is concerned Somalia remains a very serious blot on the escutcheon.</P>

The Minister has not been anything like strong enough.  Could he give a commitment to do everything within the rules and regulations of the UN &mdash; and the Minister knows the rules much better than I do &mdash; to bring an end to that veto?  The continuation of the special veto is not in our interests, the interests of the smaller countries in general or in the interests of world peace.</P>

      <P>The Government attach the highest importance to the continuation of these talks, which aim to bring about a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands.  As signatories of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Irish and British Governments have made clear that they would be prepared to consider a new and more broadly based agreement or structure if such an arrangement can be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation between all of the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>We have at the same time confirmed our continuing commitment to the full implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, including the principle of regular and frequent ministerial meetings in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  At their meeting in London on 25 September, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister agreed to a second and final extension of the interval between intergovernmental conferences and decided that the next meeting of the conference would take place on Monday, 16 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are strongly of the view that the holding of this meeting of the conference should not be treated as grounds for an abandonment of the talks process.  We have demonstrated considerable generosity and flexibility in the provision of intervals between conference meetings with a view to facilitating political dialogue.  We agreed to one interval last year and to an initial three month interval followed by two <Col N="2040" /> extensions this year.  Between 1991 and 1992 the two Governments have made available a total period of some nine months for the purpose of facilitating political talks.</P>
    <P>It is surely reasonable to expect that those participants who have imposed preconditions relating to the Anglo-Irish Agreement on the talks should now reciprocate by showing a similar commitment to the process and a modicum of flexiblity in turn, so as to enable dialogue to continue.</P>
    <P>To withdraw from the talks on grounds that the Governments may not hold even a single meeting over this long period to dispose of a backlog of conference business would not be reasonable.  It would be to demand that the Governments disregard the present agreement, which they are committed to uphold unless or until it is transcended by new and agreed arrangements.  Such a position would not be consistent with the spirit of mutual accommodation necessary for progress, and I sincerely hope it can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I should make clear that the Governments, for their part, are ready to agree a further suitable interval after the forthcoming meeting, so that talks can continue on the same basis as heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to do all in their power to bring these talks to a satisfactory conclusion.  The positions of the participants on key issues are being elucidated in detail at present and valuable exchanges are taking place.  It is important that the potential which this process offers for a lasting and equitable settlement should be carefully safeguarded. The Government regard this as a continuing process which can best realise its potential if it is not subject to artificial deadlines or to constraints of any other description.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that a new situation has arisen in the light of political developments in Dublin?  Can he ensure that as far as possible the collapse of the Government will not have an adverse effect on the talks?  Can he make arrangements to <Col N="2041" /> ensure, so far as he can, that the talks will continue after the election?  Finally &mdash; and this is of relevance in the light of the new situation here &mdash; will he agree, if it is necessary to defer the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference of 16 November that such a move would facilitate the positive continuance of the talks after the election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is simply no.  I would not be prepared to facilitate such a move on the grounds that the Anglo-Irish Conference has been postponed on a number of occasions.  The longer the Anglo-Irish Conference is postponed the more likely it is that the Anglo-Irish Agreement will be undermined.  As the Deputy is aware, the Anglo-Irish Conference is one of the central pillars of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. On 16 November in the Anglo-Irish Conference there are many important issues to be addressed, issues which have been left on the long finger considering the reasonable number of postponements which have taken place.  This is not in any way to gainsay the continuing process and the hoped for bridge which might be seen at the conclusion of the present process on either Friday or Tuesday next.  This is based on the fact that the Unionist parties, once the secretariat get back into a work mode, will remove themselves from the talks.  We do not want that to happen.  They will do so on the basis that the Anglo-Irish Conference is going ahead on 16 November.  We would like to see them return to the talks as soon as possible after the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also make one last point in relation to the talks process generally. Myself and the Leader in the delegation, the Tánaiste &mdash; who is now present in the House &mdash; the Minister for Justice and either the Minister for Energy or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who have interchanged, have committed ourselves almost full time to those talks during the past number of months.  It is proper that I should pay tribute to the other parties to the talks, more particularly to the SDLP &mdash; my spiritual home <Col N="2042" /> in the context of my national identity &mdash; to the British Government and to the Unionist parties who participated actively in the talks.  I refer particularly to the Official Unionist Party and the Alliance who are genuine and committed to the support of their own positions but who see us as being genuine and sincere and dedicated to our position.  It is a matter of bridging those positions which are still some distance apart.  For that reason I would like to think there would be an intermission between now, the Intergovernmental Conference and thereafter &mdash; in other words, that there would be a bridge over the Intergovernmental Conference and that the present process would be seen in a pause mode.</P>

      <P>I recognise that if there is a possibility of such a bridge and that is agreed, then the point we are making does not arise.  If that does not look like being the case I would like to say, as the Irish author of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, while I would agree with the Minister in the ordinary way and if there was not an election pending that the date should be adhered to, for obvious reasons, which need not be gone into, to preserve the integrity of the agreement in the particular circumstances of an election being called now before the end of the talks, I would urge that there be reconsideration of the deadline of 16 November, if maintaining it would prevent the talks from continuing successfully thereafter under other circumstances. In the national interest, I think that to now insist on the date of 16 November if that would prejudice the outcome would be something which would be very difficult to stand over.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Deputy's very serious question, I should say we are having a number of bilateral meetings on Friday next with the various parties.  I want to assure the Deputy that the bridge over the Intergovernmental Conference is something that will be pressed very hard.  The Intergovernmental Conference is going ahead.  The Deputy will recall that the most recent meeting of the conference took place on 27 April.  The two Governments agreed that the conference would not meet again before the week beginning 27 July.  Since then two successive extensions of this gap between conference meetings have been agreed to by the two Governments, one until the end of September and the other until 16 November. That means that a total of six and a half months will have been made available this year for the purpose of the talks.  At their meeting in London on 25 September the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, confirmed their commitment to the full implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, including the principle of regular and frequent meetings of the conference.  For this reason the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister decided that the next meeting of the conference should take place on 16 November.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister appears to be uncharacteristically hardline in relation to the date for the conference.  Would he not accept that the talks are underway precisely because it was agreed that the conferences under the Anglo-Irish Agreement would be deferred and that extensions were applied in order to keep the talks underway? Does he not accept, given that we will be into a general election around this time tomorrow, that the Government have no way of knowing, no more than any of us, who will be in Government in a month or six weeks' time and therefore that it would make sense to defer holding this conference until the new Government make a decision as to when it should be held, even if it is the existing Government personnel, in order to ensue that the talks, which are crucial to finding a peaceful way forward in Northern Ireland, can continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Deputy thinks I am being hardline.  The one thing that has permeated the talks has been a spirit of friendliness and a concern as between most of the delegations to these talks.  It is in that atmosphere that this Government would like to see the talks process continue.  If the talks are brought to an end by a decision on the part of individual delegations to withdraw, of course the Government would regret this.  The Government are ready to facilitate political dialogue in every way possible. As I indicated at the beginning of my response to this question, we have worked tirelessly to enable these talks to take place and we will be equally determined to facilitate their resumption at the earliest possible date should they be brought to an end next week.  There is no alternative to this political dialogue.  I hope this is accepted by all participants in the talks and that those who may be contemplating leaving the process will reflect very carefully before doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason that the holding of a single one day meeting of this conference should be a pretext for parties to withdraw from this dialogue.  The conference meeting has been delayed for over six <Col N="2045" /> months and a significant backlog of very serious and fundamental items within the context of the remit of the Intergovernmental Conference must be addressed as a measure of some urgency. The British and Irish Governments have shown considerable patience in delaying the conference for so long.  It is reasonable to ask other delegations to show the flexibility shown by the two Governments.</P>

I wish to say to the Minister that when the present phase of the talks process &mdash; I use that phrase advisedly &mdash; comes to a close one of the judgments I will use in relation to the usefulness of the talks will be the amount of generosity which has been shown by the Government, the SDLP and others towards those representatives in the talks of the other tradition on this island.  I hope we can all be pleased by that element of generosity which has been displayed and will be obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at this late stage when obvious difficulties are in the way, may I ask the Minister if he will give an assurance on behalf of the Government that in circumstances where the Irish and British <Col N="2046" /> Governments, together with representatives of the constitutional parties in the North of both traditions, reach agreement on a package that that package of agreement will be put by way of a referendum to the people on this island, North and South?  I am not asking him if he could or would give his assurance; rather I am asking him if he will give it. Such an assurance might be helpful in the two or three days which lies ahead and would be extremely helpful when these talks inevitably must recommence.</P>

Having been a participant in putting the talks process together, and recalling the tortuous negotiations on the framing of the talks, I was heartened to hear the emphasis placed by the Minister on the word &ldquo;intermission&rdquo;.  The Minister and Government are correct to have called the intergovernmental conference, having postponed it from April.  I ask the Minister to appeal to all those who attend the meeting on Friday for sanity to prevail and the generosity of spirit which has prevailed so far to be continued after this intermission, which is vitally important for peace on this island.  We are all sick and saddened at the spectacle of the murders carried out in the name of Irish people.  The sooner these activities are brought to a halt the better.

      <P>Under section 60 each candidate may appoint a personation agent to attend at each polling station.  If a party present two or more candidates, each can appoint a personation agent.  There is no obligation on a personation agent to remain all day.  He can at any time surrender his note to the presiding officer and leave.  It is also clear that the agent can return subsequently.  Thus one candidate can appoint an agent for, say, the morning if necessary and another candidate can appoint an agent in the afternoon.  There is flexibility in the system.  Under section 60 a candidate has power to revoke the appointment of a personation agent and appoint another in his place.  He could appoint one agent for the morning and advise the returning officer and appoint a replacement for the afternoon.</P>

I had sought in an earlier amendment to extend the use of postal voting.  The requirement that a member of the Garda Síochána should accompany an approved officer to the home of the special voter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does the Minister have figures of the average number of special voters per constituency?  I am not arguing about the costs but I would ask the Minister to explain the reason for the extraordinary security arrangements in the case of special voters, especially when we allow many thousands of people to use the simplified postal voting system. Why are special voters treated differently?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 85:</P>
      <P>In page 53, subsection (1), lines 34 and 35, to delete &ldquo;, in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to find out why it is necessary that a member of the Garda Síochána accompany a special presiding officer to deliver the ballot paper to the special voter.  Usually the person doing this job is fairly familiar with the list of applicants. At a time when the gardaí are fairly busy it is an unnecessary requirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I repeat the questions I have just put to the Minister.  I would go somewhat further than Deputy Kavanagh.  It is equally cumbersome and costly to ask an authorised officer to travel from house to house for the issue and collection of ballot papers.  Why not allow these people to use the postal voting system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 82 sets out the method of voting by disabled persons who are registered as special voters.  The voting papers are delivered to the elector at his home by a special presiding officer accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  The section re-enacts existing law without any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete the requirement for the presence of the Garda.  In the special voting arrangements the presence of a garda serves a number of purposes.  The garda is the independent witness who ensures that voting is properly carried out and that the secrecy and integrity of the ballot are <Col N="2145" /> respected.  He provides physical security and protection for the special presiding officer, the ballot papers and other voting documents.  He protects the presiding officer against baseless and malicious allegations that might otherwise be levelled at him.  A garda in uniform is a symbol of law and order, justice and fair play.  His very presence enhances the integrity of the system.</P>
    <P>When the special voting system was introduced in 1986 the Minister of the day saw the presence of a garda in uniform as one of the strengths of the new system, indeed the essential core of the system. He rejected utterly the suggestions that voters would be frightened or embarrassed by a visit to their house of a garda in uniform.  I would refer Deputies to the Official Report of the Seanad of 9 December 1986 on this matter.  I would be inclined to accept the then Minister's view of the position and therefore I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate why postal voting <i>simpliciter</i> is not used as is the case in regard to other persons, namely, the Garda Síochána, soldiers, diplomats and so on?  Has the Minister any detail on the number of gardaí involved or the cost per vote under the present system?  This seems to be an extremely cumbersome process and could be totally avoided if the postal voting system was used.  The Minister might have some concern in regard to a civilian official travelling about with ballot papers, that it would be desirable that he or she be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  I would not suggest otherwise; nevertheless, the process at present is cumbersome and unnecessary and it makes no sense not to use the postal voting system in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of postal voting has already been dealt with under section 14.  The bottom line in regard to postal voting is that it is not possible to extend to the postal voter and his ballot paper the guarantee of secrecy, security and integrity which are provided at the <Col N="2146" /> polling station.  Until a way can be found of doing this an extended system of postal voting is unlikely to commend itself.</P>
      <P>At present unsupervised postal voting at Dáil elections is confined to members of the security forces.  Voting by diplomats and their spouses takes place in the embassies and consulates and is supervised by a person nominated by the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Voting at Seanad panel elections is supervised by officials such as the Clerk of the Dáil or Seanad, county registrar, county manager, or senior Garda officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes my case that it would not be an intrusion on the electoral process to allow the postal voting system to apply.  I do not understand the Minister of State's view that a special voter would not be entitled to some security or secrecy in regard to their ballot while members of the Defence Forces and others using the postal voting system are entitled to such security and secrecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister talking about 4,000 Garda visits to homes on the one day or over a period of a few days and is the garda accompanied by an authorised officer?  The cost of carrying out such a service must be colossal.  Of course, as long as that cumbersome process is in place it is unlikely that it will be extended in any sympathetic way and people who for good reasons apply for special voting status will be subject to close scrutiny. As one understands a little more about this one realises why the original legislation contained so many unsavoury elements &mdash; for example, that which provided that a voter had to get a certificate from a doctor each time he or she renewed their application to prove they were not of unsound mind.  Matters are falling more into place now in regard <Col N="2147" /> to the disincentives which existed.  It is unlikely, because of the costly and time-consuming nature of this process, that the list of special voters will be extended to include those who genuinely deserve it.  I would like the Minister of State to give some undertaking that this matter will be considered again should he be returned to Government following the election.  I am totally unconvinced by the reasons advanced as to why we cannot extend the postal voting system to such people.</P>

      <P>The traditional opening hours of polling stations is from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. However, occasionally for various reasons a polling station may not open on time and my amendment seeks to have some extra time at the end of the day to make up for this.  People should have a full 12 hours during which to vote but occasionally, whether because of distance from the polling station of the person operating it or some other reason, not all polling stations open at 9 a.m. Therefore, some people are prevented from voting before going to work.  For that reason there should be some time made available after 9 p.m. to make up for the time lost at the start of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This group of amendments would curtail the discretion of the returning officer and the presiding officer in this regard and would require that where a polling station opened late the time loss would be made up if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed also to delete the provision which enables the poll to close early.  The provisions enabling the poll on an island to be shortened are quite important.  I do not have to remind the <Col N="2149" /> House how difficult conditions can be off the Atlantic coast and how quickly they can change.  It is essential that the presiding officer, the man on the spot, should have discretion to close the poll at any time after four hours of polling if he feels it necessary in order to ensure that the ballot box reaches the count centre on time.  Failure of a ballot box to reach the count centre by the time fixed for the commencement of the count would hold up proceedings at the count because, under our system, counting could not proceed until all ballot boxes were opened.  It is clearly desirable, in order to ensure the normal and efficient conduct of the count that these provisions be retained.  Obviously we could tolerate a delayed count, but it would be intolerable if the Oireachtas were to put at risk the safety of polling staff, boatmen and gardaí in the interests of false uniformity. I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument put forward by the Minister seems reasonable on the face of it.  However, if only four hours are allowed for polling that would deprive somebody of their vote and surely that is more important than the danger that the count might be delayed. We are not in the days when boats had to be rowed back and forth.  We now have helicopters and the weather would have to be very foul indeed before one would have to deprive people of the services of lifeboats or helicopters.  Obviously if the whole poll on an island has been taken why not close up and send the box back to the count centre?  That is not to say that any returning officer should have the power to close his polling station simply because he wants to see the count carried out within their hours of counting.  Where other boxes have to be opened I do not see that a slight delay in the arrival of a box would unduly delay a count.  If a candidate were to die in the middle of an election that whole count would be put back and an election would be held maybe two or there weeks after every other count has been completed.  This has happened in the past in my constituency. <Col N="2150" /> I do not like the idea of reducing the time for polling to a minimalist four hours which could deprive people of their right to vote.</P>

      <P>These are emergencies which happen only rarely.  To put this matter in perspective it must be recalled that the island electorate is very small. The largest is Inishmore with 664 electors and the smallest Inishfree with just 11 electors.  I seem to remember that for many years an island off Donegal had just two electors.  I understand that on one of our smaller islands all of the electors normally cast their votes within a very short period of time after the arrival of the ballot box.  I would suggest again that the Deputy withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to put an amendment down but, unfortunately, I forgot to do so.  There is a provision under this section for polls to be taken up to five days before the rest of the country polls in the case of islands.  This has just been lifted straight from the old legislation. I imagine the Minister did not give the matter the slightest thought when he was reviewing the legislation but just reproduced what was there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a pity, because we have moved on.  We have helicopters, as Deputy Kavanagh said.  Boats are much faster now. There are light planes servicing many of the islands.  There may be very few electors but every vote counts and every elector in this country is important.  The islanders are a bit like the travellers; they are a very neglected part of our population. They are few in number with little <Col N="2151" /> influence.  We missed a great opportunity here to try to redress the balance and put them on the same basis as everybody else.  Apart from anything else, there are frequently last minute happenings in a campaign, last minute revelations, last minute changes in party positions.  The rest of us, living on the mainland of Ireland, can decide how we are going to vote up to five minutes before the closing of the poll at 9 p.m.  On the islands people frequently have to make up their minds five days before polling day.  It is a great pity that the opportunity was not taken to update this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point that Deputy Garland is making. However, it is at the discretion of the returning officer to decide when to close the polling station.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> The purpose of this amendment is to include photographs on the ballot paper. It is something that is done elsewhere. Perhaps somebody will point out to me that it is in areas where there is more illiteracy than we have in this country. Nevertheless, it is a problem for some people to recognise candidates who may have similar names and may be of different genders, so photographs may be of help to some people.  We had some discussion on this on Second Stage.  I know the arguments against it &mdash; the delay that could be occasioned because of having to include photographs, the quality of photographs and the fact the photographs might bear little resemblance to how a candidate looks today.  However the idea is right, but because we do not want to delay the Bill I will for the moment withdraw my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 95a is almost identical to the amendment in the name of Deputy Kavanagh in that it seeks to have photographs included on ballot papers.  However my amendment is more specific in that it indicates what the size of the photographs should be.  I am suggesting that photographs should be four centimetres by three centimetres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I have tabled this amendment for a different reason.  I do not think people realise just how many illiterate and semi-illiterate people there are in the country.  A study carried out by the Department of Education in 1986 showed that there were no fewer than 400,000 adults in this category.  I received a letter today from a person in County Mayo in which he indicated that, given his extreme literacy problems, he finds it difficult to vote at polling stations.  I suggest that there are many more people like him.  The Government party however would not like to admit that there are so many illiterate and semi-illiterate people in the country.  Nevertheless, it is a major problem and we must face up to it.  It would be easy to make this simple improvement.  Indeed, I have a specimen ballot paper in front <Col N="2153" /> of me with small photographs beside the names of candidates.  Having regard to the fact that the Bill will have to be returned to the Seanad, why should we not do something for the 400,000 people who will find themselves at a disadvantage in this area?</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I support this amendment.  During the course of my conribution on Second Stage I gave as an example a family the members of which had not voted in the last election because one of them was illiterate and they did not want this fact to be made known.  They are quite adamant that a photograph should be included on the ballot paper so that a person would be able to recognise the candidate they wish to vote for and cast their vote.  I do not know if the Minister of State has made any effort to calculate what the extra cost involved would be but this change would be of help to these people.  Literacy classes are being held for adults who need help in reading and they should be given every chance to exercise their democratic right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the purpose of the amendment is to assist voters who cannot read and those with impaired vision.  Under existing law, restated in this Bill, a voter whose sight is so impaired that he is unable to vote without assistance may have the ballot paper marked on his behalf by a companion or by the presiding officer.  A voter who cannot read or write may ask to have his ballot paper marked by the presiding officer under this provision.  The presiding officer may assist the voter by reading out in full the details in relation to each candidate on the ballot paper and then mark the ballot paper as instructed by the voter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the inclusion of photographs of candidates on ballot papers might assist some voters, the effectiveness of the measure overall is likely to be limited. Under our system of proportional representation, which allows the voter to vote for the candidates in the order of his choice, certain categories of voters would <Col N="2154" /> still require assistance in marking ballot papers.  The inclusion of photographs would give rise to practical difficulties. For example, it would put extra pressure on the resources of the returning officer at a time when he is already operating under pressure.  At an election very little time is available for preparing, printing and issuing ballot papers, which have to be printed as soon as practicable after the closing date for receipt of nominations to ensure maximum time for the delivery and return of postal ballot papers.  The extra time required for the checking of photographs, ensuring that they are of suitable standard and quality and making certain that the photographs match the names on the ballot paper, would add considerably to the demands on the resources of returning officers.  It would also increase the cost of elections.</P>
    <P>Photographs on ballot papers could assist some electors in identifying the candidate they wish to vote for, but only if they already know what the candidate looks like.  Thus there would be an inbuilt bias in favour of well known candidates at the expense of lesser known ones, particularly first time and non-aligned candidates.  It also misses the point that most electors vote on the basis of party with preferences for individual candidates being a secondary consideration. Our electoral system is already criticised for putting undue emphasis on personalities rather than policies.  By including photographs we would exaggerate this tendency and it could have the effect of trivialising elections and turning them into some kind of beauty contest.</P>

      <P>I should say that the Minister of State's response was disappointing. There is an old expression: where there is a will there is a way.  In this case the problem is that there is no will.  The Minister of State has made no effort to facilitate the 400,000 people who are illiterate or semi-illiterate, to say nothing about the people whose eyesight is failing.  I would imagine that most of the 400,000 people are semi-illiterate. However, they might be numerate and know how to mark one, two, three and four on the ballot paper.  Nevertheless, they find it difficult to read names.  There are tens of thousands of dyslexics in this country but they are quite intelligent and well able to cast their vote.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State made the point that people tend to vote for a party rather than for personalities.  That may be so, but I would remind him that no reference is made in the Constitution to political parties.  It could be argued that we do not need political parties and that this country could function without them.  I feel strongly therefore that the balance of advantage lies in accepting this simple amendment and I intend to press it.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> While I accept what the Minister of State has said may be true, that voters receive help at polling stations, this comes down to a question of catering for those who cannot read.  During the course of my contribution on Second Stage I asked the Minister of State if he had made any effort to estimate what the extra cost involved would be.  I accept that this would cause difficulties, but provided the cost would not go beyond what was acceptable this proposition should be seriously considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat that presiding officers may assist illiterate voters.  Furthermore, it is not possible to estimate what the extra cost involved would be.  Severe practical difficulties <Col N="2156" /> would be encountered in producing ballot papers complete with photographs in the limited time available at a Dáil election.  Great care would have to be taken to ensure rigid standardisation of photographs in regard to size, shape, colour, finish, pose and so on.  There would be a serious danger that photographs of individual candidates would be confused either in the returning officer's office or at the printers, particularly where a large number of candidates are involved.  For example, during the 1989 general election there were 13 or 14 candidates in a number of constituencies. I repeat that we have considered this matter carefully and I am not in favour of inserting &ldquo;photographs&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 92:</P>
      <P>In page 56, subsection (2) (a), lines 35 to 41, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;The&rdquo; in line 35 down to the end of the paragraph and substitute &ldquo;The order in which the names of the candidates shall appear shall be determined by lot by the returning officer,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is similar to amendment No. 93 in the name of Deputy Kavanagh. It is absolutely absurd that we still retain the alphabetical system of placing names on the ballot paper.  My amendment proposes that the order in which the names of the candidates shall appear shall be determined by lot by the returning officer.  The Electoral Reform Society in London, who carry out ballots for various organisations, are skilled in this area and they produce ballot papers, on which names are selected at random.  If we continue with the present system, surnames of most Dáil Deputies will begin with A, B or C &mdash; for example, a few years ago a candidate changed his name prior to an <Col N="2157" /> election, calling himself Abbey of the Holy Cross Fitzsimons.  This resulted in his name appearing at the top of the ballot paper and, while he was not elected, he probably received many more votes than if his name appeared under Fitzsimons.</P>
    <P>This is a simple reform and is not a party political point because in every party there are people whose initials range from A to Z.  This is a matter that must be considered.  While Electoral Acts have been improved and updated, many areas have not been properly considered. I raised this matter on Second Stage and there was adequate opportunity for the Minister to put down an amendment in this area.  I will be curious to hear what possible excuse or reason he puts forward for continuing with this ridiculous system.</P>

      <P>I find this subject very interesting.  Since Deputy Garland and his colleagues in the Electoral Reform Society appear to have carried out such interesting work, will they give an indication as to whether there is a significant deviation between the distribution of initials among Members of this House on the one hand and members of the general population on the other hand and whether that is statistically significant to the order of the ballot paper?  Looking back at the records of this House for many years, while to my knowledge there has been no Member whose surname began with X or Z, all the other letters have been reasonably well represented. I doubt that there is any statistically significant deviation between the number of candidates who are elected to this House per initial and the frequency of occurrence of those initials among candidates, not to speak of among the general population. Some of these matters should probably be the subject of learned debate and mathematical discussion for about 30 years before we should bother with them.</P>

The initial of my surname is mid-way through the alphabet and therefore this amendment is of no great benefit to me, but it would be of considerable benefit to some candidates.  Perhaps the reason Deputy Dukes is elected before his colleague is that his name appears first on the ballot paper.</P>

The order of names is significant and may result in tight transfers.

      <P>The alphabetical arrangement of candidates names on ballot papers was the subject of a High Court action in 1986 when the court took the view that the alphabetical system of arranging candidates names provided for in the Electoral Act, 1963, was a reasonable one.  In the course of his judgment Mr. Justice Murphy referred to the advantages of the alphabetical system &mdash; the voter can quickly find any particular candidates and as it is an establishing procedure in so many fields it is seen as a reasonable, practical solution to selecting or preparing any list of names.  While the alphabetical arrangement may not be a perfect system, to determine the order of names by lot would do nothing to remove the advantage claimed by some in favour of those on top of the ballot paper.  It would merely lead to a transfer of the alleged grievance from one set of candidates to another.  In terms of confused electors and spoilt papers I suspect that such a solution could well be worse than the alleged problem.  Therefore I would ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I would counter the Minister's response to this matter.  I accept that under the present system the placement of names in alphabetical order on ballot papers can be an advantage to some electors.  My amendment dealing with the distribution of polling cards proposes that a specimen ballot paper be distributed with the polling cards to enable people to be absolutely clear as to who is running in an election and their party affiliation, if any.  That would give people an opportunity to study the specimen ballot paper and make their choice accordingly.  I am pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 56, subsection (2) (b), line 44, after &ldquo;Party&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or `Independent' &rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very grateful to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and to the House for allowing me to make this contribution.  In my experience nobody anywhere refers to Members such as myself, past or present, as &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;; we are universally referred to as &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; Members of the House.  Perhaps the Minister considers us as &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; before the election and &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; after the election.  However, that is nonsense.  Political historians and commentators unanimously refer to candidates &mdash; or, after the election, Members &mdash; as &ldquo;Independents&rdquo; and indeed Independents have held the balance of power.  They have given stability to Governments and have never withdrawn their support for petty reasons.  It may well be that after the election the Government will require the support of Indpendents.  The very least <Col N="2161" /> we can be granted is the privilege of allowing that term to be put on the ballot paper after our names.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider his position in regard to this amendment?  Two additional words are required to allow the term &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; to be used by candidates like me.  For the past 11 years I have been described in this House, and by political commentators, as an Independent TD, but if the Minister has his way I will suddenly become a non-party candidate.  Nothing could be more confusing to the electorate.  I am not just speaking on my behalf.  There are, as the Minister knows, Independent councillors, Senators and representatives throughout the length and breadth of the State.  This is a perfectly reasonable request.  I wish to re-emphasise that in the past, when Independent Members of this House were requested by leaders of the main political parties to give them their support to ensure political stability, they have done so.  The very least one expects when standing in the democratic process is that one is described in the <Col N="2162" /> same terminology which has prevailed for over ten years in the House.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are a great man for using grammatical phrases and so on.  I am sure you will agree that the term &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; is automatically negative.  I always think of it in that way, as one is seen to be against political parties when one is described as &ldquo;non-party&rdquo;. If one were described as an &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; one would be rightly seen, as one desires to be seen, as independent of political parties.  Grammatically, and every other way, the correct way to describe a candidate such as myself is one who is independent of the political parties.  I hope that having listened to the points I made the Minister will regard it as fair and reasonable to reconsider his decision and to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to maintain the concept that has always been understood by the general public, that we have a secret ballot.  The practice of the counterfoils and ballot papers having the same numbers is a departure from the concept of a true secret ballot. This is something that the general public have not been aware of and they do not realise that there is a way of tracing how a person voted.  This is usually only sought where there is some misdemeanour or a challenge in relation to the voting of a particular individual and their ballot paper can be taken up from the vaults of Dublin Castle, the courthouse in Wicklow or elsewhere.  Should a ballot paper be closely scrutinised during a count, it is possible to trace how a person voted. There is nothing new about this proposed amendment, but it is worth repeating here.  We cannot claim to have a secret ballot when identical numbers are affixed to both the counterfoil and the ballot paper and that is why I have put down this amendment.</P>

      <P>The serial number serves a number of important purposes at an election.  First, it is an essential part <Col N="2165" /> of the security precautions against the introduction of forged or counterfeited ballot papers.  By reference to the serial number it is possible to establish whether a particular ballot paper is genuine.  It is, therefore, an important safeguard and reinforces the security provided by the official mark.  The serial number is the means by which one ballot paper can be distinguished from another with absolute certainty.  This could arise, for example, where the returning officer's ruling on the validity of a particular paper is being questioned.  An election petition could be based on the grounds that the returning officer was incorrect in ruling in or ruling out ballot papers bearing certain serial numbers.  The serial number is an essential part of the control system in regard to issuing and accounting for ballot papers at an election.</P>
      <P>The returning officer is required, under section 94 (6), to maintain a record of the numbers of the ballot papers provided by him at each polling station.  Thus, a tight control and security system is maintained. For example, if ballot papers are rejected at the count for lack of the official mark, the returning officer by referring to the serial numbers will identify the station at which the papers were issued and will be able to take appropriate action in relation to the presiding officer concerned.  I want to say, quite categorically, that there is no way in which a ballot paper used by an individual elector can be identified.  The serial number constitutes no danger whatever to the secrecy of the individual ballot. I would hope that no Member of the Oireachtas would in any way lend support to the totally baseless allegation that is sometimes made in this regard.  The serial number is an important part of the security system and accounting arrangements at an election.  It cannot affect the secrecy of the ballot.  It is important that the system be retained, and I hope the amendment will be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I reiterate the point I made.  How can we claim to have a secret ballot when there are numbered ballot papers which coincide with numbers on <Col N="2166" /> the counterfoil to which they were attached?  I do not think that point can be contested.  The only totally secret ballot is where there is no mark except that made by the presiding officer which ensures that when a ballot paper is handed out on polling day it is stamped and that a copy ballot paper cannot be brought into the polling station.  That is the most important mark on a ballot paper &mdash; the mark impressed on the ballot paper and the counterfoil by the presiding officer. In the eight or nine general elections, the by-election and the European elections I fought I have never suggested to anybody that they did anything wrong with their ballot papers.  I hope I carried out my duty both as a candidate and as an agent for a predecessor of mine for many years. However, I do believe there is a strong perception among the general public that there is no way a ballot paper can be traced.  I am aware that a challenge can be mounted in court and ballot papers can be retrieved and scrutinised.  The Minister obviously is not going to accept this amendment.  He is holding fast to the argument he has made but I contend that there is less than a secret ballot operating and, therefore, I wish to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 98:</P>
      <P>In page 57, subsection (2), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) the top right hand column on the ballot paper shall bear such markings so as to ensure that nothing may be written herein,&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert a new subsection in section 88 that sets out the form of the ballot paper and how the ballot paper shall be laid out.  If we look at the Fourth Schedule to the Bill, where the form of the ballot paper is set out, what I am proposing will be <Col N="2167" /> immediately clear.  On the ballot paper, on the right hand side over the column containing the names of the candidates, there is a blank space.  We do not have a huge rate of spoiled votes, but one of the most frequent means of spoiling a vote is that people inadvertently or otherwise write their names in the space on the top of the column containing the candidates' names.  To prevent that happening I propose we put some suitable shading into that space to make it clear that nothing is to be written in there.</P>
    <P>When I formulated the amendment I proposed that the space should be crosshatched with black lines.  I pay a compliment to the staff of the House who were very quick to come back and tell me that they might have difficulties in doing that because if I were to try to make an amendment to the Schedule they would have to make a diagram of what I had proposed and they would have some difficulties with the printers.  They invited me to reflect again and see if there was not a clearer way of expressing it. Hence the amendment we have before us which, taking the advice of the Bills Office in the House, is a much more elegant and clearer way of doing what I proposed than that which I initially chose.  It is churlish to say it, but there is a slight error in the text of the amendment. The word &ldquo;so&rdquo; should not appear in the second line of the amendment.  It should read:</P>
    <P>the top right hand column on the ballot paper shall bear such markings as to ensure that nothing may be written therein,</P>
    <P>The intention is clear, to put crosshatched lines or wavy lines or something like that in the space so that it will be clear to the voter that nothing should be written there.  It might also have the incidental advantage of making the returning officer's mark on that part of the ballot paper appear more clearly in that there would be a bit of contrast to the background.  This measure might help to reduce the incidence of spoiled votes. A ballot paper which is otherwise validly <Col N="2168" /> marked but which has the name of a person written at the top will be regarded as a spoiled vote.  I recommend this amendment to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the directions which must be complied with in the preparation of the ballot paper.  The amendment proposes to add an additional instruction which would require the top right hand column of the paper to bear such markings as will ensure that nothing may be written therein.  This part of the ballot paper is reserved for the official mark in the existing prescribed form of the ballot paper which is set out in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1972.  The space carried the words &ldquo;marc oifigiúil &mdash; official mark&rdquo; and an arrow.  This was designed to remind the presiding officer that he must stamp the official mark on this part of the paper.  It had been found in practice that a surprising number of electors think they must copy this design and set it down in relation to the candidates they wished to vote for.  The legend, which was confusing, has been omitted from more recently designed ballot papers &mdash; for example, those relating to the Euro elections.  The omission has not led to any increase in the number of papers rejected for absence of the official mark. It is necessary to retain this space for the official mark.  If the space was obscure or overprinted there is a danger that some presiding officers would not appreciate that the space was reserved for the official mark and might place the mark on any other part of the paper, possibly in the space reserved for marking a vote.  It is desirable that the space remain blank. The Deputy might consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has just told us that since the direction was taken off the ballot paper there has not been any increase in the numbers of papers spoiled because of an absence of the official mark.  That seems to indicate, not surprisingly, that our presiding officers are a fairly intelligent group of people and are capable of understanding <Col N="2169" /> the directions given to them by the Department as to where to put the official mark.</P>
      <P>That is not the problem.  The problem arises from the fact that in a blank space like that a few electors feel obliged to write something.  If they write something in it, the ballot is spoiled.  If we give a direction to the presiding officers that that is the part of the ballot paper where the official mark is to be put and we have some design which prevents people from writing in it, we will secure the objective we want, which is to have fewer spoiled votes.  The Minister should consider this. It is not presiding officers I am getting at. I am trying to help voters to avoid any invitation or encouragement to write there.  If there is some sort of device on it they will not write there and we will reduce the number of otherwise spoiled votes.  I am sure our presiding officers are sharp enough, aware enough and intelligent enough to know that that is where they should put the official mark and there will be no problem.</P>

This Bill has been before the House since 1991 and we are now near the end of 1992.  It is a very important complex Bill which deserved and has got a very good Committee Stage.  We have got through the work very well. However, there is no Report Stage, which means that the Minister is almost bound to turn down our requests for simple amendments like this.  If there was a Report Stage the Minister could accept a point and undertake to bring back an amendment on Report Stage.  Nothing could be more reasonable than what Deputy Dukes is proposing.  About 20 or 30 of the amendments we have proposed have been non-ideological, non-party political and not one has been accepted, with the exception of the item dealing with deposits.  With a Bill going through the House in a proper fashion the Minister would take on board these minor <Col N="2170" /> points and bring back a suitable amendment on Report Stage.  We cannot do that and we are rushing this legislation through.  Only God knows how many more years will pass before we have another Electoral Bill.  It could be ten or 20 years down the road.  This Bill is full of flaws which we ought to put right in this House but which we are not putting right.</P>

      <P>I appealed on Second Stage for the State to do something about the state of ballot boxes.  The old black tin boxes we use are very ancient and cumbersome and require sealing wax, wire and so on to maintain their confidentiality. I would not mind if the Minister sent the Minister or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance around the world to look at the type of ballot boxes being used.</P>
      <P>I suggested that we should have a see-through perspex panel on one side of the box which would allow people to see that their ballots had actually been popped into the box safely.  I have not tabled an amendment in this regard but that is required.  I have also suggested that some of the methods of sealing the boxes are very old-fashioned and that if the boxes did have a perspex panel they could be sealed before coming out of the polling stations.  The county registrar would have in his or her possession a key and would ensure that when the box came back it was opened by him or her personally or by somebody acting on behalf of him or her.</P>

      <P>It seems that Deputy Kavanagh lacks faith.  When one puts a voting paper through the aperture one can surely accept that it goes into the box and stays there.  I do not know that one needs a perspex panel in the boxes so that one can see the paper in the box.  A little act of faith is required of Deputy Kavanagh.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 99:</P>
      <P>In page 57, subsection (1), line 49, after &ldquo;place&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(and the address of the place)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to aid the drafters of the Bill.  It seeks to insert after the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; the words &ldquo;(and the address of the place)&rdquo;.  I feel that it is preferable to include on the card the address of the place where polling is taking place as well as the name of the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the section as drafted would oblige the returning officer to provide sufficient information to enable local electors to find the premises at which voting is to take place.  Polling stations are normally located in prominent public buildings and the name of the building would usually be sufficient guide.  For example, in most cases the location of the local town hall, <Col N="2172" /> courthouse and national school would be well known to local people and no elaboration would be necessary.</P>
      <P>The amendment would probably require the full postal address to be given in every case.  It is difficult to visualise any circumstances under which the full address would be necessary.  Its inclusion would serve no practical purpose but would tend to increase the cost involved in producing the cards.  Computer addressed cards are now the norm.  Space is severely limited on those cards and unnecessary detail must be avoided.</P>
      <P>I consider that this is a matter best left to the judgment of the returning officer. Under the provision as drafted the returning officer will be required to include as much of the address of the polling station as is necessary to identify the premises in question.</P>
      <P>The amendment is unnecessary and undesirable and I ask the Deputy to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>In page 57, subsection (1), line 51, after &ldquo;section 111&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and listing each candidate and their political party or an expression in accordance with section 46 (5)* in the same order as they will appear on the ballot paper&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to put a small extra burden on the returning officer or whoever is responsible for the distribution of the polling cards.  There is a slight flaw in the way in which we deal with our elections.  Everything is taken step by step but there is a defect in that there is no list of candidates available to electors in a constituency.  Electors depend on the newspapers; yet I know that the first time I stood for election one of the newspapers left out my name in the list of candidates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not <Col N="2173" /> worry, I got plenty of votes anyway.  I had been duly nominated but the newspapers, after collecting the information from the returning officer, omitted to include my name.  People also depend on leaflets.  Sometimes leaflets are kept and sometimes they are not, and then on the night before the election when electors sit down to decide for whom they will vote they take the leaflets out of a drawer &mdash; if they can find them.  Perhaps in some cases the pet dog would have chewed up the leaflets after they were posted through the letterbox; all of us who have canvassed know that to be a quite frequent happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very obvious and a very simple improvement would be made in our electoral procedures if at the time of distribution of the polling card a specimen ballot paper &mdash; in whatever order that paper may be drafted; we have now decided, unfortunately, that we will still use alphabetical order &mdash; were distributed as well.  I remind the House that frequently there are up to 15 and sometimes 20 names on a ballot paper.  We want to encourage people to use the proportional representation system properly by voting down the ticket.  I realise that the Minister's party are known as the &ldquo;plonkers&rdquo; party.  For them it is a matter of &ldquo;one, two, three Fianna Fáil and to hell with the rest&rdquo;.  That is not the kind of voting we want to encourage.  We should encourage people to use the proportional representation system to its maximum extent by voting right down the paper. For the average person with a primary school education who might be working in a manual job or who might perhaps be not working at all &mdash; a person who is not very literate or numerate &mdash; it is very intimidating to have to face a long list of candidates' names.  I suspect that many people get halfway through filling out their voting paper and then suddenly discover that there is another candidate, whether that candidate be from Fine Gael, the Green Party or an Independent candidate, they did not realise was standing for election.  I know that voters can always ask for a fresh ballot paper but people tend not to do so.  Voters may get <Col N="2174" /> down as far as their eighth preference and then decide to screw up the paper and not bother voting.</P>
    <P>This improvement could be effected simply.  I am sure that the Minister will tell me that acceptance of the amendment would lead to greater expenditure, would add to the workload of the returning officer and so on.  However, this improvement would be of considerable benefit to our democratic process.  It is my opinion that if we were to do nothing more than make this change in the Bill we would be making a very big change.  I hope that the other parties will support me in this amendment because it concerns a very commonsense, simple measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned that some of the points I would raise are that acceptance of the amendment would result in greater expenditure and increased work for the returning officer.  The measure suggested in the amendment is not practical.  There is no doubt that people do know who the candidates are because of the election campaigns and the publicity in the news media and elsewhere.  Clear evidence of that is provided by the number of people who get votes and by the number of people who are elected.  I certainly do not support this unnecessary amendment.  As I have said, there are also practical difficulties and cost implications.  It is not necessary to send a specimen ballot paper to every elector and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed at the Minister's reply.  Of course, this issue does not affect the Minister's party very much because Fianna Fáil have a very big electoral machine and they make sure that they get to canvass every house and that plenty of leaflets are distributed.  I know to my cost that this measure is necessary.  It must be borne in mind that as a democracy we should try to facilitate in every possible way new parties and new candidates who want to enter the House.  Certainly no obstacles should be put in their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first time I stood for election I met <Col N="2175" /> at the polling station numerous people in my local area who came out after voting and, on seeing me, said that they had not realised that I was standing for election. It might be said that I had not distributed those people with leaflets, and perhaps there were a few houses that did not get leaflets from my party.  That is the nature of small political parties and Independent candidates, especially those who are contesting their first election.  It is probably that candidates from small political parties and Independent candidates do not cover the ground.  Maybe they should and maybe it is right that they should be penalised, but I do not think they should be penalised.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that my amendment received no response from other Deputies.  There is no point in my pressing the matter.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 101 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 92 stand part of the Bill.'</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 92 (4) states:</P>
      <P>No action or other proceedings shall lie against a returning officer in respect of any failure to send, non-delivery of or error or mis-statement in a polling information card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand why it would not be fair that an action should lie against a returning officer for the non-delivery of a polling information card but I wonder why it was felt necessary to provide that there should be no action against the returning officer in respect of a failure to send a polling information card or in respect of an error in such a card or in respect of a mis-statement in such a card? There may very well be a reason for this. It is the kind of provision that stands out in a Bill such as this.  It seems to suggest <Col N="2176" /> that the responsibility is being shifted from the returning officer.  The purpose of the section is entirely laudable in that I believe we should try to make sure that every elector gets a polling information card.  If we are to go to the trouble of sending polling information cards surely we should make sure they are accurate. It seems to me that a subsection such as this, that seems to relieve the returning officer of any liability for the accuracy thereof, is questionable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) provides that in the event of a non-delivery of a polling card or any error contained in a card the returning officer is not liable for any action.  This has been the situation since the foundation of the State and I do not see any reason to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That could very well be the case but I would like to know why.  The section sets out to provide where a poll is to be taken at a Dáil election in a constituency the returning officer shall send to every elector a polling card. Therefore, it is the duty of the returning officer to send a polling card to every elector.  Then we find that subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>No action or other proceedings shall lie against a returning officer in respect of any failure to send,....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, we oblige him to send a polling information card and on the other we say if he does not send it there will be no action against him.  Even if there is an error or a mis-statement in the polling information card, again no action will lie against him.  It is perfectly understandable that no action should lie against him for non-delivery of the polling card, because once it passes from his hands and into the hands of An Post, then An Post have the responsibility.  I wonder why now, or since the foundation of the State, it was found desirable &mdash; I know the Minister has not been around for very long, a little longer than I have &mdash; to relieve the returning officer in this way and why is it felt necessary to repeat the provision here?  I know the Minister was <Col N="2177" /> not involved in the original Electoral Act that set this up but somewhere in his Department I feel there is an accumulated <i>corpus</i> of knowledge and wisdom, the result of which is that this provision appears in the Bill.  I would like to know why and what is the logic behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, I do not see that there is any need to change it.  In 99.9 per cent of cases he carries out the function exactly as he is supposed to. I am satisfied that the protection exists and I do not see any reason we should not retain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take up too much time but that answer is not really an answer.  The Minister said he sees no reason to change the provision. That is fine, there may very well be no reason for change and he might succeed in convincing me there is no reason to change if he could tell me why this provision exists in the first place.  I will go back to Deputy Kavanagh's earlier amendment, which I understood, and give a couple of examples.  The electorate who are looking for the Kilrush polling station &mdash; near Athy &mdash; which is now in Deputy Kavanagh's constituency &mdash; have to search very carefully to find a health centre there.  For example, the polling station which is known as Brownstown national school is in a place which nobody calls Brownstown, although it is at the end of the Brownstown Road, but is in a place which everybody knows as Cutbush. If you are a relatively new elector arriving in the area and you were told your vote would be in Brownstown national school and if you ask your neighbour where it was, he is likely to be puzzled because he knows the school as the Cutbush school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement for information is obviously a serious one.  The implications of misinformation are serious if an elector who would normally vote in Brownstown national school got, by error, a polling card which directed him or her to vote in the Curragh national school &mdash; in the days when there was a polling station in the national school there &mdash; there would <Col N="2178" /> be much aggravation about it and a person could well be aggrieved and feel the returning officer has not carried out his job.  Now we find under the provisions of this section there is no redress, there never has been any redress for it and the Minister does not know why.  I am not going to make a big federal case of this but it is not sufficient to say: &ldquo;That is the way it always has been and I see no reason to change.&rdquo;</P>

It has always been that way and there may well be no reason to change it.  It would be worth his while to ask sometime why it was done that way in the first place.  He may then come to the conclusion that it is a good idea to keep it that way or he may conceivably come to the conclusion that it should be changed.  To state that something has been the law for a long time and he sees no reason to change is not to answer the question.  Having said all that, I will not make a federal case out of it.</P>

The number of ballot papers provided at a polling station should be at least equal to the total number of persons eligible to vote in that station.

      <P>&ldquo;(i) a vertical panel at each entrance of sufficient size to allow the display of one poster measuring not more than two feet wide by four feet high for each candidate validly nominated for that constituency.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide outside each polling station a <Col N="2182" /> space which would permit the display of one poster for each candidate validly nominated for that constituency.  This arises from section 147 &mdash; which I think we all broadly support &mdash; which is designed to stop canvassing, displays, rírá agus ruaille buaille outside polling stations and to move them some considerable distance away.  I am delighted the Minister is proposing to move these activities 100 metres away from polling stations rather than 50 metres, as originally proposed.</P>
    <P>Even if we take that kind of activity away from outside polling stations and stop people being harassed by canvassers, activists and so on, on their way into the polling stations, it would be useful to have outside polling stations a display of the candidates who are seeking election.  This may not necessarily make a great deal of difference but it would be a last non-contentious reminder to people going into vote.  I think I am right in saying that in jurisdictions where there has not been the custom of this kind of activity outside polling stations or where it has been banned for some time there is still a provision where postering is allowed outside polling stations as a last piece of information for voters.  Of course, some other jurisdictions go the length of forbidding postering in public places except on sites which are specifically provided for that purpose, something we might get around to &mdash; this matter is not covered in the Bill and I will not raise it now.</P>
    <P>It would be useful, now that we are about to take away the hassle from immediately outside polling stations, to include a provision which would give a last chance to parties and candidates to give that information to voters.  I suggest that we require an adequately sized panel to be provided by returning officers outside polling stations to allow this to be done.  It would also have the advantage, compared with the present situation, that if the returning officer provides the panel he would also be responsible for having it taken away after the election.  The advantages of this in terms of avoiding littering would seem to be obvious.  I <Col N="2183" /> invite the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 156 is similar to this amendment.  As Deputy Dukes said, in view of the provisions in the Bill regarding canvassing outside polling stations, such panels would be very important.  The provision of panels is a requirement in France and, I think, in some other countries.  This is another much misinformation, propaganda, much misinformation, propaganda, mindless postering of telegraph poles, and so on at election time.  Yet when it comes to something which provides information, not propaganda, the Minister will probably say no.</P>
      <P>Has Deputy Dukes thought through the sizes of these panels?  My amendment provides that the size of each poster will not exceed 210 by 297 millimetres.  I am surprised Deputy Dukes, a convinced Eurocrat, does not talk in terms of millimetres and centimetres instead of feet.  I thought this country was trying to introduce the metric system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of those people who do not think in centimetres and millimetres &mdash; I confess I am one of them &mdash; I am proposing that each poster shall not exceed ten inches by seven inches, roughly the size of an A4 sheet of paper. This is an adequate size for a poster which basically is to inform the electorate who the candidates are.  It would not be abnormal to have 15 candidates seeking election in a constituency.  If, as Deputy Dukes proposes, a poster is two feet wide by four feet high, it will, if my arithmetic is correct, cover eight square feet.  If this is multiplied by 15 it gives 120 square feet or, in practical terms, 12 feet by ten feet. That is a very large display area.  Who is going to pay for this?  Undoubtedly the <Col N="2184" /> Minister will say that this will cost money and that is correct.</P>
    <P>The last thing the Green Party want is to unnecessarily increase Government expenditure.  We need to reach a compromise here. A small display panel which would limit posters to the size of an A4 sheet of paper would be sufficient.  We do not need propaganda-style posters. The big posters with photographs are a part of the party syndrome.</P>

      <P>Deputy Garland made the kind of case I might ordinarily make as to what would arise if the amendment by Deputy Dukes were accepted.  It is not the business of the returning officer to be involved in this area.  We have set out in this legislation to introduce the kind of reforms needed.  We do not intend to eliminate small posters.  If there were a number of candidates in the field, Deputy Dukes' proposal would amount to a kind of plaster.  That is not acceptable.  I do not want to see the returning officer getting involved outside the curtilage of the polling station.  We are setting out to impose some limits and to ensure that we do not have the type of poster to which we have grown accustomed.  The electorate is mature and people coming to polling stations to vote are entitled to greater dignity than has been afforded them in the past.  We should not depart very far from that type of principle.  The returning officer should not be involved in an inappropriate and unnecessary way.  Deputy Dukes broadly accepts what we are trying to do.</P>

      <P>In page 60, subsection (1) (a), line 4, to delete &ldquo;day&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is yet another attempt to suggest that Sunday voting would be appreciated by the electorate.  More people are free to vote on a Sunday than on a working day.  In some cases people start their day at religious services, while others go to sporting activities.  They would have the opportunity of casting their vote beforehand. On a working day many people, particularly those living in counties adjoining Dublin, have to travel long distances, leaving home early in the morning and returning late in the evening.  People are sometimes reluctant to go out to vote after a tiring day at work, especially in poor weather.  What has been done elsewhere within the EC can be done successfully here.  Sunday voting would perhaps allow more people to cast their vote.  The argument is not new and I am sure the Minister is fully aware of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to oppose this amendment because it introduces a degree of inflexibility.  There is nothing in the section which specifically prevents the Minister from holding an election on a Sunday.  There are many good reasons for Sunday voting but also many disadvantages. I wonder where the balance of advantage lies.  People frequently live and work in different constituencies, which may be far apart.  People from country areas in the west, south-west or south may work in Dublin, where they reside during the week, and they register for elections in Dublin.  Many of them go home at the weekend.  Far from facilitating them, this would put obstacles in their way.  The matter needs to be looked into.  Obviously it is not appropriate for the election which seems likely to be called tomorrow.  The balance of advantage appears to lie in leaving the section as it is.</P>

      <P>Following almost nine months of disagreement with Deputy Garland, it seems I can leave the remainder of this Bill to be dealt with by him.  I accept the point he is making regarding the introduction of unnecessary inflexibility. The existing law prevents the Minister from having elections on a Sunday. We are introducing the freedom to have elections on Sundays or on other days. When Deputy Kavanagh was Minister this was considered and strong reservations were put to him by the minority churches, who are very much opposed to Sunday voting.  That remains their position. We must take that factor into consideration. Clearly there are advantages, but there are also disadvantages.  We should not now introduce provisions which would oblige us to opt for Sunday in circumstances where there are legitimate objections and some disadvantages. Nevertheless if we decide it would be appropriate to hold elections on a Sunday we have for the first time the freedom to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied that we have this additional freedom. I would remind Deputy Garland that most of the people who leave this city for the weekend are registered in their home districts.  That seems to be the practice. Many people who have to vote on a week day are registered in rural constituencies because they prefer to maintain contact with their own county.</P>
      <P>Another point is that schools are generally available on a Sunday and there could be no interference with examinations, particularly as elections are often held in June.  I am satisfied that Sunday voting is possible at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to get involved in this because what the Minister is doing goes a certain distance towards opening up the possibility of Sunday voting but we should be conscious of what we are doing.  There would be enormous advantages in always having polling on Sundays and I would see it as no great disadvantage in being inflexible.  However, <Col N="2187" /> there is enough flexibility in that the election must be held not earlier than the 17th day or not later than the 25th day following the day on which the writ or writs for the election are issued.  That gives a latitude of one week.  I accept that there are other considerations that lead &ldquo;dissolving&rdquo; Taoisigh, or whatever one might call them &mdash; we have one at present &mdash; to decide that it should be 21 or 24 days.  However, there is a number of advantages in holding all elections on Sundays.</P>
      <P>First, there is the advantage of certainty, people would know exactly where they stood.  Second, there would be advantages for a number of groups of people who have not been mentioned here but who are frequently disenfranchised by having polling during the week.  For example, a large number of commercial travellers frequently find it difficult to cast their vote and some politicians are conscious of this.</P>
      <P>In reply to a remark that the Government seemed to be biased against commercial travellers in their 1992 budget, having regard to the rules for taxation on benefits in kind, a member of that Government said it was true and smiled. He went on to say that they are never around to vote, which meant he did not have to be concerned about it.  If we had polling on Sundays most commercial travellers would be able to cast their vote. There is also the case of students, a problem that was not addressed properly because of time constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill people who have two premises will have an option as to where they will be registered. However, that option is to be exercised by the registration authority, not by the voter.  That is unfair.  In regard to problems which have been mentioned recently about students casting their votes the resolution of this problem is that they should be given an option.  I do not believe it is unfair that people should decide which option they want to take, but voting on a Sunday would mean that more students would be in a position to travel to their home constituency without <Col N="2188" /> interfering with the course of their studies. Those who commute to and from Dublin to work must also be taken into consideration, although that is not a big issue in my constituency as the trains &mdash; when they arrive &mdash; travel from Kildare to Dublin in about 40 minutes.  Therefore, most people would be home in time to vote before the close of the polling station.  However, it is not uncommon for people to travel to Dublin daily from as far away as Athlone or even further. It is conceivable that there would be circumstances in which, on a weekday, a person might not be back home in time to vote.  Therefore voting on a Sunday would substantially facilitate such people.  There is another group of people, merchant seamen who regularly and rightly complain, that they are disenfranchised. It is fairly certain that some of our merchant seamen would be at home on most Sundays because of the short distances over which they travel. Sunday voting would be a great advantage to those groups of people who up to now have found it difficult to exercise their franchise.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as the Minister mentioned, a number of what we call the minority chuches here might object to Sunday voting, the religious groups who have a strong Sabbatarian tradition.  We owe it to the clarity of debate at the very least to say in this House that the reason we are not specifically providing for Sunday voting is that we do not wish to create a situation where people with a strong Sabbatarian tradition would feel offended.  In order to avoid offending those people &mdash; and it is right that we should not do so &mdash; we have decided to continue to run the risk of, effectively, disenfranchising a number of people who would be able to vote if polling took place on Sundays.  I am happy that we should do that, but this is the type of question that we should examine regularly, perhaps, every four or five years, to test opinion to see whether sabbatarianism continue to be as strong or whether people might relax the strictness of their observance.  This has been done, indeed, not far away from us, for the relatively <Col N="2189" /> virtuous &mdash; and I use that word in its old and, possibly, purist Latin sense &mdash; exercise of voting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are as many reasons why Sunday is an unsuitable day for voting as there are for it being a suitable day.  I cannot speak for County Kildare but I know that they are interested in sport.  Many elections are held in summer time, although that does not seem likely on this occasion.  Some counties are very involved in sporting activities and games are played far away from people's place of residence.  We must also consider those who work in hotels and on our transport services.  The picture has changed in the past number of years in regard to the type of activities which take place on Sundays. People are engaged in various activities on that day and Deputy Dukes should accept that.</P>
      <P>The view of the minority Christian churches here is certainly a consideration in regard to Sunday voting but not the only one.  I am happy to leave things as they are for the present, bearing in mind that we generally have a high turnout on polling day.  Giving the franchise to one group by changing polling day might have consequences for others.  On balance, I think we have just about got it right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell me that this is a repeat of existing legislation.  However, as I understand it, the effect of section 99 is that any person employed by a returning officer and working in a polling station in the constituency in which that person is registered, other than the one in which that person would normally vote, <Col N="2190" /> is entitled to be given a vote in the polling station in which he or she is working.  I believe some improvements have been made in that regard recently. Is it still the case that a person employed by a returning officer in a constituency adjoining the one in which that person lives is, effectively, disenfranchised by not being able to attend at a polling station in the constituency where he or she is registered?  While working in a polling station in an adjoining constituency, they are not allowed to vote in the adjoining constituency.  I take it that is the position.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to consider that position.

It is a second best solution.  I know the perfect one is simply not available because people have to be there at the proper opening time.  I would just ask the Minister if he would consider that and, perhaps when he is in opposition as spokesman on the Environment after the next election he could ask his successor to take the matter up in future legislation.</P>

      <P>The Bill says that when a person goes into a compartment to vote he must vote. When one comes to these Bills in the Department there are always arguments about the words &ldquo;will&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  As I understand it, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is the strongest exhortation to do something.  This Bill says that a person &ldquo;shall&rdquo; vote when he or she goes into the polling booth.  I agree that everybody should vote, but I suggest that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be substituted in that case and in the case of the other amendments I am putting forward.  We are still a democracy.  Even though one feels one must go down to vote for the sake of appearances, it should not be an offence under this Bill not to vote.  One may demonstrate one's dislike of all the candidates by not voting for any of them. However, according to this, a person must vote.</P>

      <P>Section 101 sets out the procedure for voting at the polling station at a Dáil election.  Subsection (3) provides that an elector, on receiving the ballot paper, shall go alone into a voting compartment and shall secretly record his or her vote on the ballot paper.  Similar provisions exist in section 103 (3) and section 103 (5) in relation to the marking of a ballot paper on behalf of a voter by a companion and presiding officer respectively.  These amendments propose to amend section 101 (3) to make it clear that the voter may either mark his ballot paper or that he may spoil it or write nothing on it.  They also propose to amend subsections (3) and (5) of section 103 to provide that in having a ballot paper marked on his or her behalf a blind, incapacitated or illiterate voter will have the choice of having the ballot paper marked, left blank or spoiled.</P>
      <P>What a person does with a ballot paper in the secrecy of the polling booth is, of course, his or her own business.  We live in a free democracy where everybody is free to vote or not to vote as he or she thinks fit.  We would, of course, hope that he or she would use the ballot paper to express a reasoned and intelligent choice between the different candidates presenting themselves.  We would hope that he or she would participate in the democratic process and play his or her part in choosing the Parliament to represent us and the Government to conduct the affairs of the nation in the coming term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make one point to Deputy Kavanagh.  Of course we want everybody to cast their vote when they have gone to the trouble of going to the polling station and gone into the secrecy of the polling booth.  There can be circumstances where <Col N="2193" /> somebody is perhaps illiterate, but that fact is not known and what they do in the polling booth is the best they can do in the circumstances.  For that reason, with the best will in the world, there will be some spoiled papers.  The system has worked reasonably well.  It is a comfortable system and not in need of any amendments of this kind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This, I think, is new in the Bill.  A voter is required, when he has filled in his ballot paper, to show the back of the folded paper to the presiding officer so as to disclose the official mark.  I think this is an unnecessary encumbrance on a person voting.  I am sure that the presiding officer will obviously want to know that the paper being put into the ballot box is the actual voting paper.  However, this business of walking up with one's ballot paper and holding it up seems an unnecessary requirement.  What is the effect if one does not do this and puts a ballot paper into the box?  Is that a spoiled vote?  If the presiding officer has not seen the back of the ballot paper, has not seen the mark, will he open up the ballot box and fish it out to take a look?  It may not be possible to comply with this requirement in, for example, the last hour of voting when things get hectic, there is a rush on and there is a need to facilitate people quickly.  There are hours in the day when there is no pressure, but a huge number of voters can turn up on their way from work or when they are going out in the evening.  I do not think this requirement is practical and that is why <Col N="2194" /> I put down an amendment to remove it. I think it is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>In exceptional cases neighbours or others might say that a person who has to ask someone to mark his ballot paper for him has all his faculties and should be able to mark his own ballot paper.  People should be told what would happen if they seek assistance even though they do not require it.  I am suggesting in this amendment that if a person says he is incapable of marking his ballot paper when that is not the case he would be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to have the following words included in the oath: &ldquo;and I am aware that if I knowingly give false information I may be prosecuted for perjury&rdquo;.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that a person does not allow somebody else to hear the name of the person he wishes to vote for.

      <P>I move amendment No. 123:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2196" /> In page 62, subsection (5), lines 41 and 42, to delete &ldquo;and the personation agents&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states that where a Dáil elector is unable to read or write the presiding officer shall, in the presence of the elector and the personation agents and no other person, mark the ballot paper.  Given that personation agents are political people I do not think they should be present when this takes place.  This may make no difference in large urban areas but I can assure the House that many people will not vote if they have to mark their ballot paper in the presence of certain people.  People should be allowed discretion; they are not fools simply because they are unable to read or write. They should be allowed to say that they do not want personation agents to be present in the polling booth when they ask the presiding officer to mark their ballot paper.  Therefore, personation agents should be included on the list of people who may be removed from the polling station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 103 (5) where a blind or incapacitated elector does not wish to have their ballot paper marked by a companion or where the elector is unable to read or write the presiding officer shall mark the ballot paper on behalf of the elector in the presence of the elector and personation agents only.  The amendment proposes to delete the provision under which the personation agents may be present where a ballot paper is marked by the presiding officer under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of having personation agents present when the presiding officer assists an elector in marking the ballot paper is to enable them to satisfy themselves that the presiding officer complies with the instructions of the elector.  An elector who is unable to read or who has severely impaired vision will be unable to verify that the presiding officer has marked the ballot paper as instructed. It is considered proper that personation agents should oversee the marking, otherwise the presiding officer could be <Col N="2197" /> put in an invidious position without protection against malicious charges of misdemeanour. The presence of personation agents would be essential to protect the interests of the elector and the presiding officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is the greater problem?  A person may not vote because he does not want his political allegiance or preferences to be made known. Indeed, he may not wish to indicate which candidate he favours over another from the same party.  We have been told that this is a secret ballot but if personation agents are allowed to be present they will have superior knowledge.</P>
      <P>What the Minister of State is saying in effect is that presiding officers cannot be trusted.  I am not saying all presiding officers are perfect and it may well be true that there are presiding officers who may not mark the ballot paper as instructed by the elector but I have not come across any of them.  In any event prior to an election party members and agents are given an opportunity to satisfy themselves that the people to be nominated as presiding officers have the trust of all political parties and individuals who stand for election.  Indeed, many of them are reappointed time and again.</P>
      <P>The presiding officer is usually well known.  It may be argued that presiding officers should be replaced by people who are unemployed, but the reason the county registrar repeatedly calls on the same people is that no complaints have been made against them.  Occasionally, a presiding officer may show some bias but generally speaking political parties are satisfied that presiding officers, particularly at general elections, are trustworthy. If I was in the position of one of the unfortunate people who due to the loss of a faculty may not be able to vote I would be happy to ask the presiding officer to do the job for me.  However, if two or three personation agents representing political parties were present, particularly in rural areas, I would have some reservations.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2199" /> In page 65, subsection (2), line 34, after &ldquo;poll,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and after all those in the polling station at the time entitled to and willing to vote have voted,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again I am sure the Minister will have a good reason for rejecting this amendment. What I am seeking to do here is to ensure that if people are in the polling station at close of poll the presiding officer will not refuse to allow them to vote.  Once a person is inside the door, he should be allowed vote.  It may happen that if there is a rush of voters in the last few minutes a fussy presiding officer will misinterpret the legislation and use the last quarter of an hour to seal the boxes.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether &ldquo;polling station&rdquo; covers the curtilage to the station.  For example, the polling station in my area is the Holy Rosary national school which has six polling booths.  I would like to know whether we are referring to polling booths, polling stations or the surrounding area which, in this case, includes the playground of the school. When people arrive in that area will they be allowed vote or will they have to be in the polling booth in order to vote?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (1) of section 110 the presiding officer must ensure that at the time fixed for the close of poll no further electors are admitted to the polling station while at the same time ensuring that any elector on the premises is permitted to vote.  Subsection (2) provides that after the close of poll the presiding officer must seal the ballot box and make up in separate sealed packets the various documents used in connection with the election.  Marked copies of the register, unused and spoiled ballot papers, counterfoils of ballot papers, ballot paper accounts and authorisations to vote at the polling station must then be delivered to the returning officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert in subsection (2) a provision that the ballot box shall not be sealed until after all those in the polling station at the time entitled <Col N="2200" /> to and willing to vote have voted.  Under subsection (1) it is clear that at the time fixed for close of the poll any elector on the premises shall be entitled to receive a ballot paper and to vote &mdash; voting obviously includes putting the ballot paper into the ballot box.  The point made in the amendment is already covered and the amendment is therefore unnecessary.</P>

      <P>In page 66, subsection (2) (b) (ii), line 30, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I looked at possible points of discussion on this Bill I had hoped that it would be in a special committee of the House which would have given us much more time on each section to tease out the Bill in a much wider fashion than is possible today.  As there is general agreement in the House that the Bill should be in operation for the referenda &mdash; and a possible general election &mdash; we are foregoing a full debate on the amendments I tabled.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 140:</P>
      <P>In page 67, before section 112 but in Part XVII, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;112.&mdash;(1)  Expenditure by candidates and parties in connection with an election shall not exceed an amount to be determined by regulations made by the Minister with the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(2) The regulations may also provide for audit of accounts of expenditure.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>This is an example of an amendment on which I should have liked to have a wide debate but I know that there is not time to consider it in any detail.  At present and for some years past the expenditure by candidates at general elections has, in some instances, been a disgrace.  So much money is spent on certain campaigns that it is very hard for others to match it, even in a small way.  Small parties are at a great disadvantage compared to major parties in the electoral procedure.  It would be desirable to revert to the practice of 40 years ago where there was a limit on a candidate's expenditure during an election. The same applied to parties.  It meant there was a level playing field for all candidates.  In the last general election and in the European election the amount of money spent was astronomical.  It was spent on documentation, advertisements in newspapers and in making claims which could not be rebutted during a campaign.  It is very costly to employ people, which also puts smaller parties and the less well off candidates at a big disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister will reject my amendment, but if there is a move from democracy it is because of the amount of money some people can spend during the course of an election.  We should revert to the former practice, although it was not very practical.  I operated it when I was the election agent for my predecessor and he had to account for every penny he spent on the election. <Col N="2202" /> Of course that system was also open to abuse but not to the same extent as at present.  I should dearly like all parties to accept my amendment.  The excesses at present in elections lead one to believe that the normal democratic process can be interfered with as a result of the amount of money spent, which can influence people.</P>

      <P>I understand some of Deputy Kavanagh's concerns and worries but I disagree fundamentally with his amendment.  While I agree that there is a problem, I disagree with the way he is trying to solve it.  I do not believe that this kind of measure, which is open to all kinds of interpretation and abuse, will achieve his objective.  I do not accept that there is an abuse in the sense that my party have unlimited amounts of money to spend on elections or that there is any question of interference with the process of democracy by the amount of money which my party spend on elections.  From personal experience I know what I am talking about.  We are about to embark on an election campaign and I assure Deputy Kavanagh that there will not be abuse or interference with democracy as a result of the amount of money my party will spend on the campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>People like Deputy Kavanagh, who comment on these matters should know better and should choose their language more accurately.  There is no sense in which it has ever been the case in my party that a candidate had an unlimited amount of money to spend. Deputy Kavanagh and others may be unaware of the fact that certain economies of scale arise for a party in funding an election from having candidates in 41 constituencies.  Deputy Kavanagh's party are not in that position as far as I know, nor are they likely to be, but there are economies of scale from which parties can gain.  The result is that in some cases they get better value for money than smaller parties who do not have that scale of operation.  However, it means they need larger amounts of money to spend <Col N="2203" /> in absolute terms because they are campaigning in 41 constituencies and because &mdash; I am not betraying any secrets &mdash; they wish to have a consistent and coherent message to deliver to the voters.  I speak for Fine Gael, other parties can speak for themselves, but to suggest that there is any interference with democracy in the way we spend money on general elections is absurd.  There is no interference with democracy in using the facility of the free postal service, which is provided for in this Bill, to communicate with the electorate. Some of the expenditure may not achieve great value for money and I know that at every election my party examine very closely the effect of different kinds of expenditure.  The same applies to every argument we have about engaging in forms of canvassing.</P>
      <P>There never has been a time &mdash; nor do I foresee such a time &mdash; when my party have been in a position to say: &ldquo;To hell with the expense.  We are going to do everything and anything that could possibly be imagined to bring ourselves to the attention of the electorate.&rdquo;  As far as my party are concerned I want to reject utterly the suggestion in what Deputy Kavanagh said and in the amendment he proposed that there is anything improper, undemocratic or abusive in the way we spend money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last evening that this important debate on the future of the general medical service scheme takes place in a totally unreal atmosphere, characteristic of the atmosphere that has <Col N="2206" /> prevailed in this House over the past two or three days.  Since last evening the position has progressed from being unreal into being quite bizarre.  Again today we have had the unedifying spectacle of Government Ministers and party spokespersons for the two parties in Government squabbling on the national airwaves.  At least this disgraceful position will end tomorrow.  The people will have an opportunity in about three or four weeks' time of passing judgment on this Government, on all their performances and policies.</P>
      <P>In relation to their stewardship of the health services &mdash; the focus of our debate this evening &mdash; I have no doubt that both parties in this Government share equal responsibility and that they can expect no comfort whatsoever from the people. I dealt last evening at some length with the overall state of the health services and the indebtedness of the health boards nationwide.  I put that level of indebtedness on the record for all to see.  That is simply an indication of the neglect of the health services in general.  The motion this evening focuses on the threat to the general medical service scheme by the possible withdrawal of a majority of general practitioners from its operation. We have a very fine general practitioner service in this country, a scheme and service that has developed over the years and enjoys the trust of the people, particularly the most vulnerable sections of our community totally dependent on the system, the elderly, the unemployed and the poor.  It is a service which has performed well, giving frontline, basic and comprehensive health cover to people at home and within their local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said it is a service in which the people of Ireland trust, but that trust has now been fundamentally damaged.  In the course of this debate I do not want to spread alarm or anxiety among the many thousands of people dependent on this service.  I have no doubt that, even if it comes to pass that the majority of general practitioners are forced to withdraw, there will at the end of the day be very few doctors who will turn away patients in need of their help or assistance.  If that <Col N="2207" /> were to happen it would be flying in the face of everything for which the medical profession stands.  I do not believe it will happen, but what I am afraid will happen is that there are people out there &mdash; the poor, the old and the sick &mdash; who will be reluctant to call a doctor.  These people are proud and independent and would be extremely reluctant to, as they would see it, throw themselves on anybody's charity. That is what will happen, as happened when one of the Minister's predecessors introduced charges for outpatient visits, when the elderly in particular simply stayed away and suffered at home.  The statistics will not be visible but the hardship will be real.</P>
    <P>We are now coming into the time of year when elderly people in particular are at their most vulnerable.  Some years ago this Government took a policy decision, euphemistically described at the time &mdash; I thought it was a good line &mdash; as the shortening of the heating season, as if a Government by decree could decide that they could shorten the period of time when the weather was cold.  Of course, in reality that decision simply meant that the number of weeks every year when free fuel would be available to pensioners would be dramatically reduced.  Already this year we have seen the coldest start to a winter for many years.  I dread to think what will happen to hundreds of people who feel they cannot call out their doctor as the winter progressively worsens.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told the Dáil, in answers to questions I put to him on 21 October, that he will make alternative arrangements to ensure that medical card patients continue to receive general practitioner services even if the dispute goes ahead.  The Minister must know that the answer he gave is simply fooling the people since the health services are already staggering under the weight of the financial debt I outlined last evening and the cutbacks imposed by himself and his predecessors.  It is inconceivable that any effective alternative arrangements could be put in place on the timescale available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2208" /> When this Minister has left office it may well be that the only thing for which he will be remembered will be the glossy charter of rights for hospital patients he produced.  I predict that will turn out to be seen as the public relations stunt of the year, as meaningless as any of the other Government policies simply because it was unresourced in any way. That charter is the only place one can read something about Ireland's health services, but one does not see the reality of patients on trolleys, beds in corridors or nurses and paramedical staff being laid off.  That is the reality of Ireland's health service today.  The crisis facing the general medical service system can only add to the sense of injustice surrounding the operation of our health services in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke last night about the high cost of high-tech medicine.  I share his view that there is probably no developed country in the world which can afford an open-ended budget for health expenditure.  It is a system that can absorb all the money that can be made available to it.  It affects even the very rich countries.  We have seen America fight a presidential election with the quality of health cover and health insurance as a major issue for both main presidential candidates.  Therefore, it is clear that every country is faced with a challenge and a crisis in relation to proper, adequate and comprehensive medical cover for all its citizens.  Surely in the light of that fact the general medical service, which is the front line service, should have priority.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on the GMS as a percentage of all health expenditure was outlined in detail last night.  It is clear that if we properly resourced primary front line care, which is the GMS, there would not be the need for many of the more expensive hospital based procedures that are currently embarked upon.  It is false economy for the Minister not to recognise that reality.  It was also a false economy for his predecessor to close down geriatric hospitals, county nursing homes and other small hospitals up and down the country which cared for geriatrics and people who were convalescent. <Col N="2209" /> What happens now when those elderly people become sick and simply require a couple of days rest as opposed to intensive medical care?  They enter acute hospitals where the cost of taking care of them is three or four times greater and force out people who need more acute care.  That is a false economy, a wrong policy.  I hope the Minister will recognise that and set about rectifying the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke also last night about re-organising the GMS.  He referred to multi-centred group practices, co-operative centres, shared facilities and other matters.  I wish to state in relation to those suggestions that the patient must be the focus of any new arrangements and, in particular, any new arrangement that is put into place must have as its centre the right of the patient to select the doctor of his or her choice, and not the one that is convenient to any new re-organisation.  The Minister also spoke last night about indicative prescribing targets.  He emphasised that any such targets should be realistic but I am concerned that there would be a widening disparity, if that sort of objective was pursued, between the level and quality of service available to private as against public patients.  I would ask the Minister or the Minister of State when responding to the debate tonight to explain in greater detail exactly what is meant in the script by the sentence that the Minister was seeking a greater contribution from other sources.  What exactly are &ldquo;other sources&rdquo; in relation to the GMS?</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that this is probably the last time I will speak on a health issue in the 26th Dáil.  The current Minister is not very long in office.  He came to office amid great expectations from all sides of the House and, indeed, from the broader public.  Sadly, he has neither halted nor reversed the damaging health policies of his Fianna Fáil predecessors.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin has been critical of the Minister but he has not taken into account his own situation and that of his party while in Government. If this is my last occasion to address this House, it is important that I put on record the work of this Government and of the previous Fianna Fáil Government. All of the Fianna Fáil Ministers helped to ensure that we now have a new hospital and a new paediatric unit in Wexford town.  When the Deputy criticises this Government and this Minister for Health, it must be put in the context that the Deputy and his party while in Government failed to provide those services for the people whom the Deputy and I will be canvassing next week.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the efforts being made by the Minister to bring the current GMS review discussions to a successful conclusion.  We are fortunate that the Minister has had many years experience in general practice and has, therefore, a unique insight into the operation of this service.  I know that the Minister has a particular interest in developing our primary care services and, in so doing, involving general practitioners to a much greater extent in primary health care delivery.  I could not agree more with the Minister in his view that there is too much emphasis on expensive, high-tech, hospital based medicine.  This is not to say that we should tolerate an inferior quality hospital service.  However, we need to keep a sense of proportion in our approach to the development of our health service to ensure that our primary care services, which are the first point of contact with the health services for most people, are adequately developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very fortunate in this country to have a high quality health service, including general practitioner services.  I support the Minister's view that there are certain structural flaws within general practice which, if overcome, would go a long way to solving the concerns of <Col N="2212" /> doctors.  The current review has paid considerable attention to this very important issue.</P>
    <P>Health care is a major issue and a major problem in most of the developed world.  Indeed, as Deputy Howlin said, it was one of the key elements in the recent US presidential election.  Why?  Because health care affects every individual and every family.  It affects working people and people who are out of work.  Health care affects the young, the middle aged and old, literally everyone from the cradle to the grave.  Good health is a marvellous thing that one does not appreciate when one has it.  Increasingly, we become more aware that health is an asset.  We have to invest in it as individuals and as a nation.  We must do this in a way that makes the most of our assets.  One of our best assets is local, family based health care.  Other countries envy Ireland's GP service.  If one is not feeling well, a doctor that you know and who knows you, is available at affordable cost or at no cost at all.  Our GPs are, quite literally, family doctors.  They provide a service when one of the family is sick, but they do much more than that. Our family doctors provide health education, helping people to change the kind of lifestyle that leads to ill health, and they provide counselling.</P>
    <P>If one looks at problems such as domestic violence against women or the effect of alcoholism on a family, in the majority of cases the crucial intervention which helps the victims cope is the intervention of the family doctor.  In addition, it is often the family doctor who helps people to come to terms with the unplanned challenges of life, perhaps an unplanned pregnancy or the hurt of redundancy. General practitioners often provide a thoughtful, sensitive and non-judgmental resource to help people sort out such challenges.  Our GPs are of pivotal importance to our overall health.  We must continue to acknowledge their importance.  At a time when so-called professionals are downing tools and walking away from their responsibilities because of perceived dents in their honour, it is important to recognise the <Col N="2213" /> real heroes of this country who include the men and women who look after our health.  Sometimes we forget that or are misled so that we begin to think that machines are the heroes &mdash; the CAT scans and the high-tech gadgets.  We should be wary of that.</P>
    <P>Our health services should not revolve around big institutions, computerised machines or magic bullets.  Our health services should set out to empower the patient.  Sometimes we start with the money that is available, with the systems and technology or with the expertise, but not with the patient.  Our GPs are the caring face of an otherwise faceless uncaring and at times inhuman system. Efficiency and sophistication can sometimes be delivered in a way that diminishes the individual.  In the search for cures we can often lose sight of the importance of caring.  Tonight, I have a great sense of freedom in saying this.  It comes from the fact that tonight we are seeing the end of the Coalition.  That is relevant because I have been afraid over the last while that Fianna Fáil were getting sucked into a hard right wing way of thinking that is the Progressive Democrats way of thinking.  The Progressive Democrats way of thinking is all about lowering income tax.  It is a harsh yuppy self-satisfied way of thinking.</P>

      <P>Even though the Minister <Col N="2214" /> took three minutes of my time I sincerely compliment him on his efforts to resolve the GMS dispute.  I would like to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Callely.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes said that a teacher would not be a suitable Minister for Education or a solicitor a suitable Minister for Justice but the Minister for Health because he is a medical doctor who knows the health services inside out, particularly the GMS, has been doing a very good job in the negotiations so far.  I was glad that when speaking last night the Minister mentioned that the patient should always be the primary concern.</P>
      <P>In rural Ireland the capitation system which was introduced has been by and large successful.  Family doctors would like to see an increase in capitation.  GPs in rural Ireland and their patients have told me that for a full year's treatment, irrespective of the number of visits the doctor makes, the doctor is paid £45 per patient and he is expected to fully equip his surgery and provide secretarial services on that.  The doctors say that they receive about £21 per annum per patient after tax.  Capitation and taxation have been discussed in these negotiations. Independent surveys suggest that GPs should be paid £92 per patient annually. There should be more investment in the GMS.  If there was we could provide a wider range of services and facilities for the GPs leading to shorter queues in hospital casualty departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had an increase in capitation with the benefits about which the Minister spoke we would have a very good service. The improved benefits the Minister mentioned were in relation to the 1989 contract under which a superannuation scheme was introduced with a State contribution of 10 per cent as well as payments for out of hours consultation and visits, a contribution towards the cost of employing practice nurses and secretaries and specific payments for a range of special services such as the ECGs and the nebuliser treatment.  There would also be a contribution towards the cost of employing locums for doctors on annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave or study <Col N="2215" /> leave, a doubling of the rural practice allowance to over £5,000 per annum, payment of a fee for a second medical opinion, payment for out of hours special services within groups of partnerships on a rota arrangement and the introduction of earlier retirement arrangements.  I understand that almost all doctors providing GMS services opted for this new style of contract on the basis that it would be reviewed after one year and again in March 1992.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and Deputy Howlin referred to the question of group practices. I was glad that the Minister spoke about setting up a central medical centre which will be equipped to provide facilities for all members of the group.  I was amazed recently to find that doctors have to incur a great deal of expense in renting health centres from the health boards. One doctor told me that he was paying £3,000 a year rent to the health board for a health centre.  This rent had trebled over two years.  The idea of a group practice facility, putting the patient at the centre of the practice would be a worthwhile move.  I hope the Minister will follow up on that.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting features of the 1989 contract is that it provides for two reviews, the first after one year and the second after three years.  The first review was carried out in late 1990 under the chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan, former chairman of the Labour Court, and its findings were published in February 1991.  The recommendations which covered both the payment and service issues were implemented in 1992 at an additional cost of £4 million.  The second review began early this year under Professor Tom Murphy's chairmanship and it has involved an extensive and detailed examination of the widest possible range of issues of interest to general practitioners as well as to health services management.  It would be a great pity if that process were not allowed to continue as it appears to offer the possibility of breaking new ground in the organisation and management of general practice.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few comments <Col N="2216" /> on the statement made last night by Deputy Howlin.  The Deputy suggested that we were nearing a stage at which general practice services may be available only to those who can afford them.  I think I heard the Deputy right in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also suggested that the gap between the quality of private and public general practitioner services was widening.  Statements of that kind are not helpful.  They serve only to create unnecessary fear and anxiety in the most vulnerable sections of the population who are dependent on the general medical services.</P>
      <P>Ireland has an excellent general medical service that provides the fullest range of care for medical card holders on the same basis as for private patients.  The general medical service represents very good value for taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>I hope the discussions in the House last night and tonight will lead to a better health service.  The Minister is certainly approaching the matter in the right way. I completely disagree with Deputy Howlin in his statement that the Minister has failed in his role as Minister.  The Minister is doing an excellent job, and I make that statement also as a member of a health board.  The Minister has been very forthcoming in his meetings with health boards, particularly the Western Health Board, of which I am a member.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the IMO to withdraw their threatened resignations and to continue the negotiating process within the review. In that way it may be possible to resolve present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just because Deputy Owen placed a Private Members' motion before the House that I rise to express my concern.  I have previously communicated the concern of patients in Dublin North Central.  I have before me a three-page letter from the Minister for Health dated 13 October which is in response to the letter I sent him.  I wish <Col N="2217" /> to begin by quoting a couple of lines from it:</P>
      <P>I fully recognise the major role played by general practitioners in the overall provision of health care and I have been anxious in the review to identify areas where their contribution could be enhanced in a cost-effective way. </P>
      <P>The general medical services scheme is very highly regarded by patients.  It is therefore most unfortunate that doctors are threatening to withdraw from the scheme, particularly while discussions reviewing their contract are taking place. The Minister's proposal, which were outlined in the House last night, represent a major step forward in the resolution of the fundamental issues that need to be examined in a review of general practice. The Minister has accepted the need for investment in the capital development of general practice in order to bring about the organisational changes required.  For example, he proposes to provide incentives for the development of more group practices and for a better cross-cover between existing practices.  That initiative will provide greater continuity of care and a more comprehensive range of services by general practitioners.  Such improvements will be important factors in implementing the policy of refocusing health care delivery on primary care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing the question of investment in general practice we need to examine expenditure trends in the GMS scheme in recent years.  Last night reference was made to the need for the Minister to do something about the price of drugs.  Before being elected to this House I had personal experience in the pharmaceutical industry and in the sale and marketing of drugs.  I know of the concern about drug costs and of the public perception of the pharmaceutical industry.  It is important to recognise that the Minister indicated in his contribution that drug prices have been stabilised in the past two years.  That results from a pricing agreement between the pharmaceutical industry, FICI, and the Department of Health.  That agreement <Col N="2218" /> has served the State well, outside of all the other benefits of the pharmaceutical industry in terms of employment and so on.</P>
    <P>The problem with expenditure on drugs in the GMS scheme is not caused only by the pricing structure but also by the larger volumes and the more expensive drugs being prescribed.  Notwithstanding the price stability, there has been a constant increase of 11 per cent in GMS drug expenditure in past years. By the end of this year the GMS drug bill is expected to be more than £130 million. It is obvious that the continuing increase in GMS drugs expenditure uses up resources that could be more effectively utilised in meeting other health services needs, including the development of general practice.</P>
    <P>The main point I wish to make is that meeting doctors' demands for State investment in general practice is to a large extent in the hands of the medical profession themselves and that it is in their own interests that workable arrangements are agreed as part of the current review process for implementing safe and cost-effective prescribing.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the IMO accepted some time ago that the level of prescribing in the scheme could be reduced without any adverse effect on the quality of patient care.  I welcome the Minister's proposal for the introduction of realistic drug targets for individual general practitioners and the fact that a proportion of any savings generated from the operation of those targets will be applied towards general practice development.  Such an approach, based on consultation and incentives, has a much better chance of success than other more drastic measures.  The administration of those targets by local general practice development units will greatly improve the chances of success.</P>
    <P>In a discussion on the question of prescribing costs one would have to accept that there are factors that influence prescribing over which individual doctors have limited control.  Many doctors are faced with pressure from patients to prescribe, pressure resulting from receiving <Col N="2219" /> hospital prescriptions and pressure resulting from public education programmes, because of which patients now demand a drug of their own choosing.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a valid point in his contribution last night that if general practice was reorganised along the lines set out in the proposal that has been put before the review it would be possible to reallocate resources for the development of this service.  That is particularly true in the case of expenditure on drugs and medicines in the GMS.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that both management and general practitioners grasp this nettle once and for all and work out a satisfactory way of bringing the problems of prescribing under control.  I wish to pay tribute to family doctors in the GMS.  We all know that when a doctor operating within the GMS is telephoned it may not be the doctor who will answer but his wife or his children.</P>

      <P>It is indeed truly apt, right, fitting and significant that the only medical practitioner on the Opposition benches is addressing the House in the last Private Members' Business in the lifetime of this Dáil.  What Members will hear is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth concerning the <Col N="2220" /> primary care medicine here; not the truth, the whole truth and anything but the truth that this country have been hearing in the last two weeks from the Government parties.  Shame on them; their day has now thankfully finally come. Earlier this year the Taoiseach appointed one of his cronies to be chief executive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatLee" hpid="Dr. Lee Dr. Lee">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that word.  The Taoiseach appointed one of his friends to be chief executive of the VHI and in a glorious publicity stunt he refused any salary but what the public does not know is that the VHI had to hire a top of the range Mercedes and a chauffeur to drive his car.  In addition, this close friend of the Taoiseach has the personal use of all gold credit cards.</P>
      <P>The Minister, and he alone, is entirely responsible for the crisis with the general practitioners.  As the old saw states, &ldquo;doctors differ and patients die&rdquo;.  In fact, most patients do not die because most suffer from non-fatal illnesses which are of themselves limiting in nature. Although death must come to us all, it is far from clear what effect either medical care or health services have on longevity and life expectation; not least when they occupy the post of the Minister for Health in an Irish Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a reputation of talking before he thinks &mdash; an unfortunate practice for one in charge of such a sensitive area as the health services.  His careless and callous remarks on the efficacy of bypass surgery gave rise to public anxiety among the families of those patients who were awaiting for and have had bypass surgery.  His performance is shaped by that element of medical education which seeks to forge change in society which creates the high profile campaigners in pursuit of Dr. O'Connell.  His track record in office to date is largely one of impetuous commitment and erratic delivery on promises made.  Bluff and bluster, sanctimonious sham, pious hypocrisy are his hallmarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2221" /> Earlier this year I was present, as were 300 other general practitioners, in Jury's Hotel at a crisis meeting, which the Minister addressed, of doctors threatening to resign from the General Medical Service. In front of the television cameras and concerned doctors he said he would award the 17.5 per cent increase to general practitioners to be effective from March 1992 and paid in December 1992. He said that if the doctors agreed to set up an independent review committee, to be chaired by his nominee, Professor Tom Murphy, a card-carrying member of his party, this award would be independent of any finding of the review committee. Those were his exact words.</P>
    <P>Approximately one month later, in the time honoured manner of the dirty tricks department of the Department of Health, the Minister said this award would not be paid unless the GMS review was successfully completed.  This GMS review is a completely independent issue and has nothing to do with the 17.5 per cent award.</P>
    <P>The Minister broke his word given to his peers, given to his equals, people whom he trained and worked with and who trusted him.  He, and nobody else, is totally responsible for the current situation. Is he now going to verbally assault, intimidate and threaten me outside this Chamber as he did before on the Temple Street Hospital debate?</P>
    <P>Health cuts are like a death in the family &mdash; until they hit you you know nothing about them and nowhere is this more true than in the present primary care health service which the Minister boasts about.  The truth is that general practitioners, family doctors, are expected to care for a patient's entire medical needs for £45 per year.  General practitioners' costs are 55 per cent of their gross take.</P>
    <P>If one has to call out a plumber, a vacuum repairer or a washing machine service man or if his drains are blocked over the weekend nobody will not show up unless one pays £50 up front.  The contrast is simple.  The Department pay highly trained expert general practitioners to look after the most precious <Col N="2222" /> of all concepts, life, £45 gross for the year.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I submitted a written Dáil Question to the Department concerning occupational therapy facilities for the city of Dublin.  The Minister glibly replied to my question that the information was not readily available.  One of those questions asked the number of patients on the waiting list to be assessed for occupational therapy.  The answer is, 500.  There is a one year assessment delay on whether a patient requires a handrail on stairs, a bath seat in a shower and special door knobs and tap knobs if a person has arthritis.  It takes a further year for this assessment to be implemented &mdash; two years in total which at that stage of one's life is equivalent to five years.  There are two occupational therapists, people who have expert knowledge in assessing the needs in the care of the elderly, job-sharing in community care area.  That means there is only one occupational therapist for assessing and implementing the needs of 15,000 elderly people.</P>
    <P>In addition we now have a new illness in the Irish medical lexicon specific only to Dublin and it is called the Fianna Fáil-PD toenail.  It needs to be clipped or manicured only three times per year.  The Minister has introduced cutbacks even in the chiropody service.  Medical card patients over 65 years are now entitled to three treatments per year.  They must pay handsomely for any further treatments. Many of these people have poor sight by virtue of their age.  Many are obese and suffer from arthritis and they are unable to clip their toenails never mind see them.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of people require domiciliary physiotherapy services in Dublin, for example people with post-operative hip replacements, people with extensive osteo-arthritis of the feet, knees, hips, hands or shoulders.  I repeat, we have no community physiotherapist in community care area 7 in Dublin to do domiciliary visits.  We general practitioners have no access to primary referral nutritionists for treatment of our patients.  There must be something wrong.  The recent emphasis of transferring <Col N="2223" /> care from the hospital sector to primary care without the appropriate funding has finally forced the overstretched general practitioners to withdraw from the General Medical Service contract.</P>
    <P>When will the Department awaken to the fact that they get better value per pound from the general practitioner service than from any other branch of the health services?  It is essential that a national council for general practitioners, preferably a statutory body, be set up in order that the needs of general practice in the future in Ireland are properly assessed and adequately resourced.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I commend Deputy Owen for putting down this motion.  It is very important on what is perhaps the last night of regular business for the 27th Dáil that we should discuss the service given to 1.2 million medical cardholders.</P>
      <P>People of my generation will recall the structured medical service which existed during the fifties, usually a doctor based in a dispensary serving a defined geographical area.  This rural dispensary usually duplicated as the local pharmacy. This building was provided, owned and maintained by the local authority of the day.  Usually a nurse was available in the locality and a caretaker repaired and maintained the building.  Over the years the State failed to maintain this service and allowed these dispensaries to fall into disrepair; in many cases it disposed of them altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1970 the choice of doctor scheme was introduced to replace the dispensary system.  Under this scheme patients could attend a general practitioner of their choice.  This involved an important shift in responsibility for providing and maintaining premises from the local authority to the local practitioner.  Under this scheme the GP was to receive a composite all-in-one fee described as a fee per item.  As this scheme was developed over the years GPs were subsequently accused of abusing it.  For example, allegations <Col N="2224" /> were made that they were overprescribing drugs, encouraging patients to make unnecessary calls to surgeries and making many unnecessary housecalls themselves.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in 1989 the now infamous new contract was introduced.  This gave GPs a fixed fee per patient, ranging from £15 per annum for a child up to 15 years to £74 per annum for an old age pensioner residing ten miles from the doctor's surgery. This contract dictates, among other things, that doctors work for 365 days a year, and for 98 hours per week.  During the same years the hospital service, which is complementary to the medical service provided by general practitioners, has developed at a magnificent rate and we can now rightly boast of having a very high standard of hospital care.  However, there are long waiting lists for some procedures. These waiting lists are topics for another debate; I will not go into them tonight.</P>
    <P>GPs cannot now afford to invest in the infrastructure or equipment needed to provide an adequate service.  Young highly qualified and highly motivated GPs, full of new ideas and armed with new techniques and procedures, are cash starved and cannot afford to provide certain procedures which they are qualified to supply.  Some who endeavour to provide certain procedures and invest in the necessary technology and equipment quickly run into debt and have to abandon their efforts.  This results in the stunting of the potential of our medical service which, as I have already said, they are well qualified to supply.</P>
    <P>This remarkable situation provides an incentive to GPs not to invest in infrastructure or new technology.  As a result some of our surgeries and medical centres are, I respectfully suggest, of a third world standard &mdash; hard benches in cold draughty waiting rooms, no wash-hand basins or toilets, etc.  I understand that half of the GPs in Dublin and 40 per cent of doctors in rural areas have no secretarial back-up.  One and a half million Irish citizens avail of this service. They are mainly the elderly, sick and <Col N="2225" /> young; in other words, the vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister what these people will do after 8 December?  They cannot afford to pay for their treatment; otherwise they would not have a medical card in the first place.  Are they to be forced to beg for free treatment from their GP, the person who has treated them so loyally and conscientiously over the years? Are they to risk going without their repeated prescriptions and necessary regular check-ups and not call out a doctor when they are sick during the night?  Are they to clog up the outpatients' departments of general hospitals still further? Of course, we have to remember that at the same time the Department are telling GPs they are sending too many patients to hospital, that they are responsible for much of the overcrowding in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>What about the anxiety of these medical cardholders who are faced with the prospect of receiving no medical treatment after 8 December.  What assurance can I give to medical cardholders in County Westmeath that the Minister will live up to his responsibility and provide a general practitioner service for them after that date?  Will the Minister allow the strike to go ahead?  He seems to be standing idly by at present.  Will he continue to allow the general practitioner service to decline?  Will he continue to preside over a service which, because of a lack of capital funding for recruitment and equipment, is going to overload the hospital service?</P>
    <P>Similar public services, for example, the Garda, FÁS, employment exchanges, etc., have been improved over the years.  Yet nothing has been done for general practitioners.  We are returning to the two-tier system which existed during the fifties, a system starved of cash which backs the basic facilities to enable GPs to carry out basic procedures in local surgeries and help to reduce the present overcrowding of the hospital service. I ask the Minister if it is reasonable to expect a GP to treat a medical card patient for one year at a net average gain to him of £11?  I understand that GPs <Col N="2226" /> claim this is the amount they receive for this service.  Is this the value of the service provided by GPs?  Is it not a derisory sum for the quality of the service which they so loyally provide?  I call for support for this motion?</P>

      <P>At the outset I urge the Minister, together with the IMO, to immediately negotiate a settlement to this dispute before a strike takes place. In view of the events of the past week, I wonder how much time the Minister has been able to devote to thinking about how this problem can be solved in the near future.  I wonder if he had to devote some time over the past week trying to find a cure for the Taoiseach's mania at the Beef Tribunal which led to the destruction of the Government?  I do not know how one could describe the Taoiseach's mania.  Perhaps it could be described as &ldquo;coalitionitis&rdquo;, or &ldquo;anti-Progressive Democrats hysteria&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Minister, who is a doctor, has been able to find a cure for this ailment? If he has found a cure he is too late; the cure should have been found earlier in the week.  There is no doubt that the major problems facing us at present are not receiving the attention they deserve from Ministers or the Government who are looking at their neighbours and wondering where they will be in three weeks' time.  I am sure they are getting good indications that they will be relieved of their duties fairly soon.  I believe the public at large will make that decision when they get a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am aware, it is unprecedented for doctors providing this service to take this kind of action.  In general, doctors are a very caring group; that is the nature of their business.  My experience has been that doctors take their work very seriously.  The doctors in my constituency with whom I have <Col N="2227" /> discussed this issue feel they are being forced to take this action.  They are extremely worried about the effects it will have on their clients, medical cardholders, within the GMS.  It would be easy to think that doctors will pursue a policy of brinkmanship where they decide on 8 December not to go ahead with this action.  It would be very foolish to adopt that sort of attitude.  I hope the Minister does not think this is what will happen.  It would put the whole service into chaos and put at risk the lives and the health of many people.  The doctors are seriously aggrieved.  If they did not have very serious grievances they would not be contemplating such action. Doctors in my constituency are very concerned about what will happen and about the Government becoming involved in brinkmanship.  The effects of the proposed action would be enormous.  Many people will not go to the doctor because they will not have the cash.  This applies particularly to those trying to rear families, as well as many of the elderly.  They would be ashamed to ask for services for which they cannot pay.  Unless the problem is resolved, they will have to pay after 8 December.  This is a great worry for many people because they know they will not be able to get assistance unless the Minister takes his responsibilities seriously and enters into negotiations to resolve the matter in good time.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a meeting in Monaghan town called by the Hospital Retention Committee.  I was late arriving at the meeting but it transpired that two local Deputies had received a letter from the Minister during the past week.  The contents of the letter were to the effect that the services at Monaghan General Hospital would be maintained at the current level.  In a week such as this one would not expect people to believe the contents of such a letter.  That was exactly the reaction last night.  Who could believe anything emanating from this Government?  There is a huge credibility problem which was evident at that meeting in Monaghan.  Many supporters <Col N="2228" /> of the Government who attended the meeting cast doubt on the relevance of the letter and queried its dispatch to two local Deputies, particularly when we are facing into a general election.  The whole exercise was regarded as quite cynical.  I am asking the Minister to state that the letter was not a farce and that he intends in the future, in so far as he will be in control, that the services at Monaghan General Hospital will be maintained.  I would also ask him to state that Comhairle na nOspidéal do not have his authority to put a plan into operation which will remove services from Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am speaking for the people of north Monaghan in particular, the people of Monaghan town, Carrickroe, Emyvale, Glasslough, Scotstown and Tydavnet who tell me they are extremely worried that the facilities of Monaghan General Hospital will not be available to them in the near future.  Without that hospital they would have to travel long distances along very bad roads to Cavan or Drogheda.  Their lives would be put at risk if their health was in danger.  I am asking the Minister to state clearly his position with regard to Monaghan General Hospital and to do so tonight rather than during the week when he might send out another letter under pressure.  It is intended to run a hospital candidate because of the cynicism they feel regarding the Minister's actions.</P>
    <P>I will give the rest of my time to Deputy Browne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Confidence in one's GP is as important as the medicine he or she prescribes.  Anything that affects that confidence is to be avoided like the plague.  The Minister followed that line in his speech yesterday when he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, let me assure Deputies, at the outset, that while I am confident of a successful outcome to these discussions, in the event of this not happening the health boards will ensure that free general practitioner services and free drugs and medicines will continue <Col N="2229" /> to be available to persons covered by medical cards.</P>
    <P>I wish to consider the possible effects in Carlow.  All the GPs in Carlow are members of their organisation and they have all tendered their resignation from the GMS.  There is no county hospital in Carlow.  We have a district hospital which is looked after by the GPs and an excellent nursing staff.  The hospital services in Kilkenny are in such difficulty that patients are often accommodated in corridors. Our hospital services are quite inadequate.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister intend to look after medical card patients in Carlow when the GPs have withdrawn from the system and there is no major hospital in Carlow?  The prospects frighten patients. Elderly people are worried about who will look after them if they become ill. I do not see any solution for them in Carlow.</P>
    <P>The Minister concluded his speech last night as follows:</P>
    <P>Finally, I would again take the opportunity to allay any fears that might exist among medical card patients and to assure them that free general medical services will continue to be available to them after December.</P>
    <P>Who will provide the service if there are no doctors participating in the scheme? The farmer, the teacher and the general handyman can hardly step in.  There is an onus on the Minister to negotiate with the medical profession.  I accept that he is doing things his way.  He stated that his objective was to reach agreement with the IMO and that he was confident of having the goodwill of the doctors in reaching that objective.  I am quite sure he will have the goodwill of the doctors, who do not want to withdraw services from their patients.  There is a marvellous relationship between GPs and their patients.  One could not pay great enough tribute to general practitioners who without the use of X-rays and modern apparatus can diagnose what is wrong with a patient.  The Minister said he was planning <Col N="2230" /> to expand services provided by GPs, thereby saving hospital beds.  That is marvellous, provided that the money and the necessary facilities are provided.  Doctors cannot be expected to provide all those services and not be financially rewarded. I ask the Minister: who will take care of the patients when the doctors have gone?</P>

      <P>I shall explain the matter of time to the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to place on the record of this House my complete rejection of the assertion implicit in Deputy Owen's motion that my colleague, the Minister for Health, has been &ldquo;unwilling to enter into meaningful discussions&rdquo; with the representatives of the doctors involved in the provision of services in the GMS scheme. Nothing could be further from the truth. On assuming office as Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell identified as one of his highest priorities the enhancement of the role played by the general practitioner in the overall provision of health care and he undertook to work to restore the general practitioner to what he described as his righful place as a pivotal player in an integrated health delivery system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the general medical service which commenced earlier this year offered the ideal opportunity to give effect to these aspirations and, seizing that opportunity, the Minister tabled a <Col N="2231" /> blueprint for the future development of general practice at an early stage in the review discussions.  This document involved a complete root and branch examination of the current role of the general practitioner and identifies the current deficiencies in the system which mitigate against the general practitioner discharging the enlarged role envisaged for him by the Minister.  This blueprint goes on to outline radical proposals for structural change at local and national level.  It is indeed heartening to note that agreement has been reached in principle with the doctors' representatives on the broad policy content of this document.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware, from contact with the Tallaght-Clondalkin GPs in my own constituency, of the particular problems facing general practice in large suburban areas.  The inclusion in this document therefore of the proposed establishment of general practice development units at regional level, with a remit to develop services tailored to meet local needs in consultation with general practitioners on the ground, is a particularly welcome initiative and will benefit the patient.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the review process is ongoing.  I understand that there have been to date 11 plenary meetings, with another one scheduled for later this week, and over 25 subcommittee meetings covering the widest possible range of subjects identified by both sides as being of importance.  In the light of all of this, therefore, I think Deputies will agree that the Minister's approach to the review can scarcely be characterised as an &ldquo;unwillingness to enter into meaningful discussions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Owen's call for a recognition of the need for major investment in the scheme, it is worth reflecting for a few moments on the current levels of expenditure on general medical services.  The total cost of the GMS for 1991 was £176 million.  The cost for 1992 is expected to rise to almost £194 million.  The total amount of fees and allowances paid to the 1,600 doctors involved in 1991 was £56 million, or an average of £35,345 each.  This is before <Col N="2232" /> account is taken of the 17.5 per cent arbitration award already referred to by the Minister which would increase the average to £41,530.  Implementation of this award would cost £20 million in 1993 and would increase the average payment per doctor by £7,000 per year or £135 per week.</P>
    <P>While it is recognised, of course, that there is a need for a continuous programme of investment in the development of general practice, I think Deputies will agree that in the current financial climate these figures indicate that this Government's response to the needs of general practice cannot be faulted.</P>
    <P>In relation to the threatened withdrawal of services, it is regrettable that, despite the arbitrator's recommendation and the fact that the GMS review is currently underway, GPs have now decided to withdraw their services from the medical card population.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin inferred in his contribution that the Minister's organisation proposals did not take account of the patient.  The fact is that the proposals have been put forward for the purposes of providing a more comprehensive service for patients.  Deputy Howlin also asked if I would clarify what the Minister meant in his speech last night when he referred to a greater contribution being made by other sources <Col N="2233" /> towards the development of the public health services.  The position is that my colleague, the Minister for Health, is exploring a number of options in relation to this matter.  As these options have yet to be fully explored and finalised, it would be foolish to elaborate any further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lee referred to the question of access of GPs to other primary and secondary care services as being one of the important issues.  That is precisely what the Minister has put forward in his proposals to improve the situation in the current review.  I will conclude by strongly recommending the Minister's amendment to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Owen for allowing me some of her time to contribute to this debate and, as time is scarce, I have only a few salient points to put to the Minister.  I would first like to ask him a question.  Where does this crisis, involving 1.25 million patients dependent on medical cards for access to the services, leave the patients charter? That charter was hailed as the saviour for the health services but it has turned out to be a smokescreen behind which the Minister can hide.  It has no credibility whatever.  The last thing we need in the Department of Health is administration through public relations.  We need resources, commitment, tolerance and understanding.  As we are on the brink of a break-up of the Coalition Government, it is ironic that the coalition which should exist between the Minister for Health and the IMO is also teetering on the brink. That illustrates the lack of tolerance and understanding in the Minister for Health's comprehension of negotiation and consensus.  The only consensus that <Col N="2234" /> appears to emanate from the Government benches, not just from the Department of Health, is that people must accept their view or reject it.  We need serious negotiation on this issue, not public relations.  As I said, one-third of our population is dependent on medical cards and in my constituency that involves approximately 10,000 people.  I would advise the Minister that if he has any respect for his colleagues or indeed his colleague in my constituency, Deputy Kelly, he should make every effort to resolve this impasse sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>What will happen on 8 December when 10,000 patients queue up at the Gouldshill health office to have their prescriptions renewed?  There will be total chaos.  What will happen in regard to the anxiety which will exist between now and then when patients fear they will not have access to their GPs? People will become ill and there will be chaos on the doorsteps of our general hospitals.  The buck stops with the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the last Government under Deputy Haughey fell on a health issue and this Government, in the last debate in Private Members' Time will be defeated on a health issue.  Crass incompetence and public relations are all we have had from the Minister for Health. Community care has been the Cinderella of the health services for too long.  It does not come cheaply.  We have a two-tier system in our hospitals and it appears to be the Minister's intention to create a two-tier system in the area of general practice.  The Minister should not underestimate the resolve of the GPs on this issue.  They are as convinced of the righteousness of their cause as any pressure group I have ever seen and they should be heeded.  The bottom line is that patients will die if this issue is not resolved and the blame will rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start by thanking all my colleagues on the Fine Gael benches and my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on the Labour bench for their contributions to this debate.  We on the Opposition benches have listened and learned about the nature of the dispute now threatening the GMS.  I condemn the members on the Government benches who have clearly been receiving the same message but who have not listened to it and have not accepted it. Somehow or other the blindness and the deafness of this Government has led to the situation we are in now where we are facing an election.  In this eleventh hour of this Dáil they still cannot accept that there is a crisis looming on 8 December.</P>
      <P>I want to run through some points made by the Minister last night.  The Minister litters his speech with words like &ldquo;an atmosphere free from threat&rdquo;, &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo;, etc.  Where is the Minister's goodwill when he sits down to negotiate and review but does not negotiate, does not actually say to the doctors that there is anything on the table to implement any of the improvements he says are being agreed?  No resources have been committed. Therefore the doctors do not accept that the Minister is sitting down in good faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no attempt to allay the anxieties and fears of people about how the Government can deliver a health service if this threatened dispute goes ahead. Who will prescribe the ethical drugs if it cannot be the doctors who have withdrawn their services from the general medical service?  They will have to return the GMS prescription pads which it will no longer be legal for them to use if they are forced to go ahead with their action. Patients cannot be expected to go down to a health clinic.  Nurses, chiropodists and other health care service workers in those clinics will not be allowed to write the prescriptions for ethical drugs.  The Minister seems to have some magic formula to implement this scheme.  I do not <Col N="2236" /> know where he will get the doctors to implement the scheme, where he will get the personnel.  Perhaps he will tell us after this debate how he is going to do that.  I do not know; the doctors in the scheme do not know and the patients do not know.  I know they will expect their doctors not to turn them away in an emergency, and the doctors have said they will not, but who is going to write the prescriptions, who is going to pay for the prescriptions?  On all these issues there was not a single word from the Minister to allay the anxieties and the fears of patients who are of paramount concern in this debate.</P>
    <P>Only once did the Minister correctly refer to the 1989 agreement with doctors. It was not a contract.  That was one of the issues that caused a great deal of anger at the time.  The doctors did not get a contract; they got a new agreement.  The Minister, instead of calling it the 1989 contract might correct that and call it an agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied that the scheme that was brought in in 1989 was the be all and the end all of the health service, and there were certainly great improvements in it, but in outlining the improvements the Minister neglected to fill in the gaps. For example, he spoke about the payments for out of hours consultations. That sounds fine and people looking at that will say that it is fine that a doctor will be paid if he works outside the normal working day which for most people is from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 6 p.m.  However, the average working week of a general practitioner, as shown by a survey by the ICGP, is 89 hours a week.  They are paid for the normal working day which, for a doctor, has been assessed as being from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  There are no special payments for calls between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. and no special payments at the weekend.  There are special payments for calls between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.  Another thing that the Minister neglected to say, and which adds greatly to the burden of those calls, is that there are 17 questions to be filled in on any night-time call form. Not only that, but the doctor has to ask the sick person who has called him out <Col N="2237" />&mdash; if there is nobody else in the house &mdash; to sit up in their bed to sign that form. The mechanics, the complexities and the bureaucracy attached to some of this system absolutely befuddles the doctors at times and creates an antagonism to the whole scheme.</P>
    <P>There are other issues like the early retirement arrangements.  The Minister neglected to say that as doctors come towards retirement age they tend to let their lists get smaller and smaller and, of course, the payment at retirement is based on the size of the list when the doctor retires.</P>
    <P>The delays in paying for most of the services that are now eligible for payment are just unsustainable.  The Minister knows full well the manner in which the health boards are cutting back on their budgets because they have not received sufficient resources from central Government. They are holding back on payments. I am quite sure there is somebody in each health board area working out how long they can hold back on writing a cheque, making a payment, so it can go into the next year's budget.  However, there is somebody on the receiving end and I hope the Minister realises this. They have had to borrow and make commitments for that spending.  It is not good enough that the health boards are forced into holding back payments.  That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I want to make one thing quite clear. My information from the IMO and doctors involved in negotiations is that whereas it was agreed that the 17.5 per cent arbitration award was to be considered in the context of the review it was not dependent on the successful outcome of the review.  I hope the Minister will remember that.  If on 8 December the review is not completed successfully, he is still obliged to fulfil the commitment on the 17.5 per cent arbitration award.</P>
    <P>I want to move on to the question of prescriptions and the prescribing of expensive drugs.  I do not believe that the thrust of the Minister's efforts should necessarily be on the general practitioners' running of the general medical service.  The vast bulk of repeat prescriptions <Col N="2238" /> commence in hospitals.  The hospital doctors write the prescriptions and when a patient comes out of hospital with a prescription he or she goes straight to the GMS doctor, the prescription is transcribed onto a GMS pad and the prescription becomes the doctor's. However, it is the general practitioners who are blamed for the high cost of the drugs they are prescribing.  Perhaps the Minister could look towards the prescribing that is done in the hospitals and he might achieve his targets in reducing the cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the fact that the review is about the organisation and funding of general practice rather than simply payments to doctors.  I feel that is an underhand way of implying that that is why the doctors are in there, that they are in the review to up their payments. That is not why the doctors are in the review; they are in the review to improve the services of the GMS.  A recent survey shows that health care delivery is over-reliant on the hospital sector.  That is just one statistic.  Sixteen million consulatations take place through the GP service and only two million through the hospital service so we can see that we are getting tremendous value out of the GMS system and that is where the emphasis of investment should be.  The Minister spoke about increasing the scope and depth of general practitioners' contributions to primary care.  Where, in the name of God, can the doctor find more time out of 89 hours a week?</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;lack of epidemiology data relating to the disease process&rdquo; did not seem to worry the Minister when he put onto the shoulders of the doctors the responsibility for the HIV vaccinations.</P>
    <P>Let me finish now by impressing upon the Minister that unless he is prepared to recognise the reality and the genuineness of the doctors' case &mdash; and I found nothing in what the Minister said last night or in what the Minister of State said this evening to make me feel confident that they recognise the genuineness of the case &mdash; the dispute will go ahead and patients will suffer.  I agree with Deputy Creed that there may well be deaths because of <Col N="2239" /> fear and anxiety and people not going to the doctor on time.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to let the people know how they propose to solve this problem.  They should not present information in such a way that the impression is given that doctors are making absolute fortunes under the scheme.  Needless to say, to read that a doctor is in receipt of £41,530 leads to that impression.  It sounds like a great salary but it should be remembered that that is a gross figure; secretaries have to be paid, equipment, overheads and withholding tax payments must be provided for.  The impression is being given that somehow general practitioners are <Col N="2240" /> well off and living off the backs of the taxpayer but this is not true.</P>
    <P>I say loud and clear to the members of the Progresive Democrats Party who I am sure are sitting in an office in the vicinity of the House that I hope they will come into the House tonight to vote in favour of this Private Members' motion as their last act of this Dáil to show what they think of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening when I began my speech I referred to the introductory speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews.  I said I had no hesitation in congratulating him on the initiative he took in drawing national and international attention to the tragic events of Somalia, which was succeeded by the visit to that country of the President, Her Excellency Mary Robinson.  I also said it is outrageous and scandalous that the European Community is not represented by a permanent office in Mogadishu, where the office should be rather than in Nairobi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the few minutes available to me last evening I had begun to pay tribute to Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun.  I <Col N="2242" /> noted that the Minister was generous in his tributes to Ambassador Sahnoun and I join him in wishing the Ambassador's successor success in a most difficult project. I had the opportunity in Mogadishu of meeting Ambassador Sahnoun, an Algerian, who was uniquely qualified to make a contribution to bringing together the combatants who might, in turn, have generated peace in Somalia.  I am worried about the way in which those who wanted to save face by rejecting Ambassador Sahnoun's criticism were victorious in having him replaced and those who would have welcomed him continuing his efforts were defeated.</P>
    <P>As someone who travelled for over a week through Somalia, I can say that there are two urgent problems, one is bringing relief to people affected by famine but the other, more urgent problem is the reconstitution of civil society, which can be done perhaps through building on the pre-conflict structures of Somalia &mdash; the elders and the chiefs. Ambassador Sahnoun was working not <Col N="2243" /> only with the competing factions that support General Adid and Mr. Mahdi but also with the other representative forces within Somalia.  That opportunity has been lost by his replacement.</P>
    <P>It is the function of Irish foreign policy to establish a moral distinctiveness in our international relations.  In going to Africa, but very particularly in his speech at the United Nations which went beyond supporting the agenda for peace, but dealt with disarmament, the Minister for Foreign Affairs restored Irish foreign policy to the high moral ground.  Can there be a greater obscenity than the presence of so many armaments in a country dying as a result of famine?  This enables me to turn to the Bill before the House, which is simply a technical one, and puts into effect the will of the people, with which I might differ but which as a democrat I accept.</P>
    <P>How little preparation went into the Maastricht Treaty in relation to the curtailment of armaments.  Indeed, in the debate in Britain, there was a reference to a commissioner who made uncomfortable remarks which the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, rejected.  It should be noted that the same gentleman prepared notes on the future of the armaments industry in Europe.</P>
    <P>Europe will have to face up to the reality that it is not acceptable to claim the space of a regional authority or a regional authority purporting to reform the United Nations when it still goes on producing armaments far beyond its own defence needs and selling them at fairs in Africa to countries dying of starvation.</P>
    <P>There were many references in the Minister's speech to different dimensions of the European debate.  Deputy Flaherty referred to people who had argued against the Maastricht Treaty as being in the grip of some fear.  I am not in the grip of any fear, the Labour Party are noted for their international stance on various matters.  Indeed, after the foundation of the State, the leaders of the Labour Party were asked to go to the Berne Conference. We have published more international policy documents than any other <Col N="2244" /> party.  The difference between Deputy Flaherty's position and mine &mdash; as spokesperson for a long time on international policies for the Labour Party &mdash; is that I see international policy as being just that, international.  I also see that I have the right to claim on behalf of my party that our foreign policy should reflect a genuine international agenda and should not be made artificially narrow.  Not so long ago in this House the answer to every question dealing with foreign affairs started with the words: &ldquo;The view of the Twelve is ...&rdquo;.  Our people elect a Minister for Foreign Affairs to administer Irish foreign policy, and foreign policy will be made in this House.  Beyond the moral moment about which I spoke, political principles will be established.  That is a function of foreign policy, to be publicly accountable &mdash; the word &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; arises only in diplomatic practice &mdash; which is to administer what has been decided in this House where the Minister is accountable.  We are moving in that direction and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on some of the points raised in regard to the attitude of the European Community, foreign members and heads of state, towards the rejection by the Danish people in a referendum of the Maastricht Treaty.  In Europe there is a ceremonial and a ritual, a kind of public transcript, going on at the level of heads of states and Ministers and always there is a private transcript of national interest.  When these masks are taken off people talk as they think in real terms to each other privately and they come up with concepts like &ldquo;the democratic deficit&rdquo; when beneath them millions of Europeans want to be European but are excluded from the discourse of Europe.  They are the excluded voices, like the voices of slaves when slavery existed.  They are building up a range which is being reflected in the anti-European votes all over Europe.  They want Europe to speak about real things such as unemployment, recovery of economic prospects, peace and genuine international relations.</P>
    <P>In the area of unemployment there is <Col N="2245" /> a scandalous failure at Community level; the fear generated among the unemployed in France, Italy and elsewhere is being turned into anger and frustration against migrant groups.  It is not a question, as Mr. Delors said, that we must listen and change our language, there is a much bigger matter at stake, which is that Europe cannot be a monetary Europe.  I have a message to pass, through you, Sir, to the Minister and his successor &mdash; the Nordic countries seeking accession will ask and insist that unemployment is as important in the newly shaped Europe as monetary stability. They will ask what was not asked before, that the unemployment rate in the Community shall not be allowed to move beyond the Community average without certain mechanisms being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to many points in his speech and I support many of them. However, I warn him that the formal rhetoric will not be suficient.  Europe of the peoples wants action on unemployment, living standards, democratisation of the economy and solidarity. They are aching to detoxify themselves and Maastricht from the influence which Thatcher-Reaganism had on its essential economic principles.  Instead of solidarity being destroyed in Europe they want a new Europe of solidarity on issues like employment and income.  When the Scandinavian countries demand this in their accession Ireland should support them in any new arrangements which follow.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I want to say we are opposing this Bill.  Why will the Minister and Government not be more honest and openly admit that they support a federal Europe the foundations of which, according to Commissioner Bangemann, are laid in the provisions of this Bill?  Perhaps the Minister thinks he knows better and that Commissioner Bangemann, next in line to President Delors, does not know what he is talking about.  I would recommend that the Minister read today's editorial in the <i>Daily <Col N="2246" /> Telegraph</i> which demands that it is now time to tell the truth about Maastricht.</P>

      <P>There has been much play made of the word &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;. &ldquo;Subsidiarity&rdquo; will be nothing more than a smokescreen to attack environmental legislation.  We are all well aware of what the Minister and the majority in this House mean by &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;; it will just give them more room to manoeuvre out of any environmental restrictions put on this country by the European Community.</P>
      <P>The record of implementation of EC Directives regarding the environment here has been appalling and has resulted in the current circumstances in which some of our most sacred ecologically fragile areas, such as The Burren and Luggala, face extinction at the hands of the arrogant irresponsible Philistines in the Office of Public Works.  Furthermore, present legislation emanating from the European Community clearly shows that their commitment to the environment and its protection leaves much to be desired.  Indeed, their recent decision to give the go-ahead to the destruction of The Burren proves that point.  When the Minister refers to high environmental standards in the Community obviously he is measuring those standards against his, which I contend would not take much to better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty does absolutely nothing to protect our environment.  In fact, Greenpeace came out strongly against the ratification of Maastricht in both Ireland and Denmark &mdash; unprecedented for that environmental organisation <Col N="2247" />&mdash; as did Earthwatch, another extremely highly regarded environmental organisation.  Needless to say, the Green Party worked tirelessly throughout the campaign to inform people of the very serious downside of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The reason we propose voting against this Bill is that we do not accept the decision of the Irish people on Maastricht because it was a decision obtained by misrepresentation and lack of information. We contend that had sufficient information been supplied to the people as it was in Denmark, where they rejected the Treaty, or in France, where they almost rejected it, almost certainly we would have had a different result.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introductory remarks on this Bill the Minister said:</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are better informed than most of our partners.</P>
    <P>He pointed out how our Government went to considerable trouble to inform the Irish people about the content of the Maastricht Treaty and its implications, providing a short guide thereto and so on.  Now he has the gall to take credit for how he informed the Irish people, which is just incredible.  The fact of the matter is that the information was pure propaganda, lies, distortions, omissions and inaccuracies.  It is interesting to note that the two countries in which referenda were held, Denmark and France, the results were terribly close because their electorate were informed.  In addition I might add that excessive use of public funds was not allowed in those countries. The French Government were prevented from advertising for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on television, whereas here massive amounts were spent placing full page advertisements in all our national and provincial papers.  What many people are now asking is: had the Government been forced to provide balanced, impartial information instead of partisan information, would the people have voted as they did?  I do not blame the Minister for wanting to avoid any opportunity that would give the people a second chance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2248" /> Ireland always has called for nuclear disarmament at the United Nations.  But after we agree to a common approach we shall no longer be able to do so.  The Minister must be a complete fool if he believes that the other 11 member states, all members of NATO, will join us in calling for nuclear disarmament.  I predict it will be the other way round, that we will be toeing their line, no longer taking the principled stand adopted by people like the late Frank Aiken which gave us so much international respect among those seeking a peaceful nuclear-free world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to most of the Deputies for their interventions and very much appreciate their thoughtful, helpful comments.  I might refer particularly to the contribution of the spokesman of the Labour Party, Deputy Michael D. Higgins. It is fair to place on the record that Deputy Higgins went to Somalia at his own expense in a courageous, generous fashion to see at first hand the devastation that continues to be that tragic country. I salute and pay tribute to him in that regard.  I agree with him that it is unfortunate &mdash; probably one of the most serious weaknesses in the approach of the European Community to Somalia &mdash; that the EC have an office in Nairobi rather than in Mogadishu.  Like Deputy Michael D. Higgins, I have been pressing for such an office to be located in Somalia but without any appreciable success.  My belief is that if you must have diplomacy, you do not conduct it at long range but rather through a presence on the ground. It is unfortunate that that is not the position there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of Ambassador Sahnoun, I have already indicated by way of response to parliamentary questions my sadness at the departure of this marvellous man who, as Deputy Higgins said, has done so much in his efforts to bring together the two warring factions, led by General Adeed on the one hand and interim president, Almahdi, on the other.  I wish his succesor much success and hope he will achieve what we all wish, <Col N="2249" /> that is, peace and the reintroduction of a basic civil authority in the first instance and thereafter a basic infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Garland's contribution, all I can say is that he appears to be against everything and for nothing. He rejects the will of the Irish people. That is undemocratic by any standard.</P>
    <P>As I made clear in my introductory remarks, I intend to continue to bring a distinctive Irish contribution to the work of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Deputy O'Keeffe, whom I thank for a critical but fair analysis of the situation, made some interesting observations about the need to intensify the involvement of the Oireachtas in European Community affairs.  The view of the Government on the Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee is well known.  There is no need for me to repeat it now.  I already addressed that issue in the course of Question Time in the House this afternoon. As I stated then, I expect the position on that committee to be clarified shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned also the idea of a European Senate, which idea was first mooted in the preparatory discussions in the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.  However, it was rejected by the European Parliament on the basis, I believe, that the degree of European integration possible under the Maastricht Treaty did not justify the establishment of a European Senate.  Of course it may be that at a later stage in the process of integration, perhaps in 1996, there will be room for a European Senate.  However, I would sound a note of caution in that regard.  I believe that the intervention of a Senate could well dilute and as a consequence, weaken the operational effect of the Council of Ministers. Obviously the weakening of the Council of Ministers is not in Ireland's best interests.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe in the course of his helpful contribution mentioned the possible location of the European Central Bank in Ireland.  I share the Deputy's desire to ensure that Ireland's interest in locating European institutions here is pressed home.  The whole issue of the <Col N="2250" /> location of institutions remains an open one.  It will be debated at the forthcoming summit to be held in Edinburgh, when we shall pursue this matter vigorously.  I might add that the Taoiseach has already intervened at successive Summit meetings on the need to locate an additional European institution here.  He has been vigorous in his pursuit of this and I have no doubt he will continue his efforts.</P>
    <P>The question of ratification by the other member states was raised by Deputy O'Keeffe.  The Deputy is aware of the position in Denmark and in the United Kingdom.  I have already indicated that Luxembourg, Greece and Italy have completed their ratification procedures. In Belgium the Treaty is being discussed in Parliament at present and formal ratification is expected shortly.  In Germany parliamentary discussions are underway and ratification procedures should be concluded before long.  In Spain the Lower House voted in favour of the Treaties on 29 October and the Spanish Parliament will meet later in the month to give formal approval to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands parliamentary discussions are likely to continue until December and in Portugal the same situation pertains.  In France, as Deputy O'Keeffe is aware, a referendum was held on 20 September, a referendum which was narrowly passed but, as the history books will indicate, it was passed. The instruments of ratification are in the process of being lodged with the Italian Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe seems to feel that the Government is not being sufficiently committed to subsidiarity.  Let me repeat again that Ireland will contemplate no dilution of the powers of the Commission &mdash; a view shared by most member states.</P>
    <P>The area of human rights was very ably addressed by Deputy Michael Higgins and others.  On the question of human rights I would point out that the UN Charter lists the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as one of its purposes and principles.  In addition, a number of international human rights <Col N="2251" /> covenants under the auspices of the United Nations are designed to ensure respect for human rights and human rights situations.  These are considered in the Third Committee of the General Assembly and in the UN Commission on Human Rights.  All such human rights violations are addressed in detail and on a regular basis in the UN system.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of the situation in Yugoslavia.  The Deputy feels that the response of the Community has not been adequate.  The European Community and its member states have from the outset of the crisis made every effort to resolve the conflict and to bring about a settlement.  These efforts are being pursued through the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, jointly chaired by the EC and the UN, through the efforts on the ground of the EC monitor mission in which Ireland has been an active participant, and through the exercise of the collective weight of the Community to seek to persuade the parties, especially Serbia, to co-operate in bringing about a peaceful settlement.  I would very much appreciate that we would not put the total blame on Serbia; there are always two sides to every argument.  To suggest for one moment that Serbia is exclusively responsible for this particular obscenity, this ongoing tragedy, might be historically incorrect.</P>
    <P>The Community and its member states are also playing a unique part in the humanitarian relief efforts.  The human tragedy which continues to unfold in the former Yugoslavia with the onset of winter was a major issue for the European Council which met in Birmingham on 16 October.  The Council directed that the delivery of EC assistance, for which 213 million ECU is ready for immediate disbursement, should be accelerated. This is now under way.  This vital assistance includes foodstuffs, medicines, shelter facilities and trucks.  Individual member states are also providing further staff and resources to strengthen the capacity of the UN High Commission for <Col N="2252" /> Refugees to tackle the enormous problems afflicting the victims of this tragedy.</P>
    <P>Ireland is contributing to these efforts. In addition to the £100,000 given to UNHCR, £200,000 has already been allocated for humanitarian aid to the region. Ireland will also supply up to four logistical officers to assist the UNHCR and to strengthen the effectiveness of the humanitarian aid operation in the Yugoslav region.</P>
    <P>In regard to the criticisms made by Democratic Left, Deputy De Rossa seems to ignore the outcome of the referendum. The Irish people gave overwhelming support to the Treaty.  They were well informed and found to be so in a survey of knowledge of the Treaty by <i>The European</i> newspaper.  I must remind Deputy De Rossa that the motion which will be before us later this evening is but one more step in the process of ratification.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa criticised the degree of democratic consultation under the heading of foreign policy, justice and home affairs issues.  First, let me say that the Government in their actions in these areas are directly responsible to this House.  Second, the European Parliament's powers to supervise those areas are increased &mdash; it has no rights in Title VI matters at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards Western European Union, we are not and will not be members of that organisation so its committees are not a matter of concern to us. The civil service members of Community Committees are responsible to me as Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will continue to control the position which is taken on behalf of the Government at such meetings.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned the Delors proposals on the Structural Funds. These proposals are still being debated in the Council and I would continue to be optimistic unlike the Deputy who brings an element of pessimism into the equation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the use of the words &ldquo;begging bowl&rdquo;, they are a throw-away piece of rhetoric which really do not apply. Ireland at no stage has gone cap-in-hand <Col N="2253" /> to anybody.  We are equal partners within the European Community and we will continue to play our role as such.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary <Col N="2254" /> for the Chair to do so but I shall oblige the Deputy.  First, the amendment which the Deputy tabled seeks to make the commencement by ministerial order of the Bill contingent on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by Denmark. Further, the proposal is outside the scope of this Bill as read a Second Time as it draws in the extraneous matter of ratification of the Treaty by another state. Consequently, it is out of order.</P>

      <P>I will speak on the subject of when this proposed legislation should come into force.  Since the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty by Denmark the Green Party have consistently maintained that the Maastricht Treaty does not exist.  I would draw the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to a question which I put down in the Dáil in June last year in reply to which he stated quite clearly that in the event of Denmark or any other state rejecting the Maastricht Treaty, it would not come into effect for any state.  Nothing could be clearer.  In the next paragraph there were ifs and buts and talk about political reality, but the reality is that that sentence stood on its own.  It is something we have tried to hammer home again and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty as such has ceased to exist.  We have had this charade of a referendum that does not mean anything, which entailed an immense amount of public time and money.  It has been a complete waste of time. Furthermore, it is a negation of democracy to try to ride roughshod over the wishes of the people of Denmark who have clearly stated that they do not accept the Maastricht Treaty.  It is very undemocratic and wrong of us not to accept at this stage that Denmark has rejected the Treaty and that although we may think they were wrong in doing so, that is their affair.  They have decided to reject the <Col N="2255" /> Treaty and therefore the Treaty is at an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the slight delay in arriving in the Chamber.  I am getting into practice for next week.  Perhaps this shows that I need a lot of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, affording me the opportunity of raising this important issue tonight in what will <Col N="2256" /> be probably one of the final Adjournment debates in the 26th Dáil.</P>
    <P>Rogerstown Estuary is a very small estuary near Donabate in north County Dublin.  It is internationally recognised as one of the most important east coast sites and is vital for wintering wildfowl and waders and birds on passage.  Indeed, birds come to the estuary from the Antarctic.</P>
    <P>The estuary is divided into an inner and an outer section by a railway viaduct. The outer portion of the estuary is designated by the Wildlife Service as both a national nature reserve and a Ramsar site.  These protective designations are compromised by the operation of the existing Balleally Tiphead by Dublin County Council in the inner estuary.  The tiphead, which covers an area of 100 acres, has been in operation since 1971 in what could be classified as an environmentally sensitive area of scientific importance.</P>
    <P>On 15 August last Dublin County Council made an application to the Department of the Marine to reclaim an additional 52.5 acres further out into this important wetland area, the inner estuary, for tipping purposes.  That disastrous proposal, which is in conflict with the draft development plan of Dublin County Council, is totally unacceptable to the people of north County Dublin and must be rejected by the Minister and his officials.  Efforts made by me and my colleagues on Dublin County Council to have this matter debated in the council have been unsuccesful.</P>
    <P>Recent counts undertaken by the Wildlife Service have shown that wildlife depend on both the outer and the inner estuaries for feeding.  When the birds migrate they go first to the outer estuary and when the food there is used up they go to the inner estuary.  That is why we say that the estuary should be so designated.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wildbird Conservancy have been concerned for several years about the operation of the Balleally Tiphead at the estuary.  Complaints have been made to the EC in that regard and I understand <Col N="2257" /> that discussions are taking place with the EC and the Government.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the needs of Dublin County Council to provide landfill sites &mdash; and I acknowledge those needs &mdash; it is completely unacceptable to allow the proposal to go through in its present form.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have a reply from the Minister to the effect that he gave a commitment that all interested parties would be given an opportunity to express their views on this matter.  This is too vague.  I would ask the Minister and particularly his officials to give a commitment that there will be a public hearing.  Hopefully he will say to the council: &ldquo;This it totally unacceptable, find another solution, because at the end of the day we cannot afford to lose the Rogerstown Estuary&rdquo;. I hope the Minister will acknowledge this need, given the efforts being made by the various groups.</P>

      <P>Rogerstown Estuary has been designated a special protection area for birds under the EC Birds Directive (Article 4 of Council Directive No. 79/409 EEC).  It is also included in the list of Wetlands of International Importance, established under the terms of the Ramsar Convention. The area has also been a statutory wildfowl sanctuary, no shooting area, for over 17 years.  In 1988 part of Rogerstown Estuary was established as a National Nature Reserve under Statutory Instrument No. 71 of 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tiphead operated by the local authority, Dublin County Council, is located on the northern side of the inner estuary. This site is outside the special protection area and the use of the site as a tiphead predates the special protection designation. The county council received licences from the Department of the Marine to reclaim a specific area in the inner estuary and no material has been disposed of outside of the limits set by the Department.  Waste disposed of in the landfill site comprises inert material and mixed domestic refuse.  Disposal of toxic and dangerous waste as covered by <Col N="2258" /> EC Directive 78/319 is prohibited at the site.  Last month the county council notified the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, that they were applying to the Department of the Marine, for a licence to reclaim a further 52.5 acres of foreshore adjoining the existing tiphead.  The Department of the Marine have asked the county council to submit detailed environmental survey reports on the proposal, including the present ecological status of the estuary and the likely effects on the ecosystem of the proposed extension to the existing tiphead.  Copies of these reports are being made available to the Office of Public Works to enable them to assess what implications the proposed development will have on the conservation status of the estuary.  The Department of the Marine have been advised that the Office of Public Works will be submitting their observations on the proposal and they have agreed to take those observations into account before making a decision on the county council's application.</P>
    <P>I have had representations from our colleagues on this matter.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible to comment on the proposal until all the reports have been received by the Office of Public Works and studied carefully by the relevant professional staff.  I can assure the House that any inadequacies found in the reports or any unacceptable threats to the conservation of this important natural heritage site which may be highlighted therein will be brought to the attention of the Department of the Marine.  I trust that this puts the matter in context for the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Enda Kenny gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the question of a regional technical college being provided for Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank you for allowing me the opportunity to raise this <Col N="2259" /> matter on the second last day of the 26th Dáil.  I regret very much that the Minister for Education, Deputy S. Brennan, is not here to answer this charge.  The question of an regional technical college facility for Castlebar has been ongoing for a number of years.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Jim Higgins, the Fine Gael spokesman on education.  In 1979, when in opposition, Deputy Garret FitzGerald recommended that an regional technical college be established in Castlebar.  In 1985 the then Minister for Education, Deputy Gemma Hussey, authorised such an establishment. Work proceeded to the extent that a curriculum was agreed, a site was acquired and financial sanction was written into the 1987 budget for it.  Subsequent to the change of Government, Fianna Fáil have done nothing about this project.</P>
      <P>I charge the Fianna Fáil led Government of being guilty of gross educational neglect in respect of this project for Castlebar and County Mayo.  I want to publicly issue a challenge on the floor of this House, as I have done outside the House, to both of my Dáil colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister for Education, Deputy S. Brennan, to state where the Government stand in regard to this project.  Deputations of good and decent people from County Mayo were brought to Dublin. They were taken on a wild goose chase where faint hopes were held out that this project would be adopted and backed by this dying Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing but a smokescreen has come from that.  I challenge both Ministers in the dying hours of this Dáil to state where they stand on this issue.  It is not good enough that the regional technical college action group, the Mayo Vocational Education Committee and the people of County Mayo should be treated in this manner.  I want to state publicly that Fine Gael will authorise independent and autonomous courses <Col N="2260" /> in existing accommodation that will lead to a regional technical college over a number of years.  That is the fundamental and essential requirement arising out of ten years of activity.  There is not a need for £20 million to be put into the Estimates next year, as has been quoted by some Fianna Fáil sources.  This matter could be dealt with if the Government had the political will.  I wish to reiterate my public challenge to both Ministers to deal promptly and urgently with this. Otherwise during the next three weeks this campaign will be taken onto the streets and into the hearts and minds of the people.  I know they will back the only political party that has given full consent and authorisation to this necessary and urgent proposal.  I now wish to allow a minute of my time to Deputy Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for agreeing to share time.  It is incredible that the site is in place for the past seven to eight years, that the courses were agreed and that it was all systems go. Suddenly, as soon as this administration got into office in 1987, the wheels ground to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible that there are 2,000 Mayo students scattered throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, and indeed throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom, and that they do not have their own institution.  Mayo is the third largest county in Ireland.  Cork is the largest; it has got University College Cork, a regional technical college, Crawford College and a college of dentistry. Galway is the second largest; if has got University College Galway and a regional technical college.  County Mayo has absolutely nothing.  We have a national committee who have done excellent work.  As Deputy Kenny has said, they have been led a merry dance but now the moment of truth is nigh.  For a county ravaged by emigration, desolated by lack of development, which is crying out for growth and which needs a regional development college as a catalyst for growth and survival, we are extremely disappointed that the Minister for Justice, <Col N="2261" /> Deputy Flynn, has failed his native county.  The moment of truth is nigh. Unless it is delivered upon within the next 48 hours &mdash; and that is a very short time span &mdash; I am afraid they will pay the ultimate price.  The election in County Mayo will be fought on this single issue. This is the key issue; this is the litmus test of this Government's commitment to the county.  Unless there is a clear categorical commitment within the next 48 hours, then upon the head of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, be it.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the lengthy history which the Deputies have put before the House pertaining to the background to the proposed regional technical college for Castlebar.  I do not propose to go over all this history on this occasion.  I would, however, wish to inform the House as to the more recent developments.</P>
      <P>In July last the Minister for Education was pleased to accede to a request from his Government colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, to meet a deputation from the Mayo regional technical college action group to discuss the proposed regional technical college.  The deputation outlined to him the history of the proposal and made a very strong case on social and economic grounds.  The Minister for Education was impressed by the extent of the local commitment on this issue and he undertook to examine all the options available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that time the various options have been considered in some detail in the Department of Education.  Officials of the Department of Education met representatives of the action group again on 23 October and further discussed a number of options which might be pursued. Following on from that meeting it has been arranged that senior personnel, including technical staff from the Department of Education, will visit Castlebar next week to inspect a property with a view to assessing its suitability to accommodate technology based courses.  A full <Col N="2262" /> report will then be prepared for consideration by the Minister.  In his consideration of this proposal the House will not need to be reminded of the fact that the Minister for Education has considerable resource constraints.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the importance of third level education, as reflected in recent initiatives such as the programme of expansion of student places, major capital initiatives supported by the European Structural Funds and the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to the importance of higher education.  A third level institution for every town or, indeed, county is not practical.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges were set up to serve designated regions, each region comprising a number of counties or parts of counties.  North Mayo is part of the region served by Sligo Regional Technical College and south Mayo is part of the region served by Galway Regional Technical College.</P>

      <P>The projected increase in student numbers and the provision of research and development support to industry can be most efficiently met through the existing network of regionally located third level institutions, universities and technological colleges.</P>
      <P>With regard to economic development of the regions, the Green Paper on Education proposes that all third level institutions develop explicit policies for interaction with industry, with particular emphasis on the economic development of their regions and including the development of appropriate linkages between regional technical colleges and universities to further enhance the quality of service available on a regional basis. Within this context the Minister for Education will, as he has promised, look with an open mind at the options open to him and his Department pertaining to the proposal for Castlebar.  He will keep the local representatives informed of progress in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I believe it is only right to record that this will be the last item raised on the Adjournment during the lifetime of the 26th Dáil.  From that point of view, I suppose there is a certain sense of history attached to the issue.  From the point of view of importance and the need for a policy development in the next Dáil I cannot think of any more important issue that should be raised than the carer's allowance.  By way of example I wish to refer to the case of a 79 year old lady from my constituency who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease who is cared for at home by her niece and nephew.  The cost of maintaining her in a health board institution would be upwards of £200 per week.  Because of <Col N="2264" /> the nature of the disease, she has required 100 per cent constant care and attention over the past three years.  This care and attention has been given freely and gladly by her nephew and niece.  Yet, because of the restrictive conditions attached to the carer's allowance, not one penny of support has been given to these carers during that period of time.</P>
      <P>It is correct to say that both her niece and nephew are in receipt of social welfare payments &mdash; one receives disability benefit while the other receives unemployment assistance.  However, they would both be entitled to receive these payments if they never lifted a finger for their elderly aunt who has Alzheimer's disease.  They have been an example to the community in the utterly unselfish way they have cared for their aunt and the way in which they have looked after her both during the day and night.</P>
      <P>When as Opposition spokesman on social welfare, I proposed an amendment to the Social Welfare Act, 1989, which led to the establishment of the carer's allowance I certainly had in mind that cases of the type to which I am now referring would be covered.  At a very minimum a recognition payment should be paid in such circumstances to acknowledge the constant care and attention given, to make some contribution towards the additional costs involved and to provide encouragement to others to maintain relatives at home and, in the process, save the Exchequer the huge costs it would incur in the provision of institutional care.  I should say that this woman's nephew and niece will not benefit one penny from the introduction of such improvements in the carer's allowance &mdash; their elderly aunt died last month.  Their only request to me was that others in a similar situation should get some element of support to help them through the long days of devoted attention and the seemingly unending succession of sleepless nights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put three questions to the Minister.  First, how can we regard ourselves as a Christian society if we do not have a decent carer's allowance system which gives some recognition to those <Col N="2265" /> who have to care for elderly and infirm relatives?  Second, does he not accept, from a social point of view, that it is far better for the elderly and infirm to be cared for at home where medically possible rather than put them into an institution? Third, does he not agree that from an economic point of view it would be far cheaper for the Exchequer to make some payment which would encourage and help people to maintain their elderly and infirm relatives at home?  If he agrees with me on these three issues we might join in making a commitment to the improvement of the carer's allowance system in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance scheme, introduced in November 1990, provided for the first time for the payment of an allowance directly to a person providing full-time care and attention to an elderly or incapacitated person.  Originally this only applied where the elderly person concerned was in receipt of a social welfare pension but the scheme was subsequently broadened to include those on a disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this scheme recognised the value of carers in their own right.  Previously, an allowance to offset the costs of caring for an elderly relative was payable under a prescribed relative's allowance scheme as a supplement to the pensioner and not directly to the person actually providing the care and attention.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance scheme is a means-tested scheme and is, therefore, not payable where the person concerned is in receipt of another social welfare benefit or allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, a person may not receive more than one social welfare payment at any given time.  The qualifying conditions vary from scheme to scheme and persons providing care on a full-time basis might not, for example, fully satisfy the conditions for unemployment assistance which would require them to be available for, capable of the actively seeking employment.  Of course, persons who satisfy the qualifying conditions for <Col N="2266" /> more than one type of benefit or assistance may opt for payment under whichever scheme is most advantageous to them.</P>
    <P>The scheme as it stands is directed at people on low income who satisfy a means test.  Any extension of the scheme to cover other categories of people providing care would have major financial implications.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some people on relatively moderate incomes fail to qualify for the allowance or only qualify for a reduced rate of payment.  This aspect of the scheme will be examined in the context of a general review of means-testing arrangements within my Department.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister, my experience of the scheme suggests to me that perhaps it is something which might more properly reside in the health care area rather than social assistance.  Consequently, in the context of the review I mentioned, I will be pursuing the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Health, to see how the scheme can be further developed in the interests of those who give so unstintingly of their time as carers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the three questions posed by Deputy O'Keeffe, I am already on the record during the debate on the Social Welfare Act as making those points.  It would make more sense from an economic point of view to make some payment to relatives to maintain their elderly and infirm relatives at home.  I have referred to the carer's allowance since the first day I took up office and I believe some progress could be made in this area if it was looked at in the overall context of savings to the State and the advantages from a social point of view. A few Government Departments would have to be married together in introducing changes in the system.  I cannot disagree with any of the points made by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Because I felt that this might be the last day Deputy Molloy would be serving as Minister for Energy I very deliberately put down this matter seeking action on a pulpwood industry for the north-west.  I believe the Minister accepted the case for a further pulpwood industry and I also believe that he was sympathetic to and accepted the logic of the arguments for the location of that industry in Sligo-Leitrim.  I hope I will be able to convince his successor, the Taoiseach, on the wisdom of the case, achieving agreement at last between Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been argued many times for a third pulpwood industry in addition to the mills at Clonmel and Scariff.  In the north-west we are planting trees at a very rapid rate.  Indeed, too much good land is being gobbled up this way, along with marginal land.  Whatever one's attitude to forestry development, it is happening. Already there is plenty of raw material for a third pulpwood mill with forest thinnings and the residue from the sawmills.  There will be more.  Sadly there are disappointingly few jobs in forestry but there are many good, long term jobs in the pulpwood industry.  Instead of exporting surplus timber as we are now doing to Finland, France, the UK and other countries, all logic seems to suggest that we proceed as quickly as possible with a new pulpwood industry.  Because it is where the timber is and where the jobs are needed most, the logical place for such an industry must be Sligo or Leitrim.  I hope the Minister standing in <Col N="2268" /> for the new Minister for Energy will be able to agree and will have some definite information on progress planned.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a Dáil Deputy whose seat is in considerable danger, although it will be vigorously defended, I want to pay tribute to you, a Cheann Comhairle, on the manner in which you have presided over the affairs of the 26th Dáil, which was at times an unruly assembly.  I offer a particular word of thanks on the manner in which you have nurtured this late hour facility for bringing to the floor of the House issues of vital local importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the new Minister for Energy, the Taoiseach.  I congratulate the two Deputies opposite on their diligence and close marking.  The other grievance matter comes from Deputy Nealon's colleague, Deputy Gerry Reynolds.  I note what Deputy Nealon says about his seat being in danger.  I wish both Deputies well in the election.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is an urgent need for another pulpwood-using industry, in this country, to cater for the supplies of timber becoming available in increasing quantities in the country as a whole and the north-west region in particular.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, my predecessor indicated in this House that the increasing availability of timber supplies merited the establishment of a new pulpwood-using industry.  That remains our view.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the promotion of such a project is essentially a matter for Coillte, in consultation with the State's industrial development agencies. I know that Coillte and the IDA have maintained contact with all of the major companies in the industry internationally, with the aim of developing early proposals for a new pulpmill which will best utilise the growing raw material output of our forests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there has been no slackening of effort in trying to find a suitable international partner to replace the Swedish industrial concern which withdrew from an earlier development <Col N="2269" /> project.  The urgency of the situation is fully accepted.  It is the reality, however, that the timber industry internationally and pulp processing in particular is going through a very deep recession and the recent turmoil on the currency markets is another unhelpful factor in efforts to get such a project off the ground.  The Deputy will readily understand that such circumstances are an unfortunate backdrop to the search for a suitable international partner in this venture, but the search is continuing.</P>
    <P>The timber supply situation is certainly in our favour and augurs well for ultimate success.  Total average annual pulpwood availability over the period 1992 to 1997 is projected to be 900,000m. per annum. Besides the quest for a new pulpmill plant which is the highest priority project, Coillte is currently examining a number of other possible uses for the increasing volumes of pulpwood and sawmill residues becoming available in Ireland. These include board products such as oriented strand board and medium density fibre board.  Detailed feasibility studies are still in progress.</P>
    <P>To move such projects forward.  It is necessary to secure the right investment sources with the right levels of expertise and market outlets but, as I said earlier, the search is not easy in recessionary times.  As to the likely location of such industries, this would be a matter primarily for the major investor involved and it would depend on a number of factors, including electricity and adequate water supplies in the case of a pulpmill plant especially.  Of course, great emphasis will also be placed on environmental considerations.  While it is thus too early for me to indicate to the House the location of such new industries, I would reiterate my view that the north-west area would represent a prime potential location on the basis of the level of total national pulpwood supply projected from that region.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the Arigna power station in <Col N="2270" /> County Roscommon.  For the past year the communities in the Arigna catchment area have been plunged into a mood of darkness arising from the announcement of the closure of the ESB coal burning station and the consequent closure of the coal mines.  In 1968 the power station now at Arigna was commissioned and it has since performed at a very high efficiency level within planned parameters. In 1989 it was the fifth most efficient power station in the ESB network, well above the efficiency level of even the Moneypoint power station.  In over 30 years it has produced electricity at a very economic and technically efficient level.  In 1989 the works cost was almost £4 million, almost £1 million less than in 1988.  A total of 4.8 million units were generated and 4.23 million units were sent out into the system.  What therefore was initially established primarily for social considerations has become an efficient user of national resources in the area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has taken responsibility for the Department of Energy.  He represents the constituency where the Arigna power station is located.  Before he turns out the lights on this Dáil I would ask him to give a commitment to the 60 people employed in the Arigna ESB station that the station will be allowed to continue in operation until all the coal in the Arigna area is exhausted.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for allowing us to raise serious local issues and I hope I will be back in the 27th Dáil to meet you on opening day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with this matter on behalf of the Minister for Energy.  Last year an independent consultancy study was commissioned on proposals put forward by the Arigna action committee for the continued operation of the Arigna power station.  This action was taken to ensure that the committee's proposals were fully evaluated.  Unfortunately the consultants, Byrne O'Cleirigh, concluded that they could not recommend that the operational life of the station be extended past the proposed closure date next year.  This conclusion <Col N="2271" /> was reached by the consultants on the facts as presented to them.  The consultants concluded, using the most optimistic assumptions on coal availability and its cost and on station refurbishment requirements, that the cost of generating power at Arigna is likely to be at least four times the alternative cost of generation.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the ESB had proposed to close the station in 1985, so there has already been an extension of seven years.  In view of the age of the power station continued operation must depend on significant new investment. Regrettably, the investigations so far do not provide an economic basis for such investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The professional advice available to us indicates that the continued operation of the Arigna station would probably require an open-ended financial commitment. If local interests consider that a workable proposal for the buy-out of the plant, the purchase of local coal supplies and the sale of electricity to the grid could be developed, this could of course be considered.  This would, however, involve local interests taking full responsibility for the operation of the station and assuming the associated financial risks.  This is the only basis on which an intervention in the ESB decision to close the station would be made and any submissions from the local <Col N="2272" /> community in this regard will be fully considered.</P>
    <P>When the ESB decision to close the station was taken every effort was made to provide alternative jobs in the Arigna catchment area.  The local authorities and State agencies in the area were commissioned to act as facilitators for all worthwhile investment.  In addition, the ESB were asked to come up with funding for local business initiatives.  We are pleased that so far the enterprise development agencies in the area are working well with some good job creation results to date.</P>
    <P>While the exhaustion of commercially usable coal around Arigna was both inevitable and regrettable, the type of initiatives already taken as a result of this intervention on alternative job creation is the best assurance for the long term economic and social wellbeing of the Arigna area.</P>
    <P>As I have already wished Deputy Reynolds's colleagues well in the forthcoming election, I now wish my good friend, Deputy Reynolds, success, but of course not at the expense of my Fianna Fáil colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 8, 36 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear, in this House and elsewhere, that I believe that the level of Ireland's Official Development Assistance must be increased.  My visits to Somalia have reinforced that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capacity of a small country like Ireland to make an impact on the poorer countries' needs is limited but that must not prevent us from responding generously. The Irish people have given magnificent <Col N="2050" /> support to the Aid Agencies and it is my belief that the Government should also be generous.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that the Taoiseach, in his Bodenstown speech, indicated that he has decided to review the level of Official Development Assistance given by Ireland, recognising a general wish that it should be increased to reflect the strong sense of solidarity and of moral obligation that we feel towards those in the developing world.  The Taoiseach pledged that from next year the Government would gradually begin to raise the level of Official Development Assistance, and would hope to be able to proceed somewhat faster thereafter, as general economic and financial conditions improve.</P>
    <P>The projected figures for expenditure on ODA in 1993 will be announced at the time of publication of the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>I have read the recent submission by Trócaire on the Official Development Assistance Programme with interest.  It contains a range of recommendations which I will consider carefully.  I cannot at this stage commit the Government to meeting the specific targets for expenditure on ODA recommended by Trócaire but I can repeat that it is the Government's intention that the level of ODA be raised next year and thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 39, 90, 94 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The Danish Government White Paper &mdash; which in Irish terms is equivalent to a Green Paper &mdash; was published on 9 October.  It analyses the situation following the outcome of the Danish referendum last June and sets out the options which Denmark could follow in order to resolve the problems caused by the Danish vote on the Maastricht Treaty.  The White Paper did not contain specific proposals.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 30 October, after consultation with the political parties in Denmark, the Danish Government set out its ideas for resolving the issues which arise for Denmark in relation to the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have just received this Danish paper.  We are anxious to <Col N="2054" /> discuss the ideas in it with our partners; and the Danish Foreign Minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, has indicated that he intends to visit capitals to explain the proposals in greater detail.  It would be be premature to react to the detail of the proposals pending these discussions.  I can, however, indicate the general framework within which we will consider the Danish ideas.</P>
    <P>First, I believe that it is in the interests of the Community and of Ireland to have the Maastricht Treaty ratified by all member states so that it will come into effect at the earliest possible date.  Notwithstanding the difficulties that have been encountered since the conclusion of negotiations, the Treaty remains the best basis for the development of European Union which is very important to Ireland's political and economic welfare.</P>
    <P>Second, the Treaty cannot come into effect until all Twelve member states ratify it.  We are prepared to co-operate with Denmark in any steps that will facilitate Danish ratification so long as such steps uphold the Community's achievements and do not set back the dynamic of integration.</P>
    <P>Third, the text of the Treaty signed at Maastricht on 7 February, and to which reference is now made in our Constitution, cannot be renegotiated.  At the recent Birmingham European Council all Heads of Government reaffirmed the importance of concluding the ratification process without reopening the present text.</P>
    <P>Fourth, we will want to ensure that any additional agreements required to meet Danish concerns and to help Denmark ratify do not run counter to our interests or our basic policy.</P>
    <P>These are the principal considerations that will guide the Government in the discussions with the Danish Government and our other Community partners in the period ahead.  Foreign Ministers of the Twelve have been asked by Heads of Government to examine the Danish ideas and to report on them to the Edinburgh European Council with a view to agreement there on the framework for a solution. I can assure the House that we will <Col N="2055" /> be making a full contribution to these discussions.</P>
    <P>There is a connection between the ratification process and the question of enlargement.  Ireland, together with its EC partners views the Community, and the Union towards which it is evolving, as fundamentally open to qualified new members.  This was most recently given expression in the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council.  It was agreed on that occasion that the European Economic Area Agreement had paved the way for opening enlargement negotiations with a view to an early conclusion with EFTA countries interested in membership of the European Union.  As to time-scale it was envisaged that official negotiations would open after the Treaty on European Union was ratified and agreement was reached on the Delors II package.</P>
    <P>There are other applications for membership pending and more are expected in the coming years.  It would be premature to speculate at this juncture on a possible time-scale for such further enlargement.  The European Council in Lisbon noted the challenges that would be posed by a Union composed of a large number of member states and saw the need for parallel progress as regards the internal development of the Union.</P>

      <P>In a statement issued by the African National Congress on 20 October, it was stated that the comments which Mr. Mandela made in his recently screened TV interview with Bob Geldof <Col N="2056" /> cannot be construed as support for the IRA.  It has also been pointed out by the ANC that the interview in question took place in June 1991.  The Deputy will no doubt have seen media reports that Mr. Mandela has also clarified his position in a letter to the Lord Mayor of Dublin. The ANC have made clear Mr. Mandela's view that the Government of Ireland is the representative of the people of Ireland and their aspirations.</P>
      <P>The ANC and the South African Government will be briefed on the Government's commitment to achieving by peaceful means a just and durable solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  The fact that the actions of the Provisional IRA or other paramilitary groups are repugnant to the vast majority of the Irish people and the Government's rejection of support, whether moral or material, for those in Northern Ireland who espouse violence as a means of achieving their political objectives are on the record.</P>

      <P>There is a massive shortage of food supplies in Mozambique at present. As in Somalia, the twin evils of drought and war have combined to exacerbate the situation and create a full scale famine.</P>
      <P>A joint FAO/World Food Programme mission visited Mozambique earlier this year to assess the drought situation.  It confirmed the almost total loss of the main cereal crops in the centre and the south of the country, and concluded that substantial amounts of extra food aid will be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seed production within Mozambique has also been affected by the drought. Seeds for free distribution and for the market place must now be imported.  It is estimated by officials of the Government <Col N="2057" /> of Mozambique that 20,000 tonnes of seed are required immediately.</P>
    <P>In 1992, Mozambique has been allocated 271,266 tonnes of food aid by the European Community: 247,078 tonnes of this have been shipped and 124,727 tonnes delivered.</P>
    <P>In addition to food aid, on 1 October the Commission approved an allocation of 2 million ECUs in emergency aid to assist the population affected by famine. The aid will be used to fund the provision of medicines and for feeding programmes through the Red Cross and other agencies.</P>
    <P>The EC is also assisting more than one million Mozambican refugees in Malawi through EC Food Aid to that country.</P>
    <P>In spite of the very serious problems at present I am hopeful that the peace agreement signed in Rome on 4 October 1992 between the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO which ended a 15 year war will help to ensure that lives will be saved and will prevent Mozambique becoming the Somalia of tomorrow.</P>

      <P>A proposal of the Co-Chairmen of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia for a constitutional structure was made to the three Bosnian parties on 28 October. This will be the subject of intensive and almost certainly very difficult negotiations in coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is based on the principles agreed by all parties at the Conference in London in August 1992.  It also takes account of bilateral discussions on Bosnia-Hercegovina <Col N="2058" /> between the representatives of that Republic's three ethnic groups and the International Conference negotiators.</P>
    <P>The constitutional proposal has very extensive safeguards on human rights.  It envisages the inclusion in the Constitution of three categories of human rights: general human, especially civil and political rights; group and especially minority rights; and economic, social and cultural rights.  These provisions would have an effect similar to that of a Bill of Rights.</P>
    <P>On voting arrangements, it has been proposed that the Lower House of the Legislature will be composed of representatives elected on the basis of proportional representation in Bosnia-Hercegovina as a whole.</P>
    <P>The parties have been asked to consider a constitutional structure for Bosnia-Hercegovina based on the concept of a decentralised state within its present international borders.  Such an arrangement is considered essential to achieve a stable and viable solution that does not condone or accept the so-called ethnic cleansing which has taken place in that Republic.</P>
    <P>A central government, with the responsibilities that are necessary to ensure the functioning of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a sovereign and independent state, is envisaged.  The parties have also been asked to consider the subdivision of Bosnia-Hercegovina into between 7 and 10 provinces.  The precise number is to be established by negotiation among the parties within the framework of the International Conference.</P>
    <P>The delineation of boundaries of the provinces is also a matter for negotiations between the parties and the International Conference negotiators.  It has been proposed that the boundaries should be drawn so as to constitute areas as geographically coherent as possible, taking into account ethnic, geographic, historical and communication factors, and also economic viability.  It is envisaged that the provincial boundaries will be set <Col N="2059" /> out in the new Constitution for Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 7 (c) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement records the position of the two Governments &ldquo;that there is a need for a programme of special measures in Northern Ireland to improve relations between the security forces and the community, with the object in particular of making the security forces readily accepted by the nationalist community&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Hillsborough Communiqué, which accompanied the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, expressed the intention of the two Governments to concentrate at the initial meetings of the Conference on relations between the security forces and the nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  This has remained a priority area of work for the conference.  At its meeting in March 1988 it decided to give added impetus to work in this area.  Accordingly, and in addition to meetings of the Conference, a group of high level officials has been charged with the task of ensuring that the ongoing work at official level has the necessary focus and direction.</P>
      <P>The Government remain determined to ensure that the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will continue to address fully the unresolved problems of harassment, ill-treatment and the other difficulties which adversely affect the rights, security and welfare of the nationalist community in Northern Ireland and which hamper the development of good relations between the security forces and the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, a number of changes <Col N="2060" /> have already been introduced.  For example:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of a Code of Conduct for the RUC;</P>
    <P>&mdash;more impartial policing by the RUC of parades during the Loyalist marching season;</P>
    <P>&mdash;procedures to speed up the processing of complaints against members of the British army and the establishment by the British Government of mechanisms to review responses to allegations of harassment by members of the security forces;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of an Independent Commission for Police Complaints.</P>
    <P>These reforms, while repesenting some progress, have not resolved difficulties in this area.  A recent survey in Northern Ireland carried out for the British Social Attitudes Survey reveals that substantial numbers of Catholics do not believe that the security forces act evenhandedly; and that 70 per cent of Catholics believe that if the police or army commit an offence they usually get away with it.</P>
    <P>Much, therefore, remains to be done and we shall continue to press for meaningful, sustained and effective improvements. These should relate for example to the use of lethal force by the security forces; conditions and safeguards for detainees in the RUC holding centres; the objective of full and effective police accompaniment of British army, including Royal Irish Regiment, patrols which involve direct contact with the community; and the continuing problem of harassment by the British army of persons, particularly young men, in nationalist areas.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Conference remains central to the objective of enhancing confidence in the security forces in Northern Ireland.  I can assure the Deputy that the Conference scheduled for 16 November will pay full attention to these problems.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 24 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Following the killings of innocent civilians in Dili, East Timor on 12 November 1991, the Secretary General of the United Nations appointed Mr. Amos Wako, Attorney-General of Kenya, as his personal representative to visit Indonesia and East Timor in order to obtain clarification on the tragic events of the massacre and to report back to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Wako visited the area in February 1992.  During his visit he met President Suharto of Indonesia and members of the Indonesian Government.  He visited East Timor and there met the then Governor, Church representatives and local leaders. He has since submitted his report to the Secretary General.  As Mr. Wako is the Secretary General's personal representative, it is a matter for the Secretary <Col N="2062" /> General to decide in light of the circumstances whether or not to make public his report.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the Twelve, has expressed its deep concern on a number of occasions over the past year about the situation in East Timor, and in particular about the question of human rights abuses there.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with the Indonesian Ambassador to Ireland earlier this year I expressed my deep distress at the human rights situation in East Timor.  I recently met in Dublin Mr. Jose Ramos-Horta, a spokesman for the people of East Timor, and conveyed to him my deep sympathy at the plight of his people and my dismay at the human rights abuses being perpetrated by the Indonesian armed forces in East Timor.</P>
    <P>While we have always advocated restraint in international arms sales in the interests of international peace and stability, Ireland has not sought a ban on arms exports to Indonesia.</P>
    <P>The status of East Timor will be the subject of a dialogue between the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal which will take place under the auspices of the Secretary General of the United Nations starting in December, and in which the Secretary General, or his designated representative, will participate. The Government fully support these talks which we hope will achieve a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question.</P>
    <P>Portugal was designated by the United Nations some considerable time ago as the administering power in East Timor, and I believe that the question of the inclusion of representatives of East Timor in these talks should remain a matter for it and for the other participants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The Conference on Peace and Security, which met in Addis Ababa in July 1991, formally recognised the right of the Eritrean people to determine its future by an internationally supervised referendum, which is scheduled to take place in April 1993.  The Referendum Commissioner of Eritrea requested the UN Secretary-General to send a delegation of the United Nations to observe and verify the freeness, fairness and impartiality of the entire referendum process. The Secretary-General sent a technical team to Eritrea to prepare a report for submission to the UN General Assembly on the details of a potential involvement by the United Nations in the referendum.  The report of the Technical Mission has now been published and is due to be considered shortly by the UN General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The report proposes the establishment of a UN Observer Mission to Verify the Referendum in Eritrea (UNOVER), whose mandate will be to ensure impartiality of the referendum authorities and the freeness and fairness of the referendum process.</P>
      <P>In the light of the decision of the UN General Assembly on the establishment of UNOVER and in co-ordination with our Community partners, I will consider how best we can help the democratic process in Eritrea and, particularly, the referendum in April 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that Irish parliamentarians might have a role to play as observers of the referendum process and, in particular, that they might be <Col N="2064" /> able to join the proposed UN observation teams, to which UN member states are expected to contribute.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>As a member of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body from its inception until my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs earlier this year I am deeply conscious of the important contribution which the body makes to the promotion of greater understanding within these islands.  The body's debates have provided a constructive forum for dialogue between the two Legislatures and have helped parliamentarians on both sides to have a fuller appreciation of their respective positions.  Moreover, the wide-ranging nature of the body's deliberations have served to highlight the scope for enhanced co-operation over a broad spectrum of issues.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in early 1990 there have been five plenary meetings of the Inter-Parliamentary Body, including its most recent meeting in Edinburgh in July 1992.  During that period a total of nine reports have been forwarded to both Governments.  I am including with this reply a table listing the titles of these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the reports and their recommendations are given careful consideration both by me and by <Col N="2065" /> other Ministers who may be directly concerned with the subject matter of these reports.  As the Deputy will be aware the Government have responded positively to the request made by the body at the beginning of last year to provide written observations on the various reports.  To date the Government have provided views on the four reports submitted in 1991, and intend that replies to the three reports adopted at the Edinburgh meeting in July will be available in advance of the next Plenary session.  I understand that there is a similar process of consultation with the British Government.</P>
    <P>As regards proposals for the expansion of the work of the body, this I believe is a matter in the first instance for the body itself to consider.  I would, of course, in consultation with my British counterpart, be pleased to give careful consideration to any views or proposals, either with regard to the substantive work of the body or the procedural arrangements currently in place, which the Inter-parliamentary Body may wish to put forward.</P>

      <P>At the United Nations, the Secretary-General submits a six-monthly report on the UNIFIL operation to the Security Council in January and July.  The Council considers the renewal of the UNIFIL mandate on the basis of the recommendations in this report.  Following a decision by the Security Council to continue the mandate of the Force, the Secretary-General requests the troop-contributing countries, including Ireland, to maintain their participation in UNIFIL for a further six-month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> Before responding to the Secretary-General, the Government review the involvement of our military personnel in UNIFIL in all its aspects.  Of paramount importance is the question of the security and safety of our personnel.  The Government also consider UNIFIL's financing and the effectiveness of its contribution to peace and stability in South Lebanon.</P>
    <P>While it remains true that UNIFIL has been prevented from fully carrying out its mandate under Security Council Resolution 425, the presence of UN peacekeepers in South Lebanon has been crucial in maintaining stability in a region of a major international concern and it contributes to the security and to the humanitarian needs of the local population. The continuing existence of the Force is also an expression of the commitment of the international community to the unity and integrity of the State of Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Ireland's participation in UNIFIL represents a major contribution by Ireland to the maintenance of international peace and security within the framework of the UN Charter.  I believe its continuation is fully warranted at a time when, for the first time in many years, the current peace process offers a real prospect of achieving an enduring solution to the problems of the Middle East.</P>

      <P>I wish to take Questions Nos. 28 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The killing of Corporal Peter Ward while serving with UNIFIL in South Lebanon on 29 September was an appalling and deplorable act.  It is tragic that he should have been killed in the course of carrying out his peace-keeping duties and in a statement that day, I expressed my deep sympathy to Mrs. Ward and her children on the occasion of their terrible loss.</P>
      <P>Irish military personnel make a vital contribution to the United Nations effort to maintain peace and security in South Lebanon.  I pay tribute to their courage and dedication, and the exemplary standards they bring to the performance of their immensely difficult and sensitive task there.</P>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding Corporal Ward's death were explained to the House by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, on 7 October.  A UN board of inquiry into the incident has been established but has yet to report and it remains to be determined which group or elements perpetrated the killing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's serious concern about this incident, and about the situation confronting UNIFIL, has already been raised at United Nations level and directly with the Governments of Iran, Lebanon and Syria.  In our contacts with these Governments we underlined the paramount importance attached by Ireland to the safety and security of Irish peacekeeping personnel.  We have stressed the need for all parties in South Lebanon to respect and co-operate with UNIFIL, to desist from firing on UNIFIL personnel and from engaging in activities that place UN peacekeepers in life-threatening situations.  We also requested the Governments concerned to exert all the influence they can to ensure that the parties in South Lebanon exercise restraint and moderation.  These Governments can be in no doubt about the <Col N="2069" /> seriousness with which we view incidents that affect UNIFIL in the performance of its peacekeeping duties.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is as follows: As regards former Yugoslavia, Ireland agreed earlier this year to a request from the UN Secretary-General to provide military and Garda observers to serve with UNPROFOR, the United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia.  The present Irish contingent comprises: six military observers and 20 Garda officers.</P>
      <P>The military observers have played a vital role in implementing the UN plan for the demilitarisation of the areas under its protection in Croatia and in the reopening of the airport in Sarajevo. Their mission is to facilitate communications between the parties to the conflict, to attempt to defuse potentially difficult situations and thereby to promote the restoration of peace and security there.  They are unarmed.</P>
      <P>The members of An Garda Síochána serving with UNPROFOR comprise one Superintendent, four Sergeants and fifteen officers.  They are based at two of the United Nations protected areas, namely Sector East (Eastern Slovenia) and Sector South (Krajina), and at United Nations Headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia.</P>
      <P>The function of the Garda officers is to act as Civilian Police Monitors in the context of the overall United Nations Protection Force mission.  Their task is to ensure that the local police carry out their duties without discrimination against any nationality and with full respect for the human rights of all residents of the UN protected areas.  The Garda also are unarmed.</P>
      <P>In so far as South Africa is concerned, the Government have not been approached by the UN Secretary General to supply an Irish contingent to serve with the United Nations Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, two members of the Garda Síochána travelled to South Africa on 2 <Col N="2071" /> November to serve with the EC observer team there.  The observer team is attached to the South African National Peace Secretariat under the umbrella of United Nations Security Council Resolution 772, the objective of which is to assist in the implementation of the terms of the National Peace Accord.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, the Government intend to take to promote the initiative in regard to the proposals made by the Irish Permanent Representative to the United Nations on 23 October 1992 regarding an international code of conduct on conventional arms transfers, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years there has been growing concern about the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons in many parts of the world.  Overspending on armaments, particularly by some developing countries, has increased instability and reduced the amount of resources available for economic and social development.  An extreme and tragic example is Somalia which received large quantities of arms which are now in the hands of various lawless elements. This has contributed to a situation of anarchy which prevents the effective delivery of relief supplies to the famine victims.</P>
      <P>Because of our concern about these developments I instructed our Permanent Representative to the United Nations to propose the elaboration of a voluntary code of conduct to regulate international arms transfers.  The purpose of this initiative is to bring about greater responsibility and restraint in transfers of conventional weapons.</P>
      <P>The code would call upon States voluntarily to exercise particular responsibility in their exports and imports of such weapons.  It would not include specified limitations on transfers, but States would undertake to ensure as far as possible that their transfers of conventional weapons would not undermine international stability or security.  The code would build upon steps which have already been taken towards developing a responsible and restrained approach to arms transfers, including the efforts of the European Community.  It would not, however, interfere with the legitimate right of States under the UN Charter to acquire arms for self-defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The follow-up to our proposal will, of course, be a lengthy and detailed business, but I can assure the House that I <Col N="2073" /> intend to make every effort to advance it.  If this proposal meets with favourable reactions in the General Assembly, we will carry out consultations with other interested states on how best it may be taken forward in the UN system.</P>

The Russian authorities are now proceeding with a programme of storage and dismantlement towards which a number of Western countries with expertise in this area are contributing financial and technical assistance. The Russian Government have given assurances that a very strict safety system has been put in place to prevent any possible threat to the nuclear weapons while they are in storage.

      <P>A meeting of the Western European Union with the representatives of prospective members, associate members and observers took place in Rome, under Italian chairmanship, on 16 July.  Ireland was represented by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The purpose of this meeting was to initiate discussions between the Western European Union and prospective members, associate members and observers, following the extension of invitations to enter such discussions by the German Foreign Minister, on behalf of the Western European Union, on 30 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting on 16 July, the Western European Union indicated that the basis on which these invitations had been extended was set out in the Declaration of the Western European Union Ministers issued at Maastricht on 10 December last year, and their later Declaration issued in Bonn on 19 June 1992.  In their Declaration at Maastricht, the member states of the Western European Union had proposed that member states of the European Union be invited to accede to the Western European Union or become observers.  The Irish delegation made clear the Government's position that they did not intend to accept the invitation to become a member of the Western European Union but that they did see advantages <Col N="2075" /> in attending Western European Union meetings as observers.</P>
    <P>These advantages, which I have already described to the House, were set out in the Government's White Paper on the Treaty on European Union.  Attendance as observers would ensure that Ireland is fully informed of developments within the Western European Union which might have a bearing on discussions in the European Union.  It would better enable the Government to decide on any proposal in the European Union on the reference to the Western European Union of matters which have defence implications.  And it would enable Ireland to follow the subsequent course of discussions in the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The Government have also made clear their position that attendance as observers at the Western European Union would not require Ireland to take up any obligations under the Brussels Treaty establishing the Western European Union, or to subscribe to policy positions or platforms adopted by the Western European Union.  Ireland would not become a party to the Western European Union or undertake any mutual defence commitments or military obligations under the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The discussions which commenced in Rome on 16 July are continuing.  I would expect, however, that they will be concluded satisfactorily in the relatively near future, and that the Government's position, as I have outlined it above, will be fully accepted by the Western European Union.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union provides for an enhanced role for the European Parliament.  During the negotiations leading to the Treaty there was a broad consensus among the member states that the role of the European Parliament needed to be strengthened while maintaining the overall balance between the Community Institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty contains a Declaration on the role of National Parliaments which provides for greater information on legislative proposals from the Commission and greater co-operation with the European Parliament.  The Birmingham European Council on 18 October 1992 <Col N="2077" /> reaffirmed that national parliaments should be more closely involved in the Community's activities and that the matter would be discussed with national Parliaments.  The Birmingham Declaration also welcomed the Commission's readiness to respond positively to requests from national parliaments for explanations of proposals.  This is an important step by the Commission which has the exclusive right under the Treaties to make proposals for legislation.</P>
    <P>At present the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation has considerable powers to review Commission proposals, acts of the Institutions, including legislation adopted by the Council of Ministers and, of course, secondary legislation consequent on Community acts.  The committee has from the outset received from my Department copies of all proposals for legislation made by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Government fully support the Birmingham Declaration.  In order to put these ideas into effect, I am anxious for the Oireachtas to have greater involvement in European Community Affairs, building on the valuable work carried out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities since Ireland joined the Community.  As the Deputy will be aware, discussions are at present under way among the parties represented in the Oireachtas on the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee and on the role of such a Committee in relation to EC matters.  I hope that the outcome of these discussions will be a structure which will permit closer involvement of the Oireachtas with the major issues facing this country in its relationship with Europe.</P>

In particular, we now take the view that their effect on economic and social cohesion should be the predominant criterion in looking at State aid cases.  In this regard, I welcome the EC Commission's recent acknowledgement of the importance of State aid control for cohesion purposes in its recently published 3rd Survey on State Aids.</P>

      <P>At present there is no company in Ireland fully processing bovine hides from the raw state to finished leather.  The IDA estimate that, for 1991 and currently, less than 20 per cent of bovine animal hides are part processed in Ireland, i.e. beyond the prime salted condition.</P>
      <P>As indicated previously the IDA continues to pursue its objective to increase the level of processing consistent with the pattern of supplies available, market conditions and demand for processed as against unprocessed hides.  In this regard the IDA has approved two new projects in the Bovine Leather Sector and as a result it is expected that the percentage of part-processed bovine hides will increase within the next three to four years.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed, within the overall context of limited Exchequer resources, to continuing the policies, which have been pursued in recent years, of improving the net income of the employed, particularly for people on low incomes.  The main objective of this policy is to ensure, as far as is practicable, the adequacy of incentives to take up any available employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive budgets in recent years have taken substantial measures to improve the net income position of persons with large families in lower paid employment. These measures include increasing tax exemption limits, the introduction, and subsequent increasing, of a child addition to those limits, and substantial increases in payments under the Family Income Supplement Scheme.  Subject to the overall constraints imposed by limited Exchequer resources and other policy objectives, particularly in the areas of taxation and Social Welfare, every effort will be made to deploy these instruments in a way which ensures that the relationship between net income when employed, as against unemployed, will in <Col N="2081" /> general be protected and, where practicable, improved.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy on this matter is set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> clearly states, as does the Programme for Government, that no change will take place in the ownership structure of any State company unless it is in the public interest and in the best interests of the company and its employees and following consultation with the social partners. That remains the position.</P>
      <P>As regards the use of funds from sale of shares in State assets, the Government's policy is to use these proceeds to reduce borrowing and thus help to ease the burden of the national debt and of debt-servicing costs.  In accordance with that principle, and in line with the accounting practice which has now become well established, receipts of this nature will continue to be treated as &ldquo;Exchequer Capital Receipts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under this accounting treatment, such receipts enter the calculation of the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement but would not directly subvent current spending or the current budget deficit.  There would of course be an indirect effect on current spending, in that the application of the proceeds to reduce borrowing would obviously reduce subsequent servicing costs, which are classified on the expenditure side of the current budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have already announced its agreement in principle, to offer for sale ACC Bank plc and ICC Bank plc.  A decision to sell these bodies <Col N="2082" /> will depend on the sale terms being acceptable to the Government.  Therefore, it is not yet possible to say if they will be sold during the next twelve months. There are no specific proposals before the Government at present for the disposal of all or part of the State's shareholding in any other State-owned companies.</P>

      <P>Radioactive material, in both sealed and unsealed form, is imported for use in industrial, medical and laboratory applications under licence from the Radiological <Col N="2083" /> Protection Institute.  At present, all imported sealed radioactive sources must be returned to the original supplier at the end of their useful lives &mdash; this is a precondition imposed by the Board prior to the issue of a licence.</P>
      <P>There are some 2,300 Gigabecquerels of low-level waste in storage in the form of disused sealed sources in hospitals, laboratories and in certain industries. These were mainly imported before the introduction of regulatory controls in this country.  In the case of radioactive substances in unsealed form the licensee is obliged to store waste material on his premises until the radioactive content has decayed to levels at which disposal as ordinary domestic waste is permitted.</P>
      <P>Inspections of storage of radioactive substances are carried out by the Institute.  Although there is at present no central radioactive waste storage facility in Ireland, I am satisfied that the present arrangements in place ensure that all sources of radioactivity are currently stored in a manner which does not pose a hazard to people or property.</P>

      <P>The planning and provision of particular public transport services are matters for the board of CIE in the first instance.  As regards the future of public transport for the greater Dublin area as a whole, the Interim Report of Phase 2 of the Dublin Transportation Initiative &mdash; DTI &mdash; which is now almost completed has been circulated in draft form to the DTI Steering Committee, the Local Authority Committee and the Consultative Panel for consideration.  The draft includes a number of different options to serve Dublin Airport and Swords viz:&mdash; a rail link from the Dublin-Belfast line to Dublin Airport with a DART service to the City Centre; extension of a proposed Ballymun light rail link to include Dublin Airport and Swords and the establishment of a &ldquo;quality bus corridor&rdquo; from Swords to the City Centre.  When the interim report is finalised, it will be submitted to the Government.</P>
      <P>The DTI Report will form an integral part of the input into negotiations on EC Structural Funds for the period after 1993.  The draft report provides an integrated transportation strategy involving significant roads development, major public transport investments and the introduction of strengthened traffic management measures.  On the public transport side the draft report contains radical proposals for enhanced commuter transport services, including bus and light rail options, extended DART and upgraded rail commuter services to resolve the traffic congestion problems of the greater Dublin area.  However, I must emphasise that, having regard to the state of the public finances, the availability of substantial EC funding will be crucially important to the implementation of the main recommendations of the DTI.</P>

This represents an increase of about 17 per cent over the previous year.  It is not possible at this point to forecast what loss of income, if any, will arise for any health board under the arrangement, having regard to changes in eligibility and the consequent redesignation of beds.  My Department will be discussing the income situation with the VHI in the near future and those discussions will include consideration of appropriate income budgets for the year ending February 1994.  The Deputy will appreciate that the level of payments to public and private hospitals must take account of the need to ensure the continuing financial viability of the VHI.  It is necessary to agree arrangements which do not threaten the integrity of the present balance between public and private funding of health care.  It is also necessary to ensure that the VHI meet EC future requirements on minimum solvency margins.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to give the Deputy figures in relation to the voluntary hospitals as it is not the practice of most of them to draw cheques until they are in a position to make payments to creditors.</P>
    <P>As my predecessor indicated on a number of occasions the timing of the issue of creditors payments is a matter for each individual agency to decide.  It should be noted that in considering the above figures the amount outstanding to creditors on any particular date is related to the timing of payments rather than an indication of its overall financial position. The cash position of the boards and voluntary hospitals is constantly monitored by my Department.  The Deputy will be aware that, as a result of service pressures, agencies have incurred expenditure, over a number of years, in excess of their allocations and that this has given rise to considerable cash difficulties.  This problem is being addressed by my <Col N="2096" /> Department and the Department of Finance at present and I am hopeful that I will be in a position, in due course, to bring forward a package of measures to ensure that there are no further excesses on approved budgets and that the current cash difficulties are resolved on a carefully planned and targeted basis.</P>

      <P>Under the proposed new arrangements for the agrimonetary system in 1993 the movement of sterling would be monitored on a monthly basis. When a monetary gap of more than 2.25 per cent opens up between the sterling green rate and the market rate, the green rate would be adjusted at regular intervals within the monitoring period to eliminate the excess gap.  At the end of the month the green rate would be aligned to the market rate to reduce any remaining gap by half.</P>
      <P>Adjusting the green pound would effectively alter the institutional price levels for agricultural products within the UK which should increase UK prices and so help to offset negative effects of fluctuations in sterling.  The agri-monetary proposals are still under discussion in the Council of Ministers.  I have sought adjustments to provide greater security of our agriculture and food sector.  It is too early to predict the precise outcome of the negotiations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The problem of seasonal production in both sectors is a complex one which stems from the fact that the primary industry is largely grass based.  The solution to the problem lies ultimately within the industry in that it will in the long run depend upon the production and marketing of products capable of providing the returns to the producers sufficient to justify the costs associated with off season production at farm level.  It is Government policy to counteract seasonal production in so far as is practicable and the grant assistance provided by the relevant State Agencies specifically encourages projects involving year-round production.</P>
      <P>Seasonality of production in the beef sector is a major problem with around half of our production concentrated in three months of the year from September to November.  This has effectively hindered us in exploiting markets which would otherwise have been available to us.  It was in an effort to counteract this situation that during the negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform I sought and secured a corrective mechanism in the form of a deseasonalisation premium (or spring slaughter premium). This premium of £53 per head will be payable on eligible steers slaughtered in the period January to April provided that in the second preceding year steer slaughterings in the September to November period exceeded 40 per cent of annual steer slaughterings.  The effect will be to encourage a better distribution of slaughterings throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of the deseasonalisation premium to the beef sector will, of course, depend on the extent to which slaughterings are switched from autumn to spring.  Assuming that the premium leads to a shift in the slaughtering pattern such <Col N="2105" /> that 250,000 steers are slaughtered in the January to April period of a given year, then the total value of the premium for that year would be in excess of £13 million.</P>
    <P>Draft EC rules governing the detailed implementation of the new premium scheme are at present under consideration in Brussels.  When these have been finalised, the arrangements for the payment of the various premiums will be announced.</P>

      <P>Information on off-farm incomes of farm households is collected in the CSO's Household Budget Survey, which was conducted in 1973, 1980 and 1987. Information on farm income is collected in the Teagasc National Farm Survey, (NFS) which is conducted annually.</P>
      <P>In 1987, both surveys focused on a number of the same farm households in order to establish clear information on farm and off-farm income.  The results were as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;The NFS sample represented 188,000 farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Of the 188,000 farms, the head of household had farming as a principal occupation in the case of 135,000 farms and did not have farming as a <Col N="2108" /> principal occupation in the case of 53,000 farms.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Of the 135,000 farms on which the head of household had farming as a principal occupation, income from farming was the main source of income for the head of household for 78,000 and was not the main source for 57,000.</P>
    <P>No similar exercise involving the Household Budget Survey and the National Farm Survey has been conducted since 1987.  However, it is estimated that since then, the number of farms which have off-farm income has increased.  This trend is likely to continue and the various measures to diversify the rural economy and promote rural development should have the effect of facilitating, among others, farmers who wish to take up work generating off-farm income.</P>

      <P>In its Communication of 1 February 1991, the EC Commission set out its reflections on the present state of the Common Agricultural Policy and on the need for fundamental change.  Many deficiencies in the policy were outlined including the area of income support, which under the original Common Agricultural Policy mechanisms depended almost exclusively on price guarantees. Consequently incomes were largely proportionate to the volume of production and the greater part of support was concentrated on the largest and most intensive farms.  The effect of this, as described in the Commission's paper, was that 80 per cent of the support provided by FEOGA was devoted to 20 per cent of <Col N="2110" /> farms, which accounted also for the greater part of the land used in EC agriculture. The existing system did not take adequate account of the incomes of the vast majority of small and medium size family farms.  Against the background of this analysis and other reflections, the Commission subsequently suggested new guidelines for future policy.  Amongst these the Commission recognised that farmers should be compensated for lower prices, that there should be advantage in doing this in a manner which would reduce production and reflect greater concern for the environment, and that there should be a better distribution of support among farmers, taking into account the difficulties of some categories and regions.</P>
      <P>Agreement on this package of measures was reached at the end of last May.  At the present time work is ongoing at Community level to give detailed effect to these wideranging revisions of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will be introduced in stages and will not be fully operative until 1997.  Until the reformed policy is brought into full effect, it will not be possible to estimate the corresponding ratio as requested. However, it is clear that some of the changes made by the Council, including the removal of some limits on compensation, reduced or removed some of the redistributive effects of the original Commission proposals.</P>

    <P>A new draft contract on the implementation of the EC provisions governing the purchase of beef into intervention is currently under discussion with trade interests in the beef sector.  One of the provisions forming part of the draft contract is a requirement whereby a Register of Intervention Contractors would be maintained by me.

Any changes proposed by the Contractors in the Register entries would be required to be notified to me without delay.</P>
    <P>A further purpose of the contract would be to ensure that Contractors comply in all respects with Community legislation and formally acknowledge their responsibility in this regard. Requirements with regard to weighing facilities detention areas for meat examination and the keeping of records would be specified, as also would penalties for non-compliance.</P>

      <P>An efficiency plan for Teagasc identified the importance of increasing the earned income of the organisation as one means of helping them to achieve a balanced budget.  Under section 6 (2) of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, I recently conveyed approval to Teagasc with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to implement increased charges to farmers for certain advisory services.</P>
      <P>The new charges, set out in attached schedule, came into effect on 1 November 1992.</P>
      <P>The proposed advisory services and charges are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Commercial Services.</P>

    <P>2.  Membership Service.</P>
    <P>Because of the fixed nature of this service, involving an adviser designated by Teagasc, combined with a pre-determined level of service and the importance of having a service available to the widest spectrum of farmers, unit charges are discounted as follows:</P>
    <P>Limited telephone contact (equivalent to one office consultation), £25.</P>
    <P>Other elements of the Service £35, making a total (including VAT at 12.5 per cent) of £60.</P>

      <P>Under the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy, the arrangements for the arable sector include provisions for payment of area compensation for maize grown for silage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of establishing the rate of compensation, member states are authorised to apply a yield for maize silage equivalent to the yield for other <Col N="2117" /> feed cereals.  In that case, compensation is limited to the national area under maize silage in the years 1989, 1990 and 1991 i.e. the base area.</P>
    <P>If the total area for which compensation is claimed exceeds the base area then the aidable area is reduced proportionately for each producer.</P>
    <P>Maize silage is not a traditional crop in Ireland, and since production during the base years was minimal, this country is not expected to benefit from its inclusion in the new support regime.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission has not yet published the regional yield plans submitted by member states and in the circumstances it is not possible to make a <Col N="2118" /> definitive assessment of the relative benefits for Ireland as compared to other member states.  However, it is obvious that, in general, support for maize silage will largely benefit traditional production regions of the community.</P>

      <P>When the Regulation governing this particular measure was last before the EC Council for amendment, Ireland pressed to have the labour requirement reduced from one man work unit to 0.5 of a man work unit.  The request was not accepted by the Council.  The Council, however, agreed that future applicants would have up to two years within which to satisfy the labour requirement.  It was also agreed that part-time farmers would qualify for the premium on becoming full-time farmers.  These amendments &mdash; which are now in operation here &mdash; should enable the benefits of the scheme to be extended to a greater number of young farmers.</P>

      <P>At the conclusion of the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations, my Department conducted an analysis of the economic implications of the outcome.  It concluded that combining the effect of reduced value of output, savings in input costs and increased subsidies due to compensation measures, the net effect of the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement &mdash; in the first year of its full implementation following the transition period as compared <Col N="2124" /> to 1991 &mdash; would be an increase in aggregate farm income, in nominal terms, of £97 million.</P>
      <P>This result was based on a static analysis, which did not take account of changes in efficiency levels or adjustments which farmers might undertake in response to the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement.</P>
      <P>The analysis showed that the combined effect of price cuts, additional compensation and savings on inputs meant that the dairy and beef sectors showed a substantial net gain, whereas for cereals, sheep, pigmeat and poultry the net effect of the various factors was about neutral.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1992 provides for the assessment as means for Unemployment Assistance (UA) purposes of earnings from insurable employment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this change is to ensure that there is a consistent approach in the assessment of earnings by treating employees and the self-employed in a similar way.  In the case of the self-employed, their income has always been assessed in full and deducted from the basic UA in determining their entitlement. Assessing income from insurable employment in broadly the same way is in line with the overall objective of removing anomalies and reducing the complexity of the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>In implementing the new arrangements, I am conscious of the need to maintain some financial incentive for unemployed people to take up occasional employment where the opportunity arises.  Under present arrangements, there is, in respect of each week, in addition to a disregard to the equivalent of the person's appropriate daily rate of UA for each day worked, an additional disregard to £10.  For example, a married man with three children working a three day week whose maximum weekly UA rate would be £149 would have a disregard of £74.50 (£64.50 plus £10).  The balance of his earnings would then be assessed as means in determining the rate of Unemployment Assistance payable for days of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the present arrangements under review and will be examining the possibility of giving greater incentives with the Social Welfare system for unemployed people to take up work.</P>

      <P>A United Kingdom retirement pensioner may qualify for a Fuel Allowance on the same conditions as apply to other pensioners.  One of these conditions is that the person and members of their household have a combined income of not more than £5 a week above the appropriate maximum Irish Contributory Pension rate.</P>
      <P>For means assessment purposes, the Sterling/Punt exchange rate used is the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of the previous quarter.  The Sterling/Punt exchange rate currently in use by my Department represents the average of the daily Sterling/Punt exchange rates for the month of July 1992.  The rate to be used for new claims in the first quarter of 1993 will be the average of exchange rates prevailing in the month of October 1992.</P>
      <P>It is not clear if the current exchange rates between sterling and the Irish Punt are a temporary phenomena or are likely to continue in the medium to long term.</P>
      <P>The matter in so far as it pertains to Social Welfare payments, including our methodology in calculating the average exchange rate, is being kept under review.</P>
      <P>An application form for a fuel allowance will be forwarded to the person in question who should forward it on completion, to the Pension Services Office, College Road, in Sligo where his application will be considered.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare recipients who have a special dietary requirement arising from a health condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need may qualify for an additional payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  Entitlement to payment is determined by the relevant Health Board.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance and is also in receipt of a diet supplement. It is understood from the Eastern Health Board that the claimant was recently advised, on the basis of medical certification to follow a new diet, the cost of which was less than the original diet.  As a result the Eastern Health Board was obliged to re-calculate and reduce the amount of her diet supplement based on the cost of the new diet.</P>
