      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a Notice of Motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Richard Bruton. I call on Deputy Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to raise the urgent and important matter of the dismissal of the chairman of Telecom Éireann.  I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, in assessing this application, to bear in mind that it would be far preferable to have a debate under Standing Order 30 than a debate that would be subject to a time limit.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 13, 7, 24, 14, 8 and 9.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) Business shall be interrupted at 11 p.m.; (2) Nos. 13, 7, 24, and 14 shall be decided without debate; (3) statements on Telecom Éireann shall be made at the conclusion of Question Time and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statement of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Parties shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and (ii) the Minister shall be called upon to make a statement in reply not exceeding five minutes; (4) the Minister or Minister of State at the Department of Education shall be called upon not later than 6.30 p.m. to reply to the debate on the Second Stage of No. 8 and the proceedings shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 6.45 p.m.; (5) the proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 8, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Education; (6) Private Members' Business shall be No. 42, motion No. 43, the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. and Members shall be called in the following sequence at the following times: Fine Gael, 7 p.m.; Government, 7.20 p.m.; Labour, 7.40 p.m.; Government, 8 p.m. and Fine Gael 8.15 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to No. 13, while I have no objection to the motion &mdash; in fact, I strongly support it &mdash; may I suggest to the Taoiseach that we should be consistent as regards the procedures followed <Col N="283" /> in this House with regard to the reception line for the President?  It would be very foolish not to accommodate the Leader of the Democratic Left given that he has the same number of Deputies in his party as the Leader of the Progressive Democrats.  We should be more consistent about how we do our business in this House.  If possible, this should be corrected before tomorrow afternoon.</P>

      <P>On item 24&mdash;the motion for Financial Resolution re the Special Committee on the Roads Bill, 1991 &mdash; I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is no proper provision for Independent Deputies to participate in the proceedings of these special committees.  I should like my objection to be noted.</P>

      <P>In regard to item 13, I thank Deputy Spring for having raised the matter in the manner in which he has done so.  May I inquire, Sir, whether you have received correspondence from me seeking a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at which this matter should be addressed and resolved before tomorrow?</P>

Are the proposals for dealing with statements on Telecom Éireann agreed?  Agreed.  May I ask whether the proposals for dealing with Second Stage of item No. 8 are agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with the Committee and remaining Stages of item No. 8 agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to divide the House on this matter but I am unhappy that the number of Members who will be able to speak on the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill, 1992 will be quite limited.  It is quite an important and welcome Bill.  I know that many Members would wish to have had an opportunity of speaking on the contentious issue of higher education grants.  It is regrettable that the time available is limited at all, in particular, as limited as it is in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has made a number of statements in recent weeks which have created the impression that the Government are contemplating measures which would severely curtail social welfare entitlements. Can the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that no announcements in regard to these matters will be made during the summer recess, that any announcement of Government policy on this matter will be made in the House when the House is in session, when Ministers <Col N="285" /> can be questioned as to their intentions?</P>

      <P>The Dáil proposes to rise for the summer recess on Friday. Would the Taoiseach inform us of the date it is expected we will resume?  Can he indicate when it is intended to publish the legislative programme for the next session?  Will the report of the Government sub-committee on travel and information be published during the summer? Furthermore, would he say whether that report will give rise to legislation and, if so, whether it will be given priority?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter part of the Deputy's question, I might remind him that there is a question on the Order Paper today, No. 11, in the name of Deputy Spring, about that matter.  The date for resumption after the summer recess will be announced, as appropriate, on the last sitting day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I beg your indulgence for one minute, Sir?  I noticed that yesterday the Minister for Labour met the unions involved in Waterford Glass and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will meet management today. While we all welcome those actions, at this point the position is so serious it requires a meeting between the Taoiseach and the board of Waterford Glass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given Deputy Deasy some latitude.  I will go further and tell him that I will facilitate him during the week in raising that matter properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach to meet the board of Waterford Glass, the Tony O'Reillys, the people who really matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be the last chance I will have to say it.  I ask, in all sincerity, whether the Taoiseach and relevant Ministers will meet the board of Waterford Glass because, with all due respect, the management are merely intermediaries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach inform the House whether he has been made aware by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications of the correspondence received from the Confederation of Irish Industry seeking all-party support &mdash; which I believe exists in this House &mdash; for short legislation to lift the capping in RTE?  Would he say whether it is intended to introduce that legislation before the House rises for the summer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has legislation been promised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with due respect, the Minister has promised reforming legislation in this area, an aspect of which clearly is the capping arrangements.  My question was whether the Government intend responding to the Confederation of Irish Industry, so that we could move before the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give the House an approximate indication of when it is intended to introduce the legislation to implement EC Directive 84/253, dealing with the qualifications and independence of auditors, a Directive which should have been implemented by 1 January <Col N="287" /> 1990 and which was promised in this House on 1 July?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the matter investigated and will report to the Deputy today or tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach clarify his position in relation to legislation for persons with a disability?  He indicated on the Order of Business that if he was not satisfied with job opportunities for persons with a disability he would introduce such legislation.  Since it has been promised in that fashion on the Order of Business, may I ask him what process he has put in place to assess this issue and to report on it to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not promised legislation. I said we will include such people in our monitoring arrangements and will do everything we can to endeavour to improve opportunities for the disabled throughout the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the last sitting week could the Taoiseach indicate whether the White Paper on Marital Breakdown will be published during the summer recess or shall we have to await its publication until September or October next?  In addition, can he inform the House what is the present state of the joint ownership of the family home legislation which people have been awaiting for a long time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that this is the last week of this session.  Every effort will be made to finalise the White Paper on Marital Breakdown which will be published as soon as possible.  The legislation on joint home ownership is being accelerated in an endeavour to have it published as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which questions were answered by the <Col N="288" /> Minister for Energy he indicated he was preparing legislation to deal with subsidiary companies of the semi-State bodies under his control.  Would the Minister say at what stage of preparation is this legislation?  I know it is a fairly detailed departmental matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister for Energy has engaged the services of a consultancy group to advise him on the best structures.  I assume he will not be introducing any Bill or any changes whatsoever until he will have received the report of that consultancy group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different matters involved, one is the restructuring of the ESB, the other is in regard to subsidiary companies, not merely of the ESB but of Bord Gáis and others.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would report back to me at some stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government decided to discuss the serious problem within the car hire business?  Will the Taoiseach say whether the Government will advance some proposals to deal with the matter before the tourist industry falls around the ears of the Minister, or is she too busy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There are six months remaining and there has been no indication from the Government as to what plans, if any, have been put in place to <Col N="289" /> replace what obtains at present and the enormous implications for this country in relation to the opening of frontiers and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach earlier about social welfare entitlements. Would he say whether the Government have any plans for further social welfare legislation this year?  Second, would the Taoiseach say when the legislation promised on 12 May to comprehensively modernise and consolidate the law on waste disposal &mdash; which is quite important in the light of commitments given by the Government at the Rio de Janeiro Summit &mdash; will be introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A general scheme is being prepared in relation to the latter part of the Deputy's question.  In relation to the first part of his question, I can assure the Deputy and the House that any speculation about social welfare benefits being taken away, reduced, or otherwise, is pure speculation.  There is no basis or foundation for it.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 and 1978, so that a number of new and significant provisions concerning, in the main, mature students, can be made in the higher education grants scheme for 1992 and subsequent years.  The higher education <Col N="292" /> grants scheme is the scheme under which the local authorities pay grants to eligible students attending full-time courses in universities and other approved third level institutions.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendments covered by the Bill are that: (i) the income eligibility of mature persons, who are not dependent on their parents, would be assessed by reference to their and, where appropriate, that of their spouses' incomes; (ii) mature students who secure a place in a third level institution would be recognised as satisfying the academic attainment requirements for the award of a grant and (iii) other school terminal examinations, such as the general certificate of education of Northern Ireland, would be accepted in lieu of the leaving certificate examination for the award of grants.</P>
    <P>In accordance with standard practice, these amendments are to come into effect as and from the 1992 higher education grants scheme for students entering approved third level institutions in 1992 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>I wish to state at the outset, in relation to access to third level education for mature students, that facilitating the return of mature students to formal education &mdash; including third level education &mdash; has a very definite emphasis in the Green Paper which has been published recently.  This follows the broad statement of education policy in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which identified the facilitating of mature students in upgrading their education or training levels within the education system as a key policy objective. There are currently about 1,600 mature students enrolled in full-time courses of third level education &mdash; about 850 in the vocational education committee colleges sector and the balance of 750 in the Higher Education Authority sector.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate with any certainty how many mature students will qualify for grants under the new scheme, but firm data should be available after the first year of operation of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme <Col N="293" /> was introduced in 1968, almost a quarter of a century ago, following the enactment of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.  It is worthwhile and appropriate at this juncture to reflect on how the numbers of students in, and the public funding of, third level education have changed in the intervening 25 years or so.  Numbers in third level education have expanded rapidly over the last quarter of a century, from 21,000 in 1965 to almost 70,000 in 1990-91, increasing in 1991-92 to about 75,000.</P>
    <P>Total public expenditure on education in 1992 amounts to £1.6 billion, representing almost 20 per cent of total Government expenditure and almost 6 per cent of GDP.  This represents a substantial increase in allocation of available resources to education in comparison with 1965, when the corresponding figures were 13.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively.  In 1992 third level education accounts for 22 per cent of expenditure compared to 8 per cent in 1966.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the total enrolment in third level education at present is 75,000. A student intake of almost 26,000 in 1991-92 represents a participation rate of 40 per cent of the age-group &mdash; compared to 20 per cent in 1980.  A further increase in student places is planned over the next four to five years which will bring the participation rate up to about 45 per cent of the age group.  In a period of not less than ten years there will have been an increase of 34,000 students in third level education &mdash; a staggering increase of 60 per cent which reflects continuing Government commitment to providing additional third level student places, as well as improving access to higher education.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out on another occasion that despite the explosion in numbers of students at third level more than half of all students at present in third level colleges receive grant assistance of one type or another &mdash; higher education grants, ESF grants and vocational education committee scholarships, etc.</P>
    <P>The total student support for fees and maintenance provided by the State is about £72 million.  The average support <Col N="294" /> per student benefiting under the various grants schemes is £1,900.</P>
    <P>Members of this House will be aware that the local authorities are the bodies statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme.  Grants awarded under the scheme have, of course, always been means tested.  Each year my Department prepare and issue a specimen scheme for the guidance of local authorities and make recoupment to them in respect of expenditure by them on grants awarded under the scheme.  Each local authority make a new scheme for each year and under the existing legislation this has to be submitted to the Minister for approval.  The scheme itself is quite complex because of developments in third level education, social changes and related improvements and amendments to the scheme over the years.  I would like to outline briefly a number of the key changes made in the scheme since its introduction in 1968.</P>
    <P>In 1972-73, grants were divided into separate fee and maintenance elements for the first time to replace the inclusive grants system which had applied since 1968.  In 1973-74, four grade Cs in any four subjects of the leaving certificate examination were accepted, in place of in four matriculation subjects as had been the case.</P>
    <P>In 1974-75, grants became tenable at regional technical colleges for the first time.  During the seventies and eighties generally, the means test income limits and fee maintenance grants were revised periodically.  It will be recalled that this was a period of high inflation which eroded income limits and the real value of grants.  In 1982-83, the Poor Law Valuation system was found unconstitutional. New means testing arrangements were introduced for farmers and the self-employed generally.</P>
    <P>In 1983-84, special provision was made to enable grant-holders to pursue courses in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In 1985-86, tapering of lecture fee grants was introduced as a result of more gradual tapering of eligibility limits.  Up until the 1985 scheme there was no provision <Col N="295" /> for awarding less than the full fee. Grants also became tenable in colleges of education.  In 1986-87 and subsequent years, income limits and maintenance grants were index-linked, i.e. increased in line with increases in the consumer price index.  The practice has been to increase fee grants in line with increases in third level fees generally.</P>
    <P>In 1990-91 and subsequent years, the requirement of four higher level leaving certificate grade Cs was reduced to two grade Cs in higher level papers.</P>
    <P>I will deal shortly with the major new improvements to be introduced in 1992.</P>
    <P>I now come to a very important point in the context of the amendments proposed in this Bill &mdash; the question of exactly what group of students is to benefit from an improvement in the terms of the grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the constraints on Exchequer resources, it has only been possible in years when there has been an improvement in the conditions for qualifying for grants under the higher education grants scheme to introduce and fund the improvement with effect from the scheme of the year in question.  In fact this has always been the position since the scheme was first introduced in 1968 and is therefore in the nature of a general principal.  Thus, when, for example, it was decided in 1990 to reduce the requirement of four Cs in leaving certificate higher level papers to two Cs in higher level papers, that improvement applied only in respect of persons entering third level and qualifying for grants under the scheme for 1990 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The background to this Bill is that following on proposals contained in both the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Joint Programme for Government, the higher education grants scheme was re-examined in a number of key areas and the Government sanctioned a range of improvements.  In accordance with the standard procedures those improvements will take effect in the schemes for 1992 and subsequent years in <Col N="296" /> respect of new entrants to third level education in 1992 or subsequently.</P>
    <P>The principal improvements under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as already announced are: (a) the income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education; (b) income eligibility will be assessed on current income and income limits in the year of entry into third level rather than as heretofore, on the income limits in the year in which the student sat the Leaving Certificate; (c) mature students who secure a place in a third level institution will automatically be considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant; (d) mature students who are not dependent on their parents may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes &mdash; and, if applicable, their spouses' incomes &mdash; rather than on their parents' income which has been the case up to now and (e) lone parents welfare payments under the lone parents allowance scheme will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility.</P>
    <P>Arising also from the proposals in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Joint Programme for Government, a working group in my Department have carried out a review of the criteria for eligibility for third level student grants with a view to achieving greater equity and transparency.  Following this detailed review the Minister for Education yesterday announced new income assessment procedures together with a substantial increase in income eligibility limits with effect from the 1992-93 academic year.</P>
    <P>The increases in the income limits are very substantial and will be of significant benefit to lower and middle-income families who have been experiencing difficulties in sending their children to third level education.</P>
    <P>For instance, under the new arrangement now being announced by the Minister, a family with anything from one to three children will qualify for full fee and full maintenance grants on an income of £15,000.  This represents a dramatic <Col N="297" /> increase on the present income limit of £10,787 &mdash; an increase of over £4,200 or 40 per cent.  This same family will be eligible for a full fee grant with an income of up to £18,000 and a 50 per cent fee grant up to an income of £19,000.</P>
    <P>As well as this, it is important to note, as already mentioned, that these income limits will be increased by a further £2,000 in respect of every child, after the first child, attending third level education, as announced earlier this year.</P>
    <P>It was because of his concern about the families in these income groups, and who are now catered for in the new income limits, that the Minister announced earlier this year that he was carrying out this radical and fundamental review of third level student grants.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, was also anxious to see that greater equity, fairness and openness be introduced into the system of means testing for student support and in the allocation of resources for students and their families.</P>
    <P>Taken in conjunction with the package of improvements announced earlier this year &mdash; all of which will come into effect for the 1992-93 academic year &mdash; this announcement represents the most radical and far-reaching set of reforms in student support since the schemes were introduced in the late sixties.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has already pointed out, the introduction of means testing of the maintenance element of ESF Grants for students commencing in 1992-93, has to be seen in the context of this wide-ranging programme of improvements and in the wider context of achieving more places for more and more students in third level education within the scope of the funds available and a more equitable distribution of students from lower income groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister reiterated that the means testing for ESF courses will be confined to the maintenance element for students commencing in 1992.  All students on ESF courses will continue to receive free tuition.</P>
    <P>In introducing this range of improvements, the Minister is also determined to ensure that a greater degree of fairness <Col N="298" /> and rigour is introduced in the assessment of income and in ensuring a full return of income from all applicants.  This approach is motivated by a wish to ensure that there is greater equity and fair-play for everyone and he is anxious that the more direct involvement of the Revenue Commissioners in this important aspect of the schemes will make a significant contribution to achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that this announcement will be widely welcomed especially by lower and middle-income families and PAYE workers.  This package represents an unprecedented leap forward in the whole area of student support and provides a major boost to thousands of students and families throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes minor amending legislation to give effect to the amendments at (c) and (d) relating to mature students so that the grants schemes for 1992 and thereafter can be appropriately amended and grants paid to mature students on the new basis from the 1992-93 academic year.  The other improvements mentioned will be taken care of in the context of the 1992 higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity, in section 4 of the Bill, of amending section 2 (i) (a) of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, to permit the acceptance of other school terminal examinations in place of the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>I now propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to outline to the House the provisions of the Bill as presented.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo;, which is referred to in the Bill, as the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants), Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends section 1 of the Act of 1968 (as amended by section 1 of the Act of 1978) by inserting definitions of &ldquo;mature students&rdquo; and &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.  The section, in providing for a minimum age of 23 years for mature students, takes account of current admission requirements of approved institutions, and provides the facility for the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister <Col N="299" /> for Finance to vary that age by making regulations.  The making of such regulations is dealt with in section 6.  The definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in section 2 includes either person of a married couple living together and also includes a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as husband and wife and is identical to the same definition in social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 2 of the Act of 1968 and provides for local authorities to award grants to mature students who do not qualify for grants under the existing arrangements and, in the case of those who are not dependent on their parents, to assess means by reference to their own income, if any, and that of their spouses &mdash; as defined &mdash; if applicable.</P>
    <P>Mature students who are dependent on their parents will be assessed by reference to their own income, if any, and that of their parents in accordance with the general practice for higher education grants.  Section 3 also provides that mature students must comply with such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Minister.  A similar provision exists in relation to higher education grants generally in subsection 2 (1) (d) of the Act of 1968.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will enable, <i>inter alia,</i> a suitable provision to be included in the higher education grants scheme for 1992 and subsequent years deeming mature students to have met the academic requirements for grants.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 2 of the Act of 1968 to permit the acceptance of other school terminal examinations in place of the leaving certificate examination.  This section is not geared towards mature students <i>per se.</i> Rather the purpose of the amendment is to permit local authorities to consider a small number of Irish nationals who are resident in Border areas in the State but who are ineligible for a grant because they attend second level schools in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The amended provision would enable the general certificate of education of Northern Ireland to be considered for grants purposes.  It would also permit the <Col N="300" /> acceptance of school leaving examinations from the EC, generally at a later stage, should such a need arise.</P>
    <P>Section 5(1) stipulates that the amended provisions relating to mature students &ldquo;shall apply to mature students who have secured places to commence courses in approved institutions in the year 1992 or subsequent years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) stipulates that the amended provision relating to school terminal examinations outside the State shall apply to the higher education grants scheme for 1992 and subsequent years. As regards section 5, as I stated earlier, there is a general principle involved in making amendments and improvements in the higher education grants scheme effective only as and from the higher education grants scheme for 1992 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends the Act of 1968 and provides for regulations made under the Act to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 7 is a standard provision relating to short title construction and collective citation.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in that it will put in place a structure for the award of higher education grants to mature students.  This structure which was in the pipeline for a considerable period, was one of the clearly stated promises in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I also welcome the Bill in that it responds positively and in large part, although not fully, to the very strong arguments and submissions put very forcibly over a very considerable period by the Irish Mature Students' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister should spoil the general welcome, acclaim and goodwill for this Bill, which has been a long time coming, so to speak, and has been eagerly awaited, eagerly sought, and the thrust of which is basically right, by specifically excluding from it the 350 existing mature students.  Even though these people meet all the criteria age-wise, qualification-wise and income-wise, they are excluded because they happen <Col N="301" /> to be in the right place at the wrong time; they are excluded because they are already in college and have commenced their courses of study.</P>
    <P>The irony and injustice of this is that these are the very people who assembled all of the arguments, mounted a very effective lobby and convinced the decision-makers of the merits of a proper grant scheme for mature students, which the Minister is proposing in this Bill. They are the one group who are precluded from qualifying because of the way in which section 5 (1) is drafted. I believe any impartial observer would acknowledge that it is most unfair that advocates of their own cause should be eliminated in this fashion.  I put it to the Minister that he should not spoil the ship for the sake of a ha'p'worth of tar; he should not spoil the occasion for the sake of a once off payment of £1 million, which is what it would cost to include these 350 students and thereby enable them to qualify.  The bulk of these 350 students undertook their studies on the basis of what they regarded as the sure and safe commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>It was clear from that document that grants for mature students would be introduced, even before the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was published the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, made reference to it in considerable detail.  The injustice and inconsistency of what the Minister is now doing in deliberately sidelining these 350 students is forcibly underlined when one considers that the European Social Fund grants which were extended to mature students on 1 January 1991 took effect immediately and were retrospective, thus enabling people already in the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges to qualify.  Why should the basic ground rules be changed here when we are introducing new and related changes in the higher education grants scheme for mature students in universities?</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment &mdash; I am sure other Opposition spokespersons have done the same &mdash; which proposes <Col N="302" /> that the scheme should be extended to include existing mature students.  I earnestly beseech the Minister in the interest of equity and fair play and in order to launch this scheme with the proper forward thrust which will ensure that it receives the goodwill of everybody, especially the people who have made their case so forcibly, to take this amendment on board.</P>
    <P>When one considers that there are only 1,200 mature students one can see that the commitment to continuing education has been very weak indeed.  We have to laud those people who, on their own initiative and volition, have grasped the nettle, entered third level institutions and pursued courses from their own resources.  They have made many and major sacrifices in the process of doing this.  The higher education sector will have to display a much greater involvement in and evident commitment to continuing adult education and the education of mature students.  Given the pace of technological change a new balance will have to be struck between initial and continuing education.  This will have to be an absolute requirement in the future. If we are to give adult and continuing education its rightful place then new structures will have to be devised at institutional and college levels and clear and definite structures and policies will have to be formulated at national level.  The European Community will have to add its impetus to this by co-ordinating approaches and policies and promoting trans-national co-operation.</P>
    <P>Expert studies which have been carried out, particularly recent EC studies on current sectoral and regional skilled shortages, show that skilled shortages are a growing phenomenon in the Community. Even during periods of ongoing, rising unemployment, such as we have at present, skilled shortages occur and increase because of the vast rate of job losses.</P>
    <P>If those whose skills are becoming obsolete are not to be permanently left behind on the European dole queue a well-structured system of professional and vocational re-training will have to be <Col N="303" /> put in place.  We will have to face the fact that the days of having one job for life, over a lifespan of 40 years, are well nigh past.  It could happen that in the normal workspan of 40 years one might have to change jobs on three or four occasions, indeed every ten years.  This might not necessarily be a bad thing but we must be prepared for it, and that is where vocational training and re-training and emphasis on mature and adult education come into being.</P>
    <P>A recent IRDAC report entitled Skills Shortages in Europe states:</P>
    <P>The output of education and training systems (including in particular higher education) in terms of both quantity and quality of skills at all levels, is the prime determinant of a country's level of industrial productivity and hence, competitiveness.</P>
    <P>If this diagnosis is correct it is up to us to get our act together and to ensure that we have in place the higher education structures to equip all the members of our labour force, the older members as well as the young, with the new skills needed to meet the rapidly changing demands of European enterprises.</P>
    <P>There is a decline in the number of young people in member states &mdash; the demographic trend is very much downward &mdash; and the evidence suggests that the decline will continue at an accelerating rate.  Therefore industry will require more and more manpower.  One source of manpower must be the existing labour force, and we must focus more sharply on that area.  More than 80 per cent of the existing labour force will still be active by the end of the century.  Re-training, therefore, takes on a new urgency and skills and knowledge will have to be updated frequently.  Because of technological changes, industry and economic activity will be more and more knowledge based.</P>
    <P>We will have to seriously consider the extent to which higher education institutes fulfil their obligations.  They vary enormously from one member state to another.  For example, in some countries <Col N="304" /> there is a legally defined responsibility and requirement in respect of mature students, adult education and re-training. The inadequacy of the response of higher education institutes, particularly in this country, to continuing education is highlighted by the growth in recent years of private training.  There will have to be a major commitment by, and possibly a statutory obligation on the higher education colleges to address the whole area of continuing education, adult education and mature student education. Some tentative moves have been made but emphasis will have to be placed on bringing adult and mature student education centre stage in mainstream education.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the vocational education committees for providing night classes over the years and for bringing onstream a highly competent level of certification in relation to adult education.  I pay tribute also to the six Dublin Institute of Technology colleges which have provided many courses in terms of higher education.  However, we must ensure that the university sector, the revamped sector for which we legislated last week, the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges, meets the quite obvious challenges of the remaining years of the nineties and post-Maastricht 21st century Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on the very timely announcement made yesterday by the Minister for Education in relation to higher education grants.  Any change in the higher education grants structure is welcome, but I would like clarification about the mechanism that will be used to bring about these changes. Will they be brought about by way of legislation in this House or by way of ministerial order?  I acknowledge that the Minister has given a 50 per cent increase in the area, which will obviously have considerable Exchequer implications, but I am disappointed that he did not go the whole way and fundamentally reform the system.  The Minister announced not a reform of the system but an easing of the burden on certain middle income families.  If one trawled the administrative <Col N="305" /> jungles of this country for a system riddled with anomalies and inequities one would need to look no further than to the higher education grants scheme.  This scheme is manifestly unjust, and inherently wrong.  It does nothing to redress the genuine grievance of a huge sector, the middle income PAYE people, the new poor, the people who have been bearing a great burden over a considerable period of time.  The scheme is unjust in that it is based on gross income rather than on net income. It is based on a system that gives no cognisance to special factors such as illness in a family, day-to-day running costs and repayments on a mortgage or such essential items as a motor car.  Therefore, what we are doing here is not reforming the system but introducing a short term redress, a remedial measure.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would have issued to the people who last week received their &ldquo;change of mind&rdquo; slip a note reminding them that ESF grants would be means tested as and from next September.  He should have pointed out that there is now on the table a Green Paper on Education, a document that will open up discussion on every aspect of education, pre-school, primary school, second level, third level, the points system and particularly the higher education grants scheme, one of the most contentious areas of grievance for middle income families.  The Minister should seek submissions from the various interest groups, the parents, chambers of commerce, teachers' unions, students and the colleges who administer the schemes, who have a profile in relation to the calibre and quality of people attending and are aware of the many social anomalies that exist.</P>
    <P>Even though we may laud the merits of what was introduced yesterday amid a glare of publicity, irrespective of how we tamper with the threshold, at the end of the day despite the well intentioned measures the vast majority of teachers, engineers, gardaí, nurses, civil servants and journalists as well as politicians will not get a penny in grants to <Col N="306" /> send their sons and daughters to third level education.  The Minister is easing the burden slightly, he is not introducing the fundamental reform that is needed. What is needed is an in-depth examination of the whole system of third level grants, the package we are introducing today and the European Social Fund as it applies to Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and regional technical colleges as well as the university sector.  This should not be the type of so-called examination promised by the Minister in the House on 18 and 19 February when he said he would set up an interdepartmental group consisting of officials of his own Department and the Departments of Finance, Social Welfare and Health.  We do not know whether that body met or if they made recommendations. Were the recommendations not for public consumption?  Did they not produce what the Minister wanted?  We need an objective analysis in relation to third level grants.</P>
    <P>The NESC have the personnel and expertise to objectively analyse the good points and the bad points of higher education. The ESRI could also give an independent analysis or the Minister could select a group representing parents, unions, departmental officials, the IVEA and other higher education groups to give an analysis.  The Green Paper afforded an excellent opportunity for this.</P>
    <P>When we examine who will benefit from this legislation, we will find that the vast majority of the huge dominant PAYE sector will not qualify.  A person on an income of £19,000 per annum and a mortgage of £5,000 per annum would have to borrow £5,000 per annum over a four year period in order to send a son or daughter through third level education. Every penny must be paid back.  A family will literally have to put life on hold. Everything will have to be subjugated to the primary purpose of getting a son or daughter through third level education. The increases in the thresholds will only give marginal relief to a person on £19,000 with two or three children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the relief but I am disappointed that the Minister did <Col N="307" /> not avail of a golden opportunity to carry out a fundamental study of the system. If the Minister had done that his name would be emblazoned on the history of Irish education.  There are thousands of middle income people reading the headlines of the newspaper today who are taking this at face value but when they get down to examining the small print they will discover that it simply does not apply to them.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Minister to take on board one of the suggestions we have been making repeatedly, and commission a competent independent analysis of the third level grant system.  Despite the changes the system is fundamentally flawed, inherently unjust and extremely discriminating against a huge sector of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in as much as it is progressive and in as much as it enables local authorities to award third level grants to mature students.  I welcome the fact that terminal examinations at second level from outside the State can now be accepted in place of the leaving certificate.  I gather that the Minister initially sees this as something which will apply to a small number of students in Border counties but which can be extended to EC countries.  That is progressive in its way.  Also when mature students obtain a place they will automatically be seen to have reached the academic qualifications.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) creates a problem. The Minister has adopted a very niggardly approach here.  To illustrate what I mean I can do no better than to read from a letter which I received from a mature student this morning.  It underlines the whole point very effectively.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am writing to you in connection with the proposed changes to the higher education grants scheme which is being debated in the Dáil on Tuesday 7 July next.  This scheme includes a provision to fund mature students on a par with school leavers, based on their own incomes and on confirmation <Col N="308" /> of their being accepted into college. These changes were publicised in 1991 and I applied for and was granted a place in Trinity College in that year.  I accepted in anticipation of the grant becoming available in my second year in College.</P>
    <P>I was therefore pleased with the announcements that the grant was due to be introduced.  In all the initial publicity for the proposals the only requirement for mature students was that they secured a place in a college and fulfil means test requirements. However the Bill proposes a scheme which will only apply to new entrants to college.  Those already in college and who otherwise met the requirements will not qualify.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Minister for Education in this regard and he has informed me that the reason for this new requirement is that sufficient funding has not been made available from the Department of Finance to fully implement the scheme, that is to fund all those mature students currently in college.  The estimated cost of funding all mature sudents in the country under the terms of the scheme is approximately three quarters of a million pounds.  However not all students would qualify under a means test and the actual amount which would be paid out would, it is suggested, be substantially less than this figure.  Such sums are a negligible part of government budgets and I strongly feel that the commitments to a &ldquo;fair and equitable education system&rdquo;, outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> demands that such sums as are required are made available.</P>
    <P>The grant can make a real difference to whether I can remain in college to complete my degree.  If I was forced to leave the course through financial hardship I would more than likely be forced to collect unemployment benefit. This would result in a situation whereby I would cost the state substantially more than the cost of the <Col N="309" /> higher education grant, and the state would gain nothing from this outlay. The benefits to completing a degree course for me personally and for the state are obvious.  Many mature students are in this position.  However this is particularly true of those of us who entered college last year in anticipation of the introduction of the grant scheme for mature students.</P>
    <P>I support the sentiments expressed in that letter.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> where the introduction of grants for mature students was announced there is no reference to it applying only to those students who would gain places in the forthcoming academic year.  The Explanatory Memorandum, section 6, says:</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the amendments to the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, to apply in respect of both the Higher Education Grants Scheme and students who secure places in approved institutions for 1992 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>I will grant that the opposite is stated in the Bill but would the Minister not agree that this section of the Explanatory Memorandum is somewhat misleading?  The Minister in his speech today in somewhat similar terminology brings in the word &ldquo;commerce&rdquo;.  I will certainly put down an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage so that those students who are already in the system will benefit from the introduction of grants to mature students.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he is breaking faith with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a document proposed by all social partners which was subsequently debated and approved in this House.  It is utterly wrong in terms of the students' expectations &mdash; and I read out one student's letter here in the House &mdash; that provision is not being made for students already in the system.  The Irish Mature Students Association estimate that 350 students who are already in the system would benefit if the provisions applied to this group.  As quite a small <Col N="310" /> amount of money is involved, it is niggardly that this group are not catered for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Third level grants have been much in the news since the Minister announced yesterday a substantial increase in the income level eligibility for grants.  I welcome this progressive move, and it would be dishonest of me not to say otherwise, but essentially it is inconsistent and illogical that the income limits are based on gross rather than net income.  I have stated this previously and I wish to stress the point.  We are highly taxed and gross income bears little relationship to take home pay.  I believe the first change the Government should have introduced is to use the net income when determining eligibility for grants.  Although the changes are very welcome, they do not go far enough.</P>
    <P>A number of factors come into play in ensuring universal equality of access to education.  As I have often stated, socio-economic factors are not the only bar to equality of access, geographical factors also come into play.  While university fees will be increased by 20 per cent in some instances, the maintenance grant is not being increased.  Therefore the amount of money a student will receive towards his or her lodgings and upkeep while at university is not being increased.  This is absolutely ridiculous. Fees are being increased way beyond the level of inflation while at the same time the maintenance portion of the grant remains at a standstill.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with second chance education. However, while I welcome that, I question the Government's strategy for this sector.  The Government's decision to subject the maintenance element of the ESF grant to a means test of parents' income will undoubtedly have two effects: first, many students will not now have the benefit of a third level education because of this decision &mdash; and I again appeal to the Government to pull back from it &mdash; and, second, the student who on balance would pursue a certificate and a diploma course at an regional technical college if ESF funding were available for the maintenance portion will now opt for <Col N="311" /> a university education because on balance this is the more favourable prospect.</P>
    <P>Despite what was said during the debate on the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1992, I believe the Department of Education desire students to go to universities and this will become more apparent as demographic factors impact on student numbers.  I believe this will lead to the democratically based third level institutions in the regions being undermined.  I do not believe that the real strategy behind the Government's decision to means test the maintenance portion of the ESF grant is to bring about greater equality.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned another improvement in the higher education grant scheme.  Eligibility for grants will be assessed on current income in the year of entry to third level education rather than, as heretofore, on the income level in the year the student sat the leaving certificate.  However if we question whether a student who did not qualify for either the fees or maintenance portion of a higher education grant because of parental income levels last year but would qualify under the increased income level, we find out that this student will not benefit.  Therefore students who entered third level education last year will not benefit from the changes the Minister announced yesterday.  The Minister was remiss in not pointing this out.  Whereas we got a good deal of information, we did not get the whole story. From what the Minister said in the Chamber today, students who are already in the system will not benefit next September from the increase in income limits for third level grants.  The Minister should state clearly and unequivocally the down side of these welcome changes.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with the pilot scheme to allow those in receipt of social welfare to take up a college place.  Last year pilot schemes were introduced so that people could retain their social welfare benefit by way of grant while attending third level institutions.  I ask the Minister to inform the House about these pilot schemes and state whether it is <Col N="312" /> intended to extend this provision in the coming year so that a greater number can avail of it?  Some students still will not qualify as mature students and if they do not benefit from the retention of a social welfare payment they will not have the wherewithal to pursue courses.  That area needs to be examined and I should like the Minister to deal with it in his response today.</P>
    <P>Last February, Minister Davern announced that an interdepartmental group were being set up to examine the whole issue of third level grant qualification in order that a more equitable system could be provided.  I recall the Minister indicating in reply to a Dáil question asked earlier in the year that he hoped that the interdepartmental group would report by 1 September.  More recently, he indicated that the report might be made sooner than that.  It seems that this issue might be similar to that of the Green Paper on Education and the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill in that moves are made and decisions taken before production of the final report.  It would have been better for students attending third level courses had the Minister speeded up the publication of the report of the interdepartmental group so that decisions of a much more comprehensive and wide-ranging form than those we have now could be made after consideration of that report.  It is quite possible that the income limits announced yesterday could in some way or another reflect an interim, informal report.</P>
    <P>I believe that there would not be a Deputy in the House who would not say, if asked, that the present system is far from equitable.  In recent days both the Minister and the Minister of State have pointed to a general perception among the public that the PAYE sector is the most disadvantaged in terms of qualification for the grants.  There is absolutely no doubt about such a perception.</P>
    <P>I have been astounded by some of the comments I have heard from people who administer the grants.  I have a query that I should like the Minister to answer.  If <Col N="313" /> business accounts presented with an application for a third level grant contain an item for &ldquo;drawings&rdquo; without there being any explanation of what the drawings were for, must a local authority accept that that bald figure is not to be taken into consideration when assessing the income of the household concerned? If the item &ldquo;drawings&rdquo; appears in a set of accounts money must be going out of a business for some purpose.  My information is &mdash; and I wish to check it out here today &mdash; that a local authority do not seek and are not directed to seek an explanation of what happened to that amount, where it went and what purpose it served.  Every Deputy knows that in some cases accounts that are presented along with an application for a third level grant, accounts that have been accepted by the Revenue Commissioners and are therefore legally presented to a local authority, certainly do not reflect the actual income of the applicant's parents. The revenue side of such applications needs to be re-examined.  It begs a question about the general effectiveness of the revenue and taxation system in the self-employed sector.  As I have often said, the PAYE worker is the prisoner of his or her P60.  A P60 is a very definite document in which figures are stated clearly and unequivocally and a decision on qualification for a grant follows from the figures provided.</P>
    <P>I point out to the Minister that there is a great deal of room for manoeuvre in business accounts and the accounts of the self-employed generally.  I could not blame those in the PAYE sector if they felt bitter about that.  Earlier, I alluded to the fact that Ireland is a highly taxed country and that assessment for qualification should be made on the amount of money that is taken out in a wage packet rather than on the notional figure of gross income.</P>
    <P>Each provision in the Bill could be criticised.  I have not done that.  I ask the Minister to correct the inequity in relation to people entering third level education as mature students who, because of the much-heralded <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i><Col N="314" /> commitments, expected that in the second year of their course they would qualify for a mature student's grant.  It would be fair to say that mature students who took university places had, in some cases anyway, budgeted to have sufficient funds to take them through to the end of their first year's education but expected to receive a grant in the second year. Their expectations were legitimate. Anyone who followed Government statements, who read the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and who was in touch with the issue &mdash; right up to the publication of the Bill &mdash; would have been justified in believing that he or she was entitled to the mature student's grant for the 1992-93 academic year.  In a most niggardly way, that expectation has been frustrated.  The measure is unfair and unjust and I call on the Minister to put the inequity to rights by the introduction of a suitable amendment of his own on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I warmly welcome this legislation.  It certainly represents progressive and very timely thinking as well as hope and a major breakthrough for people who want to avail of second-chance education, people who did not get a fair crack of the whip the first time around.  Many of those people were dealt with very unfairly within the formal education system, for one reason or another, and now, recognising their own talents and their own potential, want to avail of further formal education.  It is only fair that we should give recognition in law to the right and entitlement of such people to avail of third level education and that we should make grant provision for them so that they will be able to so do.  That is what this Bill does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill and the announcement made by the Minister yesterday in relation to eligibility limits for third level grants represent a major package of reform in education. They must be welcomed by all in the House and, I am glad to say, they have been welcomed by Members who have already spoken.  There are refinements that need to be made, but in fairness <Col N="315" /> it has to be acknowledged that the two measures represent a major breakthrough for people who in the past were dealt with shabbily and unfairly within the system and who can, in the future, look forward to more fair play and a better chance.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased about the announcement made by the Minister yesterday in relation to grant eligibility limits.  This was included in the joint Programme for Government agreed and produced by the two parties in this Coalition Government three years ago.  It was reinforced and restated during the review of that programme last November.  I am glad legislative proposals are before the House to enable this provision of the joint programme to be put in place.</P>
    <P>Taken in conjunction with yesterday's announcement we have grounds for optimism about third level education.  I am particularly pleased with the revised income eligibility limits the Minister announced yesterday.  It is well known that under the third level grant system, as it applied for more than 20 years, certain categories of students, and their parents, fared very badly, particularly children of PAYE workers &mdash; they fared worst.  I know a number of people, some of them relatives of mine, who had to go the the bank and mortgage their houses, especially those who had two or more students in college at the same time, to pay the tuition fees.  The sad irony was that, having assisted their children to get third level education, very often the children on completion of the course were forced to emigrate as they could not get jobs at home.  That has been a fact of Irish life in the last decade.  Parents went to enormous expense to put their children through third level education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision being made for all parents, particularly those who have more than one student at college at the same time.  This will make a difference for them.  It will be welcomed widely, certainly by parents who are in the PAYE category.  It has been galling for students who were not grant-aided to sit in lecture halls with grant-aided <Col N="316" /> students whose parents' means were above those of their parents.  There has been great inequity in the system.  I am glad measures are being proposed to introduce greater equity and transparency into it so that all students will get a fair deal.  All parents applying for grants will be subjected to some form of investigation and that will subject parents not in the PAYE system to the same investigation and scrutiny as applied to parents in the PAYE system.  That is only fair and just and is overdue.  The Minister is to be complimented for grasping that nettle because, inevitably, his action will make him unpopular in certain places. However, any right-minded person will compliment him.</P>
    <P>In regard to making better conditions for mature students and students who want to avail of second chance education this Bill is a major step in the right direction. There is a fundamental need in a rapidly changing society which sees economic and social changes, for second chance education among large sectors in our society.  It is only fair and proper that we enable so-called mature students to re-enter formal education, to update their skills and build up the self confidence they need to enable them to live in these challenging and confusing times. In this context I join in the appeal made today to the Minister to consider students already in the system.  Those students should be eligible for the new grants. Many of the mature students in college are married women and for one reason or another wanted to improve their skills, very often with a view to re-entering the workforce or, perhaps, entering the workforce for the first time.</P>
    <P>Very often they want to do voluntary work in a more structured way within the community, or want to obtain the parenting skills so badly needed to enable them raise their children in the very testing times in which we live.  The Minister should make the necessary changes to enable mature students in the system avail of the new scheme.  I understand the cost will be less than £1.5 million which is not a great deal of money in terms of the value of the investment by <Col N="317" /> people who attend these courses.  I acknowledge that money is scarce.</P>
    <P>Every day now greater demands are being made on parents and more will be made in the context of the Green Paper on Education.  We are calling on parents to play a stronger role in the management and administration of education, and rightly so.  It is about time parents were given the recognition that has been denied them for so long.  However, a number of parents are not in a position to play the role envisaged for them in that paper.  Some of them simply have not self-confidence and the only way to give them that and bring the aspiration of the Green Paper in this respect to reality is to enable them to avail of second chance education.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we put in place a system that will make parents aware of the effort being made under the judicial system to come to terms with the growing number of young people who are in trouble with the law.  Young people are being sucked into crime.  To enable parents play the role that will be demanded of them we have a duty to provide access to proper education on parenting and to give them the self-confidence to realise their own potential as individuals and to fulfil their role as parents which is extremely important.  We have to make provision for them now.  It is important that we discuss those matters in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Parenting is a very demanding and undervalued role in our society.  Parents have to be breadwinners, cooks, sources of encouragement and consolation, homework tutors, arbiters in childhood disputes, imparters of sex education, nurses, have calm heads in a crisis, housekeepers, financial controllers, enforcers of the family code of behaviour and sanctions for bad behaviour, monitors of a child's whereabouts, promoters of the family's religious or ethical standards, purchasers or advisers in relation to clothing, counsellors, career advisers and managers of their children's social life. Extraordinary demands are made on parents these days.  All too often parents are overwhelmed by the changes which have <Col N="318" /> taken place in every level of society, and in education since they were at school, a fact which must be acknowledged.  In that context, I am particularly pleased with the advances now being proposed to enable mature students &mdash; many of whom are parents &mdash; to come within the system. I praise the legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to third level grants in general, it is important that this Bill should pass through the House without undue delay because large numbers of persons, students or their parents, are at present making financial provision for young people whom, they hope, will enter third level education at the beginning of the next academic year in the autumn.  It is important that the relevant changes are communicated to parents, career guidance counsellors, prospective students and colleges with all due haste so that people will know where they stand in September.  One thing I can say with certainity in welcoming this Bill is that this is major and reforming legislation for which I commend the Minister.  I am enormously happy to offer my support and that of my party for this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that this Bill is before us because on the Order of Business last week I asked that it should be brought before the House before the summer recess so that its measures would be in place in time for the autumn and that any amendments which the Minister might be disposed to accept &mdash; or which he might introduce himself &mdash; would all be in place by October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the improvements announced over the last couple of days in relation to the higher education grants scheme.  Our systems for providing financial assistance to students are very scattered and in need of co-ordination and review.  All the reports which have been introduced over the years show that, with regard to participation in higher education, the better off you are the better the chance of such participation.  The poorer you are &mdash; and the poorer the family from which you come &mdash; the less likely you are to go to a university or a <Col N="319" /> third level college of education.  It is quite clear that there is a direct relationship between parental income and participation in higher education.  In that context, it is critically important &mdash; if we are to have any degree of equity with regard to participation in higher education &mdash; to have an adequate system of student support in place.  I welcome any moves in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister when introducing this Bill put it in context in regard to the overall situation in relation to student support. Three issues arise from the Minister's speech which need to be addressed: the first is the improvement in the means test limit for the higher education grants scheme which were announced yesterday and which are welcome; the second is the continuing insistence by the Government to means test the ESF grants and, third, in the form of this legislation the extension of the higher education grants scheme to mature students.</P>
    <P>I welcome yesterday's announcement that the means test limits for the higher education grants scheme is to be increased.  I agree with the comments made that the means test limit which applied up to now was ludicrously low and &mdash; in so far as the means test operates as an income test &mdash; is very seriously biased against the PAYE worker.  I agree with speakers who said that it is not fair to base this means test on gross income, on a system of income whereby the PAYE worker has to declare his or her entire income, whereas somebody in business can, through the submission of accounts and so on, perhaps disguise elements of income or wealth.  The means test, such as it is, is based solely on taxable income.</P>
    <P>Despite the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Education, there are still anomalies in the higher education grants system and, indeed, in the way in which the means test operates.  There are still many parents who will not qualify for a higher education grant even under the increased means test limit announced by the Minister.  The cut-off limit is £15,000 for parents with up to three children <Col N="320" /> which will qualify them for the maximum grant.  I have been looking through the State Directory to try to establish the categories of public service employees who will not qualify for a maximum grant and it makes interesting reading.  The following people do not qualify: a staff officer in the Civil Service with three children; equivalent grades in local authorities and health boards; teachers with three children will very probably not qualify for any grant.  A nurse, laboratory technician, a junior clerk in the Houses of the Oireachtas, a garda or a bank official will not qualify for the maximum grant.  These are the very people whose taxes are paying for the grant system in the first place, yet they will not benefit.  I welcome the improvements but they must be put in the context of an entire band of what is loosely termed &ldquo;middle income families&rdquo; whose taxes are paying for the entire education system.  It is not true that those at present excluded from the grants scheme are people on higher incomes. Any of the categories of employees which I listed could not be regarded as being on a high income.</P>
    <P>The other point which must be borne in mind relates to the level of the grant. The maximum level of grant works out at approximately £38 per week; full board in most of the town and cities in which universities, regional colleges and so on are located, works out at about £40, £45 or &mdash; in some cases &mdash; £50 per week. The maximum grant, therefore, is not sufficient to cover full board.  In self-catering accommodation the cost of a flat works out at about £25 or £30 per week, leaving about £8 to £10 per week for students, to feed and clothe themselves and to pay for books and other student materials.  By any reckoning even a student on the maximum grant still has to find support from some other source.  In some cases that will be in the form of parental support, but it is difficult to see how parents on the levels of income which would enable a student to qualify for a grant in the first place, could afford to support them.  At one time, this could be done through raising loans or through <Col N="321" /> some form of supplemental income but as a result of unemployment levels here and emigrants returning from abroad because they are unable to find employment, the opportunities for supplemental or seasonal earnings are now quite limited.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister's announcement yesterday was spoiled by his continuing refusal to reverse his predecessor's decision to means test the ESF grants.  The new means test limit for grants may reduce somewhat the numbers of future students who will be affected by the means testing of the ESF grants, but huge numbers of students, who would otherwise be able to participate in ESF-funded courses, will now be denied the opportunity to do so for financial reasons.  That will seriously restrict the opportunities for lower and middle income families to participate in higher education.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the comparison between the levels of participation in the universities which are operated under the higher education grants scheme and the levels of participation of various income groups in regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges where students are largely supported from ESF grants.  For example, the participation rate of children of manual workers in universities works out at under 14 per cent; in the regional technical colleges it is 31 per cent.  As against that, the proportion of participants in universities who come from professional backgrounds is 30 per cent, while in the regional technical colleges it is 12 per cent.  Any examination of those figures will show that the participation rates in the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges more accurately reflects the proportion of various categories of employment in society as a whole than does the participation rate in universities.  That is mainly due to the differing kinds of student support systems which apply in both types of colleges.  The means tested higher education grants system which applies to university-type courses has resulted in a lower participation by children <Col N="322" /> from lower and middle income families in universities than has been the case in the regional technical colleges where the ESF grants applied.  To means test the ESF grants would have the effect of limiting educational opportunities for students from lower income families.</P>
    <P>The Bill which proposes to extend higher education grants to mature students had its origins in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was signed early in 1991.  I welcomed subsequent statements by Ministers for Education that the grants scheme would be extended to mature students.  I welcome the fact that second chance education is being given this degree of formal recognition and support.  However, it is significant that Deputy Quill, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, indicated her concern in this area, that the extension of the grants scheme to mature students has been spoiled by the rather niggardly approach being taken by the Minister in not including those students who are currently in the system.  The Minister must address that anomaly if this Bill is to have the desired effect. Indeed, he must do so if next autumn this Bill is not to be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>The Irish Mature Students' Association, who have been lobbying for this measure for some time, in a letter from their spokesperson, Mr. Mike Egan, state:</P>
    <P>A recent national survey carried out by our Association indicates that only 350 of the 1,200 mature students currently in college would qualify for a grant.  These students are typically in the low income bracket and make considerable personal and family sacrifices in order to gain further education.  This anomaly &mdash; the exclusion of the current students from the remit of the Bill &mdash; will force mature students in financial hardship to drop out or defer from university.  These people will almost certainly end up claiming social payments.  This is cruelly ironic as many mature students accepted college places in good faith that they <Col N="323" /> would be covered by the grant proposals in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement. Furthermore students who joined last September were given verbal assurances by the Department of Education that they would be included in the scheme.  This apparently is not now the case.</P>
    <P>A similar point was made in a letter from the education officer of the Union of Students of Ireland which state that many mature students returned to college as a result of guarantees given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> published in January 1991 that grants for mature students would be introduced. I have had several letters from mature students currently in the system all of whom make the point that the reason they decided to return to college in the first place was on the promise that they would be covered by the higher education grants scheme.  They understood that they would not be covered by the higher education grants scheme last year and most of them made other financial arrangements while in college.  However, they did expect that when the legislation would be introduced &mdash; it had been promised that it would be introduced this year &mdash; that they would be covered by it.</P>
    <P>Many of those mature students went to college in the belief and on the assumption that the higher education grants scheme would be extended to them and that they would benefit from it.  Many of them were quite happy to make financial arrangements to cover themselves in the short term until the legislation was passed.  It is clear, from the correspondence and the telephone calls I have been getting over the past two weeks or so from mature students, that many of them who are currently attending courses will not be able to return to college next October if they are not covered by this Bill.  I have a letter here from a student in Trinity College which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> I accepted my place on the basis of the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> published in its final form in January 1991, to introduce grants for mature students... I funded my course last year by loans from the credit union and the bank, which have not been paid off at all.  A benefit do was held for me which raised £300 and my entire family donated what they could.  My mother is a widow on a pension.  None of this finance can be repeated this year... I will not be able to complete my course without this grant.  Last year was an immense strain... I have tried to raise sponsorship and I have not succeeded.</P>
    <P>This student will not be going back to Trinity College next October if she is not covered by the Bill before us.  I also received a similar letter to that which Deputy O'Shea put on the record and I have another letter here, which I will not delay the House by quoting but it makes the same point.  This concerns a single parent who went back to college and is repaying a loan at £12 a week from the £69 a week single parent's allowance.  She will have to leave college if the grant is not extended to her.</P>
    <P>I join with previous speakers who pleaded with the Minister not to spoil this measure by excluding those students who are currently in the system.  It is only fair that they should be included.  Many of them accepted places in colleges on the basis that they would be covered by this measure and they will have to leave if they are not covered.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent for this.  When the European Social Fund grants were extended to mature students on 1 January last, they included all students within the system.  The Minister has laid very strong emphasis, in justifying the means-testing of ESF grants, on there being the same rules for all in regard to student support. He should apply that level of consistency to this situation.  If it was right to include existing mature students within the extension of the ESF grants on 1 January 1991, then it is surely right that existing <Col N="325" /> students under the Higher Education Authority grants scheme should also be included.  The inclusion of existing mature students in the ESF grants scheme lent credibility to the view held by many mature students of the Higher Education Authority grants scheme extension.</P>
    <P>I have tabled amendments on this point.  It seems that other colleagues have done likewise.  I do not want to anticipate the fate of those amendments either at the hand of the Ceann Comhairle or of the Minister for Education.  This Bill will be dealt with in its entirety today and I would ask the Minister, if he has not already considered doing so, to spend the afternoon examining how he might introduce, this evening, an amendment to extend the scheme to existing students. Various estimates have been made of the cost but I do not believe the cost would be as high as some of the figures mentioned. One has to offset against those figures the cost of keeping these people on social welfare if they are not enabled to pursue their courses.</P>
    <P>A final point relates to the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.  A spouse will not only be somebody who is married but will also be a person who is cohabiting.  This is the definition used in the social welfare code, but quite a different approach is taken by the Revenue Commissioners.  Under the Minister's definition a student will be means-tested on the basis of a partner's income but the partner will not be able to claim any tax relief for the spouse.  The Revenue Commissioners claim that if a couple are not officially married, they are not entitled to a tax allowance, but when it comes to giving out money the State does not care about the legality of the relationship and will assess means on the basis of circumstances.  The State should be consistent.  The same rule should apply with regard to the definition of a &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; when it comes to giving money or taking money through the tax system. I have tabled a Committee Stage amendment on this point and I would ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister <Col N="326" /> of State, Deputy Aylward, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, on bringing forward this enlightened legislation which is one of the most exciting Education Bills for some time.  It is widely welcomed by people who will be able to avail of these grants in 1992.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the contributions regarding those mature students who have already enrolled in universities and colleges.  The Minister's argument is based on economic considerations. On the other hand, Ministers as Deputies are conscious of the hardship imposed on those students who have returned to second and third level education at great cost to themselves and, in some cases, to their spouses.  The Minister should at least make provision in the Bill to take power by order to extend this grant scheme to those at present in the system.  Nobody has asked for retrospective payment for 1991 but in equity there is a strong case to be made, bearing in mind the difficulty in relation to finance. It would have to be approved by the Department of Finance and that may prove to be a difficulty for the Minister and his officials.  I am sure that is the only criterion for this decision. One can understand the sense of inequity among students who enrolled in 1991 in the expectation that the grants scheme would be extended to them on a means-tested basis.  Not all students will be eligible for grants on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across cases of students who completed their first or second year of studies before the age of 23 but then opted out for personal or financial reasons, usually because they did not qualify for grants on account of their parents' income.  I expect that in the course of 1992 they may apply and be accepted for re-entry to university, being over the age of 23 and in many cases in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I understand that in some cases they would be in a position to re-enter second year and, in some cases, possibly, third year studies.  I recommend &mdash; if it is not already provided for in the Bill &mdash; that the Minister by means of the regulations <Col N="327" /> governing the Bill should not deem ineligible a student who had to opt out some years ago and who now wishes to opt into the educational system again.  I do not think that point has been raised by other Deputies in this House today.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Minister and his officials to leave this Bill as flexible as possible.  I realise it will be going to the Seanad and the Bill will be passed but as we will not resume until the end of September or early October there is no way the Minister can accept an amendment in the Seanad because that would delay the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government, following careful analysis of and reflection on those who applied in 1991 to become students in third level colleges and universities, would now be eligible, due to a revision of the regulations, to qualify for grant purposes under the scheme before us, in 1992-93 until the completion of their studies.  This would be a welcome gesture but I would like to ensure that the Minister would not be restricted in the action he may wish to take later in the year to allow the students to avail of the grants. Basically, this Bill should be as flexible as possible and the orders and regulations made under it should allow the Minister to comply with the requests I have heard from all sides of the House.  I am glad there is such a widespread welcome from all sides of the House for the Bill but I would emphasise that it is a question of finance at the end of the day.  This country is experiencing severe financial difficulties at present.</P>
    <P>I can draw attention to the Department of the Environment where new grant schemes were introduced and people who had applied previously were not eligible. There are a great many people who are dissatisfied because of changes in regulations and schemes from which they would have benefited had they delayed their projects for some time.  That is the case here also.  I have no doubt the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, would have a great deal of <Col N="328" /> goodwill in seeking to bring about a change in the legislation.  I am aware also of the pressures on both Ministers and the Department from the Department of Finance who are concerned about the overrun in the Exchequer for 1992. Indeed, the sum of £1.6 billion is a massive investment in education and rightly so.  That sum represents about 20 per cent of total Government expenditure and almost six per cent of GDP. This is a good investment from which this country and our young people benefit enormously.</P>
    <P>In the field of marketing, in which I was involved for some time, the high calibre of our young marketeers is due to our education system.  The major increase in exports in 1991 to £15 billion can be directly linked to the quality of our education system and our young people who are obtaining, without question, the best education in the world.  I regard our regional technical colleges as being equal to the majority of the universities I have looked at in the United States, and our universities are top class in the world.  We should be very proud of that achievement and we should ensure that as many people as possible can return to the education system.  To allow people at the age of 23 years a second opportunity is a tremendous, imaginative proposal by this Government.  I commend the Taoiseach, the Ministers and the Cabinet on bringing forward this legislation which is most welcome and will bring many opportunities to many people.</P>
    <P>At 23 years of age most people feel they should not be in the educational system.  I appeal to any 23 year old who will be involved to regard himself or herself as being a young person with enormous opportunities and potential for development.  By means of this legislation the Minister is giving many thousands of people a second chance.  Going from unemployment assistance to a grants system is a very practical provision. Now people will have an opportunity to return to the educational system and be in a position to take up a job at home or abroad, at the highest level of payment.  We have found from studies <Col N="329" /> that unfortunately, those who have the lowest level of education have the highest level of unemployment and in the highest level of education the lowest level of unemployment was found.  Therefore, it is obvious that action must be taken and the Government are now taking action to resolve those issues.</P>
    <P>I recall, at local government level, making cases for people who were seeking grants for their families.  We warmly welcome the extension of the grants system to 23 year olds and the improved means testing for parents of young people going into college for the first time in 1992.  The extension in the grants system is long overdue.  This is something about which PAYE people felt particularly aggrieved.  They compare the self-employed with the PAYE sector.  The examples are not great because the self-employed have enormous difficulties so far as sickness and maintaining their livelihood are concerned but at least the PAYE people have some support from the PRSI system.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions when canvassing for general elections I have been approached by many families who would say: &ldquo;We are struggling to send our two young children to college or university. We are on the borderline and we are not able to manage.  We are sacrificing ourselves and are mortgaging our homes to ensure that our children will have a third level education&rdquo;.  The means test improvements allow for full maintenance grants to a person whose parents have an income of £15,000.  This represents a dramatic increase on the present income limit of £10,787 which was so much out of touch.  This increase, although welcome, is long overdue.  The same family will be eligible for full fee grants up to an income of £18,000 and a 50 per cent fee grant up to an income of £19,000.  The same provisions will apply to mature students who are re-entering the educational system.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is not often, in difficult financial circumstances, that we have legislation before this House which is so progressive and so imaginative.  In Government generally we find we have <Col N="330" /> to carry on and take responsibility for so many difficult decisions.  In this regard, having attended party meetings in my constituency over the last few days, I must say I received a great welcome for this legislation, which I support within the bounds of the financial constraints on the Minister and the Government.  I fully appreciate the situation that the Government find themselves in and they are to be congratulated on bringing forward this legislation now.</P>
    <P>Many people will look back on this day as an historic one.  To be given an opportunity to return to third level education which they thought they would never have and to obtain financial support towards that education and to eventually graduate.  Mature students will take on this responsibility with a renewed vigour knowing that at perhaps 23 years of age they are being given a second opportunity to return to college; they will use their time very productively at their studies and will eventually acquire their desired qualification.  I also welcome the cross-Border co-operation in relation to qualifications from Northern Ireland.  The improvement in the means test system will ensure that many students who had to go to Britain to avail of the free fees system implemented by EC regulations may no longer be required to resort to this in 1992, and I welcome this.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House but I ask the Minister to make the provisions as flexible as possible bearing in mind the timescale in relation to the summer recess.  I appreciate the constraints on amendments coming back from the Seanad not being allowed to be taken in this House.  Under the regulations contained in the Bill the Minister could cover some of the issues during the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill I am glad that the message conveyed by me when I was the Fine Gael spokesperson on third level education and reiterated on numerous occasions by my party colleagues in which we outlined the gross inequities in the higher education <Col N="331" /> grant system are now at last being heeded by this Government.  We always believed that so compelling was our argument, so realistic and fair our proposals on the higher education grants system and so great the support from the general public for our concerns, that the Government had no option but to take on board the spirit of our policies.  The tragedy is, however, that the Minister has, in fact, only tinkered with the system rather than taking on board a radical review of the entire higher education grant system. Whatever the shortcomings of this legislation, I welcome the improvements in the higher education grants system announced by the Minister yesterday.  It is in my opinion a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>This Bill was promised by the Government some time ago and indeed its progress to this House today is due entirely to the determination and commitment of the Mature Students Association who spared no effort or time in their claim for grants for mature students.  The Bill is a tragedy in that it excludes those who actually campaigned for this change.  It is extraordinary that those who fought the battle are now excluded from the victory. There are 350 existing mature students all of whom undoubtedly would qualify under the criteria of age, qualifications and income.  It is totally unfair and downright mean that they are excluded from the Bill.  Their exclusion would cost a mere £1 million, and surely it is regrettable that they should be left out when the cost is not prohibitive and when one considers who will benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must realise that mature students in our colleges are, for the most part, people who were denied the chance of third level education for one reason only, lack of finance.  The system failed them. We failed them.  They, on their own initiative and at their own cost, funded themselves in order to get to the position they are in today.  Is it not too much to ask that those who were victims of the system and those who had to opt to work in order to obtain the necessary funding to get them through college should be <Col N="332" /> given their entitlement.  These are the people who are excluded from this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, their exclusion is unfair and unjust because they, more than anybody else, are most in need of a grant because of the strain that funding their own education has placed on their scarce resources and, indeed, on those of their families.  It is only right that we should recognise their initiative and salute their efforts instead of penalising and punishing them.  It is just not good enough to be in the right place at the right time.  It is not good enough that those who perhaps work overtime, who saved and sacrificed themselves and their families in order to accumulate the necessary funding to get themselves through college, should now be excluded from the grant because they started their education too early.  I appeal to the Minister to give a positive response to the amendment that we in the Fine Gael Party have tabled for Committee Stage regarding existing mature students.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very timely and very welcome but if it is to be really effective it must be backed up with the extra provision of second chance education.  Too few opportunities are available for people to return to the education system. I hope the Minister will extend the availability of leaving certificate courses which were designed in particular for those who wish to return to the education system. It is vitally important that every town provide such courses and that resources be made available for the provision of those classes.</P>
    <P>The opportunity to take up second chance education should not be dependent on where you live.  Equality of opportunity must not be only an aspiration but also a reality.  Those who could not avail of an education opportunity during their teens should now be given that chance.  They should be enabled to benefit from this legislation.  There is little point in having a grant for mature students unless we also give them the facilities, resources and opportunity to participate in second level education and to meet the educational requirements that will enable them to apply for third <Col N="333" /> level education places.  Many people who desire to opt for second chance education, who are deserving of places in third level colleges and who would qualify for this mature student grant will never have the opportunity to avail themselves of it unless they are given the facilities to sit leaving certificate courses that suit their needs.</P>
    <P>This is a step the Minister must take. It is not good enough to deal with this Bill in isolation.  If we really want to benefit those who actually need it, those who unfortunately were unable to avail of the opportunities in their early years, we must provide them with all the necessary help to acquire the educational standards which will enable them to achieve their aspiration of entering third level education.  In this regard, I commend our vocational education committees who to date have been the only educational bodies to provide second chance education. Many of our vocational education committees provide courses specifically for the needs of those who wish to return to the education system.  Expecting mature students to go back into normal second level classes is not realistic and does not match their needs.  We are indebted to the vocational education committees for their initiative in providing those courses, which are run also in my constituency.  As a result many people will be able to avail of the mature student grants.</P>
    <P>In addition the success of this Bill will be dependent on the availability of third-level places for mature students.  It is realistic to assume that there will be an increased demand for third-level places when the Bill is enacted and that must be matched by the availability of such places.  I hope the Minister has looked beyond the provisions of this Bill to ensure that extra places will be provided for mature students who are entitled to special consideration.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the provisions of the Bill that allow mature students fulfil academic qualification guidelines, they will be useless unless there are extra places made available for those students in third-level colleges.  If we are to give <Col N="334" /> people a realistic second chance we must also extend the opportunities for career breaks and leave of absence.  Potential students will be unable to avail of the grants being provided under the Bill unless they are afforded an opportunity to take career breaks or leave of absence from their present posts.  Every effort must be made to ensure that mature students benefit from the provisions of this Bill.  However, I have certain reservations in regard to the method of means-testing of mature students outlined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new integrated strategic approach to business linkages which is being developed by the Task Force on Employment through its State companies linkage group operating under the aegis of my Department &mdash; as an initial focus &mdash; has the strengthening of the capacity of companies within the State to be involved in linkages to a far greater extent than heretofore.  The integrated strategic approach is now being put in place in the building products industry, in the electronics software and related industries sector.  It will be extended on a phased basis to a wide range of other industrial sectors.  It is this approach which is intended to double the purchasing of Irish-made components by the electronics sector.  Undoubtedly, business both within the State and Northern Ireland will benefit from the increased economic activity on the entire island of Ireland which will be generated by enhanced domestic and international business linkages.  The initial developments within the State are co-ordinated within the national linkage programme, but it is envisaged that, in time, the approach can be extended to the island of Ireland through co-operation between the relevant Departments and agencies, North and South.  I am aware that steps have already been taken in this regard by the business community through the CII and the CBI, Northern Ireland.  I am also aware that a commercial business <Col N="337" /> directory, for the first time, has been produced which covers the entire island of Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that side-by-side with the new approach which is being taken under the aegis of the Task Force on Employment, and the steps being taken by the business communities North and South, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce responsible for Trade and Marketing, Deputy O'Rourke, recently announced details of a new campaign involving An Bord Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland aimed to increase the level of business linkages by small companies on the island of Ireland, North and South.  As part of the current campaign a series of subcontract exhibitions, showing products currently being imported which could potentially be produced in Ireland, have been organised in Belfast, Galway, Derry, Waterford and Dublin.  I am confident that we can build on this initiative, but there is much very detailed work to be done before we can achieve the desired level of economic integration in the two parts of the island so as to put in place a single comprehensive integrated business linkage programme for the whole island which is our ultimate objective.</P>

      <P>Various sectors are being examined at present.  I am not in a position to name precisely those that will follow the initial ones.  I might also remind the Deputy that, apart from Government action in this regard, a joint council was established in January 1991 to develop business, North and South. To date 50 companies are operating as if it were a single market.  A series of sectoral meetings have taken place, the most productive being in the engineering and food industries.  The CII and the CBI, Northern Ireland, have appointed specialist trade executives to develop two-way trade in this regard and they report directly to this joint council.  That is in addition to the initiatives being taken by the State.  I might add that the economic adviser to my Department is working on other sectors to prepare them for inclusion in this programme.</P>

I might add that at my insistence the economic adviser to my Department, Dr. Con Power, is taking a personal interest in this area.  If there are signs of any remaining partitionist policy in relation to the development of business and about integrating business between North and South, about the establishment of an <Col N="339" /> economic corridor between Belfast and Dublin, the House can be assured that action will be taken to remove those traces.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government's campaign on the recent Maastricht referendum employed all medial and communications facilities appropriate to such a campaign.  This included advertising in the national and provincial newspapers as well as in a number of magazines such as <i>Business and Finance and Women's Way</i>; billboards at various sites throughout the country and electronic boards in Limerick and Cork; my broadcast on RTE; and the freephone information service which was operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs in co-operation with a number of other Government Departments directly concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated recently in replying to a question from Deputy Spring, the costs of printing the White Paper and the &ldquo;Short Guide to the Treaty&rdquo; and of distributing <Col N="340" /> the latter to households throughout the country will be met from the Foreign Affairs Vote, while the balance of the campaign costs will be met from subhead B of the Vote for my Department.  The latter will be met by way of a Supplementary Estimate to be put before the Dáil on Friday.  The total costs are estimated to be within the figure of £600,000 I mentioned previously.</P>
    <P>As I have also indicated, invoices for most elements of the Government's campaign are still outstanding.  When the final costings are known, they can be made available, in appropriate detail, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I find the Taoiseach's reply not very helpful in terms of detail.  I would like to ask him a number of supplementaries to try to flesh out what he has been saying.  First of all, how many people were employed on this freefone line and how many hours did they work?  What was the cost of the calls and the number of inquiries?  In regard to the special Government broadcast, will the Taoiseach confirm if Carr Communications were retained and, if so, how much were they paid?  Did RTE make a charge for the time or was the time free?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people involved in the freefone telephone services was the number that would normally be required to staff the telephones for the duration for which it was in operation. The approximate cost is estimated as being somewhere in the region of £5,000.  We have not got the final detail. As soon as I have, the House will have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy wants to delay the House I can go through various items that have been estimated and the cost for them if it is of any help to him, but I would expect that he would be better to wait until the final details are in and I will give him the full details.  I do not know whether the Deputy still wants to know the siting of every billboard in all the various towns and cities around the country.  If that is what he wants, I am certainly prepared <Col N="341" /> to let him know but I think it would be a waste of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that perhaps this is not the time or the place to discuss the detail behind these questions but if the Taoiseach were to write to me with the full details I certainly would accept that. The Taoiseach has not answered my question about Carr Communications and the question of time on RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no trouble whatsoever in extracting the additional cost of Carr Communications.  The figure eludes me at the moment.  I gave it in this House prior to this and if the Deputy were reading the record of the House he would know.  Nevertheless I will have no hesitation in sending it to him.  It is a very small amount of money anyway because, as I am sure the Deputy knows, Carr Communications are engaged in a similar activity here in the House on contract and consequently much of the expense was carried in that regard.  There were something like 153 billboard sites occupied by the advertisements in relation to the Maastricht Treaty and they were spread out across a number of towns and cities at the most appropriate places that were found to be available at the time.  I would also like to tell the Deputy that the budgeted figure for the overall cost, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and this House, is inside the figure I have quoted in this House, but I will give the Deputy the detail of the additional costs in relation to Carr Communications by writing to him today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his broadcast during this referendum was without precedent?  Would he agree further that it does not set a precedent and will not be a precedent for ministerial broadcasts in a contested referendum campaign in the future? Would the Taoiseach also agree that if it is desirable to have a ministerial broadcast at all in regard to the matter of a referendum it would be better to follow the practice of the French President in <Col N="342" /> having that at the outset of the campaign rather than in the last few days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of choice for the Taoiseach of the day as to how and when he times a national broadcast. President Mitterrand takes his own decisions and I take mine.  I regarded it as the most effective time to do it and that is what I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party have expressed the view in the past that the electoral system should be changed, would they consider that in the event that they were introducing a similar referendum to that end that the Taoiseach of the day, who happened to be a member of Fianna Fáil, would be entitled to requisition RTE time, without right to reply, in those circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach is quite wrong in saying that the only thing that matters is that the referendum was carried.  We have to ensure that the Government are accountable for what they do with the people's <Col N="343" /> money.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to what extent An Post were used for the distribution of the &ldquo;Short Guide to the Maastricht Treaty&rdquo; and to what extent were An Post used for the distribution of the polling cards?  If private companies were used will the Taoiseach indicate which private distribution companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post were used to the maximum extent possible in relation to the delivery of the short guide.  The matter of polling cards and how they are distributed is a matter for the returning officer of the day and not for the Government or the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question for detail but I have already stated to the Deputy that An Post were used to the maximum extent possible and only in areas where An Post had advised us that they could not guarantee delivery were private couriers employed.</P>

      <P>Plans for any formal visits or meetings will, in accordance with the established practice, be publicly announced by both sides shortly in advance of the event.  I have already met the Prime Minister of Sweden at the recent UN Conference in Rio and will be meeting some of the other Prime Ministers concerned at the CSCE Summit which I will be attending in Helsinki later this week.  These meetings are, of course, useful in permitting each side to clarify <Col N="344" /> their position and advance their interests and I intend to avail of such opportunities to the extent that time and other commitments allow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas I can understand the reasons for the Taoiseach not giving details at this stage, may I take it from what the Taoiseach is saying that he is supportive of enlargement of the Community and that any opportunity that arises will involve detailed discussions with his European counterparts in relation to the enlargement question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should take it that I am in full support of the enlargement of the Community and that negotiations will take place on the individual applications only after the Delors II package is agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if his meetings with applicants in the enlargement process include all the applicants or are applicants being dealt with individually and, specifically, does he propose a meeting, for example, in connection with the Cyprus application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being looked at in two separate categories but of course individual applicants will have their negotiations carried out on an individual basis. The four EFTA countries are being looked at in one category and the other three, Turkey, Malta and Cyprus, are being looked at in a slightly different category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be unsatisfactory to have a substantial enlargement of the Community unless there is, in addition to the Delors II package, a commitment to automatic transfers to weaker states in the Community?  One should not have to live on a five-year to five-year basis with various packages being negotiated, for example, Delors I, Delors II, Delors III, Delors IV, etc.  This would mean we would not know beyond a few years ahead whether certain funds were available. There should be an automatic <Col N="345" /> Treaty guaranteed system of transfer rather than reliance on political packages such as the Delors II package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that that would be a more desirable system.  However, we have to deal with what flows from the Maastricht Treaty and the Commission proposals in relation to the Delors II package.  Of course, it would be more desirable to have formal transfers from the richer to the poorer countries but that was not part of the agreement reached at Maastricht or part of the negotiations which are now taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that enlargement of the Community will involve an amendment to the Treaty and would it be possible for the Taoiseach to propose, as a precondition to his agreement to enlargement, that that Treaty amendment would, in addition to providing for enlargement, also provide for automaticity of financial transfers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The admission of the seven applicant countries will give rise to a new situation.  The four EFTA countries will bring in an additional contribution of approximately six billion ECUs to the Community's budget.  No negotiations will take place on this issue until the Delors II package has been completed. This is what we will have to deal with in the short to medium-term.  As I said, the admission of the seven applicant countries will give rise to a new situation. We will certainly see what can be done to improve the transfer of funds at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he will have placed in the Library the proposed terms of reference for this committee as not every party in the House are privy to the terms under which this committee are being established?  My question refers specifically to a European affairs committee.  I understand the Taoiseach in his reply was referring to the foreign affairs committee.  In view of the implications of the Maastricht Treaty, does he not believe that we should have a specific committee dealing with European affairs and that it is important for members of this committee to have the power to monitor and influence the discussions and decisions made by the Government at European Council level? Will he confirm that the current terms of reference as I understand them &mdash; they may have been changed since May of this year &mdash; specifically exclude such a role for the proposed foreign affairs committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government proposals in this regard were handed out on Thursday, 9 April.  The question of establishing two committees was considered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs before any proposals were made. Having fully considered the matter he came to the conclusion that this would lead to demarcation problems between the two committees and, consequently, recommended that one committee be set up, with one or two sub-committees being formed from the overall foreign affairs committee.  One of these sub-committees could deal with European affairs. Provision may be made for the attendance of Euro MPs at this committee.  That is still the position.  Hopefully agreement on this issue can be reached before the Dáil goes into recess so that the committee can be set up.</P>

      <P>I wish to repeat my question. Surely the Government have some idea of their legislative priorities, particularly in regard to legislation dealing with the right to travel and information, issues which we have been discussing for a number of months?  Is the work on this legislation nearly completed or otherwise? Can the Taoiseach give the House <Col N="350" /> an outline of the legislation the Government intend bringing before the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to meet the timescale for the abortion legislation set out by the four party leaders in their statement on the Maastricht Treaty.  This legislation will certainly be included in the programme for the autumn session. As the House will be aware, we must also bring forward a second Finance Bill to further harmonise our taxes in preparation for the Single Market.  Those two Bills will form the major part of the legislative agenda.  Other matters have not been decided as yet.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will continue to threaten to use the veto at the European Council unless Ireland is granted the £6 billion proposed in Mr. Delors' original package.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall from my statement in the House on Thursday last that we were successful at the Lisbon European Council meeting, despite considerable pressure, in achieving successes on some individual elements of the Delors II package.</P>
      <P>First, the Cohesion Fund will now be established early in 1993, compared to the date contained in the Maastricht Treaty of before the end of 1993.  This fund will assist environment and transport infrastructure projects in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece at particularly higher rates of aid compared to that available under the present Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Second, the Lisbon Summit decided that the regressive nature of the current system of own resources will be corrected for the benefit of the Community's four poorest member states.  This is another advance as the Maastricht Treaty simply stated that there would be an examination of this question; now we have a clear decision that the current system will be corrected, as I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, the Lisbon Summit agreed that the cumulated effect of the Structural <Col N="351" /> Funds and the Cohesion Fund will be such as to achieve an appropriate increase for the regions concerned in the four poorest member states to reflect the Maastricht commitments.  This is yet a further advance on the Maastricht Treaty which simply referred to a review in 1992 of the appropriate size of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>As I stressed in my statement on Thursday last, these achievements must be judged as a stage of the process towards the results that we are ultimately negotiating for at or before the Edinburgh Summit.  The Deputy can rest assured that, and as we clearly demonstrated at Lisbon, we will ensure that our interests and objectives are promoted and defended vigorously and the best negotiating strategy will be used between now and during the Edinburgh Summit.</P>

      <P>Will we receive the £6 billion that was dangled like a carrot before the public during the Maastricht Treaty Referendum campaign?  The Taoiseach is reported as having said that he would use the veto if we did not get the £6 billion in the Delors II package. Will the Taoiseach veto the membership of the applicant countries if we do not receive the £6 billion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the Deputy who has many years of experience of negotiating in Brussels, calls the answers he receives, woolly answers.  He knows that between now and the Edinburgh Summit discussions will take place behind the scenes and in various fora. We will continue to negotiate, in advance of the Edinburgh Summit if possible, a final position that will meet with the approval of other member states.  As the Deputy knows, a negotiating strategy has to be applied and other member states must also give agreement on these matters. The Deputy can be assured that we <Col N="352" /> know what our best strategy is and will use that strategy in whatever fora to achieve the desired results.</P>

      <P>There is a new expression in this instance, &ldquo;negotiating strategy&rdquo;.  I would have liked a straight answer to a straight question.  Obviously, I can take it from the Taoiseach's reply that the £6 billion is not guaranteed.  There is no guarantee that if we do not get the £6 billion the Taoiseach will veto membership of other countries, as he said in Lisbon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 19, 23, 40 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's policy in relation to the conflict in Yugoslavia is based on the following <Col N="358" /> main elements: First, active support and encouragement for the European Community's peace process, conducted through the conference chaired by Lord Carrington.  We consider that this provides the best forum for a comprehensive, negotiated settlement. Second, support for and involvement in the efforts on the ground in Yugoslavia by the European Community's monitor mission and the UN force (UNPROFOR) to bring about an end to hostilities and to create the conditions in which negotiations can succeed.  Third, support for international action, in particular through the sanctions imposed by the Community and by the UN Security Council on Serbia and Montenegro. Fourth, support for humanitarian action to relieve the plight of the displaced persons or refugees and those suffering in the siege of Sarajevo.</P>
    <P>In reporting to Dáil Éireann last week on the Lisbon European Council, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs set out the approach of the European Community.  The Council's comprehensive declaration on the matter, copies of which have been placed in the Dáil Library, reflects a number of ideas which Ireland put forward.  We will continue to try to ensure that the momentum of the European Community's peace process is maintained.</P>
    <P>On the ground, we are actively involved in both the EC monitor mission and the UN peacekeeping force, UNPROFOR.  In addition to six Irish personnel currently serving with the EC monitor mission, there are now six Irish military observers and 20 members of the Garda Síochána serving with UNPROFOR.  Two observers are being assigned to duties at Sarajevo airport. Any further requests from the UN will receive careful consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the courage and dedication of the Irish personnel who are serving in dangerous and difficult conditions in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>As regards further international action, the collective weight of the European <Col N="359" /> Community, and the international community generally, should continue to be applied to Serbia and Montenegro to encourage their full and constructive participation in the work of the conference. To that end, Ireland advocated the imposition by the European Community of a wide range of economic sanctions. With our EC partners, we also called upon the UN Security Council to adopt similar economic measures.  On 30 May, the Security Council responded decisively by adopting, in their Resolution 757, a range of political and economic sanctions.  These have been fully implemented by Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition, together with our EC partners we are committed to seeking the suspension of the representatives of Serbia and Montenegro in the CSCE and other international fora; we have not recognised Serbia and Montenegro's claim to be automatic successor state to the former Yugoslavia.  This will be considered in the light of an opinion of the legal Commission of the EC Peace Conference.</P>
    <P>Other issues being addressed include appropriate arrangements for guaranteeing the status and rights of minorities &mdash; for example in the Serb province of Kosovo, and also the question of Macedonia's admission to the international community.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the urgent need to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those who are most in need, particularly those who have been cut off in Sarajevo.  The European Council discussed the appalling plight of the people there who have suffered for months without food, water or electricity and have been subject to constant shelling from heavy artillery.  Although no party to the conflict can escape blame, by far the greatest share of responsibility falls on the Serbian leadership and the Yugoslav army whom they control.  The European Council focused specially on the immediate need to re-open Sarajevo airport to enable food and medicines to get through.  We proposed that the UN <Col N="360" /> Security Council should urgently take the necessary measures.</P>
    <P>On 29 June, the Council authorised the deployment of some 1,100 additional personnel from the UN peacekeeping force in Croatia to ensure the airport's security and functioning.  As a result, humanitarian assistance is beginning to reach the people of Sarajevo.</P>
    <P>The need for large scale aid is clear. The Government have allocated, from the disaster relief fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs, £100,000 to assist displaced persons in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  This assistance will be channelled through the UN High Commission for Refugees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all agree with the well-deserved compliment to those who are trying to maintain peace and also with the urgency of getting humanitarian aid through to those who so badly need it.  In relation to what are sometimes conflicting views being put forward by the G7 group, will the Minister confirm that the specific Irish approach towards the problem will be governed by UN initiatives, particularly Chapter 7 initiatives, and will be in the context of the United Nations CSCE process?</P>

May I take it from the Minister's reply that the discussions among the members of the Community our position will be to assist on the role of the UN CSCE process being the prime source of an Irish attitude to the current problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 25, 26, 31, 66, 70 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the proposal contained in the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992, was approved by the people in a referendum on 18 June. The Provisional Referendum Certificate outlining the results in each constituency was published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> on 23 June, 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> A Final Referendum Certificate will issue if, after 21 days from the publication of the result in <i>Irish Oifigiúil,</i> the Master of the High Court informs the Referendum Returning Officer that no referendum petition has been presented or that any petition presented has become null and void.  It is only after these steps have been taken that the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill will be presented to the President for signature.</P>
    <P>The next stage in Ireland's ratification procedures will require an amendment to the European Communities Act, 1972, as amended, to make the relevant provisions of the Treaty on European Union part of the domestic law of the State.</P>
    <P>Draft heads of a Bill are being prepared and will be presented to Government shortly.  It is intended, at this stage, that the Bill will be presented early in the autumn.  I believe it is important when a referendum is to be held that full and adequate information should be provided to the electorate.  As regards the question of making information available for any future referendum, however, I do not think it is possible to anticipate what the specific need will be until the subject matter of the referendum is known.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Western European Union the Deputy will be aware of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty which would enable the European Union to request the Western European Union to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the European Union which have defence implications.  The Government have made it clear that Ireland does not intend to become a member of the Western European Union.  But, in view of the provisions of the European Union Treaty, the Government believe that observer status would have a number of advantages in ensuring that Ireland is fully informed of developments in the Western European Union which might have a bearing on discussions in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Attendance as an observer at the Western European Union would not require Ireland to undertake any mutual defence commitments or military obligations <Col N="364" /> under the Western European Union Treaty.</P>
    <P>The proposed committee of the regions cannot become operative until the European Union Treaty comes into effect. Article R of the Treaty provides that the Treaty shall enter into force on 1 January 1993 at the earliest or on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification of the last signatory state to take this step.  In anticipation of entry into force of the Treaty each member state has been asked to submit a list of its nominations for membership and alternate membership of the committee.  The question of the nomination of Irish members and alternates to the committee is being considered by the Government and will be completed by that date.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations on the Treaty the member states agreed a Protocol to the Treaty which provided that the committee of the regions would have a common organisational structure with the existing Economic and Social Committee. As this latter committee meets in Brussels and its secretariat is based there, the question of the location of the committee of the regions elsewhere did not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposed committee of the regions, will the Minister give me an assurance that the Irish representatives to the European Regional Committee will be elected and not selected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As this matter has not been decided, I cannot at this stage give any assurance in that regard.  As I said in my reply, decisions have to be made by the Government.  That has not happened yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that it was the clear intention of the framers of the Maastricht Treaty that the committee of the regions should be a democratic body representing democratically elected representativess of the regions?  It was clearly understood in the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty that any attempt by the Irish Government to introduce <Col N="365" /> county managers or other appointed people in place of directly elected representatives would be a clear perversion of the intentions of the framers of the Maastricht Treaty?  Would the Minister agree that it is indicative of the Government's complete lack of commitment to regional development if, even at this late stage, he is unable to answer questions as to the way the Irish representatives on that committee are to be elected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

In relation to the proposed committee of the regions, I ask the Minister for an assurance &mdash; indeed, Deputy Bruton put this request but I do not consider he received <Col N="366" /> an adequate reply &mdash; that unelected officials will not be sent to represent the regions of this country on the committee of the regions?  Ireland is entitled to have nine members on the committee and I seek an assurance that they will be elected representatives and not unelected officials.  In relation to the Western European Union, could the Minister say whether the proposal to seek observer status at that body will be brought before the House for approval before being proceeded with?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the extraordinary queues on a daily basis at the Passport Office; and if he intends to take steps to provide a more satisfactory service and hence prevent such inconveniences to applicants.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that both the Minister and myself are personally concerned that the best possible service should be given to members of the public when applying for passports.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office process approximately 180,000 passport applications each year.  On average, 30 per cent of these are issued during May and June. 60 per cent of all applications are normally submitted and delivered through the postal system.  As a result of the postal dispute, the vast majority of recent applications were submitted and collected in person, adding greatly to the usual seasonal pressures on the office.  A variety of measures, including recruitment of additional staff and weekend opening, were implemented to try to relieve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has improved significantly following the ending of the postal dispute and arrears which built up during the dispute are now being cleared. However, there are still larger than normal numbers for this time of the year attending the Passport Office.  This is due, in part, to the fact that some passport applications which were deferred <Col N="370" /> due to the postal dispute now require to be processed urgently.  Every effort is being made to deal with these applications as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the precise trading status of countries which have some form of associated membership with the EC.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Article 238 of the Treaty of Rome provision is made for the establishment of association agreements between the European Community and third countries.  Such agreements involve a high degree of co-operation and the taking on of reciprocal rights and obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> The European Community has association agreements with Turkey, Cyprus and Malta.  Agreements have also been concluded in the past year with the countries of EFTA, in the European economic area agreement, as well as with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.  Specific trade arrangements are provided for in these agreements.  In the case of Turkey, Cyprus and Malta eventual customs union involving a common external tariff is envisaged.  Work is continuing towards the achievement of this goal according to varying timetables.</P>
    <P>The recently signed European Economic Area Agreement between the EC and EFTA member states is due to come into effect on 1 January 1993, the date on which the Single Market is to be completed within the Community.  It provides for free movement of goods, persons, services and capital within the 19 EC and EFTA states.  Agriculture is not covered by the provisions for free movement.</P>
    <P>The association agreements with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia which were signed in December 1991 are also due to come into effect on 1 January 1993.  They provided for the phased establishment of a free trade area between the parties, allowing for a gradual abolition of customs duties and quantitative restrictions over a ten year period.  Special arrangements are to apply to coal, steel and textiles as well as to agricultural products.  Similar agreements are currently being negotiated with Bulgaria and Romania.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to ten countries initially but in the very last paragraph he referred to two additional countries making a total of 12 countries that will trade with the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of this trade could be extremely damaging to Ireland.  Will the Minister give me some detail &mdash; although I do not expect the answer today &mdash; of the agricultural products that will be allowed into the EC from these countries from 1 January 1993, the date specifically mentioned in the reply?  Will the Minister convey to me the quantity of each specific <Col N="372" /> product that will be allowed into the Community?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this is a very complex issue and I am not certain I can deal with it case by case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at this point.  Generally, the association agreements signed last December with the Eastern European countries contain special provisions on agricultural products.  Complete liberalisation is not envisaged.  However, greater access to the EC market by way of quota increases and tariff cuts for a range of agricultural imports was offered by the Community side.  We ensured in tough negotiations that these would be subject to adequate safeguard clauses and that provisions for triangular operations would be included &mdash; this means the provision of EC financial support for the purchase of Polish and other agricultural products by the former Soviet Union.  This lessens the pressure on EC markets.</P>
      <P>The way association agreements between the European Community and Eastern Europe are structured have to be viewed in the light of overall EC commitment to assist through a variety of means the process of political and economic reform in that area.</P>
      <P>I will ensure that any further detailed information that becomes available is supplied directly to the Deputy and I will discuss the matter with him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a separate issue and the Deputy should perhaps put down a separate question, as I could not make an off-the-cuff comment on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the utmost respect, I suggest it is not a separate question.  The Minister referred to the association agreement with Czechoslovakia so therefore he should be willing to answer questions about it.</P>
      <P>Will the agreement have to be altered in any way to take account of the fact that, economically and politically, Czechlands and Slovakia will become sovereign entities from an early date and not one as at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister cannot give specific detailed information of all the products coming from each of these 12 countries but will he request the Department to supply information on the agricultural products that will be allowed into the EC from these countries?  In the past number of years illegal importation of agricultural commodities from these countries into the EC has caused considerable problems for the Irish agricultural sector and I believe the problem may be compounded by the legal importation of such products into the Community. Will the Minister supply information on the precise quantity of each commodity involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to get that information for the Deputy.  I can tell him that I have been assured that there are mechanisms in the agreements to ensure that, in the event of a situation such as the Deputy envisages arising, we can take corrective action.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 35, 36, 77, 283, 284, 295 and 301 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has consistently condemned the apartheid system and has worked actively at the United Nations and with their partners in the European Community to bring international pressure to bear on the Government of South Africa for change.</P>
      <P>In calling for the total removal of apartheid, the Irish people have, over the years, stressed that this must be by peaceful means.  We remain convinced, however, that the vicious cycle of repression and violence, provoked by apartheid, can be ended only through constructive dialogue and negotiation.</P>
      <P>In December of last year, the main parties and organisations in South Africa, including the South African Government, ANC and Inkatha, began to work together in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, CODESA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government regret that the parties were not able to reach agreement at the second plenary meeting of CODESA in May on the decisive issues of the structures for the negotiations on a new constitution and the form transitional arrangements for governing the country might take.  Mr. Mandela's suggestion that the management committee of CODESA try to find agreement on the outstanding differences gave us renewed <Col N="376" /> hope that the deadlock in the discussions could be overcome.</P>
    <P>Our hopes were shattered by the brutal massacre at Boipatong on 17 June.  It was yet another terrible incident in the continuing violence which has wracked South Africa since 1990, resulting in the deaths of over 7,000 people.  Ireland joined in condemning the massacre in a statement made by the European Community on 23 June, which has been brought to the attention of the South African authorities.</P>
    <P>The ANC suspended their talks with the South African Government, including within CODESA, because of the increasing violence.  The full facts behind the massacre have yet to be established, but it must be said that the failure of the South African Government to recognise their responsibilities and to take the necessary action has allowed the instigators of the political violence free rein.</P>
    <P>The European Council, in Lisbon on 26-27 June, in expressing its shock at what had happened at Boipatong, underlined the absolute need for effective control of the South African police and security forces.  The question of violence is the regular subject of reports by the ambassadors of European Community countries in South Africa who follow events closely and report in a co-ordinated way through the European Political Co-operation procedures.  It will be taken up by the Troika of Community Foreign Ministers during their visit to South Africa in the near future.  As the Taoiseach informed the house last week, Ireland fully supports this.  It is necessary that the conditions be created which will allow the parties to resume their talks under CODESA.</P>
    <P>We have noted the South African Government's agreement to the participation by outside legal experts in the Goldstone Commission, who are investigating the Boipatong massacre.  We hope that it represents the beginning of a change in official attitudes in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Community Foreign Ministers considered the remaining Community sanctions on 6 April.  They decided, in the <Col N="377" /> light of the positive developments up to that date, to lift the ban on oil exports, in effect since 1985.  They also agreed formally to lift the restrictions on scientific, cultural and sporting contacts, which had already been relaxed.  Ireland supported these decisions.  We believe it right that the Community, including Ireland, should respond appropriately to the developments taking place in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Community will continue to keep under review its sanctions policy.  The arms embargo should remain until a new constitution and a new government are in place in South Africa.  Other sanctions will be reviewed in the light of progress in South Africa.</P>
    <P>At the moment, Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with South Africa. The honorary consul in Johannesburg, who has responsibility for the consular protection of Irish citizens, is the only official Irish presence in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce led a delegation to South Africa last November and has answered questions in the House on his visit, which was intended to promote the development of trade and investment links between Ireland and South Africa.  The balance of trade has consistently remained in Ireland's favour since 1981.  Irish trade with South Africa has declined, however, in recent years.  The balance of trade figure in our favour for 1991 was £17.6 million.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, noting the potential of the South African market, concluded from his visit that there were some worthwhile opportunities for developing trade and business links, over time.</P>

Will the Minister assure this House that whatever diplomatic efforts can be made of our own accord and through the Community will be made to ensure that the talks and negotiations get back on the rails?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it was the sanctions imposed by the EC countries in particular which resulted in the South African Government finally agreeing to negotiations with the ANC?  Will he not agree, therefore, in view of the recent developments and the clear implication that South African security forces were at least in support of the massacre in Boipatong, that sanctions should be strengthened rather than reduced in order to ensure that the talks get back under way?  There is no other way of doing it.  Economic pressure must be applied to bring white South Africa back to the negotiating table in a serious way and force them to bring their security forces under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was that sanctions would be reviewed in the light of progress.  That works both ways.  I take the point the Deputy is making.  If an event is deteriorating that must be taken into consideration.  The intention always was that sanctions would be reviewed in the light of the progress being made.  As progress was being made sanctions were eased.  As I said, that works both ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Judged by any standards Telecom Éireann are one of the biggest companies in the State.  With 13,500 employees they are in the top ten employers in the country.  With a turnover of £782 million in 1990-91 they had the eighth largest company turnover in the country.  With almost 1 million customer lines they are connected to 67 per cent of households in the State.  They have 17 subsidiary and related companies covering all aspects of telecommunications ranging from directory publishing, sale of equipment, cable TV, and foreign consultancy.  They provide residential security systems, a radio paging service, research and development services, and electronic trading services in addition to their basic telephone and data transmission facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the issue which we are discussing today is a simple principle.  In order to properly conduct the business of a company, whether in the public or the <Col N="564" /> private sector, a chairman must have the support and confidence of his-her board.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the chairman of Telecom lost that confidence.  The board of the company, out a sense of unease and tension, formally passed a motion of no confidence in him and made contact with me which ultimately led to my taking the only action I believed was appropriate in order to ensure that the best interests of the company prevail.</P>
    <P>The sequence of events was as follows: On 26 June 1992, the company secretary of Telecom Eireann informed me that the members of the Board of Telecom, at a meeting earlier that day, had passed a motion of no confidence in the chairman, Mr. Brendan Hynes.</P>
    <P>They requested an early meeting with me to inform me directly of the situation. I could not meet them on Monday or Tuesday of last week, because I was signing a transport agreement in Hungary, so the board agreed to meet me in Galway on last Sunday week, 28 June.</P>
    <P>When they met me, the board made it clear to me that this no confidence motion was not a sudden or an easy decision.  It had been reached after careful consideration, with great reluctance.</P>
    <P>The reluctance and the personal regret resulted from their appreciation of what the chairman was setting out to achieve. They had welcomed the appointment of Mr. Hynes as chairman of Telecom and individually and collectively had given him every assistance possible.  Individual members of the board had briefed him on various aspects of telecommunications and he had been given full access to all the information available in Telecom Eireann.  They stressed that there was a general desire in the company to assist the chairman in every way in his task of leading the company.  He had clearly devoted time and effort to the task.  He had become familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the company in order to identify the policy changes which would allow Telecom Éireann to continue to prosper in the increasingly competitive days ahead.</P>
    <P>The problem was not with the former chairman's thinking, the problem was <Col N="565" /> with the former chairman's <i>modus operandi.</i> The company and the former chairman are not greatly at odds on what has to be done, but they are at odds on how it should be done.</P>
    <P>In business terms, there is just no point in having the right objective and the determination to achieve that objective, if you cannot take the board and management of the company along with you. As chairman of a State-sponsored body, there is just no point in having a vision of the future of that company, and submitting documents to the Minister which incorporate that vision, if you have not cleared those documents with the board in advance.</P>
    <P>This is really the heart of the matter. It is the board of the company who collectively have overall statutory responsibility for the company &mdash; not any officer of the board or of the company: proposals being sent to me from the company must have the approval of the board; no officer of the board can function without the support of the board and the board normally report to me through the chairman or the company secretary.  In practice, this means that a chairman must secure board approval for his-her proposals.  So, the House can see, the situation facing me last week was very clear.</P>
    <P>The board had come to a unanimous decision that they had no confidence in the chairman.  It was a situation without parallel in the last 40 years.  The board were unequivocal: the chairman must go or they would go.  When I sought clarification on why they had so decidedly lost confidence in the chairman, the board identified a number of key factors.</P>
    <P>They spoke of the chairman's style of operation at board level, which they regarded as unacceptable.  They spoke of his interaction with senior management of the company, which they also regarded as unacceptable.  They spoke of a divisiveness created within the board and of loss of morale both within the board and within the company generally.</P>
    <P>I could not claim to have been without choices in this situation.  I certainly had a choice &mdash; in the same way that a person who is between a rock and a hard place <Col N="566" /> has a choice.  If I did not seek Mr. Hynes's resignation, the board would, individually or collectively, resign.  I listened, took advice, took time to consider this grave matter over a period of almost a week, and on Friday, asked for Mr. Hynes's resignation.</P>
    <P>When he refused to resign I had no realistic option but to remove him under section 16 (2) (b) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Although he has been removed from office he will continue to be entitiled to receive a fee of £7,500 a year up to and including 28 January 1996.</P>
    <P>While we are here today to discuss the removal of Mr. Hynes, there can be no doubt that if I had taken a different decision we would be here today debating the resignation of some or all of the other board members.  This is a classic case of the Minister being in a &ldquo;no win&rdquo; situation.</P>
    <P>I have acted in the best interest of Telecom Éireann, their employees, their customers and the taxpayer.  Telecom Éireann have made great strides over the past ten to 12 years and we now have a first-class telecommunications service. They must continue to improve their efficiency and reduce their costs. Charges must be brought closer to those of our major trading partners.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications environment, both nationally and internationally, is becoming increasingly competitive.  I will take a personal interest in ensuring that Telecom are geared to cope with the competition. I ask those who argue that they have Telecom's interest at heart not to undermine their achievements or hinder them continuing development.</P>
    <P>There was some speculation in the media that differences of opinion on privatisation might have contributed to the disagreement between the chairman and the board of the company.  I am assured there were no such discussions at the board.  Decisions on privatisation are a matter for the Government and not for the board of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have asked Professor John Scanlan to take over as acting chairman.  He will <Col N="567" /> have exactly the same brief as his predecessor. Professor Scanlan is currently professor of electronic engineering in University College, Dublin, and a member of their governing body.</P>
    <P>He has been a director of Telecom Éireann since 1984.  He, therefore, is closely acquainted with and has a deep understanding of telecommunications in Ireland.  At a European level, he is a member of the COST telecommunications group.  He is the only Irish Fellow of the prestigious Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers of the United States.</P>
    <P>I expect him to ensure that the board deal speedily and decisively with the major issues facing the company.  Cost containment and, indeed, reduction must be a priority and benefits must be passed on to the customer in the form of real reductions in charges, and to the taxpayer in the form of increases in dividend.</P>
    <P>In addition the acting chairman will have a major role in ensuring that the company's control systems are revised and updated as I requested in my letter of 27 March last in order to protect the interest of the shareholder &mdash; who is the taxpayer.  The board will have to satisfy themselves that they have all the appropriate information to supervise the company properly.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the staff of Telecom Éireann who have made a major contribution to the success of the company by their full co-operation with technological change, changing work practices and cost reductions.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the board of Telecom Éireann and in their capacity to have the wisdom to put recent events behind them and in their determination to ensure that the company will continue to be successful in facing the increasingly competitive communications environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sad day for this House.  Telecom Éireann should have been the greatest flagship of the State sector, a company capable of <Col N="568" /> delivering high quality service and of earning high profits.  They would have been capable of standing as one of the greatest examples of a company emerging from the State sector able to hold their head high, but in the space of just six months we have seen them being plunged into turmoil and confusion.  The Government must take primary blame for this position.  The Government left Telecom Éireann without a board between December 1991 and April 1992, a crucial period for the company.  Members will recall that this company went through a controversial and difficult period following the resignation of their former chairman and to leave that board at sea for a vital period of four months represents serious neglect on the part of the Government.  The board still require three appointments, they are currently operating below strength and working from a very narrow base.  At present only two members of the board have any practical business experience outside Telecom Éireann.  This is not a healthy position for any company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will recall that this position is a direct consequence of a mandate given by the former Minister to the former chairman on how he was to conduct the business.  A letter to the former chairman from the Minister made it clear that he wanted the incoming chairman to be involved in the day-to-day operations of the business.  That letter stated: &ldquo;these duties are important and will involve in my view a serious time commitment each week&rdquo;.  The mandate requested the former chairman to examine the ability of the company to make strategic plans appropriate to the increasingly competitive environment they faced.  He was to play a direct role in the control and assessment of capital expenditure programmes which are now very substantial indeed as the Minister stated in the letter. The former chairman was to actively involve himself in ensuring a performance which resulted in the maintenance and, if possible, improvement of the State's financial returns.  That was a mandate, in my view, for very heavy involvement by this company, and it was <Col N="569" /> that mandate which, according to all reports, brought the chairman into conflict with the board.  I will return to this point later because many of the issues which the chairman highlighted are substantive and are of concern to the general public.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the Minister was not alerted to the friction within the company until after a vote of confidence was taken by the board.  It would seem that at the very minimum the Minister should be awere of the conduct by the board of its affairs as their members were newly appointed and the board had commenced operations after a lapse of a long period, particularly at such a vital and sensitive time for the board and the company.</P>
    <P>It also seems extraordinary that the Minister did not have any meeting with the outgoing chairman about whose conduct she was so critical in her remarks. The Minister's main criticism of the former chairman, apart from the fact that he had lost the confidence of the board was that he had provided her with documents which incorporated his vision but he had not cleared them with the board in advance.  If that was a major issue in the eyes of the Minister she should have gone to the trouble to find out what was behind that state of affairs.  The Government and the Minister have not given sufficient attention to the board and their operations and this is one of the reasons the company are in turmoil.</P>
    <P>Very serious substantive issues have been raised by the outgoing chairman. He raised the issue on a broad plane of the declining profitability of this company that could by 1994 see their profits fall by almost one-third.  He also drew attention to the lack of preparedness of the company for competition which was in line with the mandate he was given by the former Minister.  However, a specifc issue of particular concern to this House is his questioning of procedures adopted for presenting capital expenditure proposals to the board of that company. These proposals I understand run to a level of £200 million each year.  It would seem that the former chairman's concerns in this matter were not just his <Col N="570" /> concerns and gripes but were backed up by an independent Price Waterhouse consultancy report.  There is little mention in the Minister's statement about these apparent defects in procedures by the board.  Is the Minister aware of these defects? Has she issued any guidelines to the board as to how they should handle these situations, or are the board to be left in a vacuum in the coming years?</P>
    <P>We would like to see Telecom Éireann, a company capable of immense performance, returning to a confident path. Looking to the future I cannot but express unease at a new chairman being appointed today to a board who cannot have the strong base from which to tackle the very serious issues confronting Telecom Éireann.  He is being appointed as an interim chairman.  That is not the way to confront the serious issues that must be addressed in Telecom Éireann.  I can see no sense in awaiting the outcome of the report into the property deals concerning the Johnston Mooney &amp; O'Brien site before appointing a permanent chairman. If it was the Chair's company or my company, which it is, would we postpone recruiting and finding the best person for the job until some controversy was overcome?  No; we would say that from today we want to see a chairman with a strong mandate equipping the company for competition and move on from the controversy that they had experienced. The Minister, and the Government, carry considerable responsibility for the problems we heard of today.  They have not been diligent in their responsibilities in relation to this company.  They left the company rudderless, without a board. The company will face into the future with only an interim chairman.  I do not believe this is an acceptable approach by the Government and I ask the Minister to elaborate on the terms of reference being given to the incoming chairman.  I should like to be told of his long term role in relation to tackling the serious issues the company must address if they are to return to their proper role and have the people's highest confidence.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not, in <Col N="571" /> her carefully worded statement, shown much leadership which is badly needed in Telecom Éireann in the wake of the sacking of Mr. Hynes.  I would hope when replying she will clarify what she wants and what she is setting out to achieve in Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>The appointment of Mr. Hynes as chairman of Telecom was a serious error and the Labour Party pointed that out at the time.  His track record has been one of active hostility to any concept of public sector enterprise.  Obviously one could not dispute his dismissal because of what we know about the man.  One might question his appointment in the first instance. It is unfortunate that the person who appointed him is not answering for that today.  The judgment of the former Minister for Communications, now the Minister for Education, must be questioned in relation to the appointment of Mr. Hynes some months ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Communications spoke of the conflict between the chairman and the board in relation to his style of operation.  What are we talking about here? She also referred to his interaction with senior management and the divisiveness created within the board.  Perhaps she would clarify those matters.  It is quite amazing that the Minister was not informed until recent days of the difficulties which were brewing in the company since Mr. Hynes's appointment. I do not believe it is an occasion for recrimination or for looking at the personality factor.  One has to be far more concerned with the future of Telecom, whose importance in the economic life of the country the Minister outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important issue facing the company is not the appointment of another temporary chairman but a statement of philosophy from the Minister and the Government on the future of Telecom and what the Government want to achieve.  Are we talking about an efficient and profitable public sector company or is it part of the Government's agenda to break up this company and hive it off to the highest bidder?  It can be said with a degree of certainty that if this company <Col N="572" /> is put up for sale the highest bidder will not be an Irish interest.</P>
    <P>Most of us are aware of the transformation that has taken place in Telecom in the short space of ten years.  Many will remember the delays and the long waiting lists for telephones in the seventies and early eighties.  Telecom has been dramatically transformed from a loss-making company to a large profit maker and contributor to the Exchequer. We were slow off the starting blocks in the seventies but we have built a very efficient transmission system, almost completely based on digital technology. Ireland is now well placed to exploit advanced technological developments such as the integrated service digital networks. The technological transformation within our telecommunications services has been achieved by Telecom staff and management without any difficulties. The technicians in the service not only taught themselves the new technology but have since then been able to go to other parts of the world to assist in the development of technologies.  Staffing levels have been reduced from 18,000 to 13,500.  All this has been achieved without difficulty, with consensus between management and the Communication Workers' Union and without a single industrial dispute.  That is worth remembering.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that the fundamental policy decisions to invest the necessary funds were made in the early seventies and the then Minister, Conor Cruise O'Brien, played a major role in setting out the future programme for telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The Government should clarify for this House, the people and the workforce of Telecom, what they want to achieve. Leadership is urgently required.  There is a necessity for a major strategic decision. The Dáil has not had the opportunity of having an input into this.  We are more interested in defining the broader issue of the Government's intent in relation to Telecom than engaging in recriminations because of the sacking of the chairman of the company after a short time.  The Government must clarify whether they <Col N="573" /> are in favour of an efficient and profitable public sector company remaining in Irish hands.  In recent months there has been much speculation about privatisation, making Telecom more efficient and competitive and making it available in the market-place.  The Labour Party would oppose that.  It is a successful company and has capital and technological investment. That should remain in the hands of the Irish people, of Irish managers and the workforce.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of Telecom's alleged lack of preparation for the new competitive environment.  This ignores the restructuring which has taken place within the company, with the agreement of unions and management.  The purpose of the restructuring is to provide multi-disciplinary work teams capable of responding quickly to any customer requirement.  We have all seen in recent years the tremendous work to make Telecom competitive.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity when replying to set out clearly Government policy in relation to Telecom.  Is Telecom to remain an Irish company or is it to be put on the market place for privatisation? It would be a disaster for Telecom if the Government were to privatise it.  Telecom is capable of competing at the highest level on an international basis. The Dáil should be informed on this matter.  The Taoiseach promised that he would lead an open Government.  If the Government are to carry through on that commitment, this is an opportunity in relation to a very important public sector company which has not had in recent months the leadership that it deserves and has been embroiled in controversy which has had nothing to do with the workforce.  By and large it has had to do with the former chairman.  There is an onus on the Government to show the workforce at Telecom that they are committed to retaining the company in public ownership.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether the newly-appointed temporary chairman has a commitment to public sector enterprise.  If not, we are heading towards disaster.  It should be a matter of <Col N="574" /> record in this House whether the Minister has discussed with the incoming chairman his commitment to public sector enterprise. Not to be tolerated is the appointment of people to public sector companies who basically do not have the interests of public sector companies at heart.  If they are not interested in public sector enterprise and committed to it, they should not be asked to lead in that area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to state as lucidly as possible the Government's intent for Telecom.  The workforce of 13,500 people are waiting for an indication that the Minister and the Government are prepared to back the workforce in Telecom in fighting the competition which they will face in the coming decade.  They also want an indication that the Government are fully supportive of Telecom's efforts to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second occasion within twelve months on which the chairman of Telecom Éireann has left office in the most controversial of circumstances.  Irrespective of the factors which led to the removal from office of Mr. Hynes, this development is unfortunate and is likely to lead to further disruption in the affairs of the company.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann is not just one of our most successful, but also one of our most important State companies.  It has over 13,000 employees and provides telecommunication services to every business in the country and the great majority of private homes.  An efficient, well-run telecommunications service is essential for the proper development of manufacturing and service industries, for tourism, for the media, for farming &mdash; for virtually every area of social, commercial and business life.  We all have a stake in the continued successful development of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employees of Telecom Éireann had hoped that the appointment of a new chairman last January would have marked the ending of an unfortunate phase in the history of the company and the opening of a new era where directors and staff could get down to tackling the <Col N="575" /> problems the company faced and ensure the continued successful development of the company and its expansion into new areas of enterprise.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the appointment of Mr. Hynes seems to have had the opposite effect, plunging the company into a period of internal strife and creating a series of clashes between the chairman and the rest of the board and the chairman and senior management.  This was the last thing that Telecom needed.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the appointment of Mr. Hynes was a mistake and that the mandate which he believed was given to him by the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Brennan, compounded the error.  Traditionally the role of the boards of semi-State companies has been a general, supervisory one, and the day-to-day management of the company has been left to the full-time company executives. Those appointed to the board were generally people who had some experience of the area of activity of the company involved, and their expertise was used to guide the company and to supervise the overall business strategy.</P>
    <P>This is a formula which has generally worked fairly well, but was a procedure which was ignored by the former Minister Deputy Brennan, when he appointed Mr. Hynes.  First, Mr. Hynes had no particular experience of the telecommunications area, and secondly he clearly believed that he had a mandate from Minister Brennan, to operate a very direct, hands-on policy, which would allow him to be involved in the day-to-day decision-making of the company. This was a recipe for trouble.  No company can operate with two chief executives; yet that is effectively what Telecom has had since January last, and the problem rests specifically with the Minister for communications of the day, Deputy Brennan.  It is also curious to recall the great troubles suffered by RTE for similar reasons while the same Minister was at the helm.</P>
    <P>It is, I believe, unprecedented for the board of a semi-State company to pass a vote of no confidence &mdash; unanimously or <Col N="576" /> otherwise &mdash; in its chairman, and the fact that this happened in Telecom is a clear indication of the depth of the divisions that existed there.  The no-confidence motion was virtually unanimous and there is no indication that management or workers disagreed with the motion. Either Mr. Hynes was out of step with everyone, or everyone else was out of step except Mr. Hayes.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the performance of Mr. Hynes as Chairman of Telecom contrasts starkly with the glowing accounts of his management and administrative abilities which were heavily promoted in some of the Sunday newspapers.  My information is that his handling of board meetings was inadequate &mdash; to put it mildly.  Even on a simple level, meetings did not start on time.  Agendas were not adhered to, contradictory decisions were taken by the chairman.  Most seriously budgets had not been adopted on time, and the whole atmosphere of uncertainty and indecision was being felt at all levels of the company and was hitting morale badly.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hynes has been very critical of the managment of Telecom and has publicly accused them of being &ldquo;reluctant to accept the need for change&rdquo;.  Interestingly the former Chairman of Telecom, Mr. Smurfit, went out of his way, on his departure from the company, to pay tribute to the qualities of the company's management.  It has to be said that under the current management and workforce the performance of Telecom has been turned around, especially since it was freed from direct Civil Service control over ten years ago.</P>
    <P>From a position of losses of £83 million in 1983-84, they delivered profits of £94 million in 1990-91 and are expected to return an even higher level of £115 million next year.  There are few privately owned companies who could boast such a record.  Revenue per worker has risen from £34,000 in 1987 to £56,000 in 1991. While once a new customer might have had to wait years for connections, most applications for new phones are now dealt with within a matter of weeks.  All of this was achieved while staff numbers <Col N="577" /> were coming down from a maximum of around 18,000 to their present level of about 13,000.  It was also done without any significant industrial disputes. Clearly something was being done right.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that there is any room for complacency on the part of Telecom management.  They cannot afford to take their eye off the ball or their ear from the ground.  The company face significant challenges and problems in the future. Deregulation, increasing competition and rapid advances in technology are all issues which will have to be faced up to. But there are also opportunities &mdash; there is scope for expansion by Telecom in the domestic telecommunications area as well as the international market where its expertise is well acknowledged.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that the whole Hynes affair was not linked to demands which we have heard time and time again from avaricious private interests for the privatisation of Telecom.  Right wing commentators and politicians seem to consider it somehow immoral and unacceptable that a State company should be making profits.  It is fine for State-owned companies to make losses, but as soon as they begin to turn in a profit, then they should be handed over to the private sector.  The previous chairman of Telecom made no secret of his belief that the company should be privatised.  The then Minister for Communications, Deputy Brennan, is one of the ideological champions of privatisation and it is asking a lot to accept that this was not a factor in the appointment of Mr. Hynes.  The preoccupation of the new chairman with securing huge reductions in staff numbers &mdash; even at a time when we are approaching 300,000 on the dole queues &mdash; seems to have been designed to make the company an even more attractive target for privatisation.  Mr. Hynes's record with Tara mines speaks eloquently of his capacity to chop workers' jobs, in which company alone he reduced, over a period, the workforce from 7,000 to below 2,000.</P>
    <P>We have seen the ugly side of privatisation in the series of scandals arising from the sale of the Irish Sugar Company, <Col N="578" /> and we must avoid sending Telecom on the same road.  A popular myth exists that a privately owned telephone company would be automatically more efficient. However, the experience has been in Britain that the telephone service has not improved and thus most people found it made little if any difference.</P>
    <P>Given the experience with the last two chairmen it is now surely time to appoint somebody as chairman of the company who has some commitment to the public service ethic and who does not see his role as simply preparing the way for privatisation.</P>
    <P>In this regard I welcome the announcement of the Minister today informing the House that an acting chairman has been appointed.  Given the qualifications she has outlined of Professor Scanlan I wonder why in January the then Minister for Communications could not have looked to him as a very suitable and well qualified person with expertise in the area.  It needs to be explained why a miner was dug up from Tara and brought in to run Telecom when such expertise already existed on the board.  I also have to ask why we have an acting chairperson? Why is there not an announcement in the House today of the appointment to the company of a full-time chairperson who will get in there and work and restore morale to Telecom which they clearly deserve in clear and unambiguous leadership.  Can the Minister advise me by what arrangement does the person whom she has summarily dismissed stand to gain the sum of £7,000-plus per annum, which is far inexcess of what a single person on the dole will get and of whom there are hundreds of thousands.  After spending no more than five or six months working in a company that led to his summary dismissal it seems a rather extraordinary small twist in this arrangement and affair.</P>
    <P>Given the excellent performance of Telecom and the fact that they are now paying a substantial annual dividend to the Exchequer there is less case than ever for privatisation.  A clear statement from the Minister that the company will not be privatised is necessary to restore morale <Col N="579" /> in Telecom and allow the workforce to be confident that the sacrifices they have made will not have the result of adding to the profit of speculators and no one else.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with a number of the issues raised.  First of all, I hope Deputy Bruton was not in any way suggesting that Mr. Harold O'Sullivan, as acting chairman of the company in an interim period had in some way not carried out his duties efficiently and effectively and absolutely in confirmation of the mandate laid down by a full-time chairman of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's allegation that the Government have not given due care and consideration to the board of this company. From the very beginning of the setting up of this company in 1984 the staff and the board have received the support and confidence of each of the Governments in all of the intervening periods since. The company &mdash; as Deputy Spring and Deputy McCartan have made clear and as I said in my first intervention &mdash; have made enormous strides under great difficulty over those years.  The staff have been asked to adapt to changing work practices.  All the changes which have brought the company, of which we can all be proud, a State company, to their present stage, have taken place &mdash; as Deputy Spring rightly pointed out &mdash; without any dispute within the company by staff members.  That is something of which we must all be appreciative, and we must all give support to the company staff who ensured that the changes took place on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputy Bruton is not saying that the present board members of the <Col N="580" /> company are not capable of carrying out the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report when there was a query about the appointment of Professor John Scanlan as acting chairman of the board. First of all, it would have been imprudent of me to rush into the appointment of a full-time chairman at this stage in the middle of a controversy of this sort, and Deputy McCartan would probably appreciate that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it was important for me, as Minister, to appoint a person as acting chairman who would have had an impeccable record as a member of the board of the company.  I hope Deputy Bruton is not suggesting that Professor Scanlan, with his impeccable pedigree and wealth of experience, not just on the Irish telecommunications scene, but also on the European and United States scene, is not suitable for the job.  There is no more experienced member of the board of Telecom Éireann than Professor Scanlan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton indicated that I stated in my speech that a full time chairman of the board would not be appointed until the report into the Telecom site was finalised.  I did not say that in my speech today.  I do not intend that to be the case and I did not state that at any time since the events of last Friday week.  However, it is important that I consider in great detail the appointment of a full time chairman of the company.  I am sure Deputy Bruton is not suggesting that the Minister should be concerned or involved in the day-to-day operational matters of Telecom Éireann.  That is a matter for the management and board of the company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring accused me of not showing much leadership and said it was time to spell out the philosophy of the Government in relation to the company. What do I want Telecom to be?  I want them to be efficient and able to meet the challenges that intense national and international competition will bring.  I want them to reduce their costs to their customers and I believe Members on all sides of the House agree with that.  I want them to be able to meet their customer demands immediately.</P>

      <P>I want them to be able to change work practices as they have in the past and as their staff have insisted they must continue in the future.  I do not believe any shareholder in a private company would have acted differently in this regard.  The company have changed substantially since they were founded and they and their staff accept that they must change even further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring asked if the new chairman had the interests of public sector enterprise at heart.  His record since 1984, and indeed as a member of the interim board prior to that, shows the tremendous commitment Professor Scanlan has had to Telecom Éireann.  The 13,500 employees of the company have my full backing and confidence in being able to prepare the company for the intense they face.</P>
      <P>The former chairman of the company was not an executive chairman and, therefore, should not have been involved in the day-to-day administrative work which, in the normal course of events would be carried out by the chief executive and senior management of the company. Telecom Éireann have made major strides, the management and staff showed what they can deliver in the eighties. I am confident that they can deliver even more in the nineties.  There are challenges and opportunities ahead for the company and I want to ensure that they are fit and able to meet those challenges and address those opportunities.</P>

    <Title>Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members regret that existing mature students will not be eligible for grants and this cannot be over-emphasised.  The Minister will be seen as being incapable of heeding the concerns and views of the majority of this House if he does not accept amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that existing mature students qualify for mature student grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some reservations about the method of means-testing mature students for grant eligibility.  Those fears were compounded by a statement by the Minister that mature students who are dependent on their parents will be assessed by reference to their own income, if any, and that of their parents.  Is the Minister implying that in assessing mature students for third level grant eligibility, their own income plus that of their parents will be taken for means-testing? <Col N="583" /> This would be totally unjust.  While this may not be intended, nevertheless the Minister implied it in the speech.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another query in this regard.  I understand that the Bill refers to full-time mature students and one must ask how full-time mature students could have their own income.  I am sure the majority of students who take the initiative and return, perhaps, to second level education in order to qualify for a place in third level education, will have to take career breaks or leave of absence from work.  In all cases they would have to give up their full-time job in order to participate in full-time third level education. Therefore, one must question what is meant by &ldquo;their own income&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will also be seeking clarification on Committee Stage of what is meant by mature students dependent on their parents. Does that mean that an unemployed person is considered dependent on their parents or will they be assessed on their social welfare income?  It would have to be in exceptional circumstances that one would determine a mature person &mdash; defined in the Bill as a person over 23 years of age &mdash; as dependent on his or her parents.  They must fit into either of two categories, they must be employed or unemployed.  If they are employed they have their own income and if they are unemployed, they are in receipt of social welfare payments.  I look forward to clarification of that from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another important question that arises with regard to the means-testing of mature students' own income is whether the Minister intends assessing them on their income of the preceding or of the current year, which would make a vast difference with regard to their eligibility. For example, to date what has been assessed has always been the parents' income of the preceding year when assessing students' eligibility for third level grants. If the same assessment criteria are to be applied to mature students we must remember that many of them would have been in employment up to the time they will have taken up their place in college, which might mean they would be deemed <Col N="584" /> to be ineligible for grant purposes.  It would be my hope that the relevant year's income to be applied for this purpose would be that in which the student enters third level education.</P>
    <P>Part-time mature students have been omitted from the provisions of this Bill. We must remember that family circumstances may not permit many people to return to third level education whole-time but will be forced to participate in part-time courses.  There should be some financial support for such students.  It is totally unfair that a mature student, who may have to retain his or her job, should have to incur the extra costs on resuming third level education.  I hope there will be some provision incorporated on Committee Stage to provide for part-time mature students.  We talk much about re-training and re-education. Again, I believe ways should be devised of helping part-time mature students to further themselves educationally.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction but it is to be regretted that the Minister made the fatal mistake of excluding the existing 350 mature students.  The plea of all Members that they be included should be listened to because their exclusion has spoiled an otherwise excellent Bill.  As has been pointed out, the cost of their inclusion would be of the order of £1 million.  In the interests of equity they should be included.  This would entail one further step on the part of the Minister and would be much appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill which amends the 1968 and 1978 Acts.  It is to be welcomed that under its provisions in future local authorities will be able to award grants to mature students. All Members have been complaining about and are aware of the anomalies that have obtained in the case of mature students seeking college places.  I am glad to note also that its provisions will cover students who sit for their examinations outside the State.  Henceforth, if they secure a college place they will be automatically eligible for consideration for these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Members, I am disappointed <Col N="585" /> that the provisions of the Bill do not cater for present mature students. I hope the Minister can devise some method of rendering its provisions sufficiently flexible to include them, since all public representatives will have received representations from the Union of Students in Ireland and the Mature Students' Association in this regard. They clearly pointed out that when the European Social Fund grants were extended to mature students in January 1991, they applied to all students, present and future.  Those two organisations feel it would not be unreasonable to have the same criteria apply to the local authorities' grants scheme in the case of mature students since there are only 350 involved.  I hope this matter will be examined by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>In the past, one committee of Galway County Council, on which I had the honour to serve, was the higher education grants committee, of which there are only a few nationwide and may meet once or twice a year.  I am no longer a member of Galway County Council but I should like to pay tribute to that committee with whose members I remain in contact.  I should like to pay tribute in particular to their former staff officer, Mr. Tony Murphy, and their present staff officer, Mr. Tony Barrett, for their fine work.  Thankfully, their submissions to the Department over the years have not always fallen on deaf ears.  For example, their proposals for the indexation of grants, that is that they be in line with the current rate of inflation, were accepted by the Department in 1986. Another of their proposals relating to circumstances in which more than one family member was attending a third level institution has been acceded to by the Government under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a welcome announcement made earlier this year.  The Galway committee also proposed the idea of a covenant, now part of the income tax regime.</P>
    <P>I have always advocated that there be more information freely available about higher education grants.  At various meetings of that committee I proposed <Col N="586" /> the publication of a simple booklet by the Department of Education giving details of the different types of grants available, higher education grants payable through local authorities, European Social Fund grants and vocational education committee grants.  There are corresponding booklets available on social welfare benefits. The Department of Health have published a booklet on health benefits and entitlements but, to my knowledge, none is available from the Department of Education.  Indeed, I would advocate one body being responsible for the administration of higher education grants and vocational education committee scholarships.  The present position is that on completion of second level education students are unsure whether they should apply to their local authority, the vocational education committee or if they should be considered for European Social Fund grants.  This has been causing considerable confusion for quite some time past.  While this legislation is welcome the Minister should first clear up the confusion that exists.</P>
    <P>Another proposal related to income limits.  The suggestion was that the level of grants should be based on net income rather than gross income.  This is always mentioned in the context of PAYE workers but using net income as a base would give some idea of the profits of the self-employed.  It is often said that all the self-employed get higher education grants for their children.  I do not think that is true but if the income limits referred to net income rather than gross income the profits of the self-employed would be clear.  It would, of course, help the PAYE workers because we all know that for the PAYE worker it is not the gross amount indicated on the pay check that is important but what he takes home. I know the Minister has just announced a very substantial increase in the income limits for higher education grants but I would nevertheless ask him to examine this proposal.  Another proposal was that people investing in a savings scheme for education purposes should be allowed some tax relief on that investment.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to consider <Col N="587" /> the question of students living just outside the 15 mile radius of the college. It is unfair that such students would not get a maintenance grant even though public transport might not be available to a family that has no other way of travelling to the college.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the announcement made by the Minister concerning the increase in the income limits for higher education grants.  The Minister said yesterday that under the new arrangement a family with anything from one to three children would qualify for full fee and full maintenance grants on an income of £15,000.  That is a major increase on the present limit of £10,787. This same family will be eligible for a full fee grant with an income of up to £18,000 and a 50 per cent fee grant up to an income limit of £19,000.  I have had many complaints about the scheme.  I am glad to say that today, for the first time, I got a telephone call appreciating the fact that something was being done about income limits and I welcome that improvement.</P>
    <P>There has been much concern about the ESF grants.  I know the Minister was trying to ensure that there would be the same criteria for regional colleges as for the universities.  He has, to some extent, succeeded in this, in that he has now introduced a fairly substantial increase in the income limits.  However, it is important to point out that there was never any question but that the fee was to be paid anyway in the case of the regional colleges and it was only maintenance grants that were in question.  I hope this will be just the start of looking at the whole question of eligibility for these third level grants.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the regional technical colleges because I feel that sometimes they do not get the credit they deserve.  It is because of the great work the regional technical colleges are doing that there was such concern about the ESF grants.  I attended a health board meeting in Castlebar yesterday and there was a very large lobby of people there strongly urging the Minister to set up a regional technical college in Castlebar.  I <Col N="588" /> heard the Minister say this morning that he has an open mind on the proposal.  I hope that proposal will succeed because the regional technical colleges have provided a great range of subjects in the various colleges.  In many instances they have difficulty in getting accommodation for the students because the numbers have increased so much over the years. This has been a feature of third level education and it is a major problem in Galway.  It is therefore important that maintenance grants be increased.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by welcoming what has been announced here today.  It is a small amendment to the Bill but it is very important to mature students and those who have got their qualifications outside the State.  The whole question of the way we deal with third level grants will have to be examined, and the Minister has made a good start in the Bill and in announcing increased income limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other contributors to this debate, I welcome the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Kitt on the difficulty of getting all the information from the different sources about grants. Just when students have overcome the difficulties of the CAO and have decided what to do they have to look at the possibilities of applying for a grant and that is very difficult.  It is incumbent on the Minister and the Department to bring forward some kind of booklet or information leaflet that will point parents and students in a particular direction.</P>
      <P>Education is the area in which one sees the greatest inequality in Irish life.  The students in universities and other higher education institutes tend to come almost entirely from the middle and higher income sections of society.  There are great ghettoes of people not just in Dublin but all around the country who are not alone disadvantaged in many other areas but disadvantaged educationally because they have not had the opportunity of education that would take account of their abilities and their potential to achieve success and educational skills.  Anything that can be done to equalise things is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> Third level education can be very expensive.  This scheme will bring into the educational fold people who have been disadvantaged.  Very few people can afford to pay for their children's education. My three children received third level education, and I am glad to be able to say that my husband and I were lucky enough to be able to pay for it.  I believe we should forego the idea of introducing free third level education until such time as the educational possibilities for everyone, especially people who are socially and financially disadvantaged, are brought up to par.  Once this is done we can then set about dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the grant scheme for mature students.  This scheme will make redundant the scheme I introduced some years ago when I was Minister. One has to be 23 years or over to be a mature student.  I am very pleased no upper age limit is being set for mature students.  This means that people of any age can apply for a grant to attend a third level educational institution.  This scheme will open the flood-gates in terms of the number of women who apply for grants for third level education.  I have to say that the scheme I introduced in the mid-eighties was totally sexist &mdash; it gave women grants for third level education. The amount of £50,000 allocated under that scheme was derisory.  An extraordinary number of applications were submitted for grants under that scheme.  I was amazed at the use which was made of it by women who had wanted to go to university all their lives but who had to leave school at 15 or 16, before they did their leaving certificate, and go out to work and perhaps later raise a family.  Under this scheme their first year fees were paid for them.  As well as going to college they took up jobs to pay for their fees the following year.  A woman from Sligo who got first class honours in her examinations phoned me the day she got her results.  She had travelled to Galway to pursue her course.  These schemes give people who really want to attend college an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Many housewives who have come <Col N="590" /> together in information and education groups have decided to do their leaving certificate so that they can get into university. These women will benefit under the scheme.  I thank the Minister for introducing this scheme.  Many young students take it for granted that it is possible to pursue a range of studies.  I should like to point out that college was regarded as a luxury and rarity by my generation. I am glad to think that under this scheme people of 30, 40 and 50 years of age will be given a chance to attend university.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to eligibility for the scheme and a problem which I have come across more than once.  This relates to mature students who want to go to college and who are dependent on their spouses, and students who have to make their applications through their parents. In the case of a separated couple where the children are living with the wife &mdash; these are the cases I have come across &mdash; the father's income is taken into account in assessing eligibility.  Very often they will not give full details of their income for a number of reasons.  This has caused difficulties for a number of students.</P>
    <P>One student who phoned me was in tears and very distressed at the fact that the application was being turned down because her father would not co-operate properly and give the full details of his income.  I intervened in this case and got in touch with the Department.  The people with whom I spoke were extremely helpful and understanding and the problem was resolved.  One can understand the difficulties involved for a young student, whose mother is on a limited income, trying to get into university. For example, they might have to exist on a deserted wife's maintenance allowance.  Can the mother's income be taken into account in assessing eligibility? I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    <P>I join with other speakers in making a very sincere appeal to the Minister to extend this scheme to mature students who are in college at present.  As has been pointed out, there are only 350 mature students.  The cost of extending the scheme to cover these students would <Col N="591" /> be less than £1 million.  I have received numerous telephone calls about this issue and also the letter sent to other public representatives.  I appeal to the Minister to include this group of students in this scheme.  They point out in their letter that their request is not without precedent and that when the ESF grant scheme was extended to mature students on 1 January 1991 it immediately applied to all students.  Given that precedent, I ask the Minister to look favourably on this very deserving group and to include them in the scheme.</P>
    <P>A booklet on the scheme should be published by the Department so that it can be readily available to parents and students and to public representatives who may wish to send it to their constituents. I ask the Minister to look at the position of students who live with their mothers who are on a limited income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the much broadened and enlightened higher education grant scheme.  I represent a major urban area where there are many unemployment blackspots.  It is very difficult for young people from these areas to gain a foothold in the jobs market.  This scheme will enable many students from these areas to gain access to third level education. This is a positive step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the Minister and the Government have taken this enlightened approach.  In the medium and long term it will have a very beneficial effect on many communities which are finding it very difficult to gain access to the jobs market.  Like Deputy Fennell, I am very impressed with the measure which provides access for mature students to third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make one suggestion to the Minister.  There should be recognition in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that some form of financial support be made available to mature students at all levels of education.  As a member of the board of Collinstown community college I found that courses <Col N="592" /> were available for housewives who wished to improve their knowledge in such areas as home economics, and in other areas, but even though the level of fees was small many people could not afford to pay them because the head of the household was unemployed or there were large families to be provided for. Therefore these people were denied access to courses.  Perhaps the Minister would consider, in consultation with the vocational education committees, taking action to improve this position.</P>
    <P>I proposed that County Dublin vocational education committee put forward a proposal in this regard.  The chairman highlighted the number of applications they had received for a range of courses, courses that would be of tremendous benefit to local communities, to parents who married very young, to people in overcrowded housing, those who resettled in the inner city and large communities whose only focal point is the community college.  Courses could be provided for these people.</P>
    <P>As regards the extension of access to third level colleges, in the age of advanced technology the more education and skills our young people can acquire the greater will be the opportunities in the jobs market.  I am very pleased that a third level regional college is being provided in the Dublin South-West area of Tallaght.  That college will accommodate in excess of 2,000 students.  As the Minister said, there will be a substantial increase &mdash; in the region of 75,000 &mdash; in the number of people who will have access to third level education.  This is the right direction in which to proceed. However, much more can be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the new satellite towns of Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown, sites were reserved for third level facilities but the provision of additional third level spaces does not appear to be part of the Department's programme at present. This matter should be considered because there may not be sufficient places to accommodate the many students who will now have access to third level education. I trust that the Minister will draw <Col N="593" /> up some contingency plan whereby if access is sought for more places than are available action will be taken to deal with the matter.  As the Minister said this morning, it is very difficult to predict the take-up in this area.  I suggest that the take-up in my constituency will be very high.  Career guidance personnel in postprimary schools will probably play a key role in advising students who may benefit from third level education.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the senior college in Ballyfermot has broadened the curriculum and availability of subjects, catering for a whole range of students who would not otherwise have availed of third level education.  That is the sort of thinking that should be applied in these colleges.  This scheme will be of particular benefit, in areas of high unemployment. A previous Minister for Education issued a circular on primary education and in a two month period I and other Members of this House addressed up to 10,000 parents at a series of meetings.  The one subject in which people are very interested is education.  It is the wish of every parent that their sons and daughters receive an education as good as if not better than they received themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome this decisive step forward. The Minister and Minister of State have struck the right nerve and have introduced this measure at the right time. Hopefully, the extension of access to third level education will help reduce unemployment.  We continually hear about difficulties in terms of the unskilled workforce regaining a foothold in the jobs market.  If we are to make major strides in the nineties and beyond and if our young people are to have the best opportunities we must broaden the education system.  The best example is the so-called economic prosperity and development in Japan and the Pacific Basin where, by taking advantage of technology, they progressed dramatically.  Obviously their educational system also advanced in a technical direction.  The Culliton report favoured technical education.  I sincerely hope that our third level institutions will cater for the demand of the nineties and <Col N="594" /> that the necessary subjects, technical skills and courses, including essential languages, will be available.</P>
    <P>Overall we are proceeding in the right direction.  The Minister said that £1.3 billion is being spent on education but obviously that is still not enough.  This is probably one of the areas of high cost effectiveness.  I welcome the structure of grants which strikes a fair financial balance. I have no time for those who criticise the means test.  Those who can afford to educate their children should not get an advantage because it would displace more of those who should get the benefit of financial support.  In order to treat all our students equally we must give disadvantaged people financial support to give them more access to education.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider making financial support available for courses in the vocational education committee for mature students.  This could benefit not only households where unemployment is the order of the day but also the communities in which they live.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State who seems to be very busy, as he is on the floor of the House regularly in the interests of improving education facilities.  I have no doubt that the fruits of this Bill will be there for many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Any legislation which increases access to education should be welcomed.  A point which has already been made but on which repetition is justified relates to access of mature students already in the system to the benefit of these legislative proposals.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>In fact this has always been the position since the scheme was first introduced in 1968 and is therefore in the nature of a general principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education when put under some pressure years ago by me on the statutory basis of some of their regulations, introduced the glorious phrase &ldquo;the principle of continuity&rdquo; which one could translate into ordinary language as &ldquo;if you have been getting away with it for years, you should be able <Col N="595" /> to continue getting away with it&rdquo;.  As the Minister spoke of a general principle in this case, might I, with the greatest humility, suggest to him that a far deeper general principle is the principle of equity or equality.</P>
    <P>We need to think carefully about what happens when a mature student, let us say already in the system, hears details of the possibility of availing of education. Many mature students when they read the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and when they made phone calls were given the clear impression that they were doing something that was being recommended and that they would be included when provision was being made for those returning to third level education. I have not the slightest doubt about that.  Before this legislation was prepared and introduced I had meetings with the Minister for Education and with the Minister for Social Welfare about the situation that had arisen.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy for mature students for a number of reasons. I was in my twenties when I went through third level education for the first time. Also, I have taught mature students.  One must consider the great difficulties these students have in overcoming all sorts of pressure, in many cases abstracting themselves from the ranks of the unemployed and deciding to go into an atmosphere dominated by people very many younger than themselves and overcoming all of the psychlogical, personal, social, educational and even cultural difficulties in order to participate.  They are now being told that because they acted on what they felt was a fair and honourable construction of what was in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and of the information given to them verbally, they have in fact disqualified themselves from participation in the scheme.  It is very important that we understand what is happening to those people.  To raise expectations and then dash them is very much worse than to deny people the opportunity in the first place.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to respond generously to the welcome being given <Col N="596" /> around this House to the legislation by agreeing to the amendment being proposed in relation to taking care of mature students within the existing system.  It is an important point when one considers what has happened not only to those who were unemployed but also to many people who were in jobs which they felt had no future or were in jobs for which they had not an express vocation and who gave up those jobs and encountered costs so as to attend third level education.  It is absolutely miserable that for a figure of £1 million, a figure which, incidentally I do not accept, such students would be excluded.  If somebody made a commitment when the going was tougher and somebody else waited a year, there is no general principle under which the first person should be at an automatic economic advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> over the second person.  I cannot see how one could sustain that.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Finance advise the Department of Education that catering for those already in the system would cost £1 million, they would want to put it in context.  A sum of £1.6 billion is the figure given for education in the speech of the Minister of State today. This figure has for many years been almost exactly the same as the total cost of incentives given to Irish industry to create jobs.  If one were to ask where are the jobs for the £1.6 billion of our annual costed industrial policy and where are the results of our £1.6 billion investment in education, the answer is that the second kind of human investment will go on repaying itself year after year and will repay itself into generations.</P>
    <P>When people produce this figure for the total cost of education it is a dangerous sign.  I do not attribute views to either the Minister or the Minister of State but a previous speaker referred to it.  Among the most dangerous views on education I have ever read were the views in that volume dealing with education prepared by Wright and Tansey supporting the Culliton report, in which they suggested that one should have to justify educational expenditure in terms of the benefits not to the international trading <Col N="597" /> economy but the domestic Irish economy.  In arriving at that conclusion they departed from the principle that the thinking surrounding the Lynch report &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; could not be sustained because of cost.  I will not stray from the business we are discussing now, because we will have an opportunity to discuss the Green Paper in detail, but it is very important that that kind of thinking be knocked on the head.  The training costs of industry belong to industry and training costs should not be pushed into the educational system to drive out educational values.  We can debate most of that another day.</P>
    <P>Let me return to another principle which is very important in relation to access to education.  I welcome the opening up of greater access but there are a number of points that arise in relation to that.  This year alone I know mature students who lacked the means to pay their examination fees.  As a third level teacher of long standing I know of the changed nature of the Higher Education Authority's relationship with third level colleges which requires them to earn a proportion of their income from fees. Therefore, fees have to be increased. One might say that future grants will be adjusted to take account of the increase in fees.  Some colleges waived the fees of one or two students but many others did not.  The small hardship funds that exist in third level colleges are usually confined to students who have passed into the second or third year and all the demands for assistance cannot be met from these funds.</P>
    <P>There are pressures on the institutions who are deprived of funding and the obvious way out is to make a once-off arrangement to cater for those already in the system and reward them for having the foresight to return to education before the detail was in place.  It is quite monstrous to punish them for that.  If students enrolled for a week they have disqualified themselves from benefiting under the new scheme because of the definition of &ldquo;new applicant&rdquo;.  This use of words is totally unsustainable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions that improve <Col N="598" /> access to education.  I am not taking from that.  Third level education gains every time its population is extended by virtue of social class or age.  The Clancy report, among others, pointed out the vast discrimination in relation to third level entry.  I cannot remember the exact detail but the probability of a son or daughter of professional parents going to college was 12 times greater than that of parents in the manual occupations.  Entry to college related not only to parental means but the proximity of third level institutions and the provision of a wide diversity of third level institutions such as regional technical colleges as well as universities. The regional technical colleges are of considerable assistance in that regard.</P>
    <P>Students are now coming into a system that is overstretched.  I defy the heads of third level institutions to tell me &mdash; and I would love to be proved wrong &mdash; what special arrangements they have made for mature students who wish to undertake a course at their college.  I will share with the House my experience of teaching such people.  In the first term they are usually very nervous that their basic memory and writing skills are not as good as those of younger students.  However, after the first term this lack of confidence is usually conquered and they can pass out those who are very much younger than them because they can draw on the wonderful experiences, the dark as well as the bright experiences they have had.</P>
    <P>In my view the composition of third level institutes which is rather artificial not only in terms of social class but in the age cohort, benefits enormously by having mature people as part of the university population.  As we approach the end of the century I would like to think I lived in a society in which the heads of all the third level colleges would be photographed and filmed as they arrived at the Dáil, Seanad or the Taoiseach's office to make a case for having more mature students in their institutions. I would prefer that they would do something like this rather than speaking with such enthusiasm about our institutions becoming European.  If they want <Col N="599" /> to be truly European let them make a comparison with European colleges because in the equivalent institutions students are much older than the average student in Ireland and they are catered for.</P>
    <P>This is very important but it has not been grasped sufficiently.  It is suggested by some that one has exhausted all opportunities of participating in third level education if one has not succeeded in gaining a place at the age of 18 or 19, in other words if one has not got on the escalator at that age one has no right to do so. This is an appalling view and it has not disappeared.</P>
    <P>In times gone by the professions were very happy to look on as they reproduced themselves with privilege within the system but we must remember they were forced to budge from that.  They were quite happy to have large areas of professional training that excluded women. When I was at university the first woman enrolled to do engineering at University College Galway and, to her credit, she became a very distinguished graduate. There are many more people like her. The mature students are a very important wedge within the third level community. They are the forerunners of much wider participation in the future.</P>
    <P>At present the library grants for the third level institutions are derisory and we cannot dispose of this by saying that this is a matter for the individual third level institutions.  Indeed, they also have to cope with the embargo on filling posts. I note also that Members have a flair for congratulating their local third level institution &mdash; may their generosity forever continue &mdash; but I wish they would point out that many of the regional colleges of which they speak so glowingly have inferior eating facilities not to speak of practically non-existent reading facilities. One does not have to be around very long to see that.</P>
    <P>When we talk about a widening of access to education, we are talking about making the process more democratic. Women also fall into the category of mature students.  Many women may have <Col N="600" /> got married and reared their children at a time when they were subject to a tyranny of ideological conviction that they should abandon anything else other than the very important role of child rearing. A common view was that woman had been created with several children hanging off every finger of each hand, but times have changed.  People of my age group remember when women were driven from the public service.  If woman want to go back to college and recover part of their right to develop and make a very valuable contribution to society, should we place obstacles in their way?  I say this, while welcoming everything that is positive in the Bill, but there is an unanswerable case for amending section 5 to take account of the points that have been made.</P>
    <P>I want to comment about the availability of information.  Deputy Fennell spoke about the need for ease of access to information and that the information should be as accessible as possible.  I do not criticise members of the Government but I find it hard at times not to believe there is an ideology called the &ldquo;obstacle ideology&rdquo; in existence.  The definition of that ideology is that when one seeks to find out about something every conceivable obstacle is put in one's way. People are asked whether they satisfy this requirement and that requirement, where they live, whether they live alone and whether they are sure that they do not have a relative who is giving them a few pounds.  Let us be clear, we live in a society that has 20 per cent unemployed but has localised areas of 55 to 75 per cent unemployment.  If people in that mire of unemployment want to educate themselves they should be given every assistance to do so.</P>
    <P>I shall give one example only of what I am talking about, lest people think that I am indulging in abstraction about the ideology of obstacles to which I have referred.  Not so long ago I dealt with a social welfare case in which a woman's benefit had been discontinued because she and her husband were believed to sell minerals at GAA matches.  The investigating person took out the full GAA <Col N="601" /> calendar, including matches that would enjoy a very dedicated attendance of perhaps 16 spectators, multiplied the number of matches by a figure for estimated income and concluded that the woman should be disqualified from her benefit.  When sitting across the table from that woman and observing her distressed state, resulting from such thinking, I said to myself, &ldquo;That is what I mean by the ideology of placing obstacles in the way of self-improvement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A response is required from the Minister to resolve the difficulty that arises in section 5 (1) and I hope he accepts the amendments tabled for that section. Those responsible for administering the scheme will face challenges in relation to making it simple and accessible; the institutions in which mature students work will face challenges and will have responsibilities.  There will also be challenges and major tasks ahead for the professionals who work within third level institutions, people who themselves by and large come from a relatively narrow band in society.  I make that comment very carefully.  Those who work within our third level institutions are required to make an extra effort to welcome special people into third level education.  I feel that that general tendency towards democratisation is often not found among my colleagues.  I think that they are beating a path to the altar of neo-utilitarianism, suggesting regularly that they will be judged useful and looking for people to whom they might demonstrate their usefulness, when, as I might remind them, I was trained to be a teacher, they were trained to be teachers and they should be teachers.  It is curious that within third level education as well, being a good teacher is the least qualification for advancement in one's profession.  In terms of a society that has 20 per cent unemployed and when more people are coming from the otherwise excluded socio-economic groups &mdash; as the Minister's speech states &mdash; the ability of communication, the ability to be human, the ability to not try to trap students but to be in their favour, the ability to address their special difficulties, the ability to give <Col N="602" /> them confidence at times of low confidence and the ability to be generous in providing time for special tutorials, are the real skills of a democratic society. Yet the Culliton report, in that particular supporting volume, turns to the third level institutions and tells them to make themselves amenable to industry, not to international industry but to local, £1.2 billion-supported Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I ask a very serious question about local authority administration of grants. I have been a member of several local authorities at different times.  Local authorities will point out that they were given responsibilities without the capacity to deliver.  It is simply outrageous that students in different years have had to protest both outside and within local authority buildings while waiting for their grants.  When local authority members hear the phrase &ldquo;the money hasn't come down yet&rdquo;, do they realise that those applying for the grants cannot live on air and are being forced to take out loans and so forth?  Again, it is very interesting to note the way in which our financial institutions have set up their competing camps in third level institutions, busily searching out and regarding students as special people when they have a grant to lodge but just that little bit less special when they do not have a grant to lodge.</P>
    <P>I recognise the hand of the Department of Finance in one part of the Minister's speech.  I am not a conspiracy theorist at all, but when I hear, &ldquo;Total public expenditure on education in 1992 amounts to £1.6 billion, representing almost 20 per cent of total Government expenditure and almost 6 per cent of GDP&rdquo; I am encouraged to send back a message to the financial people through the Minister of State: would they give the figure for the percentage of total Government expenditure on our failed industrial policy and its percentage of gross domestic product?</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to talk about a substantial increase in allocations.  No one is scoring points; the fact is that it will take time, unfortunately, to make a major impact on our unemployment problem while we follow present policies. <Col N="603" /> If the market is to dictate, as so many people who disagree with me seem to accept, the provision of employment opportunities, would it not be a great deal more sensible to have educated people participating in that market rather than people who have been denied opportunity? We should also be very clear that while we in the House may, with different views, debate &mdash; with sincerity I think &mdash; problems such as unemployment there are many others who are abusing the level of unemployment by beating up the skill requirement for jobs and who also do not even bother to send adequate replies to the hordes of people who apply for limited vacancies.  Those people should change their ways.  The Minister stated that in 1992 third level education accounts for 22 per cent of expenditure compared to 8 per cent in 1966.  So what? The figures given are proportionate.</P>
    <P>I am not making a case for one kind of education expenditure as against another kind.  In the unlikely event &mdash; which grows more unlikely &mdash; of my ever being Minister for Education I would have to agree that if we were to undo inequality in our society we would need to put massive resources into primary education, we would need to change the system to provide greater success and we would need to complete a change in the second level curriculum.  However, that is not competing demand with third level education. The very best way to justify third level expenditure, if it is not to be a transfer to those who already have advantages, is by increasing the proportion of those within third level education who come in from age groups quite different from the usual secondary leaving age.  It also means that the variety of third level opportunities should be expanded.</P>
    <P>As this is my first chance for some time to speak on education I should like to say that it is time for those who believe in education to recover their nerve.  There are such things in life as educational values, irrespective of whether or not there is economic growth.  When the flimflam of the Culliton report is all over I should like to give consideration to the <Col N="604" /> actual situation.  I thought references to Japan were in decline, but the senior innovators in Europe and the US are coming from those who got good, basic training at third level.  An example is people who are the major world leaders in electronics, biotechnology and other areas; in the case of electronics many of them attained good engineering degrees and went on to specialise.  The recipe for early specialisation and narrowing of training is one for obsolescence and disaster. Contrary to everything in the Culliton report, the average person will finish third level and will change vocation three or four times as often as the person of ten years ago.  The person rendered unemployed will have to change direction in training.  The better and stronger the basic education is the better a person can deal with this.  That is what I meant when I said I hoped the educational community will recover their nerve in asserting educational values.  I hope also they will be innovative, not, in a sense, to narrow themselves to appear attractive to the whim of a passing phase of rather regressive eighteenth century economic theory, but that they will say it is wonderful that more and more of our people are developing intellectual curiosity, critical capacity, democratic ability to participate and so on.</P>
    <P>Because they are not often given credit, let me say that in this instance the Irish Mature Students Association appear to make a case that is not only moderate but modest, asking only to be treated equally in the autumn when it could be argued that for the period they have been within the system they have carried a burden that others will not carry in the future.  The Union of Students in Ireland, often criticised but to whom I want to pay tribute, in my term as spokesman on education in years gone by were front runners in the case for the democratisation of education in terms of internal structures but also in terms of access.</P>
    <P>The more people participating in education of all kinds with as few artificial barriers as possible the better.  For arguments sake, let us accept the Government's <Col N="605" /> figure of £1 million.  Is it worth it for somewhere between £0.75 million and £1 million in a once off payment, a once off cost, to dash the expectations of those who simply took what was published as a contract between the Government and the social partners, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> for what it was, acted on trust and listened to advice and information given by different Departments of State and overcame so many difficulties?  In what is basically good and welcome legislation the Minister should remove this blotch and amend section 5 (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority who will administer the education grants scheme on behalf of the Department I welcome any improvement initiated through additional legislation, particularly relating to mature students. However, I echo the sentiment of my colleague, Deputy Higgins, that those of us who were involved in assisting people to qualify for these grants accepted a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> that existing mature students would qualify for education grants.  Unfortunately, this Bill does not honour that commitment which mature students consider to be a contract between them and the Government.</P>
      <P>If we follow the principle of equality we try to treat all people equally, though at times women had difficulty in achieving such equality.  In regard to students and education all Governments, past and present, have tried to operate a scheme which would give equity in the allocation of assistance and grants and every incentive for people to go to school and continue into higher education.  They recognised that this would help them improve their employment opportunities in an area that is becoming so competitive.  Expectations and requirements are so high that it is difficult for people with the highest qualifications to get work at times, particularly in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this legislation extends, for the first time, permission to local authorities to operate a scheme of education grants <Col N="606" /> for mature students, we must not lose sight of the commitment given to existing mature students.</P>
    <P>We look forward to comments from both sides of the House and to the Minister's reply which we hope will be positive. He will have an opportunity between now and Committee Stage to look at the complaint we all have, that existing students are omitted from the scheme.  Those students have taken the initiative to return to education and that is not easy for adults or mature people.</P>
    <P>I have been approached by people already in colleges who had hoped to be included in the scheme.  I am processing applications from students who have been fortunate enough to achieve a place in college, and I take it that they will be assured of a grant irrespective of their academic achievements in the past.  I ask the Minister to respond to our queries.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the cost of this possible extension we are talking about a small sum of money.  I accept that from now all mature students will be covered by the legislation.  For that we are grateful. It is an imaginative improvement on the existing scale of education grants.</P>
    <P>Other criticisms have been made about the operation of the grants scheme.  One refers to the means test which, unfortunately, was linked with a decision of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Davern, in the short period he was Minister for Education, that for the first time ESF grants would be subject to means-testing. There is widespread concern at this proposal.  To sweeten the pill, so to speak, it was linked with the improved guidelines laid down for incomes in this legislation and this year's scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins mentioned categories of people who will be excluded such as engineers, who would be considered to have relatively good jobs, and people in the middle income group.  Lorry drivers who work with co-operatives are required under their conditions of employment to work overtime.  They have been penalised in the past under such schemes.  Many lorry drivers or other overtime earners have been precluded from any grant assistance to educate <Col N="607" /> their children.  We should be trying to help those categories.  Other Departments, imaginatively, have excluded overtime earnings from means-testing. Ministers for the Environment and Local Government excluded such earnings from rent determination.</P>
    <P>There are precedents where overtime earnings could have &mdash; and should have &mdash; been excluded because often overtime is not optional for employees and occasionally they are required, because their work is of a sensitive or seasonal nature, to work long hours.  As a result their P60s will show large amounts because of their workload.  Account should be taken off the amount of time they have to work to get this income.  The time they spend away from their families should also be taken into account in assessing the eligibility of people who exceed the amounts laid down in the guidelines.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in the guidelines which, unfortunately, were linked to the possible means-testing of ESF grants.  Having taken those criticisms into account, there is now a widespread fear, particularly in the countryside, that irrespective of what grants are given, unless they take into account the cost of being at college and of being in digs or other accommodation, we will, by legislation, preclude many parents from the opportunity of sending a very good student away to third level education.  This would be against all the trends of what we are trying to do in this House, which is to assist people in every way possible to avail of the maximum amount of education and qualifications.</P>
    <P>During his period in office, the Minister will have to look at the level of grants.  The limits of incomes required is one problem and they should be continually monitored.  The amount of grants paid is paltry when the costs involved are taken into account.  This relates particularly to sending students away from home to which they are unable to return at night, which happens in many areas where third level education is not readily <Col N="608" /> available close to people's homes.  We must take into account the necessity nowadays &mdash; and which will be even more evident in the future &mdash; for everybody to be as well qualified as possible and to remain in school for as long as possible in the hope that they will have every opportunity in the future.  There will be far more competition in the future but students should be able to look to it confident in their ability to get a job, preferably in their own home town or at least in their own country.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that a small island nation on the periphery of Europe has to depend on mainland Europe where language has been a barrier to some of our students gaining useful employment.  This has happened to teachers and other highly educated people and they finish up driving buses in London and other cities because of the lack of opportunities open to them. In the past, those who qualified in agricultural science found that there were no openings here because of the attitude of the Department to the advisory service Teagasc and the lack of demand or need for education at that level, which is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour spoke about the possibility of social employment schemes in Holland and in other parts of Europe.  He said that as we are Europeans we should not have a problem working in Europe.  However, in the past our educational system did not take account of the need for additional or alternative languages.  We are probably the least well-equipped compared to other countries in Europe as far as learning foreign languages is concerned.  This must put our students at a tremendous disadvantage when they go to work in Germany, Holland, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy or anywhere else.  Irrespective of how good their English or Irish may be, the opportunities for getting work suitable to their qualifications will become less and less if we do not ensure that our educational curriculum includes foreign languages.  That is why, unfortunately, in the past many of our peoples had to emigrate to English speaking countries like America, Australia and <Col N="609" /> New Zealand where at least they could speak the language.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, my council in Tipperary adopted this scheme without knowledge of its terms because they felt that they would be required to operate it.  Even without knowing the details, the council were unanimous in adopting it with goodwill and in good faith.  Unfortunately, many people will be disappointed unless changes are made; I know that previous speakers in this debate advocated changes. I do not know whether the Minister has been listening to people in his own constituency or the Department who, I am sure, have been professionally lobbied by students', parents' and teachers' organisations, all those involved in the educational process.  They will have made the strongest possible representations to the Minister and the Government to ensure that this legislation will be as liberal as possible and will cover as many pupils as possible.  It should also ensure that as many families as possible will have an opportunity to benefit from progressive legislation which we generally welcome.  I am sure the Minister is capable of applying imagination to his brief which would ensure that the Bill is progressive and would balance in some way the bad vibes resulting from the promise &mdash; or threat &mdash; to means test ESF grants, which were of tremendous benefit to people who were excluded from the existing local authority higher education grants operated by county councils or the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and I hope the Minister's response will be positive in regard to the areas about which we have expressed concern.  It will be the duty and function of members of local authorities to try to assist people in every possible way to qualify under the terms laid down. I hope the Minister will take heed of our pleadings in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me this opportunity to raise one point in respect of this Bill.  I do not profess to have any expertise in relation to this Bill which is long overdue but I welcome its general <Col N="610" /> thrust.  I hope it will provide an opportunity for people who missed out in the orthodox fashion of being able or free to participate in third level education to have a second chance having regard to their financial means.  They will now get badly overdue support from the State to pursue a third level education opportunity. I intervene in the debate merely to raise the point which has been adverted to by several colleagues here throughout the course of Second Stage debate and on which my own party's Education spokesperson, Deputy Gilmore, has put down a specific amendment, as I suspect is the case in relation to other Opposition parties in the House, which relates to the question of the provision for mature students currently in the stream.  It is a shame that we have to spoil the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar, which is effectively what is happening here.</P>
      <P>I understand, from correspondence I received from the Union of Students in Ireland that a survey was conducted to establish precisely the extent of this anomaly and, roughly, what would be the order of costs involved to the State. According to that survey conducted by the Irish Mature Students Association it would appear that of 1,200 students currently in college, only 350 would actually be eligible for funding.  That figure represents a very small number of students who were led to have a certain expectation in respect of this because, for example, the Union of Students in Ireland draw attention to the fact that many of those mature students in the current academic year returned to college as a result of guarantees which they inferred from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> published in January 1991.  Certainly those students held the view that grants for mature students would be introduced and that the term &ldquo;mature students&rdquo; in this particular case would mean not only students about to enter college but students already in college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is niggardly and mean of the Government to single out a group of students who have demonstrated commendable personal initiative, often in far more difficult <Col N="611" /> circumstances than for those who are the subject of the orthodox intake into our third level colleges.  They have striven against what appeared to be insuperable obstacles in many cases to be accepted for their respective courses and have pursued them diligently only to find their expectations shattered, not because the Government have reneged on the commitment to bring forward the Bill, but because they refuse to include a small number of existing students.  Again, I am grateful to my old union, the Union of Students in Ireland, for pointing out that what we request is not without precedent. Apparently when the ESF grants, for example, were extended to mature students, they were paid irrespective of whether one was a prospective student or a student already in the course of one's studies.  I avail of this unexpected opportunity to plead with the Minister to acknowledge the request that has come from all sides of the House to extend to existing students who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements the welcome terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the Bill in its general thrust and unashamedly say that the points I am raising are as a result of specific cases brought to my attention.  In my constituency there are a number of students who, for some reason that I am now too far removed from education to know the whys and wherefores of, happen to be attending Maynooth College. In the case of some of those students, their continuation is likely to be put at risk if they are included in this Bill. I am aware of the difficult personal circumstances that they overcame to get into college initially and I know they genuinely believed and expected that the bringing forward of this Bill would at least enable them to see their course through.  It would be a tragedy if some of these people were denied the opportunity to continue in third level education.  If some of them are forced back on to the dole queues that will be a greater burden on the State than the extension of the terms of this Bill to people currently in course, and a burden <Col N="612" /> without any prospect of an investment return to the State as a result of assisting these people to continue in college.</P>
    <P>I sincerely request that the Minister take on board the views expressed by several Deputies since the debate began, because equity is involved.  It is an important issue having regard to the fact that the scheme, as it exists, is operated and in a particularly inequitable manner for the many people who fall into the category my constituents are in.  Because of other preoccupations this week I have had no opportunity to examine the improvements announced by the Minister for Education in the higher education grants scheme.  He would seem to have got a favourable response from the media for them but there is nothing new in that. The Minister for Education has long been an expert at getting favourable responses from the media for whatever he does but looking at it more closely, one finds it does not necessarily amount to a great deal.  If the Minister only drops his children off at school, there is somebody there from the <i>Irish Independent</i> or somewhere else to photograph him doing it. Therefore, I would need to have time to study whether the improvements in the scheme he announced this week are all they are cracked up to be.  I can certainly say that prior to any improvement by the Minister, the operation of the scheme was very discriminatory as between certain categories within the self-employed and the PAYE sectors.  Frequently at this time of the year one has representations from people on average industrial earnings who are making extraordinary sacrifices to give their teenagers access to third level education which, in many cases, they themselves would not have had and who find that when they look at the nitty gritty of the scheme, they are not eligible.</P>
    <P>The calculation of means is totally unfair to the PAYE sector.  For example, for large farmers it operates in a totally different manner.  All of us know of cases where farmers have found it more economic to purchase accommodation in this city for their prospective sons and daughters to go to a university of their choice <Col N="613" /> and find to one's alarm that they are being supported by the State to do so, whereas people struggling on average industrial earnings and paying their tax every week are unable to get any assistance towards putting their children through college.  That is grossly inequitable. Unlike Deputies such as Deputy Jim Higgins, I have had no opportunity to look at this in detail but I will be doing so.  On the narrow issue of this Bill it is regrettable if the Minister feels that he is not in a position to make a gesture towards the united voice coming from this side of the House concerning people who through their own efforts have found themselves in college, and who should be assisted in the same fashion as is proposed for eligible mature students in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank all of the Deputies who have contributed to the debate on this Bill.  I am pleased that there was generally a warm welcome for its provisions and a recognition that the special extension of the higher education grants scheme to mature students represents another important step forward in the development of student support schemes in third level education.  That, combined with the announcement yesterday of the very substantial increases in the grants scheme, as well as the many improvements in the scheme which have been announced over the last few weeks, and the publication of the Green Paper on Education, represents very significant progress in the whole area of education which many Deputies and many interested groups have been requesting for so long.  It represents the continuing commitment of this Government to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues have been raised by Deputies on all sides, including the element of non-retrospection in relation to the improvements.  I have the greatest sympathy with the points put forward but due to constraints on Exchequer resources it has only been possible in years when there has been an improvement in the qualifying conditions for <Col N="614" /> grants under the higher education grants scheme to introduce and fund the improvements for the scheme in the year in question.</P>
    <P>A number of costings ranging from £750,000 to £1.5 million have been mentioned in relation to applying the 1992 improvements to mature students already attending third level courses.  My information is that the figure would be far higher.  The number of mature students attending third level courses is estimated at 1,600.  This contrasts with a figure of 350 mentioned by some Deputies, on which I presume the costings referred to were based.  These costings would appear to be quite conservative.  The actual cost of applying the improvements retrospectively to this group would be substantially higher.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell referred to the fact that she introduced a special scheme some years ago.  Because of the huge response, it cost quite an amount of money.  This indicates that there will be a huge take-up in this scheme in the new academic year, at a further substantial cost.  A more fundamental consideration is that it would be difficult to defend retrospection for the mature student group without extending it to the general body of students already at third level. This would involve huge additional costs, running into millions.  This would not be sustainable in the current economic climate.  The improvements announced by the Minister for 1992 will apply to entrants to third level in 1992 and subsequent years and will not apply to students already attending third level courses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to a precedent, namely the extension of the ESF grants.  That was quite different.  The extension of ESF grants when first introduced to students already in third level colleges must be seen in the context of the provision of funding from the European Community and the need to draw down on entitlements under the Structural Funds at the time.  The Deputy was not comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea indicated that ESF means-testing displayed a desire by the <Col N="615" /> Department of Education to move students towards the university sector. Nothing could be further from the truth. This can be borne out if one examines the phenomenal growth in the vocational education colleges sector and the role of these colleges in catering for third level educational needs.  In the period since 1980, whole-time student numbers in the regional technical colleges have increased from 6,500 to almost 20,000, an increase of over 200 per cent.  In the same period attendances at the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology has risen from 4,000 to 8,000 students.  The vocational education committee third level colleges have over 28,000 whole-time students, which represents almost 40 per cent of total enrolment at third level.</P>
    <P>Several speakers referred to the fact that eligibility for third level support is determined on the basis of an individual's gross income.  They urged that eligibility should be determined on the basis of net income.  In reviewing the eligibility limit under the scheme of student support, regard was had to the fact that the present limits are based on gross income.  The substantial increases announced yesterday were determined in that light.  To move to a system of assessment on the basis of net income would have serious implications for the income limits to be set.  I am sure Deputies appreciate that the limits to be applied, whether on a gross or net income basis, must have regard to the resource implications.  At the end of the day the same amount will be made available for third level grants.  If we change from gross to net assessment, something else would also have to be changed because only the same amount of money is available.</P>

      <P>This could be examined further in the autumn in the context of the debate on the Green Paper.  Deputy O'Shea raised the issue of the treatment <Col N="616" /> of drawings in assessing applications for third level student support.  Assessment for eligibility for third level student support is on the basis of income.  Drawings from a business do not represent income. The individual draws upon his or her assets, thereby reducing his or her capital base in the same way that any individual might draw upon savings in a bank account.  Neither is assessable as income. This approach is consistent with the practice of the Revenue Commissioners as drawings from a savings account or from one's assets are not assessable for income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was made that different attitudes are taken by different local authorities.  I will have that matter investigated by my Department and I will report back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were also asked about the status of the third level scheme for the long term unemployed.  The option of pursuing a full-time education course at third level is available to unemployed people who are on the long term rate of unemployment assistance and aged 23 years or over.  Priority is given to people who have already taken part in the vocational training opportunities scheme or second level education initiatives. Older people who have been unemployed for some time and who are mainly dependent on unemployment payments are also given priority.  The courses covered under the scheme must be full-time undergraduate courses at third level or be run by an approved institution such as a university, a regional technical college or a college of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In general the course should have a high skill content but more academic courses are also involved.  Participants in the scheme continue to receive the same social welfare rates and entitlements as they would otherwise receive.  Arrangements are made to dispense with the requirement for the scheme participants to sign in.  There are 186 participants at present and 100 <Col N="617" /> additional places will be available in the autumn.  Present plans are for the scheme to continue.</P>
    <P>It was also claimed that grant levels were not being increased in 1992.  This is totally untrue.  The maintenance grant will be increased in line with the increase in the consumer price index and the tuition fee grant will be increased in line with the increase in third level fees.  That improvement was announced some time ago.  All these provisions are a further indication of this Government's commitment to develop, as far as resources allow, all possible educational opportunities for all sectors.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the importance of continuing second chance education and I share their views in this regard.  The provisions in this Bill will enable further progress to be made towards enabling mature students who may not have had the opportunity to pursue courses of their choice at a particular time in their lives to embark on a fulfilling and enhancing programme of education in a third level institution. Deputy Higgins, and others, referred to the difficulty in obtaining information from the Department and put forward the proposal that a simplified booklet should be produced.  I promise to take that suggestion on board.  It is a good idea, it is simple and it would help people.</P>
    <P>As a member of a higher education grants committee for 18 years I was often frustrated when I saw who had been awarded grants each September or October. I tried over a long number of years by way of resolution at that committee to have the whole system fully investigated. I am glad we have gone part of the way but much more remains to be done. There will be an opportunity for Members when debating the Green Paper on Education to ensure that the most equitable system possible is put in place.  Deputy Higgins expanded on that point also when he spoke of the need for a proper policy in education to tackle the problems within the system.  I agree that the debate on that document in the autumn will be the appropriate time to expand that point.  I hope we will continue <Col N="618" /> to bring equity into the system because I believe, as I am sure do most Members, that no system should be operated unless it is seen to be fair and gives a fair opportunity to everybody.</P>

      <P>Without wishing to dispute your ruling in relation to the admissibility of certain amendments may I say that this Bill is so structured that if <Col N="619" /> a Member tables any kind of amendment it would have some consequences for the Exchequer?  The result is that the amendments, which sought to insert some of the equity we debated on Second Stage, have been ruled out.  The Bill is so restrictive that one cannot move any type of amendment. A good example of this is my amendment which sought to delete the words in section 3 &ldquo;the parents of mature students who are dependent on their parents&rdquo;. I do not see the need for that provision.  A person who is 23 years of age is an independent person in his or her own right.  That person is an adult, is mature, is self-contained but is not self-maintained in this instance.  It is wrong to insert this provision.  Unfortunately, as has been pointed out, if this provision is removed it would have Exchequer implications.  It is a provision that should not be in the Bill and I will deal with that in due course.</P>

It was ruled out of order on the same grounds as the amendment submitted by Deputy J. Higgins.  I was anxious that a person who already had a primary degree would not be debarred from eligibility under the scheme.  Will the Minister clarify that point?  As I read the section it is not clear whether a person would be debarred in that instance.</P>

By retaining this provision we are tying them to their parents apron strings for longer than is necessary.  They will be ruled out from receiving a third level education when they should be given the opportunity to be independent and to get the education they need and desire. Obviously, they missed out on the first chance when they left school.  Surely at 23 years of age and over we must give <Col N="620" /> them the opportunity to stand on their own.</P>

      <P>Several anomalies could be seen to derive from this.  A practical example would be where a person who studied for a basic arts degree in subjects that have changed vastly over a long number of years and who may or may not have used these subjects, wants to return.  New subjects have arrived, the curriculum has changed and such people may want to make themselves employable. This can arise in relation to a single parent and so on.  It also arises in relation to other issues that may arise.  I am aware of one case where, for example, a person held a degree from Maynooth's pontifical side and wanted to go on to do a degree with a view to becoming employable.  I could list a great number of anomalies and, obviously, we are talking about a small number of people.  It seems an unnecessary restriction to insist on not including this provision.  Another person may want to study law courses to which a person could proceed after a primary degree course.  Again, a person would be precluded from those courses.  My suggestion would not open the floodgates but it would be more manageable rather than having all these cases arising as anomalies in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a somewhat different issue arising from section 3 which relates to the calculation of the means of the students.  Three categories are defined in the Bill: the means of the mature student &mdash; himself or herself; the means of the parents of the mature students &mdash; that is mature students who are dependent on their parents, and the means of the spouses of mature students.  There are two observations I wish to make in relation to this. First, it is ridiculous to be talking about mature students, who, by definition are people over 23 years of age, being dependent <Col N="621" /> on their parents.  Mature students are often people who have severed their dependence on their parents and who have gone back into the educational process. I would like some clarification from the Minister as to how means will be assessed.  In the case of mature students of 23 years of age or over who have cut effectively their family ties, on whose income are means to be assessed?  Are they to be assessed on the student's income or on the parental income irrespective of what relationship may exist at that time between the student and his or her parents?  That is the first issue I wish to have clarified.</P>
      <P>The second issue I wish to have clarified by the Minister relates to the question of spouse.  I did attempt in the definition section to have this addressed but, a Cheann Comhairle, you ruled the amendment out of order and, of course, I accept your ruling.  However, there is an issue here relating to the definition of spouse.  I would like the Minister to address that.  We now have two definitions of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in our legislative system.  The concept of a married couple is perfectly understood by all but there is also cohabitation in respect of which there are two distinct approaches.  The Revenue Commissioners are happy to ignore cohabitation so far as tax allowances are concerned but the Department of Social Welfare and now, apparently, and the Department of Education, give full recognition to the status of cohabitation in relation to the payment of benefits and insist on assessing one partner's means against those of the other.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill a mature student could have his or her means assessed on the basis of their partner but under our tax code the partner may not claim a tax allowance for the person whom the Departments of Education and Social welfare regard as a dependant.  This is clearly an anomaly which I would like the Minister to address.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to address it by way of my own amendment but I would like the Minister to address it when replying.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy <Col N="622" /> O'Shea's question, higher education grants are not available to persons who hold a primary degree under the terms of the annual schemes.  The basis for this provision is that funds for the purpose of pursuit of third level courses are limited and these limited funds must be directed to people who do not already possess a primary degree.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Gilmore's question, only if a dependant lives with and depends on their parents, will the parents' income be taken into consideration. If a person lives away from the home and is independent, the person will be assessed on his or her own income.  I have already referred to the question of the spouse and for this purpose it is the same as applies under the Social Welfare legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to give more specific details on the guidelines that will issue to local authorities in relation to the parents of mature students who are dependent on their parents.  In effect, does it mean that if one is living in the same house as one's parents and not drawing the dole or some other form of social welfare, it is automatically deemed that one is a dependant of one's parents?  Is that the guideline that will issue to local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that guidelines will be sent but my understanding from the Minister's earlier reply was that if applicants live with or are dependent on their parents, the means of the parents will be assessed.  Presumably, it follows that if students do not live with their parents, or if they do but are not dependent on them &mdash; in other words as Deputy Higgins stated, they may be in receipt of a social welfare payment or separate employment &mdash; the students' means will be assessed.  Students who have jobs and live with their parents are clearly not dependent on their parents; they will have paid taxes for perhaps a number of years and contributed to their families' budgets.  If they decide to return to college, whose means will be assessed, the individual's or the parents?  Will the local authority have some discretion in deciding the matter?</P>

Take a hypothetical case where parents have a gross income of £20,000, allowing for the much lauded initiative by the Minister yesterday of increasing the eligibility threshold to £19,000, in such circumstances what criteria or ratio would be used in relation to establishing the actual income of the son or daughter who would fall within the category mentioned in section 3?</P>

      <P>We all know if dependants live with their parents, even for social welfare purposes, they are assessed on their families' income and if they are awarded a social welfare payment that is deemed to be their particular income; in this case that would be taken into consideration.  In the case of a mature <Col N="624" /> student the family income, if it does not include social welfare, would be taken into consideration.  This applies also in the case of a person in normal circumstances attending third level education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that in effect he is asking mature students who may be living at home and dependent on their parents to move out of the family home, live in a flat, draw the dole, get rent and supplementary allowance from the health board to supplement their income and be a further draw on the State rather than saying to them, if they are 23 years of age or over, that they are obviously not dependants of their parents and will not be forced out of their family homes?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much talk today about equity.  Take the example of two parents in a home with a joint income of, say, £100,000.  Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that that income should not be assessed when deciding whether a student, son or daughter, would be entitled to a third level grant.  I do not think any Member of this House would expect that the son or daughter &mdash; mature or otherwise &mdash; of anybody with a very large income should be entitled to a full grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that it would be much simpler and fairer if the student were assessed on his or her own income.  No matter how one looks at it in the case of, I was going to say immature students, but let us describe them as students who are not defined as mature students for the purposes of this Bill, whatever case might be made in those circumstances for the income of a spouse or parents to be taken into account in assessing means, it is a total nonsense in this case and will lead to all kinds of entanglements.  The point has been made already about people being told they are above the income limit, for example, in the case of a family with three children whose parental income is within the limit <Col N="625" /> allowable for payment of a student grant. In such a case how will one define the other children, the applicant for the grant who may be 24, and the other two who may be aged 25 and 26 respectively?  Will the 25 and 26 year olds be defined as children for the purposes of this section?</P>
      <P>Then there is the position of spouses. There has been reference to people being driven out of the family home.  I can foresee circumstances arising in which people would be driven out of very good relationships in order to qualify for a student grant.  It would make a great deal more sense if the means or incomes to be assessed were those of the student, albeit with some mechanism being devised to allow for some assessment to be made of the extent parents, a spouse, or whoever, contributed to that student's means. Assessing a student's means on the basis of parental or spouse's income would give rise to all kinds of anomalies and problems.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage, I said I had grave reservations about the method of means-testing.  I asked how a mature student of, say, 23, could be a dependant of his or her parents.  Surely somebody of that age would be either employed or unemployed.  It is reasonable to assume that if unemployed he or she would be in receipt of social welfare assistance which should be assessed as income.  How could any Government body or assessors decide, merely because a student's parents were in receipt of an income of, say, £30,000, what proportion of that income may be contributed to a student's education?  How does one determine what proportion of that income belongs to what is defined as a dependant mature student?  It amounts to an assertion only.  Any method of means-testing must be seen to be just and should not be based on any type of assumption but rather on fact.  I contend that to apply the description &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; to a 23 year old mature adult is not rational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be regrettable if the provisions of this Bill were to exclude many people we believed would be eligible for such grants.  It is pointless introducing legislation <Col N="626" /> which, in the small print, contains rules debarring students, for wrong reasons, from eligibility for such grants. I hope the Minister will be able to further clarify the definition of a dependant mature student.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that if a student has an income of his or her own, or is in receipt of social welfare assistance, he or she would be assessed thereon.  Beyond that, the students would be assessed in the normal way, as would any other student, on their parents' income.  I made the point &mdash; and there are plenty of practical examples &mdash; that if a 23 or 24 year old applied for a higher education grant and let us suppose, there was an income of, say, £100,000 going into that home, that student would not be entitled to a higher education grant.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 17, before &ldquo;sat&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, the provisions of section 4 are not geared towards mature students <i>per se</i> but rather to cater for those students living in Border counties who attend second level schools in Northern Ireland.  The grant scheme, as it stands, allows the leaving certificate only to be taken into account.  Therefore the scheme has been amended mainly to allow the general certificate of education of Northern Ireland to be taken into account for the purpose of qualifying for a grant.  However, it has been represented to me that the provision for an examination having to be sat outside the <Col N="627" /> State is too restrictive and would not allow the Minister to take any special circumstances into account.</P>
    <P>My amendment, proposing the insertion of the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo;, will allow such particular circumstances to be taken into account.  I would suggest it also meets the concerns of Deputy Jim Higgins in his amendments Nos. 4 and 6.  I might point out also that the provisions in this section will allow the Minister to prescribe which examination my be taken into account.  For example, this would allow the Minister to take the terminal examination of any of our EC partners into account for grant purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Minister is endeavouring to do by proposing the insertion of the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo;, but it does seem somewhat restrictive. Hopefully we are opening up a long awaited national debate on education, particularly with the publication of the Green Paper on Education some days ago which is supposed to encompass all aspects of education.  Literally everything is supposed to be on the table &mdash; primary education in all its aspects, second level and there is a whole chapter, Chapter 8, on third level education.  Therefore one may assume that, by the time all the submissions will have been received from the various interested groups, quite a comprehensive analysis of education in all its aspects will have been undertaken.</P>
      <P>We must remember that times are changing.  Without wishing to attack the integrity of the leaving certificate, we do have a range of other certificates which are beginning to be recognised in their own right as fully-fledged educational awards.  In addition to the leaving certificates, there is the vocational leaving certificate.  There is also the senior certificate and, by the time this great national debate on education will have been completed, there is the possibility of a range of other options being on the table.  The Minister appears to be stipulating the leaving certificate as the sole qualification under the terms of this section which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> Section 2 (1) (a) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &ldquo;Leaving Certificate Examination of the Department of Education&rdquo; of &ldquo;or at such other school terminal examination held and sat outside the State&rdquo; and the said paragraph, as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    <P>Today he is introducing an amendment which would have the section read:</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (a) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &ldquo;Leaving Certificate Examination of the Department of Education&rdquo; of &ldquo;or at such other school terminal examination held and ordinarily sat outside the State&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>to allow for the possibility of admission of examinations sat in other EC member states.  I presume that is in the spirit of inter-partnership, interaction, mutual exchange of qualifications and so on.  I should have preferred that the draftsman would have said: &ldquo;or at such other school terminal examination held inside or outside the State&rdquo; thereby broadening the scope of the provisions, admitting the inclusion of existing certificates beginning to gain in importance and popularity and the possibility of additional qualifications being accepted.  That would have broadened the scope of the provisions of this section to allow for existing certificates, provided they pass quality control, or other certificates that might come onstream subsequent to discussion of the Green Paper on Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On 18 and 19 February last, we debated in this House the ill-judged means testing proposal for ESF grants which Minister Brennan had just inherited from his predecessor, former Minister Davern.  We deliberately chose a date early in the Minister's career as Education Minister to debate the issue and early in the year in order to allow him a dignified &ldquo;put down&rdquo; of one of the most socially unjust and educationally backward proposals to come from any Minister in recent times.  The Minister on the night declined our overtures. However, it was generally felt that over the intervening months he would do the wise thing and jettison what is an indefensible proposal, much the same as he gradually dismantled the equally unpalatable <Col N="630" /> and similarly inheritied An Post viability plan.</P>
      <P>The Minister has disappointed us.  His store of commonsense seems to have deserted him.  His sense of fair play seems to have been blinded by the cold logic of the mathematicians in the Department of Finance and he seems hell-bent on charging over the precipice but the Minister should be warned that he is at the edge of the precipice now.</P>
      <P>This is a big issue.  Sixty-one thousand 17 and 18 year olds sat the leaving certificate ten days ago.  Even allowing for yesterday's changes, there will be very few children of teachers, doctors, gardaí, engineers, nurses, industrial or service workers, journalists or civil servants who will be eligible for a higher education grant for a university.  The thresholds are still too low.  One qualifies on gross not on net income.  There is no cognisance of special circumstances, let alone mortgage costs or day-to-day living expenses.  This afternoon I was contacted by an individual who is married, has four children and a gross income of £20,000.  The banner headlines had lifted his expectation that at last he was about to benefit under the new scheme.  Alas, when he examined the detail he was to be disappointed &mdash; no grant for any of his four children.  He put it very well.  Between tax and PRSI he pays £5,000.  That leaves him with £15,000.  He pays £5,000 on his £40,000 mortgage.  That leaves him with £10,000.  Out of that he is hard put to meet food, clothing, heating, electricity and transport costs.  He was quite blunt. He cannot afford to send his daughter to college next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated so often in the past, the scheme is riddled with anomalies.  He pointed out to me a further anomaly.  If his daughter applies for dole his mortgage is taken into consideration in assessing the family's means.  However, neither mortgage nor any other essential cost counts for higher education grant purposes. Some families will send their sons and daughters to third level but it means borrowing £5,000 each year for a minimum of four years.  These families literally <Col N="631" /> have to sacrifice all and put their lives on &ldquo;hold&rdquo;.  They have to re-mortgage their houses.  Too bad if one has a second child attending simultaneously.</P>
    <P>To thousands of these middle income families the ESF grant represents the only real chance of getting into third level.  This £39 per week maintenance grant has not alone opened up third level education for 27,000 young people of middle income PAYE taxpayers but these top-class young people have in turn energised the nine regional technical colleges and the six Dublin Institute of Technology colleges which have, in turn, become the economic focal points of the regions in which they are located.</P>
    <P>It is conservatively estimated that the presence of a regional college is worth £10 million to the local economy.  How ironic, therefore, that a mere five days after this House has passed the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, giving the colleges greater flexibility and autonomy, the Minister should effectively pull the rug out from under them.  How contradictory that while still extolling the Culliton report recommendations on the need for greater emphasis on technological education Industry Minister, Deputy O'Malley, and his party, should continue to back a decision that flies in the face of everything Culliton prescribes. Have the Government even read the articles in the Maastricht Treaty dealing with the need for improved technical skills?  How incredible that a mere two weeks after warning us during the debate on Maastricht that ESF grants would be drastically affected by a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, our own Fianna Fáil-PD Government should now seek to whittle them away.</P>
    <P>The blunt reality for a sizeable segment of the leaving certificate class of 1992 is that no grant means no college; no college means no education; no education means no future.  Can the Minister not see the powerful argument for more education not less education?  Can he not see that in a country with scarce resources education is the new form of capital in society?  Does the Minister not see that <Col N="632" /> the amount of it one has determines the place that one has in society, that it bridges the gap between the rich and the poor?</P>
    <P>Last Friday the Government announced a shameful figure of 282,000 unemployed.  The Government have failed miserably to deliver on their promises in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  They have failed to provide jobs for young people and now they are going to fail to educate them.  Let the Minister not repeat for us his message of last February that we have to subsidise ESF funds from the national Exchequer to the tune of £10 million.  If one gets £10 out for every £1 one puts in that is a good value investment indeed. Did the Minister not issue a press release calling for a strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on the Maastricht Treaty because of all the extra ESF funds we could expect for education? Neither should the Minister treat us to another regurgitation of his recent, long-heralded increase in eligibility thresholds and other administrative changes in the higher education grants scheme. All the Minister is doing is tinkering with the system, not reforming it, and certainly not getting to the nub of the problem. If one trawled the administrative jungles of this country one could not find a more discriminatory, inequitable, flawed or anti-PAYE middle income system than the higher education grant scheme.  What the Minister is now proposing to do is to import into the ESF grants all the warts and weals of a discredited system into another system that is working so well.  The Minister is not levelling the playing field as he purports, but making the playing field unplayable for thousands more.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that we are not talking just about the class of '92.  The classes of '93, '94, '95 and '96 are watching with interest as well and so are their parents and so are the communities in the regions in which the colleges are located and which will be catastrophically affected if means testing goes ahead.  These people are deeply conscious of what is happening and they will not remain as dumb spectators <Col N="633" /> while a perfectly good system is pulled asunder.</P>
    <P>In this motion we are putting to the Minister a number of reasonable alternatives. We are asking him not to tamper with the ESF scheme until a comprehensive in-depth analysis of the entire area of third level student grants has been undertaken.  This is something which is long overdue.  We are advocating a complete analysis taking into consideration and social, economic, regional and geographic factors.</P>
    <P>There is no more competent agency to undertake this task than the Economic and Social Research Institute.  We are putting a time limit of one year on this analysis.</P>
    <P>Later this evening we will pass the local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill which will extend the scope of grants to mature students.  Yet this Bill will exclude the 350 mature students who prepared the submissions, mounted the lobby and proved the case for extending the scope of the grants.  I appeal to the Minister to include these people in the scheme.  The measures he announced yesterday evening are welcome.  I do not want to be negative, but they are simply a partial relief; they are not reform. Thousands of middle income families will still be outside the scope of the scheme. I am extremely disappointed that the thousands of students currently attending university and who are not receiving any grant aid will not be included and that the grant will simply apply to those who enter college for the first time next September. This motion proposes a tax-free allowance for such families.  This would go some of the way towards placating the genuine sense of grievance felt by people caught in this income trap.  I urge the Minister to accept this motion notwithstanding the fact that my proposal that the income thresholds be increased by 33 per cent has been superseded by his announcement yesterday.</P>

      <P>The motion proposed by my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party is very timely.  I might add that it has already <Col N="634" /> forced the Minister for Education to take action, inadequate though it is.  The continued persistence of Fine Gael in outlining the gross inequities and the unfairness in the higher education grants system has at last coerced the Government into taking some steps to improve the system and widen the eligibility prospects of many, though not enough, students.  Unfortunately, the discrimination against PAYE workers and their families and the exclusion of modest income families from third level education will continue.</P>
      <P>The most controversial, regressive and unjustifiable decision to means-test ESF grants still remains.  It is for these reasons that I believe the motion before the House should be supported.  No one can deny that the unjust operation of the higher education grants scheme discriminates heavily against PAYE workers and places an almost impossible financial burden on families with modest incomes in the provision of third level education for their children.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to substantially increase the income eligibility limits.  However, he admitted, the original limits were scandalously low. Many modest income families will continue to be excluded from grant aid.  My colleague, Deputy Higgins, gave the Minister a very real example of this.  A family with two children earning one penny more than £15,000 per year will still lose part of the grant.  It is not mathematically possible for such a family to pay the costs of putting a child through college, which amount to approximately £3,500 per annum.  Fine Gael propose that in future such families be given a tax-free allowance on their expenditure on third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say to us that he has increased the thresholds by more than the 33 per cent outlined in the Fine Gael motion.  I want to say to him that our proposal included income tax relief.  It is extraordinary that tax relief is allowed on a mortgage and investment in industry but not on investment in education.  We propose that such income tax relief should be at the marginal rate.  The Minister <Col N="635" /> must realise the enormous burden being placed on modest income families in the provision of third level education for their children.  As has been outlined, many families are forced to remortgage their houses and take out expensive loans.  In the interests of equity and fairness it is reasonable to propose income tax relief for such families.  I am glad that the new measures announced by the Minister will give relief to some families. Unfortunately, they will also exclude many families who are still unable to afford third level education.  Our tax relief proposal will in some way compensate those who are over the income thresholds and, more importantly, will keep the door open to third level education.</P>
    <P>The means testing of ESF grants was a most controversial, regressive and unjustifiable decision.  I say this because the present system of means testing is inherently unfair, blatantly unjust and discriminatory.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not get to the root of the problem in his re-examination of third level education grants.  The new proposals, welcome though they are, will not ensure that all of those who cannot afford third level education will receive a grant. This is the kernel of the problem.  No steps have been take to cater for exceptional circumstances and the enormous financial commitments which have to be met by families.  These are the circumstances which can prevent a child from obtaining third level education.  The burden on the PAYE family will remain; the inequity in the system has not been remedied.  This is a reasonable, sound and logical motion, and in the interests of fairness and equity it should be supported by all parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Higgins on bringing forward this motion at a time when students have just completed their leaving certificates and matriculation examinations and are assessing their future career prospects.  It is very appropriate that we are debating higher education grants at this time.  It <Col N="636" /> is no coincidence that the Minister for Education announced the very welcome increase in the income limits for eligibility for grants to third level students yesterday, the eve of this debate initiated by the Fine Gael Party.  I hope the public will rightly attribute these improvements to the sustained pressure placed on the Government by Deputy Higgins and the Fine Gael Party over the past few months.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new income limits and the commitment given by the Minister that assessment of incomes will be carried out by inspectors of the Revenue Commissioners. We have all heard allegations in regard to the way some local authorities were administering the scheme. Many accountants in County Westmeath told me that Westmeath County Council were administering the scheme much more strictly than any other county council. Be that as it may, I welcome the fact that the system will in future be administered equitably and any anomalies ironed out.</P>
      <P>It is time there was more transparency in relation to the recipients of third level grants.  I have often heard people complaining that the children of big businessmen with two or three cars seem to be able to qualify for third level grants, while the children of the local garda sergeant or Army officer do not qualify because they are PAYE workers.  As I said, it is time there was more transparency in the system.  I suggest to the Minister that every year local authorities should publish a list of students receiving grants.  This would lead to more transparency in the system and ensure people are not accused of receiving grants when they have not received them.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister of State say that there is a higher education grants committee operating in his county council.  I have to say, as a member of a county council, that I have never heard of such a committee.  I look forward to the formation of one of these committees in my county.  I have been assured by Deputy Higgins that such committees are statutory and should be set up in every county.  I was surprised to hear this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> The Minister needs to review again the income thresholds in a more constructive way.  Recently I was visited by a member of the Garda Síochána whose third child will start third level education next September. As he is unable to pay the fees he has had to take the only option open to him, that is, retire from the force and take his gratuity.  This means he will be able to repay the debts he has accumulated to date and his youngest child will qualify for a grant.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes with satisfaction the Government's introduction of major reforms to the various third level student support schemes which will</P>
      <P>&mdash;bring greater equity to the schemes; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;ensure that families in the low to middle income brackets will benefit greatly from the improvements as announced by the Minister for Education on 6th July, 1992.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to bringing greater equity to the schemes of student support. This is in line with a central theme of Government policy, namely, positive discrimination to ensure that the benefits of education are distributed equally over all sections of the community rather than compounding the advantage of those who are already privileged.  This is a major theme of the Green Paper published recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent years have seen a major transformation in the structure and growth of the third level sector, with the development and expansion of the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), the regional technical colleges and the two national institutes of higher education, with the latter more recently designated as universities.  During the same period, considerable growth occurred in the university sector, in particular in the technology/business disciplines, but <Col N="638" /> accompanied also by a wide range of exciting and innovative new developments in the arts, the social sciences and other disciplines.</P>
    <P>The future development of higher education will seek to maintain and build upon a balance between the technological and humanities sectors.  I made this clear in the recent Green Paper.  A key contribution of the sector is to help to develop people who are willing and able to manage innovation and change in all sectors of society, including the creation of wealth and employment.</P>
    <P>The development of third-level education in Ireland is fully in line with approaches in all other developed countries, which are seeking actively to build up participation and completion rates to meet the economic and social challenges of the nineties and the new century.  Higher education now requires a very large investment by the State and by individuals.</P>
    <P>Great advances have been made in facilitating access to education at all levels. It is a measure of the Government's success that 73 per cent of all students complete the senior cycle of second-level education.  It is confidently expected to increase this to 90 per cent during the present decade.  At third level the number of full time, third level students has grown from 21,000 in 1965 to 75,000 in the last academic year, an increase of 350 per cent over a quarter of a century. Higher education now requires a very large investment by the State and by individuals.</P>
    <P>A further increase of 15,000 places is projected over the next four or five years. In a period of less than ten years from the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties 34,000 additional students will have been given the opportunity of third level education &mdash; a staggering increase of 60 per cent. There will be 90,000 full time third level students in State-funded colleges by the middle of the decade.  Student intake in 1991-92 was close to 26,000, representing almost 40 per cent of the age group and, with the additional places to be provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> participation is likely to <Col N="639" /> increase in the medium term to about 45 per cent of the age cohort.  About half the intake proceed to degree-level programmes.</P>
    <P>Although still below the best levels in the EC member states, Ireland has made dramatic strides in increasing the participation rate in recent years.  Further measures to increase our participation rates in third level eduction will have particular regard to the need, pointed out in the Green Paper, to improve the participation rates of those from economically disadvantaged areas.  Growth of such magnitude gives a clear indication of the enormous financial and logistical demands which we face in providing quality higher education for such a large proportion of our young population.</P>
    <P>Still the Government wish to ensure that lack of means should not constitute an insuperable obstacle to any student who has the ability to benefit from a third level education.  They acknowledge, at the same time, the considerable financial sacrifices made by parents and, indeed, students in pursuit of their legitimate aspiration to acquire a third level qualification. These were the precise considerations which led the Government to introduce the changes to our student support schemes which I was happy to announce yesterday.</P>
    <P>The first issue that had to be faced was that of the income eligibility limits.  There was consensus in this House that they were unacceptably low &mdash; I described them as scandalously low.  It is important to note that these income limits will be increased by a further £2,000 in respect of each child after the first child attending third level education.</P>
    <P>Under the existing system the income limit for full fees and full maintenance support in the case of a family with two children has been increased from £10,787 to £15,000, an increase of £4,213 or 39 per cent.  The full fee grant for a family with two children is being increased from £13,822 to £18,000, an increase of 30 per cent.  Up to now a family of two children with an income of more than £14,672 received no grant for fees or maintenance <Col N="640" /> but under the new limits this family will get full fees and full maintenance on this income.  A three children family with an income in excess of £14,023 received a full fee grant but no maintenance grant while this family will now get a full maintenance grant up to an income limit of £15,000.  A three children family with an income in excess of £15,480 received no fee or maintenance grant while the same family with an income between £15,000 and £16,000 will now receive a full fees grant and a 50 per cent maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>A four children family with an income in excess of £14,832 up to now received no maintenance grant but that family will now be entitled to full fees and maintenance grant up to an income limit of £16,500, full fees up to an income limit of £19,500 and part fees up to an income limit of £20,500.  A five children family with an income in excess of £15,500 up to now received a full fee grant but no maintenance grant.  This family will now be entitled to full grants for fees and maintenance.  That is an example of some of the dramatic increases which I was pleased to announce yesterday.</P>
    <P>These are substantial increases specifically designed to benefit people on low to middle income and would experience considerable financial hardship in sending their children to a third level institution.  A further noteworthy point is the introduction of more equitable, open and more rigorous procedures involving the Revenue Commissioners, which are important at this time.  I cannot emphasise too strongly that the whole rationale underlying Government policy in this matter is to relieve financial hardship on the low and middle income families who will now benefit under the increased eligibility limits.  I was particularly keen to see greater equity, fairness and openness introduced into the system of means-testing for student support and in the allocation of resources for students and their families.</P>
    <P>The amended schemes, including the package of improvements which I announced earlier in the year, represent the most radical and far-reaching set of <Col N="641" /> reforms in student support since the schemes were introduced in the late sixties. They also strike the right balance in resource allocation between the funding of the third-level education system as a whole on the one hand and support for individual students who use the system on the other.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out means testing will also apply to new ESF grant holders from next September.  It was consistent with the overall thrust towards equity and positive discrimination that the principle of means testing, once accepted, should apply to all maintenance grants.  Differential application of the means test was a clear anomaly in the system which needed to be addressed.  Initial concern expressed by a number of interests will give way to recognition of the manifest equity of the decision, particularly in view of my announcement yesterday.  It will be seen in the wider context of achieving more places for more students in third level education within the scope of the funds available.  It will also result in a more equitable proportion of students from lower income families gaining access to third level education.</P>
    <P>Two points needs to be borne in mind: (i) a means test will not apply to existing ESF students and they will continue to receive non-means-tested grants under the conditions of the existing ESF grants schemes; and (ii) all ESF students will continue to receive free tuition.</P>
    <P>It will be readily accepted by the House that the question of student support is of fundamental importance as we embark on major expansion of our third level system.  The positive link between third level education and economic development has long been recognised and was recognised by Opposition speakers again this evening.  It goes without saying that the Irish university system, the colleges of technology and the regional technical colleges have provided a constant flow of high-quality graduates for the professional, economic and, indeed, political life of this and many other countries. There is now a huge social demand for third level education, in Ireland more so than in many other similar countries.  We <Col N="642" /> are now at the point where we are trying to provide a third level education for every student who wants it and who demonstrates the ability to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely convinced that in going down that road the Government have the solid support of the vast majority of the people whose conviction of the inherent value of education has been unwavering over a long period.  I am also convinced that they are willing to make the necessary resources available.  But it is the responsibility of Government to make decisions regarding the most equitable and cost-effective allocation of those resources.  This in turn involves the making of choices between a range of feasible options in the area of student support.  The options vary from a regime of economic fees and very restricted maintenance on the one hand to free tuition and very generous maintenance on the other.  What the Government have tried to do is to reach the best possible compromise between these two extremes, in the light of custom and practice and in the light of the resources available for student support.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, fees have been retained as an integral part of the funding of higher education here.  I should point out, of course, that yearly lecture fees represent less than one-third of the unit cost of a student place for the academic year. Moreover, in respect of ESF students the Department will continue to pay the fee on their behalf.  With regard to maintenance, the principle of means-testing has been retained as an essential instrument of equitable resource allocation. In the interests of removing an existing anomaly, all student grants, with the exception of those held by existing ESF students, will in future be means-tested.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me list again the objectives which the Government set out to achieve in their review of student support schemes.  The primary and overall objective was to ensure equity within and between the different schemes.  This included the removal of any outstanding barriers which might militate against access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The second objective was <Col N="643" /> to address, to the extent that it was practicable and affordable, the financial pressures on students from lower and middle-income families.</P>
    <P>In pursuing these objectives the Government have increased the income eligibility limits and have undertaken to develop more equitable means assessment criteria.  They have also decided that equity demands that the same rules should apply to all.</P>
    <P>People on all sides of the House will give their assent to the objectives of the review.  Time will show that the recent measures represent the most prudent approach to the achievement of these objectives.  Accordingly, it is with full conviction that I recommend the amended motion for adoption.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase the eligibility limits by between 40 and 50 per cent, and up to 50 per cent in some cases, is the most dramatic increase in student grants since the scheme was introduced in 1968. Successive Governments have not found the resources to tackle the issue.  The figure of £10,700 which has now gone to £15,000 is not as great as I would like it to be but the figure has been brought somewhat closer to the average industrial wage.  Over a long period we have only been able to make some adjustments arising from inflation.  This is the first quantum leap in student support in 25 years. This is the way to tackle the question of giving increased support particularly to the PAYE sector and to hard-pressed families who are trying to send their children to universities and regional technical colleges.  This will benefit thousands of students and it will be welcomed.  It will largely offset any residual concern about the Government's decision to means test the ESF grant.</P>
    <P>What we needed was not so much to make the university sector pay for the regional technical college sector, or <i>vice versa,</i> but equality in the system.  I am disappointed that the Opposition speakers cannot acknowledge that the equity of the system dictates that we should not make fish of one sector and flesh of the other.  Are we trying to say that regional <Col N="644" /> technical colleges are second-class institutions to which different rules should apply?  They are not second-class.  They are on a par with universities and recent legislation stitches that into the record. The regional technical colleges and the universities are fine institutions and the same rules should apply to both of them. I cannot understand why some Members of the House seem to feel that they should be treated differently.  It seems to be something to do with money from Europe, as if that was easy money or free money.</P>
    <P>On the question of money, £10 million of the money available for ESF grants had to come from the Exchequer.  A substantial portion of the money comes from the Irish taxpayer.  If we preach equity in education we have to stand over it.  We cannot pay lip service to equity and then tell the parent on the doorstep that the person next door, who is earning £50,000 a year, will not be means-tested while the person on £15,000 a year will be means-tested because the regional technical college is a different institution. They are both third level and are on a par.  They are both fine institutions and in equity the same rules should apply.</P>
    <P>The proposals I announced yesterday are aimed to taking the pressure off the PAYE sector.  I announced that we will be introducing new rules in regard to eligibility criteria.  That will not be a witch-hunt after one sector but to ensure that the perception of the PAYE sector towards the non-PAYE sector and <i>vice versa</i> is that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that when somebody states his income it is genuine and there is no reason to doubt the documentation or the word of anybody either PAYE or not.  This is to make sure that there is an above board approach to the criteria. The active involvement of the Revenue Commissioners in working with the local authorities and the vocational education committee will clear up any perception that one sector has one advantage over another.  That perception understandably comes from the statistic which shows that the non-PAYE sector has a very high proportion of the total available places. <Col N="645" /> It is important to remove that perception which may be ill-founded.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion asks me to deal with discrimination against PAYE workers and their families with regard to eligibility.  Bringing in the Revenue Commissioners will tackle that.  They also ask me to tackle the exclusion of low income families from third level education due to unrealistic income thresholds and to increase the thresholds by 33 per cent.  I have increased the thresholds by 40 per cent and by 50 per cent. I would argue that I have more than met that part of the motion.  With regard to providing a tax free allowance for expenditure on third level education, that is a hairbrained idea which is not really fair. A family on social welfare would get no benefit while the person next door on £60,000 per annum would get a tax free allowance at the highest rate.  The richer family will get a major State benefit while the family next door, because they do not pay tax, will get no benefit.</P>

      <P>My proposition is the fairer way to do it.  I do not doubt the Deputy's goodwill in suggesting a tax free allowance.  Indeed, many of us could do with it when trying to send our children to third level education, but it would militate against those who do not have the benefit of good incomes.  The motion also asks me to give recognition to families with more than one member in third level education at the same time.  There is the special provision of an extra £2,000 for such cases.  The motion also asks me to assess all existing and future mature students on the basis of their own income and that is what we are doing in today's Bill, so that portion of the motion is also met.  All that is left is some worry about ESF grants which have been fully taken <Col N="646" /> account of in a fairer way, in bringing equity into the system.  The motion is fair enough, but I would argue that I have more than met the aims in the motion. Yesterday's announcement will go a long way towards giving a chance of education to thousands of families throughout the country who up to now had not got such chance.  What is most important is to have equity in education; equal access and equal opportunity for everybody regardless of means.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that Members are arguing that I should choose not to means-test somebody on £50,000 per annum who wishes to send his or her child to a regional technical college instead of the alternative course of action of means-testing income and thereby giving the opportunity to three or four other children to go to the regional technical colleges.  At the end of the day that is the choice we have to make.  I am amazed that Members pay lip service to rather than standing behind the concept of equity.  I stand over my proposals to means-test income for ESF maintenance support.  These proposals are sensible and equitable.  The historic dramatic increase in income levels, the first in almost 25 years, will go a long way to improving the lot of students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated last week that since I became spokesperson on Education there had not been a great deal of debate in this House on education, but events this week and last week give the lie to that.  I compliment Deputy J. Higgins on bringing this motion before the House.  Indeed, the Fine Gael Party have devoted a large proportion of their Private Members' time to education matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent this end of term debate has been overtaken by events, which, in the main, are very welcome.  It would <Col N="647" /> be dishonest of me not to welcome the measures announced by the Minister yesterday. However, towards the end of his contribution, when the Minister was speaking <i>ad lib,</i> he went for the over kill. The Clancy report, published in 1986, showed that 30 per cent of the children of professional parents went to university while only 12.2 per cent went to the regional technical colleges and 13.9 per cent of the children of manual workers went to university while 31.4 per cent attended regional technical colleges.  The point needs to be made that children from the professional classes, by and large, attend university rather than a regional technical college.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an impassioned plea for equity across the board.  The question of means-testing parental income to determine the maintenance portion of the ESF grant is not quite as simple as the Minister makes out.  We argued this point at some length in recent weeks and I outlined what I believe will happen when the maintenance portion of the ESF grant is subjected to means-testing in September this year.  I made the point, which I repeated this morning that the net result of this change will be that students who would otherwise avail of the opportunity of third level education will not be able to do so.  That is a very important issue in terms of equity.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument in favour of redistributing resources does not hold true in the context of the regional technical college sector.  The other group of students whom I believe will be affected by the means test will be the achiever types whose parents' income is just above the income limit for higher education grants and, therefore, their children do not qualify for higher education grants. Heretofore many of these students would have opted to pursue a course in a regional technical college or Dublin Institute of Technology institution which would have lead to a certificate and then a diploma.  The net result of this change will be that more of these students will go to university and this will be to the detriment of the regional technical college <Col N="648" /> and Dublin Institute of Technology institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bills that were passed by this House, but the decision to subject the maintenance portion of the ESF grant to a means test will have a profound effect on student intake in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>Some of the students who attend a regional technical college and gain a diploma subsequently go on to university. While their child is attending the regional technical college, the parents and the student, if lucky enough to get employment during the summer, have the opportunity to save so that he or she can go on to university to study for a degree.  This group will suffer because of the decision to means-test the ESF maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns:</P>
    <P>(1)  the discrimination against PAYE workers and their families in assessment of eligibility for third level education grants,</P>
    <P>While the Minister must be given credit for substantially increasing income limits, it must be remembered that this favours everybody and not just the PAYE sector. However, I was asked to question how the income of the self-employed was assessed for higher education grant purposes. I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, to clarify how the local authorities, and the vocational education committees, treat the items that appear as &ldquo;drawings&rdquo; in the accounts of the self-employed.</P>
    <P>If I understood the Minister of State correctly, he said that such &ldquo;drawings&rdquo; are seen as capital and not as income and are, therefore, not taken into consideration as income solely.  The Minister should address this issue.  If I am a self-employed business man and I draw out money from my business solely for my own use, surely that is not capital but is an income for me that should be taken into consideration if my child applies for <Col N="649" /> a third level grant.  It is more than a perception that PAYE workers are being discriminated against.  The P60, which the PAYE worker gets at the end of the year, clearly states the person's income and the figures are virtually always accurate. However, this is not the same for the self-employed and those who are not in the PAYE sector.  This problem cannot be solved by the Department of Education as it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, particularly the question of &ldquo;drawings&rdquo; which was brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>What I understood the Minister of State to say earlier this evening was outrageous, that a self-employed person could draw substantial amounts from their business solely for their own use without those amounts of money being recognised as income.</P>
    <P>The income thresholds of low-income families are referred to in the Fine Gael motion.  I warmly welcome the moves made by the Minister in that regard. However, in the assessment of a person's eligibility for a grant or a subsidy from the State, is it not the actual amount of money that is received in the hand that really matters?  Gross income is different. Ireland is a highly taxed country.  Deputy Higgins cited the example of someone who contacted him in relation to this matter earlier today, an illustration which gave a flavour of the difference in real terms between gross income and net income.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the year it was announced that an interdepartmental group was being set up to consider equity in relation to eligibility for higher education grants. I recall the Minister stating in the House that he hoped the group would report before 1 September and I also recall a subsequent statement that he hoped the group would report before then.  The Minister has brought in welcome changes but I believe he would have served a better purpose had he made sure that the report of the interdepartmental group came sooner and that any changes made would be applied with the benefit of an overview of the entire position.</P>
    <P>I have some personal sympathy with <Col N="650" /> an interesting point that was raised regarding a tax free allowance for people who spend money on third level education. At present the parents or other relatives of a student can take out a deed of covenant on a particular student.  As I understand the position, the deed of covenant relates to about 5 per cent of income, so essentially the better off one is the most one benefits from that tax concession.</P>

      <P>The principle of tax relief for money spent by parents or relatives on students attending third level education is progressive but obviously it would have to be administered in a progressive way.  I certainly would not advocate any measure that would result in outrageous payments being made to the very well off.  Inside a certain level of income such a departure would be welcome and equitable.</P>
      <P>In general, I support the thrust of the Fine Gael motion.  As I have already said, it has been overtaken by events.  In conclusion I wish to draw attention to my belief that assessment of grant eligibility should be made on net income.  I do not mean to criticise the Minister's approach, which is progressive.  The measure is welcome.  However, it is on the actual income that accrues to a person, whether that person is a PAYE worker or is self-employed, that the criteria in relation to income limits should be based.  Once that principle is established there are other options that can be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for sharing his time with me.  Like Deputy O'Shea, I welcome the increase in the eligibility limits for higher education grants, the extension of higher education grants to at least some mature students and other improvements that have been announced in the systems of student support. However, the Minister is behaving a little like the pupil who for the first time has got all of his sums right in that he has not stopped praising himself since making his announcement, and, as the Minister knows very well, self-praise is no praise.  The Minister has pulled a stroke; in fact, he has pulled two strokes. He has pulled a political stroke by making his announcement in advance of today's day-long debate on student grants and he has pulled an administrative stroke by financing the improvements in the means test eligibility limits from the savings he will make in the means testing of the ESF grants.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the invidious comparison between somebody who would earn £15,000 and somebody who would earn £50,000.  I respectfully suggest that that is not the comparison the Minister will be asked to make.  The Minister will be asked to make a comparison between what happened last year and what will happen next year for people who otherwise would be on ESF grants.  For example, he will have a postal clerk who does one hour overtime per week and who last year could have sent a son or daughter to an ESF-funded course and have an ESF grant applied to that education, ask him why this year he or she will be over the eligibility limit for qualification of a student to a full grant.  He will be asked why the sons and daughters of gardaí or of teachers who last year would have been able to qualify for an ESF grant will this year have their grants subjected to means testing and why the income limits of those parents will not enable their children to benefit from a full grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier today in welcoming the increase in the eligibility limits I pointed out that those on modest incomes were still left unable to benefit from a full <Col N="652" /> grant.  I identified the categories of workers whose income would put them outside the eligibility limit.  Staff officers in the Civil Service, teachers, gardaí, nurses and bank officials are hardly people in receipt of the kind of income mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that in announcing the improvements in the schemes the Minister is actually moving one step closer to a middle income revolt in this country. PAYE workers in receipt of modest, middle incomes, who pay very high tax and who get very little benefit back from the State, people who have to pay for everything they get, now see this Government whittling away the modest benefits that they did have.  The Government are means testing ESF grants, have launched an attack on the insured social welfare system and the dental benefit is being whittled away.  I believe that those earners, whose taxes are paying for the education system and for the upkeep of this State, are beginning to ask themselves what they are getting in return.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be faced this autumn by a very disgruntled student body, many of whom will be sitting side by side with students who will benefit under the extension of the mature students grants and from the increase in the means test eligibility limits.  Existing mature students will find that the new intake of students in October will benefit from the extension of the mature students grants and students already in the system will realise that they do not benefit from the increase in the means test eligibility limits.  There is a long way to go before we will achieve the kind of equity and fairness in the higher education grants system that those of us in this House would wish to have.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister <Col N="653" /> on yesterday's announcement.  To Irish people generally education is one of the most important items on their agenda.  It is a little sad that in Opposition the Fine Gael Party are very good at putting down motions on education but when they were in Government with the Labour Party the first Department to suffer from the axe were the Department of Education. However, that is to be expected.  Also I accept that in Opposition their role is to say the Government are not doing a good job.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party have given a welcome of sorts to the Minister's announcement. Like many people I was delighted with that announcement.  It is important to stress that 60 per cent of our students will receive grants.  While 40 per cent may not be in receipt of grants, I believe the means test should be applied. Where people are fortunate enough to have means large enough to allow them educate their children they should not begrudge others the grants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they get the grants, but there should be a means test in relation to maintenance.  That is just.  We have probably the highest percentage of third level students of any country in Europe.  I understand one third of our population have been in third level education. We may have a problem employing our people at home but at least Irish people who leave home are well educated. They are no longer the hewers of wood and drawers of water.</P>

      <P>Many of them are in countries without the proper documentation. I should like to tell Deputy Gilmore that 35 per cent of the chief executives of the top 500 American companies are Irish or of Irish descent or Irish extraction.  The Irish are doing very well.  At least we <Col N="654" /> send them out well equipped and we will continue to do that.</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with means-testing particularly when students come from homes where there are adequate means. I have always felt sorry for the middle income group who must pay for everything. Deputy Gilmore is referring to deprived, poor people.  The poor are benefiting best out of this.  Deputy Gilmore is probably blue in the face hearing that instead of the 33 per cent increase in income thresholds requested in the Fine Gael motion, which they regarded as pretty generous, we have given a 40 per cent and 50 per cent increase.  That is excellent.</P>
      <P>We are not in the business of gloating. The Minister has had an opportunity to examine the scheme carefully.  It will continue to cost us money.  He mentioned that it might cost an extra £4 million this year alone, but, nevertheless, it is to be welcomed.  The Fine Gael Party should agree to withdraw their motion in favour of our amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of full time students has increased enormously.  When I was elected to the Dáil in 1965 the figure was in the region of £20,000 full-time students. By the mid-nineties we will have about £95,000 full-time students, at a time when funding will be fairly short due to the high amounts of money we need to pay out on social welfare because of high unemployment.  At the moment we are enduring the tragedy that, while technology has improved, our exports are increasing and our growth rates are greater than those in most EC countries, they are not being translated into employment.  We are examining this carefully.  We have a highly skilled, highly motivated workforce.  I am glad the country voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the recent referendum. That will encourage companies <Col N="655" /> in the US, Japan and elsewhere to establish plants here.</P>

It has made a contribution in line with this long tradition to the development of Community policies in the field of education.  The Government side look forward to participating fully in the increased level of Community activity in education which will ensue following on the acceptance of the European Treaty.  What remains the same is the sure prospect of financial sacrifice for those who wish their children to pursue education and secure third level qualifications. The recent history of Irish education demonstrates clearly that the proportion of such people continues to grow year by year.  Lest there be misunderstanding, I should like to record that I welcome this increase unreservedly. However, this expansion has implications especially at second and third levels.  It has put additional strain on already limited resources.  This is particularly noticeable at third level <Col N="656" /> which has experienced an increase of 60 per cent in student numbers in the past ten years.  Further growth is projected in the next four or five years.  This will bring our participating rates in full time third level education into favourable comparison with those of some of our most affluent Community partners.</P>
    <P>Against this background it was timely and prudent for the Government to undertake a full review of the schemes of financial support for third level students. The main objectives of the review were to ensure equity in the different schemes and, to the extent that it was practicable and affordable, to address the particular financial pressures on students from lower to middle income families.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore and other speakers referred to the status of parents who would no longer be able to avail of grants. They also talked about the lower and middle income groups, the high numbers of unemployed and how these people would be disadvantaged.  I think it has long been accepted in this House that every effort should be made to make third level education available to any student capable of taking full advantage of it, another way of saying that no student should be denied access to third level education on the sole grounds of inability to pay.  I am sure all Members would accept that on the grounds of social equity.</P>
    <P>We have also been uncomfortably aware for some time that the income eligible limits applying to third level grant schemes were unacceptable, which meant that students might be forced to refuse an offer of a third level place because they could not afford it.  The main focus of the reforms introduced by the Government were well covered by the Minister today and we are all aware of the alterations in the income guidelines, which are welcome.  As Deputy Briscoe said, 60 per cent of our students will now be covered by grants.  The Opposition criticise but they do not have any answers.  Deputy Gilmore wants everybody to avail of grants but then he referred to certain classes.</P>
    <P>The second focus of the reform which <Col N="657" /> is very welcome is in relation to the linking of tax assessment by the PAYE workers and the self-employed which will vindicate their claim that the current assessment procedure &mdash; particularly in relation to the self-employed &mdash; meant that they had an unfair advantage.  As the Minister pointed out, means-testing is an essential instrument of an equitable resource allocation.  The fact that non-means tested grants were available to ESF students represented an anomaly which had to be addressed on the grounds of equity.  However, I fully accept that there will be disappointment among some students and parents.  Nevertheless the long term effect of the decision will mean greater equity in the different student support schemes.  I am confident that people inside and outside the House will, in due course, concede that the basis of good sense and fairness is enshrined in this new approach.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to dramatically increase the student support grant from £10,000 to £15,000.  Under the new arrangement families with one to three children will qualify for a full fee and maintenance grants on an income of £15,000 which is a substantial increase on the previous income limit of £10,787.  The same family will be eligible for a full fee grant if they have an income under £18,000 and to 50 per cent of grants if they have an income up to £19,000.  These new measures announced by the Minister will mean that a larger number of middle income families will qualify.  However, for the first time factory workers will be in a position to send their children to universities.</P>

      <P>Sligo Regional Technical College is in the heart of my constituency and its catchment area is Sligo, Leitrim, part of Mayo and Donegal and north Roscommon.  Nowhere have the ESF maintenance grants, as at present administered, been more significant both in the build up of the college and in making available the opportunity of third level education to large numbers of students who would otherwise have been forced to opt out, than in this area.  Nothing the Minister said will alleviate the problem being created, in particular for Sligo Regional Technical College, by the introduction of means-testing maintenance grants, welcome as the increases are, in the third level limits.  The success of Sligo college has been an important factor in the economy of the whole north-west region, in particular in the attraction of industry.  The graduates forced to emigrate &mdash; the region has the highest emigration rates in the whole country &mdash; went with very valuable education and skills, equal to anything they encountered in their own age groups in the host countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test will result in up to 60 per cent of all future students and those changing courses losing out.  Some will be deprived of the grant, some will get partial grants while others will get nominal <Col N="659" /> grants.  As we heard earlier from Deputy Higgins, the PAYE workers will get nominal grants.  As we heard earlier from Deputy Higgins, the PAYE workers will be the worst hit.  The harsh reality is that in many parts of the Sligo regional technical college area &mdash; in the other regional technical colleges and I am sure in Dublin Institute of Technology areas also &mdash; many parents will have to tell their sons and daughters that they must forget about their plans for third level education if the Minister persists in means testing ESF grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sligo Regional Technical College and others have been particularly successful in attracting students from farming and manual workers backgrounds, leaving a very balanced socioeconomic student body profile.  All this is at risk.  I have spoken about the damage the new means testing decision will do to the educational pattern and prospects in the Sligo regional technical college catchment area, the one I know best.  I am sure it will not be much different in any other part of the country.  All over the country there are students who have done their leaving certificates and whose educational fate will be decided by this ESF decision, irrespective of how well they did in the examination.  When I talk about their education fate I am talking about whether they go on to third level, that is how serious it is for many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to introduce the means test for ESF maintenance grants for students of regional technical colleges is a big mistake, a retrograde step.  It is a decision which will cause major hardship for many families and put third level education beyond the reach of many more families.  As I outlined, it will have extraordinary and serious implications for the Sligo Regional Technical College which has been built up to a great extent on the ESF grants system, grants which were not means tested.  Most of the college's 1,188 students benefit from those grants. <Col N="660" /> The Minister is now delivering a body blow to that system which has been of vital importance to Sligo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputies from all sides who contributed to this debate, those who agreed and those who disagreed with the thrust of the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave the Deputy one minute, which is more than his colleague gave him.</P>
      <P>The notion of a tax free allowance, as advanced by Deputy Therese Ahearn, has much to commend it.  I am talking not alone about the people who are over the limit, but about those who are marginally above it.  I gave the example of a person with four children, earning £20,000 per year but who will not qualify for any third level grant.  A tax free allowance of £3,000 &mdash; £30 to £40 a week net &mdash; would enable that person to send his or her children to third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for validating various case histories &mdash; the member of the Garda Síochána, the lorry driver and so on, who will have to turn down any overtime that may be available in order to artificially come within the guidelines set by the Minister.  By and large, I agree with the principle of means-testing but I make no apology for singling out the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges for special consideration.  They are still in the embryonic stage, reasonably new innovations.  They are providing the kind of education recommended in the Culliton report and envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty: if we are to go forward with industrial policies here we will have to discriminate positively in favour of that type of education.  These colleges need a further boost.  As Deputy O'Shea said, by discriminating in favour of those colleges i.e. by way of the provision of ESF grants, top level students who would have gone otherwise to the universities, pursued courses in the regional technical colleges. If the ESF grants are taken from those <Col N="661" /> colleges there will be a mass movement from the regional technical colleges in Waterford, Tralee, Sligo and Letter-kenny to the perceived prestige places, the universities.  Unfortunately that is still the attitude towards universities in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point about not treating this as something to do with money from Europe.  Europe must be laughing all the way to the bank as we are the only country that means tests ESF grants.  Furthermore, the Minister is flatly contradicting a point made by his colleague, the Minister of State, regarding the provision of money for third level grants.  The Minister made the point that the reason ESF grants for mature students, which were introduced on 1 January 1991, were made retrospective was that it was money from Europe.  Now he is saying we cannot say this has something to do with money from Europe.  I would make the point in relation to grants, tax allowances, and so on, that it is much the same principle as the child benefit allowance, you take your chances.  Sometimes you are discriminating in favour of people in the very high income level but, by and large, you are targeting the people who need the benefit most.  I defy any Minister for Social Welfare to take away the child benefit allowance from the mothers of this country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the contributions from Deputies O'Shea and Gilmore. Deputy Gilmore, in particular, put his finger on the problem.  While the Minister has, in the short term, gained certain kudos by the announcement yesterday of the increased thresholds, he is, in fact, transferring resources; he is robbing Peter to pay Paul.  He is taking European Social Fund moneys from middle income parents, and transferring it to other sectors. If we do not redress the imbalance as it affects the middle income PAYE sector &mdash; we are not doing it with this measure &mdash; we are inviting them to revolt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> I thank Deputies Briscoe.  Callely Mattie Brennan and Nealon for their contributions but in particular, I thank the people who telephoned me to say they have noticed the transparency in what the Minister is embarking on.  The fact that this House has debated third level grants twice in four months, and that the Seanad has debated them in the same period, emphasises how high this issue is on the political agenda.  The announcement yesterday of increased thresholds will mean that thousands will be excluded.  If the income thresholds are increased by another £5,000, it will still be a question of so near and yet so far for many people.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's announcement makes a meal of tightening up the system and involves the Revenue Commissioners and the further threat of penalties.  I would point out to the Minister that penalties already exist in that attached to the current higher education grant form is a sworn affidavit.  The change will not make a single, solitary difference.  Unfortunately, affidavits mean very little to the majority of people.  Creative accounting is very much the order of the day and as long as accounts are certified there is nothing local authorities can do about them.  It is another case of the practice being far removed from the theory.</P>
    <P>There is need for overall analysis and reform of the various systems.  The higher education grants scheme is administered by the county councils and the European Social Fund grants scheme is administered by the nine regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.  The vocational education committee scheme is administered by the vocational education committees.  In regard to the PLCs, the ESF grants apply to fees only and today we are passing the local authorities higher education grants scheme.  As series of relief measures were announced by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Davern, and further measures were announced by the Minister in the interim.  Then there is yesterday's announcement.  In reality, our third level grants system is an <i>ad hoc</i> one that has grown over the years.  Essentially, <Col N="663" /> it is an inconsistent anomaly-ridden patchwork that is in need of fundamental reform and reappraisal.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper, published 12 days ago, is a discussion document to launch a nationwide debate on all aspects of education.  Chapter 8 deals with higher education, new admission procedures, credit accumulation and transfer, postgratuate work, research, quality assurance, course development, length of courses and of academic year.  It deals also with funding arrangements of a capital nature, management structures, coordination in the university and non-university sectors, the role of the Higher Education Authority and the Council for Educational and Vocational Awards.  It is supposed to be a comprehensive discussion document, yet there is not one syllable in it about student grant aid. There is no mention in the Green Paper about means-testing or otherwise.  I have no doubt that, in response to his invitation, the Minister will receive many submissions and that he will be inundated with submissions on means-testing.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not deferred the ESF means-testing proposal until such time as he may receive some such submission.  I am <Col N="664" /> equally disappointed that he has not adjudged the Educational Social and Research Institute a competent agency to prepare an overall picture of the third level grants scheme.  The Minister's approach to European social funding is wrong.  One group should not be pulled down in order to push another group up. We should not be going for the lowest common denominator but for the highest one.  We should not be making the pitch more unplayable for all; we should be levelling it.  We should be sending a message to Europe that it has failed to provide us with jobs and opportunities.  If we are to provide a conveyor belt for top quality third level students the least the EC should be asked to do is to pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>Finally, who will administer the scheme?  I would like the Minister to take cognisance of the warnings from IMPACT.  I do not believe that the new means-testing proposal is workable.  I am sorry the Minister did not avail of the opportunity in the context of the Green Paper and of this debate to allow the ESRI carry out a global analysis.  If he had done so he would have left his name etched <i>ad infinitum</i> in Irish education.</P>

      <P>We were debating section 4 which deals with examinations outside the State.  We have two amendments, one tabled by the Minister and <Col N="669" /> the other by Deputy J. Higgins.

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section in respect of which most serious disagreement arises.  Section 5 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Section 2 (1A) of the Principal Act (inserted by section 3 of this Act) shall apply to mature students who have secured places to commence courses in approved institutions in the year 1992 or subsequent years.</P>
      <P>As was indicated in the course of Second Stage, all parties on this side of the House indicated that we were tabling amendments to this section to ensure that the relevant grants would apply to existing mature students attending courses in universities and colleges who would otherwise be eligible for such grants in October 1992.  I accept your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle, that the amendments are out of order.  In the letter you sent me, you stated that they must be adjudged to be out of order as they involve a potential charge on Revenue.  To some extent I anticipated that ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of Second Stage I implored the Minister of State to reflect on what was being said by Members on this side of the House, requesting that he introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to the effect that grants would apply to existing mature students.  That case was made from all sides of the House.  Indeed, when responding the Minister said he had some sympathy with <Col N="671" /> it but unfortunately sympathy will not put bread on the table.  I very much regret that the Minister turned down the request from all sides of the House to extend the grants scheme to existing students. Incidentally, I also regret that the Minister for Education &mdash; who has been so prominent within the past 24 hours in taking credit for and praising himself for improvements in the higher education grants scheme &mdash; has not thought it worth his while to spend another hour in this House after Private Members' time to deal directly and personally with this very topic.  That is very disappointing.</P>
    <P>In the course of Second Stage debate we indicated it was unfair to have circumstances prevail in which existing students would not benefit from the grants, that there were many students who had commenced courses because of the promise given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> at the beginning of 1991 that a scheme of grants would be introduced for mature students. Various promises were given.  All the signals from Ministers and others in the intervening period suggested that those students who had embarked on courses last autumn would qualify for student grants, many of whom will have to withdraw from their courses if they are not covered by such grants next October. That is the simple fact of the matter, communicated to me by a number of students who have said they have encountered great financial hardship in their first year in college and in no way can they continue in the absence of a grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister contends it will cost additional money to include them in the scheme.  Then, by implication &mdash; because I listened very carefully to his response to Second Stage &mdash; he implied that the reason the scheme is not being extended to mature students is that the increase in the eligibility and means test limits will apply only to students registering for the first time in October next.  He implied that if he extended the grants scheme under this Bill to mature students he would then be under pressure to extend <Col N="672" /> the eligibility limits for the grants scheme to existing students.</P>
    <P>Can one imagine the reaction were the Minister for Agriculture and Food to announce a scheme of grants for farmers which would apply only to farmers who bought land after a certain date?  Can one imagine an employer deciding to grant an increase of pay to his employees, stipulating that it would apply to new employees only, or were the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; I must say I am reluctant to tempt him &mdash; to announce, say, an increase in old age pensions which would apply only to people who reached 65 after 1 October 1992?  Clearly the Minister's proposals in regard to mature students are absurd and unfair.  In replying to Second Stage debate I know the Minister indicated he was unable to take our requests on board.</P>
    <P>This will be the central issue of difference on this otherwise welcome Bill. Most of us have been quite generous in the course of the day in welcoming improvements in the student grants scheme announced in recent times but it really spoils its provisions and is very unfair to those students at present within the system to exclude them in the manner being done.  If the Minister is not prepared to amend this section, either on the floor of the House in course of Committee Stage or perhaps on reflection when we deal with Report Stage immediately thereafter, I will have to indicate my intention to oppose this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out this morning on Second Stage that in this context paragraph 6 of the explanatory memorandum, to some extent, was misleading, in that, in the second last line, it states: &ldquo;... students who secure places in approved institutions for 1992 and subsequent years&rdquo;.  There is no mention there of students commencing but merely a reference to students securing places, although I concede that in the Bill the word &ldquo;commence&rdquo; is included.  I had tabled amendment No. 9 &mdash; which has been ruled out of order &mdash; seeking to insert, after the word &ldquo;commence&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;or to continue to pursue&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> It is regrettable that the Minister will not give way on this issue.  In essence, the Bill has been welcomed on this side of the House.  I might briefly repeat the arguments I advanced this morning.  For example, when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was published, the document of agreement drawn up between the social partners approved by this House, mentioned grants for mature students.  There was nothing incorporated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> stating that the grants would be applicable from the beginning of the new academic year for new students only.  I read out a letter in the House this morning indicating that it was quite clear that students accepted places, as mature students, for one year at great expense, inconvenience and sacrifice on the justifiable expectation &mdash; on the basis of information then available &mdash; that at the commencement of the 1992-93 academic year, their second year in college, they would qualify for mature student higher education grants.</P>
    <P>There were varying estimates of the cost involved in including mature students.  The estimate of the Mature Students' Association claimed that of approximately 1,200 students, an estimated 350 would qualify for a mature student grant; in other words, of the 1,200 at present within the system 350 would qualify for grants.  Therefore we are talking about a small number of students and not a very large sum of money.</P>
    <P>The suffering that will be caused to many of these people is not acceptable. It is certainly not justifiable.  In anticipation of my amendment being ruled out of order because it would constitute a potential charge on the Exchequer, I asked the Minister to bring in his own amendment on Committee Stage.  The Minister has not done so but Report Stage is yet to come.  I plead with the Minister again to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to remove this injustice. It does not require a great deal of money to rectify this anomaly but in human terms it would have a very wide and positive effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> We welcome the Bill on this side of the House.  It is progressive.  It was developed in discussions with the trade union movement, the Government and the employers.  This movement towards expanding the range and quality of second chance education available to people, particularly those who are not very well off, is to be welcomed. However, the benefit comes to those who come into the system in the 1992-93 academic year.  The people who pioneered this process, who have shown the way and demonstrated that people will go down this road of improving their qualifications and their employment potential at very great sacrifice to themselves are the very group that is being penalised by this legislation.  Once again I plead with the Minister inasmuch as Deputies on this side of the House are precluded from doing so, to bring in an amendment to rectify this anomaly.  The niggardly approach that is being applied here is just not good enough.  In the absence of a positive response from the Minister at the end of Committee Stage, the Labour Party will be opposing the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the remarks made by Deputies Gilmore and O'Shea on this section.  It is extremely unfortunate that when we are marking a milestone in relation to higher education grants the whole atmosphere should be sullied by what is nothing more than a scrooge-like approach on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing but respect for the Irish Mature Students Association.  These are the people that hassled, harried and lobbied and put together a very strong argument. They collated all the statistics and made such a case that it was inevitable that we would capitulate.  The finished product is the Bill before us.  It puts in place a positive scheme of arrangements for third level grants for people who, because of their income at the time they left secondary school, were not able to avail of the opportunity of going on to third level education.  They did not have the money or the resources.  At some <Col N="675" /> stage subsequent to that they have found it possible to get into the third level mainstream.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the people who did all the ground-work, who presented a cast iron case, who made the submission that was the crunch point in relation to this breakthrough and who pioneered the movement are the people who will be left on the education sidelines.  All the benefits of this Bill will be enjoyed only by the people who &ldquo;enter&rdquo; third level in September.  One would not mind if there was to be a knock-on effect, if it was to be a recurring charge, if it was something that would permeate the system for the next number of years or as long as the scheme was in operation.  However, as was said by Deputy Michael D. Higgins on Second Stage, this is a once off payment to 350 students.  Even if it was not the case, surely there would be an argument for making a grand gesture to the people who did the ground work.  A relatively small amount is involved.  Already tonight, £1 million has been saved on ESF grants by the introduction of means-testing. By means-testing ESF grants the Minister is saving more than he is giving by way of increases in the thresholds.</P>
    <P>It has been said tonight that the Minister will face an extra charge costing about £4 million as a result of increasing the thresholds by 50 per cent across the board.  However, by means-testing ESF grants he is saving about £10 million.  I reckon that at the end of the year, when all of the debits are put in place, there will actually be a saving to the Exchequer by means-testing ESF grants.  It would be an acceptable gesture if the Minister would take £1 million of that and transfer it to those 350 students.  I appeal to the Minister of State to introduce on Report Stage, his own amendment to rectify this anomaly, this injustice.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore that the Minister should be in the House for the debate on this section.  We agree with the basic thrust of the Bill.  It is going in the right direction.  However, we are now at the nub of the problem of whether the people who fought the case, who <Col N="676" /> launched the crusade, who took it to its finality, are going to be left on the education sidelines or if there will be a grand gesture recognising their entitlement to be here.  I hope the Minister will see the light of what we are trying to achieve and the injustice of what he is doing by not recognising the right of these people to be included.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Gilmore that this Minister has taken unto himself the skill of involving himself in high profile popular events which are in the full glare of the media and of ducking the more unpalatable, more unsavoury and more unpopular measures.  We could all be song and dance routine people if we wanted but the kind of person we need in the Ministry is somebody who can take things on the chin as well as enjoying the benefits and fruits of praise.  I wish that when the unpopular things are being discussed here the Minister will come in and face the music.</P>
    <P>I made the point on several occasions that the Minister of State at the Department of Education and other Ministers of State, are being wheeled in here night after night to deal with Adjournment debates or grievance time debates.  Since he became Minister for Education we have not seen this Minister in the House for one Adjournment debate or grievance time debate.  We have seen Deputy Kenneally and others but not the Minister.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, has been left out on his own tonight, without any civil servants and the Minister.  Therefore, he does not have the power or discretion to make a decision.  If I were in Deputy Aylward's place I would draft my own amendment. If he does that he will have the gratitude of everybody and will have struck a blow on behalf of the junior Ministers who very often are worked to the bone while the Ministers take the credit for what is good or what is popular and attractive.</P>

      <P>At this stage it is important to point out that every attempt has been made in this House by all parties to make the case for having mature students treated equally after next September. I do not wish to waste the time of the House because I already adverted to this point in my Second Stage contribution. I ask the Minister to take on board the points I have made and to think of the demoralisation which will ensue for the people who are being excluded. Trying to get over the hurdle of continuing in college next autumn is not an abstract point.  Having been disappointed in their expectations, many mature students have already dropped out of college.</P>
      <P>One must remember that the students who will qualify and those who are being excluded come from the same pool of people.  It will be incredible if these mature students are excluded from the scheme.  This is the core issue in the Bill. It will be seen from the Book of Estimates that the sum of money required could be very easily found &mdash; it is non-recurring expenditure.  The appropriate course for the Minister is to seek authority from the Minister for Finance to accede to our request so that all students can be treated equally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said on several occasions today, I have great sympathy for the sentiments behind the Deputy's amendments.  There is always the problem when introducing improvements in the grant scheme that students who do not qualify for a grant the previous year feel they are unlucky or hard done by.  I <Col N="678" /> should like to explain the present situation and perhaps dispel some misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>There is no ongoing higher education grants scheme as such.  The 1968 Act allows local authorities to submit annual schemes for approval by the Minister for students entering college during that year.  Consequently, higher income limits and, for example, the reduction of the educational qualifications from four honours to two honours come into effect from the year of proposal.  As I said, I have great sympathy for the sentiments behind these amendments but I am afraid that any concession might create a whole range of anomalies which could not be ignored.</P>
      <P>Students do not qualify for grants every year on the basis of the income limits for that year but on the income limits set for the following year.  This Bill is mainly designed to cater for mature students but the application of amendments to the scheme does come into question.  Up to this year local authorities could not submit a scheme to the Minister which did not remain within the confines of the 1968 Act.  This Bill will allow them to submit a scheme for the 1992-93 academic year which will take into account the circumstances of mature students.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured to take on board the genuine concerns expressed by Members of all political parties, including Members of my party.  Accordingly I intend to insert a new subsection (3) in section 5 which will provide that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by regulation, from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, extend the scope of section 5(1) in relation to mature students.</P>
      <P>I will circulate the text of this amendment before Report Stage.  I hope this meets the concerns expressed by the Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the existing mature students are consoled by the level of sympathy expressed by the Minister about their plight, but it does not change the circumstances.  This is a great pity <Col N="679" /> because in the main this Bill was welcomed by Members on all sides of the House.  As has been pointed out, the exclusion of mature students from the scheme is a serious omission.  The Government are being nothing short of mean in excluding mature students. Many speakers have commented on the absence of the Minister, but we are all human.  How could he sit here and not be embarrassed about introducing legislation which will exclude a mere 350 students from the scheme?  I believe the Minister is embarrassed to come into the Chamber tonight; after all, he is in the building.</P>
      <P>We are debating this legislation primarily because of the work done by the Irish Mature Students' Association.  In other words, they fought the battle but are being excluded from the victory. There is no financial or logical explanation for excluding them from the scheme.  The Minister has tried to justify their exclusion by pointing out the changes introduced in the eligibility guidelines for higher education grants over the years.  Those are only changes in eligibility guidelines and we are dealing here tonight with new legislation which will introduce grants for mature students for the first time.  The existing mature students are being excluded not on grounds of eligibility but because they are existing students.</P>
      <P>It is very unfair of the Minister to assume that those students who, at great cost to themselves, are pursuing courses at present will be able to continue their education.  We all realise from discussions with mature students that they work from year to year and have to raise the necessary finance.  If they are excluded from this scheme many of them may not be able to continue their courses. It is extraordinary that the very sincere views expressed by Members on all sides of the House about the exclusion of these students have not been taken on board by the Minister.  I believe this is a mistake which he will live to regret.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond briefly to the Minister's earlier remarks.  He is <Col N="680" /> being somewhat pedantic in trying to suggest that there is no ongoing higher education grants system, that there is an annualised scheme.  As we have been repeatedly told all day, this scheme has been in existence for 25 years.  Therefore it is a bit late in the day to tell us that the scheme is operated on a year by year basis.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on the amendment the Minister proposes introducing on Report Stage.  I seek clarification on whether he is putting this amendment before us now or on Report Stage.  If I understand the Minister's amendment correctly &mdash; he only read it once and we have not been circulated with the text &mdash; it is that the Minister may, by regulation, and with the approval of the Minister for Finance, extend the scope of section 5 (1) of this Bill.  I should like the Minister to tell us in plain language what his intentions are.  This may well be a formula for making progress on this issue but I should like to have it clarified by the Minister. Is it his intention to seek the approval of the Minister for Finance to make regulations to extend the scope of section 5 (1) to allow existing mature students to qualify for student grants?  That is the bottom line and we need to know the intention behind the amendment.</P>

      <P>When one reflects on the Minister's proposed amendment one can see that it has the merit of improving the legislation by giving it flexibility. Therefore, it could have the merit of not only dealing with the existing problem but also of anticipating any further anomalies which may arise.  It will enable the Minister for Education of the day, with the permission of the Minister for Finance, to rectify any anomalies which may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify the position with which we are concerned under section 5, that of existing mature students, and state whether their case is being recommended by the Minister for Education to the Minister for Finance for resolution.  If that is the case it means that when the second Finance Bill of 1992 comes before the House <Col N="681" /> in the autumn we will be able to support the request of the Department of Education to facilitate a resolution of this problem and that would clarify matters enormously.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go over the ground already covered but it was disappointing to read about means-testing for ESF grants.  In this case means-testing will not apply to existing students. I have met representatives of students who were particularly impressed by various Ministers who encouraged mature students back into the education system. There are two categories of mature students: the person who cannot get a job and goes back to college and those who have a job and make tremendous sacrifices to better themselves.  Considering that of the 75,000 people in third level education only 350 are mature students, they represent less than 0.5 per cent of the total.  This is a very vulnerable sector.  The Minister told us of the provisions that &ldquo;the Minister may, from time to time, in relation to regulations&rdquo; take certain action.  On Report Stage the Minister should tighten up that provision.  He should redress the unjust position that prevails by conceding that these people be included in this Bill.</P>

We welcome what the Minister is trying to achieve but, unfortunately, he does not go far enough. Nonetheless it is a cautious advance.  The wording proposed is that the Minister may, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, extend the scope of section 5 (1).  Therefore it gives him power but the problem is that if that power is not acted upon, it is meaningless. The Minister should make a clear and unequivocal statement in relation to what he proposes to do, what order he proposes to make and how he sees this measure as a remedy for the case advanced by all of us of the 350 people <Col N="682" /> who are caught in a vacuum and will not benefit from this legislation.</P>

Could the Minister give a specific assurance that it is his intention to use this section to ensure that the 350 people, about whom all of us are concerned, will be catered for in terms of qualifying for grants in September of this year, subject to the other conditions being met?  These people should not be excluded on the basis that they are not new entrants into the system.  If the Minister gives an assurance on that point progress can be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably fair to say that many of the 350 mature students who might qualify for a student grant embarked on their course of study as a result of what they read in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the promises they received that a scheme of student grants would be introduced for them.  They accepted the nod and wink that they would be fixed up, but that has not happened.  The Minister is now asking this House to accept this proposal in a somewhat similar vein. He proposes to include in the primary legislation an additional paragraph which will enable him to make regulations with the approval of the Minister for Finance, but there are no assurances that the Minister <Col N="683" /> for Finance will give his approval. The Minister is intimating that it will be all right in October, but it was not all right for the students who enrolled last October and it does not appear as if it will be next October.  We need more specifics from the Minister before we can make a decision on the section.</P>
      <P>The Minister should state his intentions. I wish to put a number of specific questions to him.  If the Bill is passed in the amended form he is proposing is it his intention to make regulations following the passage of this Bill to provide that the scheme of higher education grants will apply to mature students who are currently on courses?  If we receive a positive and clear answer to that question it would help us greatly on this side of the House.  However, if the Minister's intention is ambiguous, that would raise certain doubts in my mind.  This whole problem has arisen as a result of the ambiguity that arose following the adoption of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  If the Minister gave a clear statement of his intention in this regard it would help us greatly.</P>

      <P>In an attempt to achieve a resolution of a difficulty, towards which I detect sympathy from the Minister, I wish to make a very important point.  If we pass the legislation this week &mdash; the last week's sitting before the recess &mdash; the position will be changed in a clear way for mature students applying for this grant for the first time in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again there is the problem of the uncertainty of the people who are within the existing system.  I will not labour the point but already many have more or less thrown in the towel.  They have to make their plans the same as anybody else, before September.  It is only reasonable for the Minister of State to go beyond his amendment and to simply say that it is the view of the Minister for Education and himself that such a regulation would be in place to enable those 350 people not to be excluded from the terms of the legislation.  The Minister would then have <Col N="684" /> the benefit of dealing with the specific problem and of having made the legislation more flexible in relation to dealing with future situations that may arise. If on the other hand we finish this legislation after the next Stage without this matter having been resolved, we will have left a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the people who have made the strongest representations for amending the legislation.  I can appreciate that the Minister of State cannot give an undertaking on behalf of the Minister for Finance, but he can give an indication that it is the policy of the Minister for Education that such a regulation would be in place at the same time as the legislation taking effect in order to ensure that the 350 people for whom we have been making a case are not excluded.  With such an assurance we can reconsider our position in relation to the Committee Stage and section 5.</P>

      <P>I agree with the basic thrust of what the other Opposition speakers are saying.  We are onto the only major obstacle in relation to our acceptance of this Bill.  We are tantalisingly close to agreement.  We are grateful to the Minister of State for introducing his amendment at this stage.  The Minister of State has asked us to accept his good faith and assurances, but what we are trying to do is defend the interests of those 350 people.  We would love to accept at face value what the Minister of State is saying but we need the Minister of State to interpret, to specify and to be crystal clear in relation to the intention. We are not asking the Minister to enshrine the exact words &ldquo;that 350 people shall benefit&rdquo;.  We are asking the Minister to stitch into the record of the House, not into the legislation, what he means by the spirit of introducing this amendment at this stage.  If the Minister stitches it into the record of the House that this is his intention, subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, we will accept it.  I know the Minister cannot guarantee the agreement of the Minister for Finance but if he does this we can accept his bona fides.  The problem is <Col N="685" /> that the amendment says that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; by regulation, but the Minister may and he may not.  The Minister could decide to decline the invitation to do what he proposes to do in this instance.  If the Minister could be a little more clear with regard to his intention we could satisfactorily resolve the matter within a very short period.</P>

      <P>Now that we have the wording of the proposed amendment for Report Stage, there is one technical point which I would like clarified.  Section 5 (1) clearly states that the section shall apply to mature students who have secured places to commence courses in approved institutions in the year 1992.  The word &ldquo;commence&rdquo; is clear and unequivocal. The proposed new subsection says that the Minister from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance can extend the scope of subsection (1).  There may be a difficulty here.  We are talking about extending the scope of a subsection which only covers people who commence courses in 1992.  How can this new subsection be used to cover the situation the Minister wishes it to cover?  The Minister has introduced this amendment in the context of the spirit of the debate here, but I am concerned about the legality of this.  Obviously the Minister cannot give us an undertaking that the consent of the Minister for Finance will be forthcoming, but he can give an undertaking that the Department of Education will endeavour to have this implemented.  Section 5 (1) refers to students who have secured places to commence courses.  I do not see how the new subsection can apply in the way the Minister of State wishes it to apply and in the way which we wish it to apply.</P>

      <P>We are very near agreement.  I hope it is not a case of &ldquo;so near and yet so far&rdquo;.  The problem is that we want the Minister to outline clearly the intention implied in this amendment. We want the Minister to tell us whether or not it is his intention to include existing mature students for eligibility for grants. We want a specific commitment from the <Col N="686" /> Minister.  That is understandable in view of our deep concern in this regard.  We cannot really be satisfied with an amendment which says that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; because, as my colleague pointed out, the Minister may not.  If the Minister is not prepared to outline the intentions of this amendment more specifically perhaps he would agree that we proceed and conclude Committee Stage and get on to Report Stage where we can discuss this in more detail.</P>

      <P>Might I deign to be of some assistance?  If a Report Stage amendment is circulated to change the word &ldquo;commence&rdquo; in line 28 to &ldquo;pursue&rdquo; it would leave it totally flexible.  It means that the section with the Minister's amendment can apply to existing mature students.  All that is required, and I am sure it is not contentious, is a Report Stage amendment simply replacing the word &ldquo;commence&rdquo; with &ldquo;pursue&rdquo;.  If that is done the Minister's amendment will be consistent with the section and it will resolve the legal difficulty.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 35 to 44, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;9A&mdash;Where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act a draft of each regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a <Col N="687" /> resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the way in which regulations are made.  The formula proposed in the Bill when dealing with regulations is that they would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and be implemented unless a resolution annulling the regulation had been passed in either House within the following 21 days.  As we know from experience, rarely if ever does this House get an opportunity to debate a motion to annul regulations.  We rarely debate regulations in this House.  What I was seeking to do in my amendment was to make it a requirement that where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act, a draft of each regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  In other words, the Houses of the Oireachtas would have an opportunity to debate regulations.  We have already had one example and that is the amendment that has been proposed here relating to the making of regulations extending the scope of subsection (1).</P>
    <P>The detail of any such provision should be discussed by this House.  There is also a reference to the making of regulations, for example in relation to the manner in which the means test may be carried out. During an earlier part of the debate we discussed this matter and the Minister referred to the guidelines he would issue to the local authorities in relation to means testing.  As things stand we will not get the opportunity to debate those regulations in the House, whereas I think the House should have the opportunity to debate secondary legislation such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 as it stands in relation to regulations is in line with other third level legislation in general, for example the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1992, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1992, which were recently passed by this House have the <Col N="688" /> same provision in relation to regulations. Given that there is provision whereby either House could annul any such regulations I do not see that the provision in section 6 should cause any problems and I am not, therefore, prepared to accept this amendment.</P>

There is a great deal of talk about reforming the Dáil and I believe this area will have to be addressed sooner or later. We are constantly passing primary legislation enabling the Minister to do this, that or the other by way of order or regulation.  The Minister then makes the regulations and, in practice, this House never gets the opportunity of debating the matter.  I shall withdraw my amendment rather than take up the time of the House further on it.  However, I think we should return to the issue during a general debate on proposals to reform the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this amendment, which addresses what we are seeking to achieve.  Opposition Deputies had anxieties about amendment No. 1.  While that amendment was well intentioned and the Minister indicated a spirit of goodwill behind the tabling of that amendment, we sought further assurance before Report Stage about the Minister's thinking on this issue.  We are very grateful to the Minister for introducing amendment No. a1 because he has now enabled us to pass legislation that does justice to everybody and particularly to the 350 people who were the crusaders and pioneers in the higher education grants scheme for mature students.  Those 350 people, who lobbied, hassled, prepared a submission and made an irrefutable case, have been vindicated and validated and will now be included.  We are deeply grateful that the Minister has done the right thing.  The Minister can rest assured that he has the gratitude, good will and thanks of every Member of the House in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I should like to say that since the Minister has taken over as Minister of State at the Department of Education he has been extremely forthcoming in relation to the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and in dealing with education matters in general in the House.  Certainly he reached the pinnacle <Col N="690" /> of achievement tonight by doing what is the right and decent thing in accepting the right of those 350 people to benefit from the scheme.

The Irish Mature Students Association had lobbied for this change in the legislation, the USI had lobbied for this change, individual students had lobbied for this change, a number of speakers on all sides of the House asked in the course of Second Stage that this change be made.  The Minister expressed some sympathy for the points of view that were being expressed; a number of formulae were tested out on Committee Stage and eventually the Minister did something that is quite unusual in this House, he made a decision.  He decided to accept the argument that was being made to introduce this amendment on Report Stage. He is to be commended very much for it.  He will certainly be thanked by the students who will benefit from this change.  I welcome it very warmly and appreciate it.</P>

For those of us who sincerely felt that existing mature students should be included in this Bill our case has been vindicated and rewarded.  Having fought a long battle, we kept re-stressing our case and it has been successful.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that what the Minister has done is a once-off commitment. It is not a recurring expense on the Exchequer.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the continued development of the Industrial Credit Corporation plc. It allows for an increase in the amount of borrowings which the corporation may undertake.  The Bill also provides for a change in the name of the Industrial Credit Corporation to ICC Bank plc., for the supervision of the company by the Central Bank, for revised principal objects of the company, for the company to amend their memorandum and articles of association to accord with the changes in the Bill, and for some technical matters.</P>
    <P>The ICC's current borrowing limit of £1,000 million, which is also the amount which may be guaranteed by the Minister, has almost been reached.  This limit was introduced under the terms of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1990.  I should point out that borrowing includes deposits with the company, along with borrowing in the normal sense.  Up to now, all such borrowing has been guaranteed by the State.  The Bill provides for an increase in the borrowing limit to £1,300 million, but leaves the guarantee limit unchanged at £1,000 million.</P>
    <P>The Bill marks a departure, therefore, in that the increased amount of £300 million in ICC's borrowing powers will not be guaranteed by the State.  It reflects the policy which has been in operation for some years of reducing the Exchequer's exposure through guarantees to commercial State bodies in so far as that can be achieved.  Steps will be taken by the ICC to ensure that the two types of borrowing will be clearly segregated and identified by lenders and depositors.  I wish to make it clear that there is no change in relation to existing lenders and depositors with the ICC; their funds continue to be fully covered by the State guarantee already in place.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the detailed provisions of the Bill, I would like to give the House an indication of developments in relation to the corporation since 1990, <Col N="693" /> when a Bill to increase the ICC's borrowing limits was last before this House.</P>
    <P>The ICC have been developing along satisfactory lines.  They have enjoyed a consistent run of profitability since their incorporation and have paid dividends to the Exchequer over many years.  After tax, profits in 1991 were £5.86 million and dividend payments increased from £1.4 million to £1.8 million.  Their assets amounted to over £1 billion at the year end.  The ICC recently published their half year figures, which showed a steady performance in profits after tax of £3.27 million, and a continuation of their interim dividend, yielding over £700,000 to the Exchequer.  The chairman stated at the release of these figures that he expected a satisfactory outcome for the year, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances.</P>
    <P>The ICC recently withdrew from activities which were not providing an adequate return, such as hire purchase, leasing and fund management.  They are now concentrating on their core activities, term lending and trade finance to small and medium size business, treasury, including foreign exchange, and venture capital.  In addition, they will continue their involvement as an adviser in corporate finance activities.  The ICC are adopting a prudent approach to the growth of their assets &mdash; rather than a push for growth, they are concentrating largely on working their existing assets to maximum effect.  I am confident that the trend towards full commerciality of the ICC which has been ongoing for some time, will continue under the direction of the new chairman, whom I recently appointed.  The provisions of this Bill will help the corporation to maintain their present, steady progress and enable them to meet the challenges of the post-1992 situation in the financial services area.</P>
    <P>My predecessor announced in May 1990 that he was inviting firms to tender for a consultancy assignment on the future options available in relation to the ICC.  Subsequently, the consultants <Col N="694" /> reported that ICC would require additional capital in the years ahead which would not necessarily be available from the Exchequer and, without which, the future development of the company could be restricted.  They found that there was no compelling strategic reasons for the continued retention of the shares in ICC in State ownership.  They, therefore, recommended that the Minister should sell his entire shareholding in ICC.  The Government accepted that the option of a sale of the State's shareholding in ICC should be explored further, and the consultants were employed &mdash; on a no sale no fee basis &mdash; to assess the prospects for a sale.  However, no suitable purchaser of the State's shares in ICC has emerged so far.  I am keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, been some significant developments in the State banking sector since legislation relating to the ICC was last before this House.  The Trustee Savings Banks have now amalgamated. Legislation extending, <i>inter alia,</i> the areas of business that ACC can engage in was passed earlier this year.  It will be obvious that the main sections of this Bill follow closely the lines of the ACC Bank Act, 1992.  It is important to recognise, however, that there is still a substantial difference between the ICC and the ACC Bank in that the former is a merchant bank concentrating on the business sector, with few retail outlets, whereas the ACC Bank is now largely a retail bank with a traditional concentration on the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the State's banking activities should be amalgamated, and perhaps sold to the private sector.  A simple merger of the ACC and the ICC has also been suggested.  I am keeping the various options available to me under review.  All I can say at this stage is that I am not ruling out any particular course of action, including a sale of ICC, should a suitable purchaser emerge.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that <Col N="695" /> the increase in the borrowing limit of £300 million provided for in this Bill will not be guaranteed by the State.  Following the enactment of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1990, my Department in conjunction with ICC undertook an examination of this question in so far as it relates to the corporation. As a result of this examination, I am satisfied that the corporation can &mdash; and indeed should &mdash; tap the market for unguaranteed deposits.  I wish to repeat that the position of depositors and lenders who already have funds with ICC is not affected by this change.</P>
    <P>ICC propose to establish a subsidiary company following the passing of this Bill, which will take deposits on an unguaranteed basis from the outset. Deposits with the parent company will continue to be guaranteed within the limit of £1 billion.  In this way, ICC will distinguish clearly between deposits which are guaranteed by the State and those which are not guaranteed.  This arrangement will enable ICC to continue its normal business, but its further growth will be funded from the new unguaranteed deposits through the proposed new subsidiary.  The ICC will underpin the subsidiary with its resources.  This is clearly a substantial change compared with previous practice.  However, I am confident that ICC is now in a sufficiently strong position to adapt successfully to the new position.  An approach based on not guaranteeing the increase in borrowing was called for by some Deputies during the course of the debate on the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the definition section and is self explanatory.  Section 2 provides for a change of name of ICC to ICC Bank plc.  The use of the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo; in ICC's title serves to emphasise its commercial orientation.  It is seen as helpful from a marketing and development viewpoint.  Also, in international terms, it is desirable that the <Col N="696" /> word &ldquo;bank&rdquo; be used for ease of recognition.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the application of certain supervisory provisions contained in Central Bank legislation to the ICC at a date, or dates, to be determined by ministerial order and after consultation with the Central Bank.  The supervisory provisions will be administered by the Central Bank itself; in other respects I, as Minister for Finance, will continue to exercise my existing functions with regard to ICC.  The proposed Central Bank supervision is in line with Government policy in this area, namely, that given the small scale of resources available for financial supervision of deposit-taking institutions in Ireland and given EC requirements for the regulation of financial markets, it is appropriate that a body such as the ICC should come within the prudential supervision of the Central Bank.  This provision is similar to a provision in the ACC Bank Act, 1992. The change has already occurred in the case of the Trustee Savings Bank and building societies, and is part of the consolidation process that is required by the imminent completion of the Internal Market in financial markets with its attendant increase in competition.  ICC is fully supportive of this new relationship with the Central Bank and sees it as an essential step on the way to becoming a competitive banking institution subject to the same rules and regulations as the other credit institutions supervised by the Central Bank.  ICC has for some time now been submitting financial reports to the Central Bank on an informal basis similar to those which the bank requires of other credit institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is concerned with making explicit the powers of the corporation to engage in normal, modern banking and financial transactions and to provide associated services.  The existing principal objects of ICC date back to the 1933 Industrial Credit Act which established the corporation, as amended in the 1971 Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act. <Col N="697" /> These provisions required that the principal objects of the company should include dealings of the corporation with trade or industry in the State.  There will be no change in ICC's traditional role as a merchant bank primarily for the small and medium sized indigenous business sector except that the scope of its operations will be somewhat enlarged.  The section also provides that the exercise of the revised objects may be made subject to such conditions or limitations on amounts as may be determined by the Minister for Finance or the Central Bank, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The section is similar to section 5 of the ACC Bank Act, 1992.  Given that both State banks are expected to operate on a commerical basis, and that both will be subject to Central Bank prudential supervision, it is desirable that similar principal objects should apply to both banks.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for an increase in the borrowing powers of the ICC from £1,000 million to £1,300 million. The last increase was in 1990, and the increase now proposed should last for a number of years, given ICC's concentration on existing assets, rather than the pursuit of asset growth.</P>
    <P>Section 6 requires the ICC to amend its Memorandum and Articles of Association to bring them into line with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a technical measure which extends the scope of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, as amended, and the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, as amended, to ICC. These Acts already apply to banks and building societies, and to ACC Bank, and it is desirable that ICC should be covered similarly.  The first part of the section relates to the acceptance of bank records as evidence in the courts, and the second part to the rules relating to bills of exchange, cheques and promissory notes.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives the short title, collective citation and construction.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to signal that we will not be opposing the Bill as it is not controversial and similar Bills have gone through the House quite frequently increasing the ceilings for bodies such as the ICC.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise a number of issues with the Minister in my brief contribution. I note that the Bill provides for an increase in the borrowing limit to £1,300 million but leaves the guarantee limit unchanged at £1,000 million.  This means that the extra £300 million will no longer be guaranteed.  What is the present level of all State guarantees for the State commercial sector?  Does the policy of disengagement from guarantees apply to all semi-State organisations or do some of them still have a role in relation to guarantees?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he had an open mind in relation to the future structure of ICC, whether it will remain as a State bank, amalgamate with the ACC or be sold to a willing buyer.  He also said that no suitable purchaser of the State's shares in ICC has emerged so far.  Will the fact that such a large element of the finances of ICC will no longer be guaranteed affect the price?  Is it the intention in the consultants' recommendation to which the Minister referred, to transfer the guarantee to the private sector or was it part of the recommendation that if ICC was privatised the guarantee would not transfer and that the State would shed the underpinning of £1 billion to ICC?</P>
      <P>I am also glad that ICC &mdash; like ACC &mdash; are now being brought under the regulatory control of the Central Bank, which is consistent with a number of measures which have been brought in here over the last number of years.  It would be unusual if this had not been done.  Will the Minister comment on the arrangements made for ICC to look after the former Fóir Teoranta portfolio?  What kind of agency arrangements exist there now, will they be affected in any way by the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to comment <Col N="699" /> on a matter that is raised frequently and which I am sure is familiar to Deputies on all sides of the House.  I constantly meet business people who tell me they are unable to obtain venture capital, that the banks are operating a policy where they will only support a venture if it is backed by fixed assets, but they will not finance a business idea.  Venture capital, in the narrowly defined sense of the word, is no longer available in this country. These people have argued that the arrangements the Minister is now making for special deposit accounts to ensure that the yield from DIRT tax does not evaporate as money moves out of the country in January 1993, is putting a further strain on the provision of venture capital.  However, some banking people do not agree with this.  They claim there is money available for good commercial propositions, that there is no shortage of money but that there is just a shortage of good commercial propositions.  I would like the Minister to adjudicate on this issue as I have heard both sides of the debate and this is a matter that comes up quite frequently.  I would like to hear the advice of the Minister, his officials and the Central Bank in this regard.  If venture capital is not available, that is a serious undermining of the Government's programme and of the ambitions most politicians would have for a modern industrialised Ireland.  I have failed to understand this matter and I would like the Minister to cast some light on it.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain in further detail the necessity for the ICI to form a subsidiary company for any non-guaranteed portion of their business. Is this not maintaining an artificial distinction into the future?  Is there any necessity for such arrangement?  Surely if a bank is to be a normal commercial merchant bank under the control of the Central Bank they can be corporately unified.  The issue of State guarantees should not necessarily undermine the position of the bank in any way with <Col N="700" /> the requirement that any non-guaranteed portion of business that has been added on by way of ceiling would have to be arranged by way of a subsidiary company. What is the necessity for this?  I would like to assure the Minister we will be supporting this Bill, and I do not intend to delay him unduly tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions to put to the Minister in relation to this Bill which is being presented as a minor technical adjustment in the operations of the ICC, but really the issue is much bigger than that.  The Minister is reluctant to reveal to the House the serious range of options that must, one would hope, be before him and his officials in the Department of Finance. We are talking about preparing yet another element of the State's ownership of the financial credit institutions and bringing it into line with their sister bank, the ACC bank, so that various options which have been put to the Minister and which he recognised on 1 April 1992 when we had a debate in the House on the ACC Bill can be considered.  I am disappointed that the Minister, in his speech, has been extremely careful not to show his hand in relation to the attitude of the Department of Finance regarding the possible future of the ICC in any shape, size or form.  We must act quickly on this matter. This economy desperately needs working capital.  The small and medium sized enterprises are the bones and the engine of real sustainable job creation now, having regard to the way large companies, multinationals and Irish companies are not showing the capability to create or increase employment.  The news from Waterford is a simple manifestation of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large corporations are no longer creating real jobs and are certainly not responding to the size and scale of the employment problem.  We have a major capital provision problem.  The Government at one stage provided capital in different shapes, sizes and forms for <Col N="701" /> enterprise formation, but have retreated rather dramatically from that activity. Our banking system was traditionally the source of a good deal of capital for the type of company I am talking about, what, in the Irish context, would be a small to medium sized enterprise with between five and 15 employees and turnover of somewhere between £150,000 to £300,000.  Those companies depend on four banks and within the rules of the House, a Cheann Comhairle, I believe I am permitted to name them.  They are, Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank in that order.  Allied Irish Banks, together with the Bank of Ireland, have about 80 per cent of the domestic market.  Ulster Bank have approximately 12 per cent and a very vigorous player on the stage, National Irish Bank, are trying to bid up their own share.  We have a duopoly of banks dominating the domestic market, certainly for the type of company I am talking about.  They compete vigorously with each other.  I am not suggesting in any way that they are a cosy cartel &mdash; their dominance, geographically and culturally, dare I say it, in the Irish economy is such that they effectively, notwithstanding their mutual competition, have such a dominant share in the Irish market that their concerns determine the availability of capital for small and medium sized enterprises.  Unless the Government and the Minister for Finance can introduce some kind of third force in banking terms into the Irish economy in the foreseeable future, I do not see the type of enterprise to which we on all sides of this House are committed, having access at reasonable cost and risk to limited amounts of venture capital.  In such circumstances we are not going to get the take off in job creation to which the Government, allegedly, are committed. I purposefully use that phrase because I know the Minister is personally committed, but we have to contrast the aspirations and the words with the deeds. The deeds are represented by a debate <Col N="702" /> that took place here on 1 April last, also by a previous debate and now by a further debate this evening.  The Minister for Finance has had another opportunity to indicate to this House his view in this regard, but we have got no indication as to his attitude or that of the Department of Finance in relation to these matters.  We are not putting down these markers for the first time.  These questions have hung in the air.  The Minister, in reply to Second and subsequent stages of the debate on 1 April 1992 &mdash; column 306 of the Official Report &mdash; stated:</P>
    <P>I will consider Deputy Quinn's suggestion, but if these companies were to amalgamate on the basis of a joint venture with another State company it would lead to rationalisation.</P>
    <P>Earlier in his reply the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I find some of the alternative ways quite interesting.  However, in answer to Deputy Bradford, having been in the Department of Finance for a matter of months I am not prepared to jump in a certain direction because somebody says that is the way to jump. The future of ACC is not predetermined, as has been suggested.  My Department are aware of some of the possibilities to which Deputy Quinn in particular has referred.  I assure the Deputy that all the options are open to the State and will be examined in due course.  Some of the synergies referred to by the Deputy are quite interesting, but there is no question for a quick disposal for a quick buck.  There is logic in some of the points made by the Deputy, but whether or not agreement could be reached with ICC and Trustee Savings Bank on these issues is another matter.  I accept that these bodies are entities in their own right and that they are major employers who make relatively small profits.  Unfortunately, one of the dangers of privatisation, whether within the State or without it, is rationalisation.  The difficulty I have with privatisation &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte <Col N="703" /> will have heard me say this on many occasions, both in Opposition and otherwise &mdash; is that it inevitably leads to rationalisation.  In the case of Trustee Savings Bank, I pushed for amalgamation and signed the order two weeks ago allowing for that.  There are about 800 people employed in that instance.  In the case of ICC and ACC there are also many people involved, although these corporations may not make a great annual profit.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to make the point I quoted earlier.  The Government are not slow in relation to rationalisation of the labour force.  When Deputy Ahern became Minister for Labour in 1987 there was massive rationalisation of the public service.  There is no ideological, cultural, emotional or personal reluctance on the part of Fianna Fáil in Government, either on their own or with the Progressive Democrats, to avoid the chalice of rationalisation, even if it leads to job losses. The proposals made by the then Minister, Mr. MacSharry, in relation to the costly reduction in the public service labour force had the support of the Cabinet, of which Deputy Ahern was a member.  To respond to the idea of a third banking force by saying, as the Minister did on 1 April, that he did like the idea of job losses was a reasonable holding position, but three months later it will not stand. It is still a holding position.  I am amazed that the Minister has not given the House the benefit of his thinking on this matter.</P>
    <P>The dominance of AIB and the Bank of Ireland in the domestic market is causing hardship in the real world.  Small companies have been unilaterally told by bank managers, who have apologised in advance, that their working overdraft provision of between £10,000 and £20,000 is being reduced on orders from head office.  Bank managers are virtually admitting in some cases that they are in the hands of credit controllers, who are running the banks instead of marketeers or financiers.  That is particularly true, <Col N="704" /> it is claimed, of the Bank of Ireland. Directors of small companies are being told when they have productive ideas that in order to get the necessary capital they will have to pledge their personal belongings, including the family home.  There is a demand from the banks for collateral of at least 100 per cent, and in some cases 150 per cent, to cover relatively small amounts of money.  One of the reasons is that in those two banks in particular the centralisation of decision-making has removed the local judgment of the bank manager who has a working knowledge of the small company and the capabilities and commitments of the directors who make that company function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to the future of ICC.  Its role will be to fill the gap being created by the activities of the two major banks to which I have been referring.  They are being left alone in a duopoly which allows them to hold 80 per cent of the market.  The State has the capability to cater for 20 per cent or 25 per cent of the total retail banking sector through four components, the ACC, the ICC, the enormous network of post offices and the Trustee Savings Bank, which is effectively State controlled, although nobody likes to admit it.  Nobody is in any doubt as to who really calls the shots in relation to the control of the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are giving the Minister further powers to polish and prepare for the disposal of ICC, but no coherent strategy is being put forward by the Department of Finance.  The absence of that strategy for the disposal of ICC must be considered in the light of the hardship being experienced in the financial markets.  The secondary banks are dealing with financial refugees who have been driven into their <Col N="705" /> arms either by the Bank of Ireland or by AIB.  The leasing companies and the secondary banks are being asked to provide traditional banking credit facilities which would in the past have been offered by their friendly bank manager. The banking fraternity were recently regaled by an article about the absence of the friendly bank manager.  He has been replaced by a computer without personal knowledge of the individual companies. The traditional bank manager had some knowledge of business and was able to act as a quasi legal and marketing consultant.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to change the Industrial Credit Corporation into the ICC Bank.  The ICC was set up at a time when venture capital was not available. It is moving away from that traditional position into mainstream banking.  There is no indication in the Minister's speech as to what alternative mechanisms will be put in place to fill the role which ICC was originally established to play.  He must be getting reports from the marketplace on the perception of small and medium businesses of their relationships with the two main banks.  The other two banks are active in the market but their shares at 8 per cent and 12 per cent are not as representative, given their geographical spread, as those of the two major banks who have 80 per cent of the market.</P>
    <P>The future role by ICC must be considered against a deteriorating background. Since I spoke here on 1 April I have been told by various financial experts that my proposals have some merit and they hoped there would be a response from the Government because of the deteriorating position.  The absence of a serious third banking force in the economy is a major impediment to economic growth and to job creation. The reluctance of the Minister for Finance to respond to two public invitations from me in this House to indicate his thinking on these matters is inexplicable. I invite him when replying to this debate <Col N="706" /> to give such an indication.  Many people are anxious to know, including more than 800 staff in ICC who want to know what their future is.</P>
    <P>When ICC was first offered for sale, 50 prospectuses were circulated by Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance who had the contract to dispose of the company.  That first offer found no takers.  The view expressed informally was that ICC was over staffed and was not saleable.  I know that ICC are committed to this Bill and welcome its provisions. They have improved their productivity and efficiency in recent times.  One of the business newspapers recently carried an interview with my namesake who is the chief executive of the company.  He is not related to me. That individual in question, the company and the management have certainly improved the performance of ICC but the question mark as to its future still hangs over those people for whom the Minister expressed some concern here on 1 April when he talked about the rationalisation process.  I am not clear as to the thinking of the Department of Finance on how they will move with ICC. The Minister clearly indicated previously that ICC was on the market for sale. He stated on 1 April that he was not interested in the fast buck.  The value being put on ICC ranges from £20 million to £30 million.</P>
    <P>In terms of the credit control mentality within the Department of Finance, that kind of capital receipt which was one of the options that Deputy Noonan on occasion has recommended for dealing with the national debt, will not do much for it.  I suspect a better way of dealing with the ratio of GNP to national debt is for the economy to grow faster and to reduce our high level of unemployment. ICC could be disposed of mindlessly into the market place to whoever could reach the reserve which somebody in the Department of Finance would put on it, but as I suggested on 1 April, going into the market with a bride &mdash; rather than some-one <Col N="707" /> you wanted to dispose of &mdash; and seeking a constructive and productive marriage that would address the very real problem of venture capital &mdash; among other things that have already been identified &mdash; would be a much better way of achieving an objective which I suspect all of us in this House share, that of bringing this economy into the correct position to meet the five criteria of European Monetary Union by 1997 at the latest.</P>
    <P>The mentality of selling off assets still seems to prevail but the distastefulness of that within some elements of the Fianna Fáil Party seems to have created a sense of coyness in the Minister for Finance, unlike the robust disposal attitude displayed by a former Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry, when he was in that position.  That coyness is caught between a recognition of the necessity to raise the extra few bucks and a reluctance to state it publicly in a manner that might attract some negative comment.</P>
    <P>ICC will be a better financial institution and will be as formalised as a bank.  Effectively it is a merchant bank &mdash; it always was &mdash; but it will now become a bank in the legal sense following the passage of this Bill, which we will not oppose.  They will be legally required to do what they have been doing for some time, to submit regular reports to the Central Bank.  I share Deputy Noonan's concerns in relation to its weird construction.  It will be a two tiered company where £1,000 million will be State guaranteed and £300 million will be open and non-guaranteed. From a marketing point of view I am intrigued to know how it will be sold in the market place and how they will differentiate between one financial product that has a State guarantee underwriting it and other products which have not.  It seems to be an Upper Merrion Street compromise where the necessity to allow the company to grow has been recognised and the necessity to maintain or curtail State guarantees has also prevailed. I am not sure whether at a time <Col N="708" /> of uncertainty in the financial world that kind of compromise is the best way to move forward.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to an issue I raised on 1 April and to which we got no response, that was the linkages that the Irish financial institutions must begin to create in a European Monetary Union that will stretch all the way from here to Helsinki on the northern side of Europe, and as far south as Athens and Seville on the western side.  Where is the strategic thinking in relation to a financial regime that will prevail in eight years from now whereby there will be a single central financial bank or monetary institution based either in Bonn or London &mdash; preferably for all of us in this part of the world it will be in London &mdash; and, in addition, a single currency that will remove much of the soft profit that the two resident dominant banks make at present from currency transactions.</P>
    <P>All tourists have to change money when they come here &mdash; I do not know what the tourist expenditure is but between now and the response I hope the Minister will be able to get the figure. There is one and a half per cent commission on changing pesetas into Irish pounds for every Spanish student who comes into Ireland.  That is one way in which profit is made effortlessly but that will disappear within two to four years if not sooner.  It is now that a modern Irish financial institution, post-EMU, should be in the process of being established by the Department of Finance and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke recently in glowing terms at the celebratory function for Woodchester Credit Lyonnais Bank and talked about the merits of competition and the welcome that has been extended by many people in the Irish economy to the growth of that company with a degree of efficiency and market acumen that we all admire.  There is no correlation between the news expressed by the Minister on that particular evening in the company of so many people from the Irish <Col N="709" /> financial community, and the lacklustre, coy presentation to this House tonight.  I have no suspicion that the Minister has a secret or hidden agenda &mdash; I know the man too well for that &mdash; but what I do suspect is that there is indecision in the Department of Finance and that a treasury mentality is being attached to State assets instead of an economic development attitude to the utilisation of State assets.</P>
    <P>I repeat that what is needed is a Green or a White Paper, a discussion document &mdash; and I invite the Minister to respond &mdash; that can be circulated to the relatively small financial and business community asking all of us what kind of banking structure we want to be in place by the year 2000, now only eight years away, what form and shape it should take, and what opportunities such a banking structure will present after the creation of a Single European currency in a market which on the first day of eligibility will have at least 250 million people.  Certainly, all the member states will not be eligible on day one but the market will be of the order of 250 million people. What kind of banking system do we want to cater for a market of that scale spread over at least seven or eight countries with a European Central Bank located either in London or Bonn?  What should any Irish Minister for Finance be doing now to ensure that the domestic banking system will survive as an autonomous Irish entity with loyalties to this place.</P>
    <P>Let me give you an indication of the scale of the competition we are likely to face.  Abbey National Building Society &mdash; a name with which you will be familiar from advertising &mdash; lends more by way of mortgage finance in a single month in Britain than the combined Irish mortgage industry lends in an entire year, that is coming from one country which has a similar product to ours in relation to mortgage finance.  The Italian, Spanish and German financial institutions are into a scale of operation that is enormous by our standards.  If we do not have some <Col N="710" /> unique strategy that will enable us to harness the benefits of that scale of market and at the same time minimise the threats to domestic operation, we will lose much of what we currently have and not replace it.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow a debate in the House on the disposal of something as essential as ICC, who have a borrowing capacity of up to £1.3 billion and a substantial deposit base, without demanding a much clearer presentation of the range of options from the Minister for Finance. I am not asking him to say what is the preferred option or what he intends to do.  A serious debate on the future of Irish banking post-EMU, or within European Monetary Union, must take place.  We are getting no indication whatever that there is a recognition that dangers, possibilities and threats exist or that anybody in the Department of Finance is thinking about possible alliances and allegiances after 1997.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, is able to attend this debate because the position in Waterford Crystal is alarming and we should all be extremely concerned at the trend of recent events.  I have been forecasting difficulties for that company in this House for the past three or four months and the time has arrived for the Government to take an initiative in this regard.  When I say &ldquo;the Government&rdquo; I mean the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other relevant Ministers, <Col N="711" /> such as the Ministers for Finance and Labour.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough to say that the company and the unions should work out their own destiny, the matter is far too serious for that at this stage.  Mistakes have been made on all sides and the recent announcement that 525 jobs are to be lost is very serious.  The indications that the whole operation may move out of Ireland is very frightening.  We do not want to see that happening as it would mean the loss of more than 2,000 jobs and, obviously, a multiple of that number would be affected by a complete closure.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be an alarmist; I want to be realistic.  However, I do not want to have to come in here shouting about this matter in a few months' time when this assembly resumes.  I wish to make it clear that I believe the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should meet the board of Waterford Crystal.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister met management today, but I regard the management &mdash; with no disrespect to them because they are quite an able team &mdash; as intermediaries in this matter.  The people who count in this affair are the members of the board, particularly Dr. Tony O'Reilly, and the chairman, Mr. Brennan.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, and the Taoiseach should sit down with those people and hammer out a solution to save these jobs.  I hold no brief whatever for people who advocate that the industry should be nationalised, I do not regard that as an option.  People should be willing to give and take and if the company need financial aid from the Government through the aegis of the IDA, they should get it.  I appeal to the Minister to talk to the people who will be making the decisions in the boardroom.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for sharing his time with me on this critical issue for the constituency we both represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future of Waterford Crystal is no longer just a Waterford and Dungarvan <Col N="712" /> issue, it is a national one.  Waterford Crystal is a flagship industry and the industrial success story of the Irish State. Are the Government prepared to accept an international brand name, which was built up by workers in Waterford and Dungarvan based on a tradition going back over 200 years, being used on inferior foreign products in an attempt to maximise profits for an American controlling interest?  This is being done at the expense of Irish jobs and the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Are the Government prepared to let Mr. Brennan know, in no uncertain terms, that this is contrary to Irish interests and that the Government are, therefore, totally opposed to it?  The bottom line is the protection of jobs and earnings in Ireland.  Will the Government provide the necessary resources to achieve this fundamental objective in a company that will become profitable over a reasonable timescale if the right tactics are put in place by the Government?</P>
    <P>A controlling Irish interest &mdash; either a single interest or a consortium of interests &mdash; is the best way to achieve this objective. Such a strategy should be explored urgently by the Government and the IDA in the context of the management entering into meaningful negotiations with the unions with all production options in Ireland included and a plan agreed.  The jobs in Waterford and Dungarvan must be retained.  That is the Government's responsibility.  Like Deputy Deasy, I am not putting forward a case for nationalisation, but we must be flexible because this is a crucial industry in our economy. It is an international brand name and time is running out.  The Government have to get things moving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern about the current problems facing this company.  I have been keeping in touch with developments in the company over recent months.  I have had meetings with both the management and the workers' representatives.  Indeed, I <Col N="713" /> met the chairman and the chief executive of Waterford Crystal &mdash; both of whom are also members of the Waterford Wedge-wood plc board &mdash; as recently as a few hours ago.</P>
      <P>What they had to say to me was no surprise to anyone who has been following the problems in Waterford Crystal over recent years.  Essentially they told me that the company are facing very serious problems of competitiveness which must be addressed.  Costs, they said, are too high for the level of sales being achieved.  They see it as inevitable that jobs will have to be shed, as the chief executive already indicated to the staff last week.  They see themselves as very much constrained in what they can do because of the limited funds available from their banks and investors, but if they do not do what is necessary, the future of the Waterford plant must be in some doubt in the medium term.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the company, and at an earlier stage to the workers' representatives, I am struck by how difficult the circumstances are for the company and for the staff whose jobs are at real risk.  But, however difficult things are now, it is certain that they will be worse for everyone involved if the company do not get things right in terms of the market and especially of their production costs in Waterford.</P>
      <P>Those costs have already caused some products to be sourced elsewhere.  That has been a very great disappointment to many.  I wish it were not so.  But we cannot force consumers overseas &mdash; especially in a recession such as that of recent years &mdash; to buy products which are too dear because production costs are out of kilter.  The best way &mdash; and the only sustainable way &mdash; to ensure that the maximum possible amount of production continues in Waterford is to get costs there down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely recognised that the company face serious problems.  Their main markets in the UK and the US have been hit by recession.  It is good to see from <Col N="714" /> their annual report for 1991 that the latter half of that year saw some relative improvement in sales.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the company that they are doing everything possible to try to improve their competitive position. The company's decision to source some products outside this country has already caused concern.  The company see this, however, as increasing market share in a declining market and generating urgently needed, business to help the company back to profitability.</P>
    <P>My concern and that of the Government is that the management and staff of the company should work together to assure their future.  Waterford Crystal are not only of local but of national importance. The unique status of the company has to be protected through continuing the traditional high standards of craftsmanship in Waterford on an efficient and profitable basis.</P>
    <P>The company tell me that they are continuing to work on their development plans for the future.  They will be in dialogue with staff representatives about what steps will have to be taken.  In the meantime, speculation about their plans would not be helpful.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that I have been, and am, available to discuss matters with the company and that I will continue to respond positively to any future requests from the company for further discussions about their plans.  I fully agree with Deputies that it would be a major tragedy not just for the company but for the region and country as a whole, if production were to cease.  However, I am hopeful that, with the constructive cooperation of all concerned, that will not happen.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter has given me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the circumstances resulting in two persons being held in a cell in Castlebar Garda station which contained firearms and ammunition; whether an inquiry is being conducted into this incident and if he would outline the steps, if any, being taken to ensure that such weapons and ammunition are not similarly stored in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving me to the opportunity to raise what appears on the face of it be a bizarre and extraordinary event.  As is already widely known, the present Minister for Justice has been somewhat unfortunate in that apparently he was the victim of a burglary in his private residence prior to Christmas, which we were all sorry to hear.  Indeed, one would have expected that the security on his home in Dublin would have prevented that happening. That was an unfortunate event but that misfortune apparently has been compounded by a degree of carelessness which is difficult to fathom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were widespread reports last week that two persons, allegedly arrested for being drunk and disorderly, were placed in the cells of the Garda station in Castlebar.  Incredibly, the reports stated, it was subsequently discovered that within the cell in which the two people were placed were 20,000 rounds of ammunition, an Uzi submachine gun and five hand guns.  Reportedly there was some commotion in the cell some time after the two allegedly inebriated gentlemen were placed in it which resulted in a garda in the station returning to the cell to find the two gentlemen somewhat the worse for wear and reportedly each waving a hand gun in the air.  I am assuming that the hand guns had no ammunition in them.  I am also assuming that the gentlemen concerned were so <Col N="716" /> badly inebriated they did not know the nature of what they were doing, were not quite sure whether they were in a cell or playing a game of cowboys and indians down in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>Events such as this occurring in the Minister's home town are a matter of some considerable embarrassment.  But it is a matter of great concern &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;concern&rdquo;&mdash; that ammunition and guns could be stored in such a careless way that events could evolve which resulted in two persons being incarcerated in a cell in which it is alleged, guns and ammunition were stored.  If the reports are true it is fortunate that the two people placed in the cell were not from a subversive organisation. We can thank God that was not the case.  Had they been from a subversive organisation God only knows what could have been the consequences of the events which took place in Castlebar on that reported occasion.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the Minister will tell me this is all fiction invented by the news media and/or a grossly exaggerated event.  It would be of some relief to learn that was the case.  If that was the case, the silence of the Department of Justice last week, when these reports became public, is quite peculiar.  It would seem to me that rather than this issue having to be raised in this House a statement should have been issued from the Minister's office last week detailing the exact nature of the events that occurred and giving assurances that necessary precautions would be put in place to ensure there is no repetition.</P>
    <P>I am asking for those assurances.  I am asking the Minister to detail to the House the exact events that occurred and what inquiry, if any, is being conducted into them.  Perhaps the Minister will be in a position to indicate what has befallen the two inebriated gentlemen who, I understand from press reports, were eventually released and against whom no charges were brought.  I am not suggesting that charges should be brought against them. <Col N="717" /> I am merely saying that we were extraordinarily lucky that, in these series of events &mdash; which could have been well written in a Tom Sharpe novel &mdash; no serious injuries were sustained and no life lost.  Indeed, we are lucky that the gardaí were not injured.  We are equally lucky that the two gentlemen who found themselves locked up with so much ammunition did not injure themselves or each other, considering their alleged condition.</P>

      <P>The matter raised in the House tonight by Deputy Shatter has been the subject of very serious allegations reported in the media.  The nature of these allegations is that persons arrested on the morning of 28 May, 1992, were placed and held in a cell in Castlebar Garda station which contained firearms and ammunition. These allegations are of a very serious nature.  I have no wish to downplay that in any way.  At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that we are speaking of allegations, no more than that at this point.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have ordered a full investigation into what happened in Castlebar station on the morning of 28 May.  I can assure the House that the investigation, which is being conducted by a senior officer from outside the Mayo Garda Division, is already well under way and will be completed with all possible speed.  This officer will inquire into the circumstances of all detentions at Castlebar Garda station on the night in question and endeavour to establish whether there is substance to the allegations reported in the media.  He will review the procedures relating to the storage of firearms and consider whether these procedures were implemented on the morning in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> Pending completion of this officer's investigation it would not be appropriate to comment further on this matter other than to inform the House that, should recommendations for safer storage of firearms emerge from the review &mdash; and in saying that I am not to be taken as in any way prejudging anything or implying an absence of safety on the morning in question &mdash; these recommendations will be given effect by the Garda authorities.  I repeat that the investigation is at present under way.  It is hoped that it will be completed with all possible speed when we will be in a position to report further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity of raising this issue in the House this evening.  The future of school transport is a matter of grave concern not only to hundreds of thousands of parents nationwide but also to nearly 1,000 employees of Bus Éireann and to 1,600 private contractors directly involved in the operations and administration of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is timely that I raise this matter given the controversy that has arisen as a direct consequence of the Minister's desire to privatise the service.  His proposals for the devolution of management and administration of the service to private contractors, local authorities or schools, boards of management is a recipe for disaster, would ultimately incur more costs for the State and would be less effective overall.  It would also lead to a duplication of service and lack of standards. <Col N="719" /> Many small, rural areas will be affected and many jobs put at risk.</P>
    <P>Over the years various Governments have commissioned reports on the operation of the school bus service.  In 1970 we had the Hyland report.  In 1980 there were various interdepartmental reports. In the late eighties we had a pilot scheme. In August of that same year Bus Éireann were requested to pick up the tab to bring the service back under its wing.  In 1990 the Departments of Education and Tourism, Transport and Communications commissioned Deloitte and Touche to produce a report.  Let me briefly quote a number of the recommendations.  One states that the provision of the school bus service by Bus Éireann is, in their opinion, at or near the minimum cost for the level of service provided under the present rules of the scheme.  Another stated that the supervision and management of the school bus transport network is a complex but stable task and that in their opinion it is well carried out by Bus Éireann.  The report also stated that Bus Eireann deliver the yellow bus element of the scheme at direct costs which are competitive with those operating in the private sector of public transport.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister disregard the main recommendations of this report?  It seems, given his decision to seek a further report, that it is his intention to continue to commission costly reports until such time as one comes up with the conditions and the recommendations that he is looking for.  In view of this, is it any wonder that the trade unions representing the staff, particularly SIPTU and the TSSA, are taking a very strong line on this matter.  It should be of deep concern to the Minister that the board of CIE are threatening to put the workforce directly involved on protective notice if the problems are not resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The annual piecemeal approach to the school bus service is most frustrating to the staff and is not conducive to a continuity <Col N="720" /> of service.  I recommend that the Minister accept the Deloitte and Touche recommendations and meet with management and unions with a view to putting the school bus service in this country on a sound footing once and for all.  There is a deep resentment in the company at the directive that Bus Eireann should not enter into commitments regarding school transport beyond the end of this year. This is totally unworkable.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw it.</P>
    <P>The State owes nearly £4.6 million to Bus Éireann for the operation of the school transport service and this is putting a grave strain on their resources. Hopefully the Minister will be able to give a commitment to have this matter resolved.</P>
    <P>It is reported in the media that substantial increases in charges for school transport have been recommended by the Department of Education from January next.  An increase of the order of £19 per pupil per term which would bring it from £21 to £40 for junior cycle pupils and from £35 to £55 for senior cycle pupils are the figures quoted.  Increases of this magnitude will have a devastating effect on the families of some 164,000 school-going children who use the transport service. This is totally unacceptable and the Labour Party will be totally opposed to it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bring to the attention of the Minister for Education my concern that a proper service should be introduced.  All the resources of the people in the Department should be called on to ensure that the best service is provided.  I believe the Minister has taken the option he himself wishes, the option of privatisation.  This is not the solution to this problem and I hope the Minister will take on board the views expressed here tonight and hopefully will give some good news when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Department of Education are concerned, they expect the school transport scheme to <Col N="721" /> operate normally in accordance with current procedures as from September next. These procedures are based on an agreement between the Department and Bus Éireann under which Bus Eireann act as agent for the Department in the operation of the school transport scheme. The Department establish the policies related to the scheme and it is a matter for Bus Éireann to operate the scheme within those policies.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been operating now for 24 years.  In view of the costs involved and the complexities of the arrangements necessary to cater for a wide diversity of requirements, the operation of the scheme is kept under continual review. A recent consultancy study found that on the basis of current arrangements the scheme was operated cost-efficiently by Bus Éireann.  The review is continuing to determine whether any alternative arrangements could provide greater efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Let me stress that what is in question is a continuing review, again with the assistance of consultants.  The next phase of the review is not yet started and will include consultation with concerned interests.  There is no question of any decisions having been taken.  Such decisions would be a matter solely for Government, following completion of the review.  Such decisions, if any, will be for the future.  In so far as the coming school year is concerned, I expect, as I have stated, the school transport scheme to proceed under the normal procedures and arrangements as agreed between the Department of Education and Bus Éireann.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Justice. I propose to call the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Nealon, Deputy Bell and Deputy Deasy in respect of matters to the Minister for <Col N="722" /> Social Welfare and, again, Deputy Deasy in respect of matters to the Minister for Justice.  The House will now hear a two minute statement from Deputy Nealon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of this opportunity of bringing to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare what I regard as a monstrous anomaly in the social welfare code.  The reason I am raising it in the House at this time is in direct response to a call for some sort of action by a constituent of mine who is a victim of this regulation.  This is as much about principle as it is about money.</P>
      <P>My constituent is now on maternity benefit, as she was almost two years or so ago.  Now she finds she is getting less money than she did the last time even though she is on a higher salary.  The reason is that she worked for only 38 weeks in the present reckonable tax year which happened to be the year of her previous maternity leave.  If she had had her maternity leave a little earlier or a little later she would be getting 70 per cent of a full year's salary and not, as now, 70 per cent of 38 weeks' salary.</P>
      <P>Surely there is something wrong with that kind of thinking, that a previous maternity leave should be a factor in the calculation of the benefit in a subsequent maternity leave just because of a confluence of timings.  I understand that this kind of anomaly may be dealt with in a new EC Directive, but the Minister should not wait for Europe to tell us what to do in a matter such as this.</P>
      <P>We all, I suppose, are familiar with the considerations and difficulties involved in family planning.  Surely we should not be adding the reckonable tax year as a further calendar calculation that has to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Maternity benefit is payable to women in employment, including women in employment under a contract for a fixed term and to women in part-time employment earning £25 or more per week, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions. <Col N="723" /> The weekly rate of social insurance maternity allowance payment is 70 per cent of the claimant's average reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant tax year, subject to a minimum payment of £60 per week and a maximum payment of £154 per week.  The relevant tax year, for the purposes of calculating average reckonable weekly earnings, is the last complete income tax year before the beginning of the benefit, that is, the calendar year in which the first day of maternity leave occurs.  Therefore, for a maternity benefit claim commencing during the benefit year January-December 1992, the relevant income tax year is 1990-91.</P>
      <P>Maternity benefit is not treated as income for the purpose of determining avarage reckonable earnings.  However, the minimum payment of £60 under the scheme ensures that recipients whose earnings in the relevant tax year are low do not have their entitlements reduced below the level of other analogous social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The scheme, therefore, guarantees a minimum payment for low income earners who would otherwise have received a significantly lower payment as a result of having been in receipt of maternity benefit in the reckonable tax year.</P>
      <P>An EC Directive concerning the protection of pregnant workers is currently under consideration.  It is expected that this Directive will be adopted before the end of 1992.  The draft Directive lays down certain minima in terms of social security protection for pregnant workers, which are already exceeded by the entitlements applying to Irish workers. The maternity benefit scheme will be reviewed in the light of the Directive once it is adopted and the issue raised here will be considered in that context.  However, any changes in the maternity benefit scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>It was expected that we should now have a two-minute <Col N="724" /> statement from Deputy Michael Bell.  I do not observe the Deputy.  I am proceeding, therefore, to call Deputy Austin Deasy to make his two-minute statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue because it defies explanation.  It arises as a result of the Social Welfare Act recently passed by this House.  I regret that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, is not in the House to hear the case I wish to make.  I do not want him to answer the case as such but I want to request him to repeal the legislation.</P>
      <P>This issue concerns a single man in my constituency of Waterford who has been working and stamping a card for the past 27 years.  Since he became sick ten years ago he has been receiving a disability benefit of £50 per week.  He told me that he thought he should be getting much more assistance.  When I made inquiries at the local social welfare office I was informed that, as a result of the Social Welfare Act recently passed by this House, that was his maximum entitlement. I then contacted the TDs' complaints section in the Department of Social Welfare who merely confirmed what the local office had told me, that the maximum payment for a single man on disability benefit is £50.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the anomaly in this case.  If this man was unemployed and had never worked he would be entitled to receive £55 per week.  However, having paid 27 years' stamps and worked hard all his life he is now being penalised to the extent of £5 per week; he is receiving less for having worked and stamped a card than if he had never worked at all. I cannot see the justice in that.  I request the Minister to change the legislation so that this wrong can be corrected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare would have liked to be present in the House but he is detained elsewhere on Government business.  He has asked me to deputise for him. <Col N="725" /> The Social Welfare improvements announced in the 1991 budget provided for a general 4 per cent increase in all weekly payments with effect from the end of July 1991.  However, special increases of 11 per cent were given to those in receipt of short term unemployment assistance and 6 per cent to those getting the long term rate of unemployment assistance.  The effect of those increases was to ensure a minimum personal rate of £50 for all short term payments and £55 for all long term payments.</P>
      <P>As a result, since July 1991 the personal rates of all long term payments have reached or exceeded the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contains a specific commitment to move by 1993 to the priority level of rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>A PRSI contributor who falls sick and claims disability benefit would, subject to satisfying the relevant conditions, receive a personal rate of £50 per week.  The same person who loses his or her job and claims unemployment benefit would receive the same weekly rate of payment, subject to satisfying the relevant conditions. Where the person continues to be unemployed for more than 15 months, unemployment assistance at the long term rate of £55 per week becomes payable subject to satisfying a means test.</P>
      <P>I accept the point made by the Deputy that an unemployed person with no means, who has never paid PRSI contributions and who is in receipt of the maximum rate of long term unemployment assistance is better off by £5 per week than the PRSI contributor who becomes sick and claims disability benefit.  This differential of £5 per week is designed to recognise the special needs of the long term unemployed and is in line with the policy of providing higher payments to long term recipients in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to take issue with the point made by Deputy Deasy that no recognition has <Col N="726" /> been given to the contributions made by the applicant.  On reaching a certain age or becoming sick a person can draw either disability benefit, invalidity pension or contributory or retirement pension based on their contribution.  Obviously, they are in a much better position at certain times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With a huge young population, many of whom are unemployed, there is a growing crime problem in this country.  It has been obvious for some time that conventional policing is not sufficient to deal with growing vandalism, drug abuse and violent behaviour, particularly in urban areas.  I suggest that the Garda Síochána be assisted in their duties by a reserve force, equal in number to the strength of the present force which is approximately 10,000.  Special attention should be paid to obvious flashpoints such as pub closing times, social and sporting events and assisting in community work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present many crimes go unreported because the public believe the Garda will never have time to solve their problem or even investigate it.  This complaint is continually made to me.  I regard the alternative to my proposal as unacceptable. If present policing practices and presence are not improved vigilante groups will take the law into their own hands, thereby creating more problems than will be solved.  I firmly believe there <Col N="727" /> are enough civic-minded people available to constitute such a force.  This force would not patrol or act at any time without being supervised by a regular member of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The time has come to recognise that the present system is not adequate to deal with a worsening problem.  We should face up to the fact that law and order has broken down and tackle the problem realistically.  In other words, I am asking that a part-time civilian force be set up, as is the case in many other countries, to augment and assist the Garda in the performance of their duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the policy of successive Governments and the Garda authorities to encourage all law-abiding and responsible citizens to assist <Col N="728" /> the Garda in law enforcement.  The question of the establishment of a reserve police force has been examined from time to time.  However, it is not clear that any possible advantage arising from the establishment of such a force would outweigh potential difficulties which could arise from it.  For example, one would have to be concerned with the rights of individuals faced with a new law enforcement group who would initially lack the expertise and training of full-time police. With regard to the need for additional gardaí, recruitment of 1,000 gardaí over the next few years is already under way. In addition, 585 civilian clerical staff are employed in the Garda Síochána.  This is a matter which the Minister is pursuing in consultation with the Garda authorities.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> The Government warmly welcomed the proposal by Sir Patrick Mayhew on 1 July that Strands Two and Three should now be launched and the acceptance of this proposal by the four political parties participating in the Talks process.</P>
    <P>Strand Two is a very important and integral part of the process which was agreed on 26 March 1991.  We are pleased that this critical phase of the talks has now been reached.  The Government look forward to working actively and constructively in Strand Two, the opening session of which is underway at present under the independent Chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen.</P>
    <P>The meeting to discuss a possible agenda for Strand Two was held in London on 19 June under the Chairmanship of Sir Ninian.  Both Governments were represented at official level and with the four political parties also participating.  Agreement was reached on a draft Agenda for Strand Two.</P>
    <P>At the meeting in Strand Three formation which took place in London on 30 June under the joint chairmanship of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, agreement was reached between the two Governments on a possible agenda for Strand Three.</P>

      <Quest>whether Ireland has made any proposals on the non-proliferation and reduction of nuclear weapons now that thousands of such weapons are stored in the different republics of the former Soviet Union and that highly skilled redundant nuclear scientists are available to pariah nations to assist them in putting together nuclear weapons capacity.</Quest>

      <P>The Government's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and to the reduction and ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons is well known.</P>
      <P>The Government have been concerned that the transformation of the former Soviet Union into the Commonwealth of Independent States should not lead to any increase in the number of nuclear weapon States or contribute in any way to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Bilaterally and together with our partners in the European Community, Ireland has made this concern clear to the CIS Republics.</P>
      <P>In their Declaration of 16 December 1991 on the &ldquo;Guidelines on the recognition of new States in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union&rdquo;, the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve listed as a precondition for recognition of a new State &ldquo;acceptance of all relevant commitments with regard to disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation as well as to security and regional stability&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their statement on the &ldquo;Future Status of Russia and other former Soviet Republics&rdquo; dated 23 December 1991, the Community and its member states again clearly stated their expectation of assurances from the CIS republics to &ldquo;ensure single control over nuclear weapons and their non-proliferation&rdquo;.  Finally, in the statement on the &ldquo;Recognition of former Soviet Republics&rdquo; of 31 December 1991, the Community and its member states expressed their readiness to proceed with recognition on the basis of the assurances received and on the understanding that all republics &ldquo;on whose territory nuclear weapons are stationed, will adhere to the <Col N="382" /> Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear States&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, nuclear weapons are stationed on the territory of four of the CIS republics: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. These four republics have agreed that there should be a single command over all their nuclear forces.  The Government welcome the announcements by Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan and that they will accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear States and that all of the nuclear weapons on their territories will be eliminated.  The Government also welcome the agreement signed in Washington recently by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin which provides for substantial further reductions in nuclear weapons by the year 2003.</P>
    <P>The Government have also been concerned that States which are known to be developing their own nuclear weapons might seek to acquire nuclear materials, equipment or expertise from the CIS States.  The Government have encouraged the CIS republics to introduce effective export controls to ensure that nuclear materials and equipment are not acquired for military purposes.</P>
    <P>Together with our European partners, Ireland has also contributed to the establishment of the International Science and Technology Centre in Russia which is intended to provide opportunities for Soviet nuclear scientists and engineers to redirect their talents to peaceful nuclear activities so as to ensure that they will not be recruited by other countries seeking to develop their own nuclear weapons.  The European Community will contribute 20 million ECUs towards the cost of setting up this Centre which will make a significant contribution to nuclear non-proliferation objectives.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has conveyed to the Foreign Minister of Algeria the sincerest sympathy of the Irish Government and his shock at the assassination on 29 June of Mr. Mohammed Boudiaf, President of the High State Committee of Algeria.</P>
      <P>The Government, together with their partners in the European Community, has been greatly concerned at developments in Algeria since the beginning of 1992, when the second round of the parliamentary elections scheduled for 16 January were cancelled.  That decision was followed by the declaration of a State of Emergency, large scale arrests and now the assassination of Mr. Boudiaf.</P>
      <P>European Community Foreign Ministers issued a Declaration on 17 February underlining the need for steps to be taken by the Algerian authorities to restore the democratic process.  The Foreign Ministers also made clear the importance they attached to ensuring respect for human rights, tolerance and political pluralism. The European Council, at their meeting in Lisbon on 26-27 June, made a major Declaration on relations between Europe and the countries of the Maghreb region, including Algeria.  That Declaration sets out the principles on which those relations are to be based, and demonstrates clearly that progress must be made towards free elections and that whoever is the victor in those elections must govern on the basis of respect for human rights and the rights of minorities and must be committed to the holding of regular elections.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's strong hope that the Algerian authorities will undertake every possible effort for a return to normal institutional life so that peaceful political dialogue among all parties concerned will take place and democracy be restored there.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their Declaration made at Maastricht on 10 December of last year, the member states of the Western European Union proposed that States which are members of the European Union be invited to accede to the Western European Union or become observers.  At their most recent meeting in Bonn on 19 June, Western European Union Ministers agreed to extend invitations to prospective members, observers and associates.  This invitation was communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by the German Foreign Minister, as President of the Western European Union, on 30 June.  As both the Taoiseach and I have stated on a number of occasions, the Government do not propose that Ireland should become a member of the Western European Union.  However, we do see advantages in taking up observer status.  As an observer, we would be able to ensure that Ireland was fully informed of developments in the Western European Union that might have bearing on discussions in European Union.  This would place the Government in a better position to formulate appropriate responses on such issues within the European Union.  It would also help the Government to <Col N="385" /> decide on the reference of issues with defence implications to the Western European Union and enable Ireland to follow the subsequent discussions within the Western European Union on such issues.</P>
    <P>I would again underline that, as an observer in the Western European Union, we would not have to take up any commitments under the Western European Union Treaty or subscribe to any policy positions or platforms adopted by the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The Government will be pursuing the invitation with the incoming Italian Presidency of the Western European Union and I will keep the House informed of developments.</P>

      <P>Article N (2) of the Treaty on European Union provides for the convening of a conference of representatives of the Governments of the member states in 1996 to examine the provisions of the Treaty for which revision is provided, in accordance with the objectives set out in Articles A and B of the Treaty.  As well as this, under Article N (1) it is open to the Government of any member state or to the Commission to submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conferences which negotiated the Treaty on European Union agreed that the following areas will be included in the 1996 review:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the scope of the co-decision procedure;</P>
      <P>&mdash;competence in the areas of energy, civil protection and tourism;</P>
      <P>&mdash;common foreign and security policy; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;measures to enhance the democratic process in the operation of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> Preparations for the conference provided for in Article N will not begin until the Treaty on European Union is fully operative.</P>
    <P>When preparations begin, consideration will be given to whether any proposals for amendment or review should be proposed by Ireland.  The circumstances of the Community are likely to be different in 1996 from what they are today.</P>
    <P>Firstly, amendment or review of the provisions of the Treaty will have to be considered in the light of the operation experience of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the proposed enlargement of the Community to include Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland, for instance, will affect the character and concerns of the Union.  Both these considerations require that the specific items for negotiation in the 1996 conference be decided upon closer to that date.</P>
    <P>Ireland will play its part in shaping the agenda for the 1996 negotiations, in consultation with our Community partners.</P>
    <P>As regards the development of a federal Europe, Ireland had no objection to the proposal during the negotiations to insert a reference to the &ldquo;federal vocation&rdquo; of the Union in Article B of the Treaty.  In the event the Intergovernmental Conference decided not to include this provision.</P>
    <P>If, as is likely, this issue is raised again in 1996, the Government will decide its negotiating position in the light of the circumstances applying then.  However, it is very likely that it would be in Ireland's interest to continue to support a federal vocation for the European Union.</P>
    <P>In due course, the Government will report to the Dáil on the prospects for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conferences and will keep the House informed of negotiations when they commence.</P>
    <P>The Government will also consider an information campaign at the appropriate time &mdash; it is not possible at this stage to predict the character of the campaign in advance of the outcome of negotiations in 1996.</P>
    <P>I would add that the Government <Col N="389" /> mounted an extensive information campaign during the recent referendum. Apart from a series of factsheets on the Treaty, an extensive multi-media campaign, a Freefone information service and the provision of copies of the Treaty in public libraries and main post-offices nationwide, the campaign included the delivery of a Short Guide to the Maastricht Treaty to every home in the country &mdash; despite the postal dispute.</P>

      <P>The sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council prevent imports from, and exports to, Iraq but they make exceptions in respect of foodstuffs, medicines and materials and supplies for other essential civilian needs.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Security Council agree that Iraq could export petroleum products up to the value of 1.6 billion US dollars, the sum to be paid into an account administered by the Secretary General and to serve principally to finance the purchase of food, medicines and essential civilian needs.  The Security Council has also provided that funds from other sources may be deposited in that account and be immediately available to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population.</P>
      <P>The suffering of the Iraqi civilian population is a matter of great concern but it must be made clear that the responsibility for this situation lies with Saddam Hussein. The issue here is not one of availability of resources; Iraq is rich in oil resources.  It is the persistent refusal of the Iraqi regime to comply in full with Security Council resolutions that has led to the hardships being endured by the civilian population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> In February, Saddam Hussein broke off negotiations with the United Nations which were intended to permit the sale of Iraqi oil to enable essential civilian needs in Iraq to be met.  I am glad to say that those negotiations have resumed since then, and that the UN Secretary-General has said that Iraq is now taking a positive attitude as regards the implementation of UN resolutions although it has not yet implemented all of them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Iraqi authorities will co-operate fully with the Security Council and will reach agreement with the UN on the sale of oil in order to ensure much-needed relief and assistance for the people of Iraq.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is not a producer of arms but we have always advocated restraint in <Col N="391" /> arms sales in the interests of international peace and stability.</P>
    <P>In its Declaration on Non-Proliferation and Arms Exports of 29 June last year, the European Council identified a number of common criteria on which the national arms export policies of EC member states were based.  Ireland fully supports these criteria which are in line with our national policy.  These criteria are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;respect for the international commitments of the Member States of the Community, in particular the sanctions decreed by the Security Council of the United Nations and those decreed by the Community, agreements on non-proliferation and other subjects, as well as other international obligations;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the respect of human rights in the country of final destination;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the internal situation in the country of final destination, as a function of the existence of tensions or internal armed conflict;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the preservation of regional peace, security and stability;</P>

      <P>I can assure the House that I am conscious of, and I deplore, the deaths of Palestinian detainees which have occurred in Israeli custody over the past four years.  Ireland has joined with its European Community partners in making numerous representations to the Israeli authorities on this and on other human rights issues in the Occupied Territories.  Ireland has also made representations bilaterally to the Israeli authorities concerning the situation of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories.</P>
      <P>The illegal occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the continuing abuses of human rights there are of grave concern to Ireland and our partners in the European Community. The Government attach great importance to the current Middle East peace process, in which we are participating both at national and European Community levels.  That process offers the best prospects for reaching an overall Middle East settlement which would at last bring an end to the suffering of Palestinian civilians as well as meeting Israel's legitimate security requirements.</P>
      <P>The Declaration of the European Council meeting in Lisbon on 26-27 June on the Middle East Peace Process restated the Community's position on the situation in the Occupied Territories and explicitly called on all parties to refrain from all acts of violence that are likely to jeopardise the Peace Process in any way.</P>
      <P>That Declaration also expressed the belief that last month's election results in Israel will reinforce the Peace Process and called on the new Israeli Government to seize the opportunity to negotiate a comprehensive peace.</P>

      <P>All 11 members of the Commonwealth of Independent States have been formally recognised by Ireland.  The Irish Ambassador in Moscow is accredited to the Russian Federation; non-resident diplomatic relations have been established with Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.  The establishment of formal diplomatic relations with the remaining seven states will be considered from time to time in the light of our national and international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to make a precise assessment of the likely effects on trade of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, particularly since separate statistics were not previously recorded on trade with the constituent republics.  However, the bulk of our trade in the past was with the Russian Federation and this will probably continue to be the case.  I am conscious that there are also considerable opportunities for doing business with the new republics, especially in the services sector, and these are being actively pursued.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 48, 71 and 291 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are very concerned about the situation in Somalia which has developed into an appalling human disaster.  Many thousands of people have died since the civil war broke out in 1991 and now there is the added problem of the drought.  The number of displaced <Col N="397" /> persons is estimated to be as high as 2 million.</P>
    <P>The scale of the problem is so vast that it must be confronted at international level.  It is heartening to note that, despite all the difficulties and dangers, the United Nations and other relief agencies, including Irish non-governmental organisations, are pressing ahead with the relief effort.</P>
    <P>Ireland is playing its part in the effort to help the people of Somalia.  A total of £125,000 has been provided from the Disaster Relief Fund to agencies involved there.  Much of this aid has been directed at providing for the basic food and health needs of displaced persons and refugees who are surviving under dreadful conditions.</P>
    <P>Ireland also participates in the EC emergency relief and long term aid programmes. The total value of EC assistance to Somalia so far is equivalent to over £24 million of which £10 million was allocated under the EC Special Food Aid Programme.</P>
    <P>I was deeply concerned to hear about the recent tragic incident, in which refugees died when their ship went aground off the Yemen coast.  Thousands more were stranded without food or water.  On instruction, the Ambassador in Geneva raised this incident as a matter of urgency with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Ireland has also raised the matter with our partners in the European Community.  I understand that assistance is being provided by the EC Commission, by some EC member states and the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>I will continue to keep developments in Somalia under close review.  I am committed to doing what I can to help alleviate the situation there, both at a political and a humanitarian level.</P>

      <P>As has been the position since Ireland joined the European Communities in 1973, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for the conduct of Ireland's relations within the Communities. The structure and organisation of the Department is kept under constant review to ensure that it continues to respond effectively to the needs of that role and the responsibilities arising from Ireland's membership of the Community and of the developing European Union.</P>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union reinforces Community competence in some areas and introduces new competences in other areas.  In this regard, however, the new Treaty goes no further than the Treaty of Accession or the Single European Act in converting foreign issues to domestic issues.  Since Ireland joined the Community in 1973, Ministers have attended Council meetings in Brussels which take decisions in specific areas for which they have domestic responsibility and look after EC business within those areas of responsibility.  For example, the Minister for Labour has attended meetings of the Social Affairs Council since Ireland joined the Community. That Council took on board the legislative consequences of the important advance in Community competence arising from the Single European Act and will take account of the consequences of the agreement on social policy annexed to the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

    <P>Irish interests in the Community are drawn together through the exercise of co-ordination responsibilities by the Minister of State for European Affairs in the Department of the Taoiseach who presides over the interdepartmental European Co-ordination Committee.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 53, 59 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Seven applications for membership of the EC are currently outstanding.  These are from Turkey, Austria, Malta, Cyprus, Sweden, Finland and Swizerland. There are indications that further applications may be made in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's general attitude to the question of enlargement is an open and positive one.  The Treaty stipulates that any European state may apply to become a <Col N="400" /> member.  Our concern is that enlargement should he handled in such a way as not to diminish the momentum towards European integration.  We would also wish to be certain that applicants are capable of taking on the obligations of membership.  In determining this the formal opinion of the Commission, as required under Article 237 on each application, is of major importance.</P>
    <P>With the growing number of applications it has been clear for some time that the enlargement issue would become an important one on the Community agenda.  We therefore fully supported the decision taken at the Maastricht European Council in December last year to consider the issue in depth at the Lisbon European Council on the basis of a study by the Commission.  The outcome of the decision at Lisbon has already been reported to the House in the statements made on 2 July.</P>
    <P>My Department has begun the process of examining with other Departments the implications of the likely next round of enlargement for Ireland.  In the case of the EFTA countries it should be noted that a considerable amount of ground relevant to accession has already been covered in the negotiations to establish between the EC and EFTA a European Economic Area.  Analysis of the issues posed by the pending membership applications will be intensified in the period ahead as the Commission opinion on each application becomes available. Numerous meetings at official and ministerial level at which enlargement has been discussed have taken place in recent years with representatives of the EFTA member states.  The Finnish Foreign Minister for example was in Dublin on 19 February.  The Swedish royal visit in April was the occasion for valuable discussion with the Swedish Foreign Minister.  I expect such contacts to continue and indeed intensify in coming months.</P>
    <P>The timing of enlargement negotiations was considered by the Lisbon European Council.  The conclusions state that official negotiations on accession would open only after the Maastricht <Col N="401" /> Treaty is ratified and an agreement reached on the Delors II package.  This reaffirms an agreement reached in Maastricht in December.  Ireland firmly supported this line at the European Council as did Spain.  Preparatory work is likely to be undertaken in coming months in line with the Council conclusions which aim at having the proposed general negotiation framework for enlargement ready for consideration at the next European Council in Edinburgh in December.  As to the Cohesion Fund, the Deputy will be aware that it was agreed at Lisbon that it would be put in place early in 1993.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has been in contact with the US authorities since 1986 in the matter of waiving the visa requirement for Irish visitors to the US.</P>
      <P>Section 313 of the US Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986, provided for the establishment of a visa waiver pilot programme for visitors from certain countries to the US.  Under the terms of the Act, the pilot programme can be introduced only in respect of countries which have a low rate of holiday and business visa refusals.  Continuing qualification depends on a low overstay rate in the US on the part of those who benefit from the scheme.  In implementing the scheme, the US authorities are giving priority to countries where there is a large volume of holiday and business visitors to the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The volume of visa applications from Ireland is small by comparison with those countries in respect of whom the visa <Col N="402" /> waiver scheme is currently being implemented and this is a factor to be taken into account in assessing our prospects for inclusion in the scheme, at least in the short term.  We are nevertheless continuing our discussions with the US authorities in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 56, 61 and 282 together.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that total ODA for 1992 will amount to £42.9 million which would represent 0.17 per cent of Gross National Product &mdash; GNP.</P>
      <P>I am making available a tabular statement of the 1991 ODA contributions of those developed countries which are members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee.  The figures for 1992 are not yet available.  Ireland is at the bottom of the list for 1991.  Clearly this is a matter for regret.  It is Government policy to continue to do what it can to help to relieve the crisis confronting the developing countries and to provide long term assistance through the ODA programme.  The revised Programme for Government includes a commitment that the Government will undertake a planned programme of increases in Ireland's Official Overseas Development Assistance 1992-1994, so as to achieve a higher ODA/GNP contribution by the end of that period.  I am anxious that we should make steady progress towards improving our performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro Ireland agreed to participate in a European Community initiative to establish a start-up fund to address the problem of <Col N="404" /> poverty reduction and the building of management skills in developing countries.  The financial implications for Ireland have yet to be fully quantified. I intend to discuss with the Minister for Finance how we can meet our commitments.</P>

    <P>The incursion to which the Deputies refer occurred on 20 June 1992 in the area of Derrybeg, Drumully, County Monaghan.  The Government take a serious view of such incidents and the <Col N="405" /> matter was immediately raised with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The British authorities have admitted that their troops crossed the Border and they have apologised for this incursion which they state was accidental and due to a map reading error.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this prompt acknowledgement and apology it remains the case that incidents of this nature continue to give rise to disquiet and concern in Border areas.</P>

      <P>I very much hope that the prospects for the peace talks in the Middle East will improve as a result of the Israeli election.  It is most important that the peace talks, which were launched last autumn, should make real progress. I believe we can now look forward with greater confidence to progress being made in the peace talks in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Lisbon on 26-27 June stated its belief that the election results will reinforce the peace process and reiterated the need for all parties to commit themselves to the process and to seize the opportunity to negotiate a comprehensive peace.</P>
      <P>The European Council expressed the hope that the new Israeli Government and the Arab parties will act quickly to implement confidence building measures.  The European Council looked forward to a halt to settlements in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, and to full application of the terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  It also called on the members of the Arab League to lift the trade boycott of Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the measures set out by <Col N="406" /> the European Council would contribute greatly to creating a climate of confidence between the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the importance of Hungary, a country with which Ireland has had diplomatic relations since 1974. The Irish Ambassador to Austria is accredited on a non-residential basis to Hungary.  We welcomed the establishment of a resident Hungarian Embassy in Dublin in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are continuing to develop Ireland's political, cultural and economic links with Hungary.  However, our network of resident diplomatic missions is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future, given our limited financial and personnel resources.  We do, of course, keep the possibility of extension of the network under review in the light of our changing national and international interests and the resources available to us, including any possibilities for redeployment of resources.  As a general matter, however, it would not be possible for me to speak publicly in advance about proposals, if any, which might be under consideration at any particular time in relation to the establishment of an embassy in any particular country, since decisions in these matters have to be agreed in each case with the foreign Government concerned and <Col N="407" /> could be announced only in consultation with it.</P>

      <P>The Government strongly support the views of the Norwegian Foreign Minister which coincide with the policy which successive Irish Governments have adopted on this issue over the years.  The Government welcome the fact that Russia and France have temporarily suspended their nuclear testing programmes and would urge the other nuclear powers to follow their example.</P>

      <P>While any inconvenience caused to the civil population is very much regretted, it is virtually impossible for the Air Corps to avoid flying over built-up areas which are in close proximity to Casement Aerodrome despite the careful selection of flight paths and the maintenance of rigid safety procedures.  All Air Corps pilots are acutely aware of the need to minimise the nuisance caused by flying over built-up areas and such flying is kept to the absolute minimum necessary.</P>

The sub-regional review committees broadly comprise the previous sub-regional advisory and working groups which were established by the Government in 1988 to assist in the preparation of the National Development Plan 1989-1993 which formed the basis of Ireland's application for Structural Fund assistance.</P>

The sub-regional review committees were convened in June 1990 and have <Col N="424" /> met regularly, on average, once every two months, since.</P>
    <P>In May of this year the review committees were formally invited to prepare by 30 October 1992, submissions on their views on the content and strategy of the plan, CSF and operational programmes, in so far as they will affect the sub-region, to be assisted by the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund over the period 1994 to 1997.</P>

      <Quest>the approximate cost to the Exchequer of the proposal referred to by An Taoiseach in his reply to a parliamentary question on 3 June 1992 to raise the exemption from stamp duty for the sale of houses from 125 square metres to 140 square metres; and the reason this proposal was not accepted.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is difficult to estimate the year-to-year loss of revenue that would have resulted from the implementation of the proposal, figures available for the number of new houses in this category built in 1991 suggest that the revenue loss from increasing the exemption could have been in the region of £1.5 million. It is claimed that this significant surrender of revenue by the Exchequer would be offset by a reduction in the number of unemployed.  However, the likely effects of the proposed change have been analysed within the constraints of my Department's model of the Irish economy. The results of this simulation indicate that the overall impact of the measures would be negative, because the direct loss of tax revenue would exceed the marginal benefits arising from a very insignificant increase in employment.</P>
      <P>The proposal would also have been contrary to the overall spirit of recommendations made by such bodies as the Commission on Taxation, the OECD, the IMF and the Culliton report against this country's over-reliance on the use of tax reliefs as a mechanism to stimulate economic activity.  The Culliton report particularly advised against a diversion of savings into areas such as high quality residential construction.</P>
      <P>Finally, I consider that there are strong reasons of equity for not proceeding with the proposal.  All second-hand houses, small or medium-sized or large, are subject to stamp duty on sale.  It would be inequitable to raise the existing stamp duty exemption threshold to include even bigger new houses, almost certainly being bought by people with an above-average income, while small second-houses being bought by low-income and medium-income purchasers of second-hand houses continued to be subject to stamp duty.</P>

      <P>Purchasing procedures for computer equipment in Government Departments are an extension of the purchasing procedures that apply to the procurement of goods and services in general by Government Departments.  These general procedures are set out in &ldquo;An outline of Government Contracts Procedures&rdquo; published by the Stationery Office (PI 4120).</P>
      <P>Most Government Departments now have a formal information technology, IT, plan which sets out how computer systems can assist a Department to meet its objectives and provide the overall framework within which purchases of specific items of computer equipment for each Department are made.  In many instances these plans outline the major technical characteristics of the hardware and software to be used in the Department in question.  Wherever possible, the aim is to choose a technical direction which allows for the competitive purchasing of computer equipment and services. When a Department has established the need for additional equipment in line with its information technology plan it prepares a formal request for proposals setting out the requirement in as much detail as possible and seeks competitive tenders for the supply of the equipment.  In some instances regrettably it is not possible to get competitive tenders, usually because of the necessity to purchase equipment which is compatible with equipment already installed in a particular site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the administrative budget initiative Departments then purchase computer equipment and services without further reference to the Department of Finance subject to the following conditions: that the purchase is in accord with an approved information technology plan, that it has been possible to get two or more competitive tenders, that the procedures set out in &ldquo;An Outline of Government Contracts Procedures&rdquo; have been complied with and <Col N="430" /> that various EC requirements including the advertisement in the Official Journal of all proposed contracts in excess of 130,000 ECU have been met.</P>
    <P>Where these conditions cannot be met a Department must seek the specific sanction of the Minister for Finance before undertaking the proposed expenditure.</P>

      <P>Under the rules agreed for the post-1992 VAT regime, new motor vehicles will be liable to VAT in the country of destination i.e. where they are used in all cases, regardless of where purchased within the Community.  In so far as used vehicles are concerned, the application of VAT will depend on the precise circumstances of the transaction.  For private individuals resident in the State, purchasing used vehicles from a dealer in another member state, VAT will be payable only in the country of purchase. Where the purchase is from a private individual in another member state, the question of VAT will not arise.  Detailed rules remain to be worked out for purchases of used vehicles by dealers in one member state from dealers or private individuals in another Community country. Discussions on this particular aspect are actively underway in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing initial excise duty on motor vehicles will be replaced by a first registration charge, as I announced in my budget speech.  This new charge, which is designed to comply with EC Single Market requirements, will be aimed at producing broadly equivalent revenue and will take effect from 1 January 1993. The main legislative framework for the new vehicle registration tax is contained in Chapter IV of the Finance Act, 1992, sections 130 to 144.  Further <Col N="432" /> detailed provisions will be made by way of regulations, as provided for in that Act, in the coming months, while the rates of tax to apply will be set out in the autumn Finance Bill.  It is my intention when setting the actual rates that these revised taxation arrangements will leave the cost of vehicles to motorists largely unchanged.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of outline agreements reached in June 1991 by the EC Council of Ministers in regard to the coverage and rates of VAT to apply after 1992 when the Single Market is completed, energy products generally are intended to be liable to the standard VAT rate.</P>
      <P>However, member states will have the option of applying a reduced VAT rate to supplies of natural gas and electricity provided that, in the view of the EC Commission, such reduced rating would not lead to distortions of competition. Furthermore, special provision has been made for Ireland to reflect the position that the UK will be entitled to retain zero-rating of energy products for heating and lighting.  In the event that this situation gives rise to distortions of competition we may have the option, on foot of authorisation by the Commission, to apply a reduced rate to such supplies generally. The agreement reached, which it is intended will be enshrined in a directive, also includes certain provisions in relation to products to which member states have applied reduced rates but where the option will not be available in the future.  At present, the 12½ per cent rate of VAT applies here to energy products for heating, lighting and power.  This would qualify as a reduced rate after 1992.  The actual VAT rates to apply to energy products as to other goods and services in the future will, of course, fall to be determined in the light of overall budgetary, economic and competitive considerations.</P>

      <P>I have informed the House on previous occasions that the ESB and the National Grid Company in the UK are in continuing discussions about the possibility of an electricity interconnector linking the Irish and UK grids.  As part of this ongoing process it is proposed to conduct a detailed feasibility study incorporating a seabed survey this year.</P>

      <P>The level of carbon dioxide emitted by power stations in 1990 was 10.9 million tonnes.</P>
      <P>The EC is committed to stabilising CO 2, emissions in the Community as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000.  This commitment was made at the joint Energy and Environment Council in Luxembourg in 1990 and reaffirmed in December 1991.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment in consultation with my Department and other relevant Departments in preparing a national carbon dioxide abatement strategy for the Government's consideration prior to submission to the EC Commission.  This strategy will make appropriate allowance for growth in Ireland's CO 2 emissions, reflecting circumstances in our economic development which are different from the more mature economies of many other EC member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland still has an open mind on the approach to be adopted by the Commission to achieve limitation of CO 2 emissions by year 2000.  However, we consider that much greater analysis of the proposal is needed both at Community <Col N="444" /> and member states level before any informed decision is made on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice to make statements to the House about individual Garda investigations except in singular instances where the circumstances are so exceptional that such a course is deemed appropriate.  I do not propose to depart from that practice on this occasion.  As regards the question of extradition proceedings in this case, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 133 on 4 February 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 172, 185, 186, 193, 194, 201, 202, 203 and 204.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputies in relation to the numbers of one, two three and four teacher schools in various counties is given in the following table.  Details regarding such schools are not available on a constituency basis.</P>
      <P>The information requested on the names and locations of schools is being collected and will be forwarded to the respective Deputies when it is available.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals for the widespread closure of small schools.  Amalgamation of primary schools has been taking place for many years on the basis of consensus and agreement.  The Green Paper, which I remind the Deputies, is a discussion document, clearly states that amalgamation of schools would continue to be considered in consultation with local interests.</P>
      <P>I want to have the need for the reorganisation of primary school facilities along with the many other substantial issues raised in the Green Paper fully and thoughtfully debated over the next six months.</P>

      <P>Regulations were made in March 1991 to give effect to an EC Directive on access to the occupation of road haulage operator and road passenger transport operator.  The passenger regulations require that all existing bus operators must hold a road passenger transport operator's licence.</P>

      <P>The professional competence requirement can be met by the licence applicant obtaining a certificate of competence himself or by engaging the holder of such a certificate as his transport manager. Certificates of competence are obtained normally by attending a course and by being successful in the relevant examination organised by the Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland on my behalf.</P>
      <P>The good repute and appropriate financial standing requirements are matters personal to each particular operator.</P>

While the 1991 Act amended the scope of these Acts, it did not change definitions of employee status or relationships.  Therefore, persons who were excluded from the terms of the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; Acts by conditions other than hours thresholds, remain excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home help service is operated through a wide range of agencies.  The voluntary nature of the service, which involves a large element of social commitment, is underlined by the fact that a significant proportion of part-time home helps are engaged on a voluntary basis. In the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups.  It is not possible arising from the <Col N="484" /> diverse contractual arrangements involved to give a general assessment on the application of the terms of the Act to the home help service.</P>
    <P>However, the Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees) Act, 1991, does provide a procedure for disputes concerning qualifying criteria through the Employment Appeals Tribunal. I understand also that advice on the matter is available from the Department of Labour.</P>

As a result of the additional clinic the inpatient waiting list for children's ENT increased.

      <P>The recent report by a consultant anaesthetist in the Meath Hospital quantifies, for the first time, the levels of infection within the intensive care unit of the hospital.  The purpose of this audit was to critically analyse the practices within the unit in order to identify areas of possible improvement, and to review hospital policy regarding infection control.</P>
      <P>The audit took place over the calendar period 1990-91, and one of the findings revealed that infection was present in 69 per cent of patients who died in the unit, during that period.  The consultant who prepared the report has confirmed infection was not the cause of death in these patients.  Critically ill patients are more susceptible to infection and are less able to fight it, and this is a major problem in intensive care units worldwide. The mortality rate within the unit for the 1990-91 period was 17 per cent, and this compares favourably with the rate in similar sized, good quality units in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>Within a framework approved by Government in 1984 each health board has developed its own plan for the specific response of the health services should a major emergency occur.  The role of the health board includes the provision of medical assistance, ambulance transport and casualty evacuation, hospital treatment and community, medical and welfare service.  In addition, the emergency plans of the local authorities and the Garda are designed in such a way as to link in with the health board plan.  It is the combination of the plans of each of the services which forms the overall emergency plan.</P>
      <P>I understand that the health board plans have worked well on those occasions where unfortunately they had to be implemented.  They are kept under review and are updated on a regular basis in the light of experience gained in this country and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ongoing co-ordination of the plans of each emergency service is a matter for the Inter-Departmental Committee on Peacetime Emergencies.  This committee <Col N="487" /> meets to discuss ways of improving existing arrangements and of increasing co-operation and contact between the services.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board's major emergency plan is revised annually.  The last revision was issued in November 1991.  The board participate in exercises with the other emergency services and are involved in regular liaison and discussion with local authorities and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that any shortcomings have been found in the Southern Health Board's major emergency plan. However, if the Deputy has any information in this regard he should make it available and I will raise the matter with the board.  In the light of the Deputy's question I shall seek further assurance from the other health boards.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to refute the claim that Ireland has the worst record in the world after the United States for malpractice law suits.  In any event, the number of law suits taken is not an indicator of the number of claims made against medical practitioners or the number of cases settled out of court.  The general view of the profession in Ireland is that the Irish claims made experience is at least comparable to or possibly worse than the United Kingdom trend. However, the statistical facts in the whole area of medical litigation are notoriously difficult to establish.  Following an announcement in December 1991 by the medical defence organisations that massive increases in medical defence fees were imminent, an inter-departmental working group was established to examine all areas of medical indemnity insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group focused initially on non-consultant hospital doctors as a homogeneous grouping within the medical profession for medical indemnity purposes. As a result, I am pleased to say that a new medical indemnity scheme has been arranged with the Medical Protection <Col N="491" /> Society from 1 July 1992 for NCHDs and community medical and dental staff.  The net effect to the individual is that he-she is no longer required to make any payment for indemnity cover.  Savings will also accrue to the State as tax concessions will no longer be payable to individuals. The working group is currently finalising its report on all aspects of medical negligence and the various means of providing indemnity.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the working group's report and I can assure the Deputy that I will take immediate steps to initiate whatever action is recommended for cost containment in the whole area of medical indemnity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232, 233 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to ENT services in the Southern Health Board area, the position is that the regional unit is located at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital in Cork.  There are two full-time and one part-time ENT consultants attached to this unit.  The Deputy will be interested to know that the South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria Hospitals' revenue allocation for 1992 includes a sum of £0.150 million for the further development of the ENT service at the hospital.  My Department has also approved a post of senior audiometrician and four additional nurses for the ENT unit at this hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The Deputy will also be interested to know that the Southern Health Boards revenue allocation for 1992 includes provision for the development of an ENT service at Tralee General Hospital. In this context, my Department issued financial clearance to the Southern Health Board to proceed with arrangements for the appointment of an ENT consultant at Tralee General Hospital.  I understand that Comhairle na nOspidéal has now given approval to the board to proceed with the filling of this post.</P>
    <P>With regard to ENT services nationally my Department has recognised the need for further improvement in the service and this has been reflected in the 1992 Health Estimates.  In addition to the developments in ENT in the Southern Health Board area specific provision has also been made for the development of ENT services in the North Eastern Health Board, the Western Health Board and the Midland Health Board areas.  I am confident that these measures will significantly improve the service for patients requiring ENT treatment.</P>
    <P>Audiology services are provided by health board community care programmes, the National Rehabilitation Board, special audiology clinics and ENT departments of major acute general hospitals.</P>
    <P>The question of resourcing technical staff levels in hospitals is primarily a matter to be addressed by hospital authorities, subject to their prioritising their perceived relative needs within the general environment of deployment of financial resources and current employment control procedures.  More generally, the national population base has certain limiting implications for the range of technical, vocational and professional courses which can reasonably be provided within third level colleges on a continuous structured basis.  Courses of training for careers as an audiologist or as an audiological technician, audiometrician, are available in various centres in the United <Col N="494" /> Kingdom, through no such courses are available here.  In common with a number of other specialist career areas some difficulty has tended to be experienced over the years in the recruitment of audiology support staff to centres in the public health service here.  Salary levels for audiological technicians are in line with these for many broadly comparable health service employees.  The difficulty in recruiting personnel would derive from a number of factors.</P>
    <P>The additional funds allocated in 1989 to reduce unacceptable long waiting times resulted in a reduction of almost 10 per cent in the numbers of patients on the waiting list for ENT treatment during the period April 1990 to February 1991.</P>

As Minister for Health I am directly involved in the development of a comprehensive and integrated national AIDS policy in terms of prevention, treatment, care and rehabilitation.  The National AIDS Strategy Committee, of which I am Chairman, has developed a number of strategies to implement national policy goals on a priority and on a multi-sectoral basis.  The Deputy will be aware of these strategies which concern: the care and management of persons with HIV/AIDS, HIV/AIDS surveillance, education and prevention strategies and measures to avoid discrimination.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the strategies which has received a major additional investment of £3.3 million this year is currently being undertaken by statutory and voluntary agencies.

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the situation in the Eastern Health Board area where couples are waiting to be assessed for a foreign adoption.</P>
      <P>This backlog has risen as a result of the large initial rush of applications for assessment following the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1991, which imposed for the first time a statutory duty on health boards to carry out foreign adoption assessments.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is committed to clearing the backlog as soon as practicable.  This is reflected in the fact that it now has four social workers carrying out assessments and that it expects to be in a position to assign a fifth social worker to the task this month.  These measures are having a big impact on the current waiting list and demonstrate the health board's commitment to the early completion of all outstanding assessments.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the anxiety of the couples concerned to have their assessments started and I would ask them to be patient a little longer while the positive steps being taken by the health board on their behalf bring about an improvement in the situation.</P>

      <P>The most reliable and comprehensive source of information on the incidence of child sexual abuse comes from the statistics compiled by health boards on the number of cases of such abuse confirmed by them following detailed medical and social investigation.</P>
      <P>The number of alleged cases of child sexual abuse reported to health boards in 1989 was 1,242.  All of these reports were investigated in accordance with my Department's child abuse guidelines and in 568 cases the allegations were confirmed. The breakdown of these figures by health board is as follows:</P>

    <P>As there is an unavoidable time lag between the receipt of a report of alleged child sexual abuse and the completion of inquiries by the health boards, collection of statistics in respect of 1990 and 1991 is not yet complete.  However the preliminary indications are that the number of confirmed cases in those years was of a similar level to 1989.</P>
    <P>A major research project into all confirmed cases of child sexual abuse in the Eastern Health Board area in 1988 was carried out on behalf of my Department. The report contains an analysis of the various factors related to the incidence of child sexual abuse.  I am arranging to have a summary of the findings forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal have furnished to my Department the data requested by the Deputy.  The data refers to approved permanent consultant child psychiatrist posts in each health board area at 1 May of each of the years in question.  Consultant child psychiatrists employed by voluntary hospitals and other agencies have been included in the data in respect of each of the respective health board areas.  Comhairle have indicated that whilst seven of the establishment of 34 permanent posts are not currently filled on a permanent basis, they are in the process of being filled.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, a revised common contract now applies to consultant appointments.  In the case of health board consultant appointments, including child psychiatric consultant appointments, the chief executive officer has power under section 14 (3) of the Health Act, 1970, to determine the duties of all officers.  However, the chief executive officer of each health board has indicated that the exercise of his powers under section 14 (3) of the Health Act, 1970, will be in accordance with the terms of the revised consultants' contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the revised contract, the precise <Col N="505" /> duties of consultant child psychiatrists are determined in accordance with the agreed Schedule of Commitment and Practice Plan of the consultant's post in question.  In broad terms, the consultant child psychiatrist's duties involve clinical, organisational, research and teaching functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> The increase in the number of permanent approved consultant child psychiatrist posts over the period 1.5.1989 to 1.5.1992 shown in the tabular statement reflects the commitment of the Government to the development of child psychiatric services.</P>

      <P>The data requested by the Deputy which is taken from my Department's Health Services Personnel Census is outlined in the attached tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The data relates to all clinical psychologists employed at both basic and more senior level in the health board sector, the voluntary hospital sector and in the mental handicap sector.  A significant number in all three sectors would be involved in the provision of psychological services for children.</P>
      <P>The duties of clinical psychologists employed by health boards are determined by the Chief Executive Officer of the respective health board in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>A basic grade psychologist's duties, which are performed under the supervision and guidance of a senior psychologist typically would include the provision of therapy, undertaking and participating in research and giving lectures and demonstrations to other health staff as required.  Other duties include the provision of reports on persons referred by other psychologists and by medical staff and attendance as and when required at any hospital or institution. The Chief Executive Officer of the health board may determine other duties, which are appropriate to the post of basic grade psychologist.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258, 259, 260 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the committee which carried out a review of the law applying to the operation of small public service vehicles was published on 1 July and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The report contains a total of 64 recommendations. Because of the extent of the changes recommended and the high level of interest in the matter, I intend to allow a period for interested persons and bodies to consider the issues, and to make submissions to me, before I decide whether to implement the main recommendations. These recommendations do not necessily represent the only way forward and I will be looking at all the options, taking account of any views which interested persons or bodies may wish to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with publication of the report, I decided that some of the recommendations should be implemented immediately and I made regulations on 1 July which provide for the grant, by the Garda Commissioner, of 50 new licences for wheelchair accessible taxis in the Dublin taximeter area and for the removal of the moratorium on the grant of new taxi and private hire (hackney) licences throughout the country which was introduced last October.  These regulations <Col N="510" /> have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in the usual manner.  Any further changes in existing law on the granting of taxi and hackney licences will be considered following the consultation process which is now beginning.</P>
    <P>As regards the creation of new taximeter areas, the report recommends that decisions to apply taximeter area status to any particular urban area should be devolved entirely to local authorities.  I will also consider this matter following the period of public consultation.</P>

      <P>Waste producers are primarily responsible for the safe disposal of their wastes.  The appropriate local authority has statutory functions in relation to toxic and dangerous waste planning and control within its functional area.  Local authorities have a wide range of powers to ensure that such wastes are disposed of without danger either to public health or to the environment.</P>

      <P>2.  The position of Chief Executive should be advertised to secure the best applicants from both the private and public sectors.  To attract the calibre of candidate required, the position should be structured at an appropriately high level within the public service with regard to grading and remuneration.</P>
      <P>3.  The legislation should clearly establish that the NRA will report directly to the Minister.</P>

The committee recently carried out a comprehensive <Col N="516" /> mid-term review of the programme which confirmed that investment outturns in relation to road development in the period to end 1991 were on target.  The committee agreed financial plans for road development in each of the two sub-programmes for the remaining two years 1992 and 1993 which would complete the investments originally envisaged under the programme.

      <P>Primary responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of county roads rests with the individual county councils and State road grants for these roads are intended to supplement, and not to replace, expenditure financed by the local authorities from their own resources.  The commitment given in the 1989 budget that £150 million would be provided over three years in discretionary grants to county councils for regional and county roads was more than fulfilled.  In fact, total grants over the three years 1989-1991 amounted to £182.47 million and I am maintaining the momentum this year with a grant of £68.1 million.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the report made by the United Nations Special Representative, Mr. Galindo Pohl, on the human rights situation in Iran in 1991. The Minister for Foreign Affairs paid an official visit to Iran from 3 to 5 March during which he raised the issue of human rights with the Iranian authorities.</P>

    <P>Concurrently with that visit, Ireland and the other member states of the European Community co-sponsored a draft resolution on human rights in Iran at the United Nations Commission on Human <Col N="520" /> Rights, in Geneva.  That resolution was adopted on 4 March.</P>
    <P>It expressed deep concern at the continuing reports of violations of human rights in Iran and grave concern at the fact that the application of the death penalty had not diminished, but increased.</P>

      <P>Two of these, on 19 September 1991 in the Hague and on 30 September 1991 in Brussels, considered the conflict in Yugoslavia and the steps the WEU might take to support the European Community's peace process including its Monitor Mission.  In the event no such steps were taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The third meeting took place at the time of the Maastricht Council on 9/10 December 1991.

      <P>The widespread presence of unexploded landmines throughout the Cambodian countryside is a real danger to the lives and limbs of all the people of Cambodia.  The problem posed by these landmines is fully recognised by the international community and is a matter of major concern to the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of this, one of the first tasks undertaken by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia was the establishment in April of this year of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre.  The function of the Centre is to assist in undertaking long-term programmes in mine-awareness, mine-marking and mine-clearance.  The Centre also trains civilians in mine-avoidance techniques. <Col N="523" /> The UN considers that the Centre's programmes are proceeding well.</P>
    <P>UNTAC has already deployed mine-clearing teams in Cambodia and is engaged in training additional Cambodians so that further mine-training teams can be deployed in the coming months.  The UN estimates that 5,000 Cambodians will have been trained in mine-clearing by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>UNTAC has concentrated its initial mine-clearing work on the main roads; recently, the whole of route 69, from Sisophon to the Thai border, has been cleared and the clearing of other main roads, particularly those being used by returning refugees is being given priority.</P>
    <P>As regards a ban on landmines, I think it is worth noting that the problem has been specifically addressed by the UN Secretary General in his recent report &ldquo;Agenda For Peace&rdquo;.  I would hope that this will lead to this serious matter being given further consideration by the United Nations.</P>

      <P>The report from the Embassy in Bonn indicates that the main problem facing Irish students in Munich is their difficulty in obtaining suitable low-cost accommodation.  In addition, for a variety of reasons, holiday employment is scarcer than usual in Munich this year. These difficulties were compounded by the fact that many of the students lacked sufficient information about living and working conditions in Germany and were unprepared for the practical problems which they might encounter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Embassy official who visited Munich for four days last week spent a considerable amount of time discussing their problems with the large body of Irish students and advising them how best they might improve their position.  His discussions with campsite officials, various officials dealing with local <Col N="525" /> employment, and the local police also helped to sensitise the authorities in Munich to the problems being exprienced by Irish students.  The visit by the Embassy official appears to have dealt with the more accute aspects of the problem; however, the Embassy will keep in close touch with the situation and will send an officer to Munich again if necessary.</P>
    <P>The experience in Munich highlights in particular the need for proper preparation on the part of young people travelling abroad for summer holiday work.  I have asked my Department to examine, together with other Departments involved, any further steps that might be taken to address this issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 297 and 298 together.  The position regarding legislation promised or introduced since 1989 is as follows:</P>
      <P>Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991</P>
      <P>This Act was signed into law by the President on 28 May 1991.  The Act provided for the establishment of the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange to replace An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cómalairte (The Scholarship Exchange Board) which, since 1957, had administered the Fulbright Programme of academic exchanges between Ireland and the US The Commission was established by Ministerial Order on 3 February of this year.</P>
      <P>11th Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1992</P>
      <P>Ireland signed the Treaty on European Union at Maastricht on 7 February 1992.  Under Article R of the Treaty, member states undertook to ratify the Treaty in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements and to complete those procedures before 1 January 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first stage in Ireland's ratification procedures the Minister for Foreign Affairs presented the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992, in April 1992.  The Bill provided for an amendment to Article 29 of the Constitution to allow the State to ratify the Treaty on European Union and <Col N="528" /> become a member of the Union.  The amendment also allowed the State to ratify the agreement relating to Community Patents.</P>
    <P>The Bill completed its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas on 15 May 1992 and, following the referendum on 18 June 1992, it will shortly be presented for the President's signature in accordance with the relevant constitutional provision.</P>
    <P>The next stage in Ireland's ratification procedures will require an amendment to the European Communities Act, 1972 to take account of the Treaty.  Draft Heads of a Bill are being prepared and will be presented to Government shortly.  It is intended at this stage that a Bill will be presented early in the autumn.</P>
    <P>There is no legislation, for which the Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible and which has been enacted by the Oireachtas, which is not in operation.</P>

      <P>The Special Commission has, however, verified the destruction of ballistic missile production equipment in Iraq and, provided that what has been verified represents the essence of Iraq's ballistic missile production capability, the Special Commission is confident that Iraq's capability in this area has been destroyed.</P>

    <P>I regret to say I have seen reports that <Col N="529" /> Iraq, on Sunday 5 July, refused UN inspectors permission to enter a Government building as part of their task of overseeing the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq.</P>

As indicated in response to an earlier question, it would not be possible for me to speak publicly in advance about proposals, if any, which might be under consideration at any particular time since decisions in these matters have to be agreed in each case with the foreign Government concerned and could be announced only in consultation with it.  The same requirement of mutual agreement applies to the opening of foreign Embassies in Dublin and it would be inappropriate for me to speculate publicly about possible developments in the period ahead.</P>

The policy is to advise farmers through publicity, including through the advisory work of Teagasc in the course of farm visits.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions <Col N="542" /> Nos. 323, 329, 330, 338, 349, 350 together.  Unemployment statistics are compiled by reference to the local office from where the claims are administered, and the catchment area of a Local Office is not necessarily confined to the particularly Dáil constituency or county in which it is situated.  The numbers of persons registered as unemployed at local offices in the counties or constituencies specified by the Deputies are as set out below.</P>

      <P>Although there is no provision for obtaining a divorce in Ireland, the law does recognise foreign divorces in certain circumstances.  In deciding an application for a social welfare payment, where a foreign divorce is involved, the Department must have regard to the status of the individual under the laws of the State, in considering the application. The legal provision relating to foreign <Col N="547" /> divorces are to be found in the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986 and not in Social Welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>Generally, if a divorce is recognised in the State, it is also recognised for social welfare purposes.  In these circumstances if the person remarries, that marriage will be recognised for social welfare purposes.</P>

      <Quest>when the Maynooth employment office in County Kildare will be upgraded from an employment office to an employment exchange as this subcontracted office, which caters for the whole of County Kildare, is causing great hardship to social welfare claimants and recipients due to long delays in processing claims as all claims have to go to Gardiner Street, Dublin 1.</Quest>

      <P>There are approximately 2,500 persons registered at Maynooth branch employment office at present. Some 1,200 of these attend the branch office each week for payment or to sign for credited contributions and the remainder are paid at their local post offices.</P>
      <P>The Maynooth branch office, which services north-east Kildare and parts of Meath, is managed on a contract basis by a branch manager who is required under the terms of his contract to provide suitable office accommodation and sufficient clerical assistance necessary for efficient performance of the work.  The branch manager works under the general control and direction of the manager of the Department's office at Gardiner Street, which is the parent office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the service being provided at the Maynooth branch office is satisfactory.  I am not aware of any complaints about the service and if the Deputy has specific cases in mind I will have them examined if he lets me have <Col N="548" /> the details.  I am pleased to be able to say that the network of branch employment offices throughout the country is being computerised at present and this will bring about increased efficiencies and improve the general level of services being provided.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the unacceptable situation which has arisen from the changes made in the Social Welfare Act, 1992 regarding maternity benefit which now means that pregnant women who are not in employment, or who do not have a job to return to after the birth of the child, are denied maternity benefit and are having to continue to sign on at employment exchanges right up to confinement and immediately after birth in order to continue receiving unemployment assistance; if he considers this acceptable; if he will now amend the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Social Welfare Act 1992, there were two maternity benefit <Col N="554" /> schemes.  The scheme for women in employment covered women who qualified for leave from work under the Maternity Protection of Employees Acts, 1981 and 1991.  The other scheme catered for women workers who did not so qualify but who satisfied the relevant contribution conditions.  Women claiming unemployment benefit or disability benefit could transfer to this scheme for the relevant period.  Women claiming unemployment assistance would not generally fulfil the contribution conditions for maternity benefit and would remain on unemployment assistance for the period concerned.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1992, rationalised the schemes, in the light of the extension of entitlement to maternity benefit and other social insurance payments to all workers earning £25 a week or more including part-time workers. Under these arrangements the maternity benefit scheme for women in employment was extended to women in employments not covered by the Maternity Protection of Employees Acts, 1981 and 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements were made at the same time for women on unemployment benefit and disability benefit, who had hitherto availed of the general maternity scheme, to remain on those payments for the period immediately before and after the birth of a child.  In order to eliminate the necessity for pregnant women and women who have recently given birth to attend for weekly signing at their local employment offices, new flexible signing arrangements have just been introduced. Under these new arrangements, pregnant women will be required to sign a declaration of their availability for employment six weeks before their expected date of confinement.  Thereafter, they will receive their weekly payments by post. A second declaration will be sent by post to be signed after the confinement, which will continue the arrangements for the following six weeks. The question of the claimant's continued availability for employment will not fall to be examined until the end of the 12 week period.  The effect of these new <Col N="555" /> arrangements is that women claiming unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance will not now be required to sign on in the periods immediately before and after their confinement.</P>

      <P>Thirteen projects are formally approved for funding and are commencing activity.  A further number of projects will commence activity in the near future.</P>
      <P>Given the high level of interest in Ireland in the NOW initiative, I have written to Commissioner Papandreou seeking additional EC funds for NOW.  I am hopeful of a positive response to this request.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 357 together.  The operation of the scheme within the agreed funding level with regard to the level of intake and the approval or renewal of projects is a day-to-day matter for FÁS.  Directions were not given by my Department.</P>
      <P>The 1992 Exchequer allocation for the social employment scheme is £72.9 million compared with £59.545 million in 1991.  The 1992 allocation makes up for the loss of £13 million approximately European Social Fund aid in 1991.  I have indicated on a number of occasions that the 1992 allocation was intended to provide 11,000 man-years activity.  I am optimistic, that in fact it will be possible to generate 11,300 approximately man-years activity in 1992 with the allocation of £72.9 million.</P>
      <P>I must re-emphasise that the scheme was never intended to provide funding on a continuing basis for particular projects. It would be more appropriate for voluntary organisations providing services on a continuing basis to seek sources of State funding from sources relating to the area in which they are operating, e.g. the Arts, health, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently, under the Factories Act, 1955 (Manual Labour) (Maximum Weights and Transport) Regulations, 1972, (S.I. No. 283 of 1972), adult males employed in certain premises to which the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980 apply may not be required to lift or carry a load weighing more than 55 kilograms or 121 lbs.  This is without prejudice to the general requirement in section 67 (1) of the Factories Act, 1955, that a person may not be employed to lift, carry or move any load so heavy as to be likely to cause injury to him.</P>
      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health are considering proposals for new regulations to give effect by the end of this year to EC Council 90/269/EEC on the minimum health and safety requirements for the manual handling of loads where there is a risk particularly of back injury to workers.  The existing regulations will be revoked on the coming into operation of the new regulations which will apply to all places of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, the Directive requires an employer to take appropriate measures or use appropriate means, in particular mechanical equipment, in order to avoid the need for the manual handling of loads <Col N="561" /> by workers.  Where such manual handling cannot be avoided the employer must make an assessment and take appropriate measures to remove or reduce the risk of injury.  The assessment required must take into account several factors including the characteristics of the load e.g., weight, size and shape, the physical effort required e.g., too strenuous, unstable body posture, the characteristics of the working environment e.g., insufficient room, uneven floor and the requirements of the activity e.g., excessive lifting, rate of work as well as the specific risk factors which may affect the individual workers e.g., physically unsuited to tasks, insufficient training.  The directive is based on modern ergonomic criteria which recognise that weight is one of the many factors only which may influence the risk of injury in the manual handling of loads. Accordingly, the directive refrains form stipulating absolute maximum weights to be applied.</P>
    <P>The directive is of special significance in that its preventive approach relies more on the use of ergonomic assessment, mechanical aids and training than on human muscle power.</P>
