      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that: Business shall be interrupted at 6 p.m. today; the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 8, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to be conclusion at 6 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare; the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.; No. 5, which shall be taken tomorrow, shall be decided without debate; the following arrangements shall apply with regard to the statements on the Culliton report which shall be made tomorrow; the statement of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes; and a Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 3.50 p.m. to make a statement in reply.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that, in the course of Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, we have now reached discussion on section 7. There are 63 sections in this Bill.  I would urge the Taoiseach to give some consideration to the provision of more time since the provisions of this Bill have implications for approximately one-third, or more, of our population.  Yet we now propose to conclude Committee Stage between now and 6 p.m. today. That time is inadequate.  Probably we will get to about section 10 when the discussion will have to be brought to a conclusion.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consider providing more time for Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said yesterday, neither I nor the Minister for Social Welfare regard the arrangements as adequate in the context of 1992.  I pointed out yesterday that the Second Stage debate had been somewhat shortened to allow the maximum amount of time for consideration of Committee Stage.  Committee Stage was allocated 14½ hours as against 6¾ hours last year.  The total hours devoted to consideration of the Bill this year are 21¼ as against 16¼ last year.  While we do not regard it as satisfactory, the Bill has to be passed by the Seanad and its provisions implemented for the benefit of social welfare recipients by 6 April next.  We do not regard it as satisfactory and will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that this does not recur in the future.</P>

Therefore, I am proposing an amendment to the proposal for dealing with the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with tomorrow's sittings &mdash; that the House will meet at 10.30 a.m. and adjourn not later than 4 p.m. &mdash; agreed?  Agreed.  It is agreed that No. 5 shall be taken tomorrow and decided without debate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with the publication of the Estimates.  Last year the Estimates were debated in a few hours and literally billions of pounds were voted through the House at a rate of approximately £100 million per minute. In regard to this year's Estimates, will the Taoiseach say whether the Government have drafted proposals, not only to allow more time for debate but also to allow Ministers to be individually examined on individual subheads of the Estimates for which they are responsible in the form of a committee-style discussion?  Otherwise, this House is not carrying out the clear responsibility it has under the Constitution in regard to approving the Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of having Friday sittings is to ensure that there is more time and an adequate opportunity <Col N="1835" /> to discuss the Estimates.  As we now have Friday sittings, that will be done.  Deputy Bruton's request that consideration should be given to a short question and answer period at the end is being considered in the context of Dáil reform but in the immediate future perhaps the Whips will have a discussion in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>While we made some progress, it was on minor details and we did not make any progress on the major elements in the Bill.  In fact, we are unlikely to get to the sections where we can achieve that.  My party Leader, Deputy Spring, emphasised that there was not sufficient time to deal with the Bill and we all share that view.  I am sure the Minister would agree that we need a great deal more time to deal with this very complex Bill.  Over one million people are affected by each and every section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has very wide ramifications. Will the Minister consider this suggestion?  I suggest that the Minister consult with his colleagues in Government and the Opposition Party leaders and ask them to agree the financial aspects so that the sections dealing with increases in benefit could be applied? Then people would not be deprived of their increases and the remaining section of the Bill could be put in cold storage until such time as Members who know about social welfare matters could sit down with the Department officials and work out a social welfare code from the green field stage, after examining the social welfare code before and during the eighties and see why and how we introduced it and see the level of contributions then as opposed to earnings and the benefits which accrued to workers who paid into the system.  Every year since 1981 we have tinkered around with the system so much that the Social Welfare Bill and the PRSI element of social welfare is no longer in operation as it was originally intended.  As I said last night, we should turn the clock back <Col N="1842" /> and start afresh.  I do not see why that cannot be done.  There is adequate scope within the section we are dealing with and other sections to achieve that.  I suggest that between now and lunchtime the Minister, in consultation with his officials and colleagues, consider the proposal to simply pass the sections of the Bill that would give effect to the increases in the benefits from April in the case of old age pensions and from July in the case of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, invalidity pensions and other aspects of the Bill.  I am satisfied the Minister would have the full support of the trade union movement, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Irish Industry and other employer agencies in the State and semi-State sector to achieve that.  Even the employer organisations have said publicly that the Bill will not work in the interests of maintaining employment.  It is a tax on employment which will create more unemployment and cost the Department of Social Welfare more money.  We must start afresh.</P>
    <P>One could not possibly amend the social welfare code as it now exists because we would be here debating social welfare matters for the next six months. We still would not come to a conclusion because we are trying to satisfy too many elements of the social welfare code instead of trying to direct resources of social welfare where they should be directed, namely, to the lower income groups and to the widows, of whom the female Deputies of Fine Gael spoke so eloquently last night.  We should be looking after widows with young families, deserted wives with young families, and old people living alone who are unable to take care of themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 is about putting a ceiling on contributions and on benefit.  I will keep to that point because the core of the problem lies there, and I thank you for reminding me about it.  I read in the newspapers about certain individuals, who shall be nameless, who are earning £6 million, £2 million, £5 million and £100 million per year.  Why not lift the ceiling provided for in section 7 and make those people pay PRSI on every pound they earn?  If they earn £100 million, they should pay PRSI on every pound.  The Minister would then have the money he needs to take care of the categories of people referred to in an excellent debate last night.  That is what the Minister has to think about.  The ceilings contained in section 7 are only protecting the people who do not need protecting and who can spend thousands of pounds engaging financial wizards to figure out ways and means of not paying their fair share into the system.  Nobody in the House would be more skilled and knowledgeable in that regard than the Minister, who is a professional accountant.  The Minister knows that accountants are employed by the business community and by people of means in order to get over the issues created by section 7.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to scrap the ceiling altogether and accept the Labour Party proposal.  I will support him and go out to the highways and byways and try to get the support, which I know will be forthcoming, from my colleagues in the trade union movement.  That would provide the Minister with the money to be able to do what Deputy Connaughton suggested last night in regard to small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I visit the west I see small farmers on 20 acres getting up in the mornings at 6 o'clock to feed their calves with nuts and milk.  They are not millionaires, they are depending on supplementary welfare allowances to boost their earnings.  That would not be necessary if section 7 were not contained in the Bill.  The Minister knows who I am talking about &mdash; I do <Col N="1844" /> not like naming people who are not here to defend themselves &mdash; but if a person can be paid for his work for a year at the rate of £5 million or £6 million and somebody else has to exist in the west on a small farm on a miserable £40 or £50 supplementary welfare allowance, then we are not talking about a caring society or the Irish society that Connolly, Lemass, de Valera and all the other leaders fought and died for.  That concept is gone out of the community at large.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister, in the context of section 7, to eliminate the floors and the ceilings.  If one is talking to a widow with children and a deserted wife who has many children at school for whom she cannot provide clothing or footwear, she does not know anything about ceilings or floors or income limits.  The only ceiling she knows about is the one in the kitchen and the only floor she knows about is the one in the dining room.  She does not know anything about the floors or the ceilings contained in that monstrosity of a Bill.  I feel very sorry indeed for any Minister who would have to inherit such a Bill.  It will be a yoke around his neck unless he takes a decisive decision to eliminate all aspects of that Bill and sit down and rethink it.</P>
    <P>I see the work of the person who prepared the 1981 Act in sections 7, 8 and 9 of this Bill.  Effectively, sections 7, 8 and 9 should be taken together because they are consequential on each other: one deals with the floor levels and the others deal with the ceilings.  They cannot be separated, they must be taken in consort, otherwise we will have a repetitive discussion on what is effectively the same subject.  Therefore, it is very difficult for Members to debate section 7 without taking into account the effect of sections 8 and 9.</P>

Let us turn the clock back and let us talk about the old system where the worker was able to go into the factory office and examine a little card with his insurance record.  We should forget about the high powered P60 and P45 systems as they mean nothing.  I could fill the library in Drogheda with the P60s stacked in my office.  These P60s are worth nothing because the money was not returned to the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners.  There are no benefits to be gained unless the money paid by the worker is returned to the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great difficulty with section 7 for a variety of reasons which I will now outline and which I consider to be extremely relevant. While it is obvious Deputy Bell takes this matter very seriously, it is not as simple as he thinks.  The proposal that each worker should pay PRSI on their entire earnings, irrespective of how much they earn, would have implications for the VHI.  It should also be said that those with an income above the ceiling of £20,300 pay a large chunk of income tax and have to pay for everything, including third level education.  Indeed, they get nothing at all out of the system.  I assume that the pensions board &mdash; the Minister has indicated to the House that their report will be made available in a few <Col N="1846" /> months time &mdash; will have an awful lot to say about this matter also.</P>
      <P>I said last night, and I am saying it again now, that the pay-related social insurance scheme is under attack.  Every worker should therefore take a close look at what is happening because the trends are being reversed in this House this week.</P>
      <P>There is a number of matters that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I have raised these in the House on a number of occasions, although not with the new Minister.  In 1988 a scheme was introduced under which the self-employed pay PRSI.  This is a good scheme, although some objections were raised initially when it was argued that we would encounter major problems in relation to actuarial assessments.  One of the advantages of the scheme is that it has brought to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners a great number of people about whom they knew nothing heretofore. While the self-employed should pay a contribution towards their own pension scheme, the events of both yesterday and today in this House may indicate to them that the results may not be as good as they expect.  If the value of their contributions continues to be reduced many of them might say that perhaps they will not receive a pension in ten years' time, but that is a matter for another day.</P>
      <P>There are three or four matters relating to the self-employed that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  As he is aware, the self-employed have to pay contributions for a minimum period of ten years from 1988.  That is a reasonable provision but, as is the case in respect of every other scheme, there must be a starting point.  The Department therefore decided that each person aged 55 and over should pay the piper.  It was assumed, although not stated at the time, that those who would pay contributions for less than ten years would receive a <i>pro rata</i> pension on reaching the age of 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the reasons the Minister for Social Welfare during the first four or five years of the scheme would say that <Col N="1847" /> no changes would be made.  Taking into account other workers in insurable employment, one could argue that the necessary contributions had not been paid.  But the scheme has now been in operation for four to five years and there is a substantial number &mdash; I do not know the exact number &mdash; who have said both to me and my colleagues on all sides of the House that because they were born at the wrong time the contributions they are paying are not going to be of much use to them.  In other words, even though they will pay contributions for, say, nine years these will not be of much use to them on the date they apply for a pension. They fear they will be told that because they had not paid contributions for ten years they cannot receive a pension.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking here about the self-employed, who said that they would be clever and not join the scheme for two to three years.  They will have to row their own boat, which is only reasonable.  I am speaking about those who joined the scheme in 1988 and now expect to receive a pension.  There are two ways in which this can be done.  First, if they pay contributions for seven years, for example, they should receive a <i>pro rata</i> pension. Obviously, they would need to pay contributions for a minimum period of perhaps five to six years.  In that way, given that half a loaf is better than no bread, they would get something in return for investing in the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is another way in which this can be done, although I understand that this would prove to be far more difficult.  We could allow a self-employed person who had paid contributions for eight years before reaching pension age to continue paying contributions for another two years when they would become eligible for a full pension.  I understand that there is a break-off point and it may not be possible to do this.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects to this matter.  Legislation was introduced to allow spouses of self-employed persons who had paid contributions for at least three years to claim a contributory <Col N="1848" /> widow's pension.  I should say that this is very good legislation but, as in the case of other legislation, we are now running into problems.  There are farm widows whose husbands just prior to their deaths paid the contributions, which were recorded in the Department but because the payments were not received before 6 April in that year, the credited contributions only stood at two.  I understand now that there are about 60 such farm widows affected.  This problem will not recur and if humanly possible I would ask the Minister to address it.  This case is similar to the examples given by Deputy Bell with regard to other widows and deserted wives whose contributions were paid but who were credited with only two contributions because of the way the contributions have to be received in the Department.</P>
    <P>I understand that a huge number of farmers are not involved in the scheme. The suggested figure is 5,000 or 6,000 farmers.  They are not involved because they do not have a taxable income.  The Minister should institute some sort of vehicle to get it across to farmers generally that it is in their best interests to be in the scheme even if they came in on the lower rate.  Many farmers on social welfare are exempted from paying PRSI and we can forget about them but some would be better off even if they were allowed to pay in at the lower rate so that they can be entitled to a pension at the end of ten years.  Another group of farmers who will never have a taxable income are just marginally over the limit for unemployment assistance.  I understand the Department will allow such people to pay contributions on a quarterly basis through a bank or post office but this is generally not known.  It would benefit the Department in revenue terms to advertise this system and it would also benefit many farmers to be included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase of £1,000 in the earnings ceiling proposed in this Bill, this is in keeping with what has happened over the last couple of years. When replying will the Minister give me some indication as to what can be done <Col N="1849" /> about PRSI for the self-employed whom I have mentioned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest until 12 midnight yesterday to the Minister.  I have been thinking about what the Minister said.  My worst fears expressed on Second Stage have been reinforced by the Minister's comments.  The information the Minister imparted about his relationship with the Irish Dental Organisation, and his hope that when the balloting is completed, we will have a new dental scheme for the spouses of insured workers and for insured workers was quite illuminating.  It clearly indicated the Minister's betrayal of PAYE workers earning in excess of £25,000 to the grubby claws of the private sector dentists.</P>
      <P>Section 7 asks the House to give the Minister permission to raise the ceiling by £1,000 so as to allow more money into the coffers.  The Minister wants sanction so that he can force people to pay more money while giving a poorer service to those who are contributing.  That proposal will not get the support of New Agenda or the Labour Party and I believe Fine Gael have reservations about it as well.</P>
      <P>If I explain in detail why this proposition should not be supported, perhaps the Minister will see his way to abandoning the increase this year anyway. The increase flies in the face of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Minister wants to ask people to pay more for a reduced service.  He signalled the beginning of the end of the social insurance system as we know it.  The Minister indicated a very fundamental change in direction away from the thrust of the excellent report of the Commission on Social Welfare. The proposition also flies in the face of virtually all the organisations and individuals who have made submissions to the commission between 1984 and 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consensus, until now, has been broadly in favour of extending access to the social insuranse system and the social welfare system.  Unfortunately, the Minister has attempted to blur the difference <Col N="1850" /> between a social welfare system and a social insurance system.  The idea was to spread social insurance to as many people as possible, including the self-employed, part-time workers, civil servants and even those working in the home.  It is interesting to note that in excess of 600 submissions had been received during 1991 by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  Means testing is sounding the death knell for the whole concept of social insurance.  The Minister will effectively reduce those who are contributing to social insurance to the status of those on social assistance.  I understand that it is the policy in the Department of Finance to go in that direction.  It flies in the face of the social consensus that anybody in employment who is contributing to the social insurance system should be entitled to some benefits.  This Bill forces people to pay more while giving them less in return.  This is a fraudulent approach to social insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fraudulent to ask people to pay a 7.75 per cent contribution under the PRSI system and to give them less than they used to have.  It is a fraudulent approach.  The Minister is turning the PRSI system into an income-generating system for the Exchequer, a second form of tax collection.  That flies in the face of the concept of a social insurance system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second objection is that means testing is reprehensible.  There is no role for it in social insurance.  It is outrageous to decide that spouses of insured workers earning in excess of £25,000 will be deprived of dental and optical benefit.  It flies in the face of a fair and honourable social insurance system.  There will be a complete loss of confidence in a backlash by workers and employers against social insurance.  Deputy Fennell said last night that people deprived of benefit would be better off taking out private insurance cover.  If the concept of means testing is established and certain limits are set, we <Col N="1852" /> can be confident that the position will gradually be eroded.  Farmers objected strongly to the land tax on that basis. The principle of means testing will be extended.  The Minister agreed last night that the prospect is that contributory old age pensioners and widows in receipt of contributory pensions will be vulnerable. The reason is that the Govenment have failed to produce the jobs required to service the social welfare and social insurance codes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attempted to conclude the long drawn out dispute between his Department and the dentists.  As part of the potential solution the Minister is prepared to sacrifice those at the upper end of the scale by taking them out of benefit and forcing them to seek private dental treatment.  That is a very dishonest approach.  I appreciate that the Department have a serious problem because of the collective difficulties of the Government in tackling unemployment.</P>

      <P>I had thought the Minister might be known henceforth as the Minister for gums.  I spoke to the Minister yesterday about the anomaly to <Col N="1853" /> which I refer.  A constituent of mine who was in full-time employment decided to do a FÁS course.  She contacted the Department of Social Welfare and was told she could go on the course without affecting her PRSI contributions and entitlements.  She completed the course and claimed unemployment benefit.  That claim was accepted for about three weeks, but she was then told that while on the course she was paying J1 contributions instead of A1 contributions. She would have stayed in fulltime employment but for advice given by persons in the Department of Social Welfare and information in a departmental leaflet.  She now finds she is not entitled to unemployment benefit and will have to apply for unemployment assistance, which is means tested.  That is a major anomaly.</P>

      <P>I am nearly finished my contribution.  The Minister's officials should correct this anomaly.  It is unacceptable <Col N="1854" /> that people, because they were given incorrect advice, should find themselves worse off than they were heretofore. That is not what the social welfare code is about.  I would like to refer to the point raised by my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, regarding PRSI contributions of the self-employed who are not entitled to benefit.  This is a major anomaly which should be corrected.  It is very unfair that a person who pays PRSI for six years receives no benefit.  Deputy Connaughton's amendment was ruled out of order but perhaps the Minister could find some way of resolving the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I presented the Minister with a golden opportunity to strike out flamboyantly in favour of equality. I am sure the Minister will take action in this area.  I would ask him whether he considered this matter since last night because he did not give a definitive reply to my question at that stage.  I had referred to PRSI for the self-employed and the procedure of means testing within the social welfare system. At present, if one spouse is not earning half the other spouse's income is taken into account when means testing for benefit. For example, if one spouse earns £5,000 the other spouse is reckoned to have an income of £2,500.  Would the Minister agree that that principle should also apply, on an optional basis at least, to PRSI payments?  For example, in the case of a self-employed person whose spouse is not working would the Minister agree that half the income of the employed person be reckoned as income for the other spouse for PRSI purposes? It seems that that would be equitable and, in the sense that many women are dependants, that system would provide security for them.  The Minister did not have an opportunity to respond to my suggestion last night.  I would like to know whether there would be serious difficulties with it or whether there would be a need for legislation in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in proposing to increase the ceiling for PRSI is <Col N="1855" /> at the same time proposing to decrease the benefits.  I did not have an opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  He has a difficult job with this Social Welfare Bill.  In many cases at present Ministers do not have the opportunity of speaking to people who depend on social welfare.  Any legislation that proposes to increase the ceiling of PRSI and decrease the benefits right across the board represents a very serious assault on the principle of insurance based social welfare.  At present people pay 7.75 per cent of their income towards PRSI and employers pay 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the period of disqualification for unemployment benefit. The legislation provides that a person who becomes unemployed and receives a certain amount of redundancy will not be paid benefit for nine weeks. A person who commits an offence under this law could be disallowed payment for three months.  That person may go to the local community welfare officer and if the officer so decides the person will be paid. However, in two out of three cases the community welfare officer will refuse payment.  One would think they were paying the money out of their own pockets. I have no hesitation in saying that the manner in which these officers treat people is appalling.  People who have paid PRSI contributions should not be subject to that kind of treatment when they lose their jobs.  The Minister should reconsider the measure which proposes that a person who receives a certain amount of redundancy will be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for nine weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of disallowing dental and optical benefit for people earning £25,000 is unacceptable.  In a couple of years time many people will be earning that amount, for example, people on shift work and those who work long hours.  Those people pay almost one-third of their total income in PRSI contributions.  When tax is taken into account the take home pay is very small.  These people are also deprived in that tax and PRSI is not deductable when <Col N="1856" /> assessing for eligibility for higher education grants and health services.  I concur wholeheartedly with my colleague, Deputy Byrne, in that the purpose of this measure is to placate the Dental Association.  The Dental Association have defied this Government in the past three years, as have many other professions. Another section of the medical profession is demanding £17 million.  All that the Government can do, however, is to cut the rates of social welfare payments to those who are honestly making their contribution to the State.  A worker's earnings are an open book while the medical profession may account for a half of their income and have the other half paid in cash.  The Minister would be well aware of that fact.  Today the secretary of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said that his people received £60,000.  That may be, but the consultants are taking another £60,000 in the hand for which there is no accounting.  The same position applies to members of the Dental Association.  It is scandalous that until now legislation passed by this House has not been implemented because members of the Dental Association have refused to treat the spouses of insured persons.  I admit that some dentists do treat the spouses of insured persons; the figure given is about one dentist in five.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he said that it was further announced at the publication of the 1992 Estimates in December last that the Government had decided that responsibility for short term sickness payments should be transferred to employers through a scheme of statutory sick pay and that in order for employers to participate in this kind of arrangement the rates of benefit require to be simplified and streamlined.  He went on to say that the continuation of pay-related benefit would not be possible in the context of statutory sick pay.  What the Minister means is that workers will continue to pay 7.5 per cent of their earnings but that the rules relating to sick pay and disability benefit will be changed so that the employer will now be responsible.  At the moment many employers send their employees to medical advisers they <Col N="1857" /> appoint and consequently workers are very often forced back to work before they are fit to return to work.  There is a constant row between sections of the medical profession in that regard.  Section 35 provides that those in receipt of occupational injury benefit will receive a lesser amount.  The occupational injury benefit previously provided for the payment of up to £65 a week.</P>
    <P>Substantially, the Bill is a measure designed to increase the limit for contributions and reduce the amount payable and lessen the conditions for payment.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Congress of Trade Unions.  The workers of this country do not have the strongest lobby.  They certainly do not have a lobby of the strength of the big farming organisations or the medical profession, who are the people the Government are bending over backwards to help.  If the Congress of Trade Unions were serious in representing the workers then this Bill would not pass through the House.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill.</P>

It is rather a pity that we did not get the support we should have got from other Deputies.  Being a Tadhg, an dá thaobh can often be a difficult position to hold.  I wish to take the debate back to the issue of PRSI for the self-employed. In the House last year there was a great discussion on that issue and as a result of suggestions that were made I wrote out letters telling people that the very kind Minister would consider the issue leniently.  This year I do not want to have to change the wording of my letter &mdash; I shall stay with &ldquo;the kind Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people concerned were brought into a scheme but after a while they were told that they could not qualify for the scheme.  I cannot understand the illogic that could have led to that position.  I should like the Minister to tell me how many people have been caught in that they will not have made payment for ten <Col N="1858" /> years.  I should also like to know the approximate cost of a <i>pro rata</i> payment. Surely there would not be a very large number of people involved.  Last year the Minister was very complimentary when I made a proposal for a <i>pro rata</i> payment, but then he disappeared.  Like the swallows that go back to Capistrano, he will not come back.</P>

      <P>Several Deputies made speeches that would be more appropriate to a Second Stage debate, ranging over various points.  I do not intend to deal with the treatment benefit issue again because I dealt with that last night.  I shall deal with some of the other matters raised after the discussion on section 7.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides for an increase in the ceiling up to which PRSI contributions are payable by both employees and employers.  The new ceiling for employees will be £19,000 and the new ceiling for employers will be £20,300 and they will take effect from 6 April 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the debate on the Bill mention has been made of an attack on the social insurance system.  I well remember the debate that took place back in the 1970s, before I was a Member of the Dáil, about a pay-related social insurance system.  Deputy Michael Bell spoke about a green fields situation.  As I said earlier in the debate, I know that if we were to again set up a system for either tax or social insurance the systems evolved would not be so complicated and diverse.  In explaining that point I used the analogy of the Frank Kelly tape.  The concept outlined by Deputy Bell was in line with the trade union movement <Col N="1859" /> thinking of the 1970s.  He outlined the concept in a much better way than I would be able to.  In the purest form of that concept there would be no floors and no ceilings and everyone would be included.</P>
    <P>Like many things in Irish life, the original idea was very good.  Due to financial constraints, successive Governments of different make-ups made changes.  It is the case with many schemes &mdash; and not only social welfare schemes, I think of income tax schemes and also agricultural schemes &mdash; that when the changes are made most people forget the original intention of the scheme.  I have often said that most people have forgotten the economic theory that backs up the idea of a current budget deficit.  The underlying economic theory behind the current budget deficit is quite sensible, but the budget deficit has now become part of the system and its existence is accepted.</P>
    <P>I can call to mind many schemes administered by many Departments of State, the original purpose of which has been totally lost.  What has happened has been that those schemes have developed a type of organic growth within themselves which has continued; people keep changing and tinkering with their provisions. As regards the purest form of the concept, Deputy Bell is absolutely correct.  I well remember when Deputy Bell was first elected to this House he spoke against that proposal and got himself into hot water.  I had not been very long a Member of this House when I got myself into hot water with my party although I was probably a Member somewhat longer than Deputy Bell; I think I sustained a clean record for approximately two years, whereas he did not even reach that point.  He took a stand on that matter.  I can understand the passionate manner in which he spoke last evening on a subject very dear to his heart.  He also said something very sensibly, that he is prepared to accept the logic of the purest concept of the system, as did Deputy Byrne last evening, that everybody should be included in the system, eligible for everything regardless <Col N="1860" /> of one's income.  If at present people advocated that course I am sure we would have employers and some of the unions up in arms because it has now become part of the tax system.</P>
    <P>While contending we may have bastardised the system somewhat, the Deputy went further and asked, since the system has been changed so drastically, would it not be better to revert to a straight system.  While that may not be the phrase he used I understand the implications: let us forget about the total, merely regard it as a contribution going into the Exchequer, resulting in a straight system.  I agree with him that over the years the original idea of a pay-related social insurance system, as advocated in its purest form, has been changed drastically.</P>
    <P>At various stages in the debate Deputy Byrne has attacked me, contending that I am doing away with the concept of the social insurance system and so on.  This morning he inferred that the Commission on Social Welfare did not advocate this. For the benefit of the Deputy I quote as follows from page 274 of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare what they say about social insurance:</P>
    <P>We accept that social insurance can be validly perceived as a form of insurance.  But it is inappropriate, in our view, that social insurance be directly compared with private, commercial insurance.</P>
    <P>Further on in the same paragraph they had this to say:</P>
    <P>Social insurance, as a form of collective, social provision and as an expression of social solidarity, is different in principle and in practice to private insurance.  There is no contradiction, in our view, between the assertion of an insurance dimension and the recognition that social insurance contributions in their incidence and distributive effects may also be evaluated as a form of taxation.</P>
    <P>Backing up the point made by Deputies Bell, Byrne and others, the commission recommended in that chapter:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> PRSI should be extended to all employee income, without a ceiling.</P>
    <P>I dealt <i>ad infinitum</i> over the past two days with the social dimension and I do not intend to repeat those arguments or cover the same ground.</P>
    <P>If, in the purest form of the concept, every person in the county was to be included in the system, simultaneously, whether we like it or not, we must also acknowledge that it is now regarded as forming part of the negotiations that take place between the Government, social partners, unions and employers.  Indeed it is also taken into account within the context of tax reforms and/or reductions. This would mean that everybody without exception, including civil servants, would have to be included, which would please some and displease others.  It is not possible for me, within the provisions of this Bill, to do anything about it.  As Deputy Bell said, it is a matter for another day, one which should be the subject of collective thinking on the part of everybody interested.  I do accept what he has said, that we have deviated totally from the original principle, as has been the case with many other schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton raised a subject very dear to my heart, that of self-employed PRSI contributions.  In the short time I have been in this Department, a few weeks ago in fact, I asked some of my officials to examine anomalies that arise with regard to certain categories of PRSI.  I would have dealt with them in my former capacity over the past couple of years.  I have in mind not merely those anomalies to which the Deputy referred but those obtaining that contain no logic at all and which were probably never intended.  Take the example of a person, say, aged 64 on 6 April 1988 who, having paid contributions for the two years thought he would qualify, but discovers he does not and would be unable to recoup those contributions.  That was one case brought to my attention quite recently.  That person had been in insurable employment for a very brief period &mdash; I think it must have been a holiday-type job he <Col N="1862" /> had; he was not a client of mine &mdash; but pre-1944 he had clocked up about ten contributions as a student and because of the manner in which the legislation is framed, he is not eligible for the pension for which he had thought he would be eligible.  Neither will he be reimbursed the contributions he had paid.  I should say there are many administrative anomalies even in the collection of PRSI contributions in the case of people whose income falls below the tax threshold, those without a tax liability, in that despite one's best efforts the Revenue Commissioners will not deduct such contributions. There are many other anomalies obtaining.  I hope to have all of the anomalies that have come to light eliminated over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking in the House at the time of the introduction of self-employed PRSI contributions.  I think it was my party who were in Government at the time but I know I did question the actuarial costs of that scheme while recognising that it was a tremendous idea.  As the Deputy and I well know, there are hundreds of self-employed people engaged in very small businesses, be it carpentry, building, shopkeeping or whatever who, on reaching the age of, say, 68, 69 or 70 must continue to work because they know they will not get benefit. It is an excellent idea, in principle, of which I was very much in favour at the time while entering the caveat that I thought the costs had been under-estimated. We shall have to ascertain what they will be in years to come.</P>
    <P>The idea of <i>pro rata</i> pensions has been proposed by the IFA over a number of years.  In theory that is a proposal I would favour.  I remember speaking at a conference on this subject when it was first mooted, contending that if one had been contributing over seven or eight years one should reap some percentage of pension. I have examined that matter in recent weeks and find there are other implications involved.  I know that my predecessor, Deputy Woods, spoke about this as well, saying he would like to travel down that road.  While we would like to travel that road, I would have to <Col N="1863" /> point out that there are cost implications. There are implications also in that over a period of time people in insured employment have been granted <i>pro rata</i> pensions if they do not have the requisite contributions.  Remember we must think of people in insured employment as well, because their average is calculated over a longer period.  We would not want to create inequity by making, say, a farmer or self-employed individual, who may have contributed over seven years, eligible, while making ineligible another person who may have worked on and off over a period of 30 years and who might not have the average contributions.  Over the past few years we have gone some of the way in regard to <i>pro rata</i> pensions. But I am aware there are various problems to be teased out.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Deputy Byrne said about the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and everything else. However, he made one point I would have to correct.  I referred last night to the fact of pensioners being vulnerable and so on.  Again there was a big song and dance about the dentists.  I shall not refer to them again today.  I will just correct the general point.  It is my belief that if we do not control expenditure in these areas people at the worst end of the scales will become the victims, in that in years to come the State would be unable to support the old and the sick.  We will have to maintain some control over public expenditure.  I have said this over many years as a back bencher, indeed in speeches nationwide over a period of ten years.  I might add that, since being appointed Minister, I have not changed my views on it.  Indeed I am now more convinced than ever.  I referred to the demographic statistics demonstrating that, over the past two years, our population have been highly dependent on social welfare benefits.  I will not go into that aspect now.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, Deputy Gerry Reynolds raised a question in regard to FÁS courses.  A few weeks ago I read an article in a newspaper about FÁS courses.  I have asked my officials to look at the present position in regard to these courses.  If Deputy Reynolds gives me the details of the case to which he referred yesterday I will pass them on to my officials for further investigation.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, an unemployed person who goes on a FAS course gets a class A credit which maintains their entitlement while a person who leaves their employment to go on a FÁS course, as in the case to which Deputy Reynolds referred, gets a class J contribution only and no credits.  In other words, the contribution class depends on whether a person was previously unemployed or employed.  This appears to be an anomaly in the system.  As I said, I asked my officials to examine the matter two weeks ago as a result of an article in a newspaper. The point has been made that there is no incentive for people to go on FÁS courses.  As I said, the matter is being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cotter, who has left the House, made an interesting point last night.  The household review group have been considering how households should be treated.  This issue was raised at Question Time some weeks ago.  My Department have been looking at this area, which is tied into the question of equality and individual payments for members of the same household.  Such a system may have major ramifications but it is the way European social legislation is going at present.  The Department of Social Welfare have examined this matter in great detail.  I want to point out that there is a downside to the principle outlined by Deputy Cotter for people who earn, say, £30,000.  Deputy Monica Barnes made a similar point last night.  Under the new ceilings, a man earning £30,000 will stop paying contributions after £19,000.  If we were to do as Deputy Cotter has proposed and divide this man's income between him and his spouse, which would give them £15,000 each, that household would be worse off &mdash; both of them would <Col N="1865" /> have to pay their PRSI contributions.  If we were to follow the pure concept of social insurance, to which Deputy Bell referred earlier, this problem would not arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock raised matters which are dealt with in later sections of the Bill. He more or less made a Second Stage speech.  The point was made that I do not have adequate experience of dealing with people on social welfare.  I accept that the unemployment situation in Cork is bad but I can assure the Deputy that it is no worse than the situation in County Kildare, a county which has a very large population and which had a great industrial base going back as far as the thirties and forties.  The unemployment rate in certain parts of County Kildare is as high as the rate in parts of Dublin, Cork and other areas.  Whatever else I have done, I have never lived in an ivory tower.  Most of the people I have met as a politician over the past 15 years have been on social welfare.  Like most Deputies, more than half of the representations I receive are from social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to community welfare officers.  In large Departments such as the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare occasionally people may not be as tactful as they should be and they may do things differently.  From my dealings with community welfare officers in County Kildare I have to say that these people are doing the best job possible in very difficult circumstances. I do not think it is fair to criticise community welfare officers as a body and say they are mean, stingy and do not help recipients.  Community welfare officers administer the functions given to them by the Department and the Minister of the day and they implement policy.  On occasion some community welfare officers may not treat people in the proper fashion but I do not think it is fair to criticise them as a body.</P>
    <P>I dealt earlier with points raised by Deputy John Browne in regard to the PRSI contributions of the self-employed. I hope to be able to eliminate some of the problems in this area.  I do not know whether I will have enough money to go <Col N="1866" /> down the logical road of introducing <i>pro rata</i> pensions.  I certainly will not be in a position to do that this year.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the House that what we are dealing with here is a proposed increase of £1,000 in respect of the ceiling up to which PRSI contributions are payable by employers and employees.  A following section deals specifically with the self-employed.  Perhaps we can now agree that more than enough time has been given to section 7 so that I can put the question.</P>

      <P>It is hard to disagree with your suggestion, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as this section has got a good airing.  This is a very important provision.  I am heartened by some of the points made by the Minister in so far as pensions for the self-employed are concerned. I wish to put two proposals to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to pay particular attention to the point I made in regard to farm widows.  The Minister did not refer to this point when he was speaking. The Minister cannot afford to delay too long before looking at the possibility of allowing people to buy into the scheme in some way.  If he delays too long the problem will have solved itself. Obviously this possibility has to be looked at in the very near future.  Is there any way people can buy into the scheme? For example, they could be asked to pay an extra contribution for the years they are not allowed in because of age.  As I said, this section has got a good airing and I have no objection to moving on to the next section.</P>

With modern technology there is no reason this should not happen.  I had <Col N="1874" /> hoped that the Minister would say that such a provision would be included in the Bill as a matter of urgency to ensure that it would be in place in the year 1992 and that each person who applies to the Department of Social Welfare for benefit would receive a full reply indicating clearly the reasons he or she was refused.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 gives a bit of good news so I might as well get some credit for good news as well as for bad news.  The section provides for the introduction of an alternative method for satisfying the yearly average test for determining entitlement to the maximum rate of old age contributory pension. Section 11 provides a similar test for the purposes of retirement pension.</P>
      <P>Under existing provisions, in order to qualify for the maximum rate of old age contributory pension, the claimant is required to have a yearly average of 48 paid or credited contributions over the period from 1953 or the date of entry into insurance, if later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching age 66.  Reduced rates of pension are payable where the yearly average is 20 or more and less than 48.</P>
      <P>The practical application of the yearly average test can often result in a situation whereby individuals with a similar number of contributions, including credited contributions, can end up with different entitlements depending on whether insurable employment occurred early or late in their careers.  The alternative period proposed in section 10 is the period of insurance from 6 April 1979, the date of introduction of the PRSI system, to the last complete contribution year before the claimant reaches pensionable age.  This alternative test will be applied only for the purpose of determining a person's entitlement to the maximum rate of contributory pension. If the claimant fails to qualify for the maximum rate of pension based on contributions paid or credited since 1979, entitlement to pension will be determined as at present on the basis of the yearly average from 1953 or the date of entry into insurance if later.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 10 provides for the necessary amendments to section 78 (3) of the 1981 Act to enable this alternative yearly average test to be introduced. Subsection (2) provides for consequential amendments to section 79 of the 1981 Act arising from the introduction of the alternative test.  Subsection (3) provides that the new alternative test will only apply in the case of claimants who reach pension age on or after 6 April 1992.  This alternative yearly average test will speed up claims.  It should allow some people to qualify who could not have done so previously.  It will remove certain anomalies.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is of greater benefit now than when previously framed.  I cannot say that I understand the intricacies of <i>pro rata</i> pensions despite frequent dealings with the matter.  Widows in receipt of contributory pensions were able to draw on <Col N="1877" /> contributions made prior to 1953 but old age pensioners in the same category could not do so.  This is not a political point.  Can the Minister explain why contributions made prior to 1953 are generally not acceptable?  What is the technical reason?  Prior to 1953 many people in rural areas such as my constituency worked for bodies such as local authorities, the Office of Public Works or the Land Commission, but it is often very difficult to recover the record of that employment.  The computer printout system in Sligo is working quite efficiently but it does not seem capable of catering for people who are able to prove by some means that they were in employment prior to 1953.  It is very unfair that stamps paid by such people prior to that date should be totally disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had tabled an amendment, which was ruled out of order, concerning the introduction of a single means test to cover a variety of schemes.  I was pleasantly surprised at the Minister's reaction in this regard yesterday.  Many claimants have to deal with five or six different agencies. The Minister indicated that he would be favourably disposed towards the idea of a single means test, and obviously this would have been introduced long ago but for the difficulties involved.  I am not asking for a common means of assessment in respect of third level education grants and medical cards.  Perhaps it could be introduced first within the Department of Social Welfare.  In New Zealand people are issued with a card which they are obliged to retain.  The system appears to be somewhat similar to the issuing of an RSI number to a young person over 16 years of age.  The means test might in future be related to that number.  The Minister stated previously that a single means test would mean that some people would be worse off.  In order to keep everybody happy we would have to bring all payments to the same level.  Have the Department carried out any research into the cost of such a system?  Is it possible to average out the various schemes and payments? The desirability of a single means test has long been talked about, but every Social <Col N="1878" /> Welfare Bill seems to make the position worse.</P>

      <P>Groups of well meaning peoole in the community are continually asking why one assessment cannot be used to establish eligibility in respect of various types of benefit.  I should appreciate an outline of the Minister's thinking in this regard and an indication as to when the Department will begin to move in this direction.  Is the Minister disposed to look sympathetically on cases where there is a gap in the employment record?  Many women were forced to leave their jobs on marriage. If they apply now for a contributory old age pension those years are disregarded.  That is a disadvantage to them.  I could give various examples but I do not propose to delay the House.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether the single means test comes under this section.  I was deprived by the previous occupant of the Chair from asking the Minister a question and I will seek the opportunity to do so now while the Chair is otherwise occupied.  Points have been raised about the question of a single means test.  As the Minister admitted in the last few days, the social welfare system is very complex and complicated and needs to be simplified.  The Minister also indicated that he intends to introduce a consolidation Bill.  The report on the treatment of households is extremely complex.  As I have said on numerous occasions, the Minister is taking a different approach with this Bill, particularly as regards means testing insured workers. Given that the Commission on Social Welfare reported in 1985 and that changes are taking place in Europe in equality of treatment and so on, would the Minister not agree that it is important that that commission be reconvened with a view to updating social welfare legislation? European law which impinges on our social welfare code is changing all <Col N="1879" /> the time and, therefore, I would ask the Minister to address this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>One welcomes any further improvement in allowing for pensions. This is an area in which I was very involved in the couple of years when the electorate gave me a short Sabbatical from this House.  During that time I did some work in an MEP's office.  The then Minister for Social Welfare agreed at the time that there was a huge anomaly in the qualification conditions for old age pensions.  I am concerned that a number of people will be left outside this system. Many people, particularly women, who made contributions up to 1967 and then went out of the workforce to become full-time housewives or carers found when they applied for their pension that they did not have the necessary contributions. How much thought has the Minister given to reducing the minimum number of contributions which at present is 20? Even with the new system of calculation, a person must have a minimum of 20 contributions in order to qualify for the minimum pension.  The minimum contribution could be reduced substantially. It may not result in a great weekly pension but it would allow people to qualify for some of the other benefits that are available to old age pensioners, such as the electricity allowance, television licence, butter vouchers and so on. People who pay a certain number of contributions should get something in return. At present a person with only 15 contributions will get no pension.  I would ask the Minister to do something about the present cruel cut-off point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand what the Minister is proposing in this legislation. For example, if a person going back to work in, say, 1979, has three or six contributions from a summer job in earlier years, would those contributions be taken into account when that person applies for an old age pension.  The Department calculate the person's pension entitlement on the basis that the person has been paying contributions since those early years.  Many women in <Col N="1880" /> particular have been penalised in this way for having worked for a few years in their youth, and the Minister should correct that anomaly.  There is only a very small number of people involved and eventually when these people die &mdash; this sounds very cruel &mdash; we will not have this problem because the workforce who started paying compulsory PRSI in the seventies will be the next set of pensioners.</P>
    <P>I pay particular credit to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods, who started the ball rolling in this area, although not without pressure from Europe.  I dealt with hundreds of petitions to the European Parliament about this anomaly. Eventually about 2,300 or 3,000 pensioners who heretofore had been refused a pension received it in the last two years. However, there is still a small number who do not receive it.  I would ask the Minister to consider the cost involved in bringing those people into the system. I do not believe it would be very high because, as I have said, there is only a very small number of people involved.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate the advantage to a person of having even an average of five contributions.  That person might receive a pension of only £1.50 but they would qualify for the other benefits that would make life a little easier.  There is an element of justice here.  There may be only 2,000 people involved in this area and, therefore, only a very small payment would have to be made.  Perhaps the Minister would come back on Report Stage and stamp his mark on this area of social welfare to ensure that this anomaly is corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been pressing for this matter since I came into this House. There is an anomaly in this area and, as Deputy Owen has said, only a small number of people are affected, of whom I am one.  As I explained last night, many Deputies and Senators are equally affected.  I have worked for 40 years, for nine of which I have worked in this House.  For over 30 years I paid the full PRSI contribution in industry services and in the trade union movement. However, the nine years I have worked <Col N="1881" /> here will not be taken into account when I qualify for the old age pension.  Because I was elected as a public representative my pension entitlement will be reduced. This is the reason I say that Members of both Houses should get credit for their absence from their employment.  The average should be based on the 30 years that the person, the Senator or the TD actually worked in industry.  The same situation would apply to any employee of the Houses of the Oireachtas or any other worker who had worked for 30 or 40 years.  The operation of averages only started in 1953 and therefore someone who had worked 50 years might still not qualify for a full pension because some of those years would have been before 1953 and they would be disregarded altogether. However, the years that the worker did not work at the other end of the scale are brought in.  You, Sir, would realise that, because you are someone caught in that position along with many hundreds of workers.  Because it is a minority who are involved the matter is being overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The anomaly could be corrected provided two simple provisions were included in the regulations.  One provision is that only the years of work should be included.  In other words, if someone worked 30 years then the pension should not be divided by 40 but by 30.  To say the least, it is penal to add on another ten or 15 years to someone's service and then divide the total by 40 or 45 rather than 35.  After all, someone with 40 years' service has worked for two-thirds of a lifetime and should not be penalised by adding on ten years and thus bringing the total down.  Effectively someone else could qualify for a full pension with half of that service if the service were at the other end of the scale.  Those who are losing are the people who worked before 1953 but did not work between the date of their retirement and the age of 66.  For example, someone who worked from the age of 14 or 16 until reaching the age of 56 would be penalised for the ten years before the age of 66 that he or she did not work.  If the Minister corrected that anomaly in the regulations <Col N="1882" /> he would do justice not only to many members of the public but also to his own colleagues in the Seanad and the Dáil.  I have tried to point out this anomaly over and over again since I came into the House.</P>
    <P>I now wish to speak about the shifting of the goal posts to 1979.  There are not many workers concerned in this regard. I am sure that Deputy Owen is correct in that regard and that the Minister would have quantifying figures.  The worker concerned should have the choice to opt for whichever period was the better.  If I remember correctly, the Minister referred to that in his speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister said he had decided to build that provision into the regulations.  The number of years for qualification for the maximum pension rate should not be more than 30. The Defence Forces and the Garda provide for entitlement to a full pension after 21 years.  Why should an industrial worker have to work for 40 years to earn the right to a basic old age pension?  The maximum level should be brought down to realistic qualifying figures.  Any man or woman who has worked 30 years has worked long enough to quality for an old age pension.  If it were two-thirds of take home pay that pensioners were getting then I would agree that the level could be set at 40 years, but that is not the case.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to especially note the existence of that anomaly, which particularly affects his colleagues in the House.  I know that the Minister realises the problem.  Members of the public from the professions and elsewhere are not encouraged to come into the Dáil to represent the people of Ireland when they realise that they will be penalised for so doing.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I also wish to speak in support.  We should ensure that justice is done in social welfare. It must be unjust that a person who has stamps going back 35 years will average out with less than the required <Col N="1883" /> 20 years of service because of a gap in between the 35 years of service whereas, as has been discussed earlier today, someone with ten years' contributions could qualify for a full pension.  There is something wrong that someone with 20 years of stamps might not be credited with 20 years' service when the average was worked out.  That does not give cothrom na féine to those who started work before 1953. If someone did not bother to pay stamps until 1988 but then paid ten years' contributions he or she would be entitled to a full pension while people who had paid stamps all along could finish up with an incorrect average. That position cannot stand up in justice.</P>

      <P>The comments that have been made are sensible.  Before I became Minister I came across examples of these anomalies in my constituency work.  I remember serving on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges with Deputy Michael Bell when he first came to the House and I remember his pressing the point that he should be able to become a voluntary contributor to the PRSI scheme in order to maintain his contributions record.  Back then the Deputy put forward the exact same reasons he has enunciated today.  I have not served on that committee for a long time but I should have imagined that the problem would have been sorted out.</P>

      <P>In relation to the issue of gaps in insurance records, people can qualify for credit of contributions, but an <Col N="1884" /> anomaly does still exist in relation to TDs and Senators.  For the life of me I do not know why some adjustment has not been made.  The Deputy has been pressing the issue since 1983 so I should have thought that it would have been resolved by now.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have to study the matter further in order to determine the cost implications.  I would not like the public to get the impression that in the House we looked after ourselves only.</P>
      <P>The rules relating to date of entry into the insurance scheme are certainly anomalous. As Deputy Owen and others pointed out, someone who was contributing stamps 30 years ago might not qualify whereas someone who began contributions 15 years ago could qualify. There is no point in my trying to defend something that is not just.</P>
      <P>During my brief time in the Department I have examined the problem. Parliamentary questions have been tabled in this regard.  I went into the issue in some detail for Deputy Paul Connaughton on 12 March.  I had previously spent time looking up the regulations, because I would have been in no way an expert on them before coming into the Department. I have discovered many anomalies.</P>
      <P>I hope that the matter will be addressed in the final report of the Pensions Board, which is due shortly.  We are dealing with people who moved out of the insurance scheme and then went back into it.  In the past three years there have been changes with regard to mixed insurance records that benefit the client.  It is hoped that the Pensions Board will recommend some of the changes that have been spoken about in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that the Pensions Board will recommend <i>pro rata</i> pensions which would leave some people worse off.  At the moment someone who has contributions for 40 years or more receives the maximum allowance.  A simple example taken from the book I have before me, which refers to the 1991 levels before changes were made, shows a person on the maximum allowance to be <Col N="1885" /> in receipt of £64.  If that persons's friend had contributions just over the limit, between 20 and 23 years of contributions, he or she would receive £59.  The difference between the rates of pension is about £5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be only one rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate the report of the National Pensions Board, but if they recommend total pro rata they might well recommend that a person at the maximum level would get the maximum pension.  There is that danger which I should point out at this stage.  If one accepts the principle of <i>pro rata</i> pensions in total&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Hold the top and let the others catch up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see what Deputy Bell is recommending there but that would have cost implications as well.  If <i>pro rata</i> is to be the principle throughout, which anyone would accept &mdash; including the self-employed and the PRSI contributor-there would be the downswing as well.  However, I do not want to anticipate the contents of the report of the National Pensions Baord.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also made the point about the gaps that occur in insurance contribution records.  Those gaps should not be as frequent henceforth, as I remember when I first started to work I stamped a card.  I was a student in 1968 and stamped a card.  Then I became an articled clerk and at that stage clerks were not paid very much &mdash; indeed, they are still not paid very much &mdash; and paid for the ordinary stamp.  When I qualified in 1973 my income was too high and I came out of the system but later returned to it.  This should not happen henceforth.  Even if people are self-employed they should come into the self-employed category covered within the system.  In any event, this will resolve itself over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of people who, just because they worked and stamped a card, say 30 years ago, now find that their average <Col N="1886" /> contributions do not render them eligible. We hope to go into all the ramifications of the system because the injustices that have been pointed out by Members are obvious to everybody, including my predecessors, whoever they may have been.  But there are cost implications which successive Ministers for Social Welfare have been unable to resolve in the sense of their budgets not being sufficiently large.  Nonetheless, we have travelled some distance in the resolution of these problems.  Hopefully, armed with the report of the National Pensions Board, we will be able to do somewhat more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell raised another interesting point about TDs obtaining maximum pension at a different level from others; he mentioned other professions as well. There was a lot of commonsense in what he said.  While I and all my predecessors have readily appreciated the inherent justice in what he and others have said, cost has been the constraining factor. However, we have been endeavouring to resolve those matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne asked whether it was our intention to reconvene the Commission on Social Welfare.  I do not intend thinking along those lines even within this year until I have come to grips with the job.  Perhaps in years to come another Government may decide to reconvene such a commission.  It is not my intention to have a new commission. There are many aspects of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare which warrant further examination and many of their suggestions could be adopted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton raised the question of means testing.  I did give a commitment that we in the Department would endeavour to introduce some uniformity across the board in our means testing.  That is the commitment I gave which necessitates a fairly onerous task, leaving other Departments to look after themselves.  Last evening we had a discussion about the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  I also mentioned another matter close to my heart, that of the unique identifier RSI, identify number or whatever.  Hopefully we will <Col N="1887" /> get all those problems ironed out in the future.  With modern technology it should be possible in future years to call up, say, Deputy Paul Connaughton, number so-and-so, ascertaining that he is participating in a FÁS course, is paying a differential rent, holds a medical card or whatever.  That would render matters simpler administratively, more effective and efficient.  In addition, its great advantage would be that Government Departments could target their resources more easily as it would be much easier to identify areas of greatest need.  Therefore, vis-a-vis social insurance, it should be possible to look up a person's record and be able to ascertain, say, that he worked from 1960-72; he then became ill for four years, then returned to work and later he became unemployed.  He is now aged such-and-such; his basic qualification was such-and-such.  I appreciate that that may be perceived to be a kind of big brother, liberal-type approach.  But there would be great advantages in having the overall system simpler.  I am not saying that people will not be able to point to disadvantages in this idea but I am convinced the advantages would considerably outweigh the disadvantages. I can confirm for the benefit of Deputy Connaughton that we will endeavour to streamline our system, ensuring some uniformity, so that we will end up with a universal system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton asked why contributions paid prior to 1953 are not acceptable &mdash; exactly the same question he asked me by way of parliamentary question on 12 March.  As I explained then, the old age contributory pension scheme was not introduced until 1961.  In order to qualify for that pension a person must have entered the insurance system before the age of 56, have at least three years' paid contributions and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered on his or her behalf since 1953 or the date of entry into insurance, if later.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension but, as the House will know, had those rules <Col N="1888" /> been applied nobody would have qualified for the old age pension.  Therefore, in 1961, a concession was made to enable persons reaching retirement age at that time to qualify immediately for contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account. Those transitional arrangments operated until 1973 from which date contributions paid pior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of satisfying the yearly average test but are still reckonable for the other two conditions.</P>
    <P>With regard to all the questions Members raised about pensions, average contributions and so on, I should say my Department have been endeavouring to remove the unfavourable chinks or aspects so that these problems will not recur.  Section 10 provides for the introduction of an alternative &ldquo;yearly average&rdquo; test to that if one has a full insurance record since 1979 - rather than revert to the old average - we will take it that one qualifies for the maximum rate of old age contributory pension.  But, if that did not work out for a person, the other system would operate as well.  Therefore, it will be seen to be fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister will be aware that mutual constituents of ours are affected by the anomaly obtaining there.  For example, a person who might have entered employment say, in 1948 and remained in insurable employment until approximately 1963 or 1964, could then have become self-employed, requiring no contributions up to 1988, at which time he may have recommended contributing and continued to pay contributions. Unless such a person qualifies under the Minister's amendment introduced this year, by way of pension age in 1992, he or she will still fall that bit short. What most annoys such people - and I am sure this concerns the Minister also - is the fact that probably they will have considerably more contributions than many others who qualify for a pension.  In many cases probably they will not qualify for a non-contributory old age pension But their main contributions over many <Col N="1889" /> years are not now being taken into account.</P>
      <P>There was, first a change effected in 1961 to accommodate people who needed to qualify for pension at that stage and this was changed again in the early seventies.  In view of the 1988 Act would it not now be appropriate to take their circumstances into account, not necessarily taking all of their contributions into account, but an average of their contributions, say, prior to 1953, take an average of their contributions over a number of years, in an effort to raise their contribution levels to the 20 required in order to qualify for minimum pension? That would be only fair since they made their contributions within the law.  In fact, the sole reason they now fail to qualify is that they may have been, say, out of the country, self-employed, or not in a post which necessitated their paying such contributions.</P>
      <P>People who do not have ten years' contributions cannot qualify for a pension. I fully realise that people cannot expect to get their entire contributions back by way of benefits &mdash; this scheme is there to serve a particular purpose.</P>
      <P>I put down a parliamentary question seeking information on the number of people caught in this trap.  The reply given to me was that this information was not available but I believe it would be possible to get it.  Like me, the Minister has had dealings with a number of these people.  I do not think a great number of people are caught in this trap.  These people feel especially hard done by when their neighbours who have two, three or four contributions more can qualify for a pension while they cannot qualify because they are one contribution short. I ask the Minister to identify the number of people caught in this position.  When this is done it may be possible to identify the cost.  It should be possible to either reduce the average requirement or take into account on a once-off basis a person's contributions prior to 1953.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is a fairly simple solution to this problem.  If the system is kept simple people will not get confused.  All the Minister has to do is say that the minimum requirement for a full pension is X number of years.  For example, a person could have to work for 30 years in a 40 year period.  A person who makes A1 contributions for 30 years and J1 contributions for ten years will not have their J1 contributions taken into account for qualification purposes; the lower rate of contribution does not qualify for pension purposes.  A person who pays stamps for 25 or 30 years &mdash; it should be a reasonable length of time &mdash; should be able to qualify for a full pension.  It does not matter whether they want to work for an extra 20 years after that, they should be able to get a full pension once they have worked X number of years.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister when he is drafting the regulations to give the appeals officers and the deciding officers in his Department some flexibility when dealing with people who are short one or two contributions because they emigrated or had to stop working when they had a baby.</P>

      <P>I know Deputy Durkan has an interest in this matter because he had put down a parliamentary question on it.  He was not present in the House for the debate last night.  He probably had to attend to his constituency work.  He is an extremely hard working Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, this issue revolves around the date of a person's entry into insurance.  We all accept that there are anomalies in the system.  I hope the National Pensions Board will address this matter further in their report.  As I pointed out earlier, there have been changes in regard to mixed insurance. I have referred to the downside of the principle of <i>pro rata</i> pensions.  There is <Col N="1891" /> very little difference between a contributory and a non-contributory pension; I think there is only £5 of a difference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan asked about the number of people who do not have adequate contributions.  Due to the complicated and complex nature of our social welfare system it would take an enormous number of man hours to assess the number of people involved.  The only way we would ever find out the number of people involved is to invite applications.</P>

      <P>I am not an expert on this area but I believe this is the only way we could find out the number involved. However, this could give the impression that we were going to do something about the issue when we may not be in a position to do anything.  As Deputy Owen said, the number of people involved is declining because people are getting older&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but we would have to assess the number of people who had insurance contributions a long time ago but who are now self-employed. As Deputy Durkan said, this has happened in many instances.  Some people may not have applied for a pension and we would not know whom to write to.  I do not think an enormous number of people are involved. However, it would be hard to identify them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell said that we should forget about the date of entry into insurance. As I said earlier, some people would be better off if they had not been brought into the system in 1954 or 1955 but only came in 15 years ago.  Deputy Bell said that a person who works for X number of years should be able to qualify for a full pension.  I have not given much <Col N="1892" /> thought to this proposal but I could consider a period of 25 or 30 years.</P>

      <P>It is an interesting concept which I believe will have cost implications. However, some consideration can be given to the Deputy's suggestion. Problems in regard to insurance should not occur as frequently in the future due to the fact that the self-employed are now being brought into the PRSI system.  In addition, people who are made unemployed will go onto credited contributions. We are now nearing the stage where there will be a record for everybody.</P>
      <P>Another problem is that civil servants do not pay full PRSI.  If I get an opportunity I may extend to them the requirement to pay full PRSI.  I am sure they would all be delighted about this.  I am being facetious when I say this; it is not Government policy.</P>
      <P>Section 10 will introduce an alternative yearly average test which will be of help to some people.  Successive Ministers for Social Welfare have made progressive moves in this area over a number of years.  This is another step forward in this area.</P>

The danger of changing to the new system is that no matter what the cut-off point is there will be a gap in the same way as there is a gap in the tax free allowances.  It would be simpler to have a system whereby a person would start at zero and move on a graduated basis from there to whatever number of years are required to render one eligible for maximum benefits.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Minister will not have time to talk to me later so I want to raise a matter I raised previously with his predecessor.  It is indefensible that a person aged 15 is regarded as an adult in terms of looking after a person living alone.  The case I have in mind is of a widower receiving free rental for his telephone which he lost when his daughter attained the age of 15. In theory the daughter is supposed to be <Col N="1895" /> there to help her father but everybody knows that children of that age are still attending school.  My amendment suggested raising the age to 19 years because that is when teenagers might be at home fulltime.  The age of 15 years was probably suitable some years ago when people did not go beyond primary school but nowadays everybody has the opportunity to go on to second level.  We do not want people to drop out of school to look after a parent.  I am sure that the number of people involved is small and amending the age should not cause a problem.  I hope that when the Minister draws up the regulations he will fulfil the commitment he gave earlier on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be paying a young person of 15 or 16 years of age to stay with an elderly person because otherwise the older person will lose his or her living alone allowance.  Old people are frightened as a result of muggings and so on and we should encourage them to have a young relative in the house.  We should pay them an extra £4 instead of taking it off them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the Minister will not consider the general thrust of the scheme in order to rectify some slight anomalies in it.  Some elderly people are being deprived of benefits or pensions because the regulations are antiquated and do not take account of the circumstances of daily life in 1992 as against daily life in the sixties and seventies when these regulations were made and when it might have been reasonable to expect that a 15 year old would be around to help the elderly person.  I ask the Minister to be a little more flexible when considering this area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point could come up under a separate heading or in a general debate on social welfare. The term &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; is not defined in legislation and this has given rise to some inconsistencies in interpretation across the various schemes regarding pensions. What we are doing is strengthening that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies have come across problems with regard to the living alone allowance, because if a person does not qualify <Col N="1897" /> for it, they will not be eligible for the other free schemes.  This, however, is a totally separate matter.  If I am in the Department long enough and if I have any free time, I will be prepared to consider this because I have come across inflexibility in my time as a Deputy.  I will have to wait and see whether I can do anything in this regard but it is not one of my priorities at present.</P>

I am a bit old-fashioned and I believe that people who want to live together should get married but even in my own family circle that has changed.  People like to live together before getting married, but while I would not like that, I would be considered a square in the eyes of younger people. The fact is that people are living together and therefore it has to be regulated because it creates problems in administration.

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; is a thorny area and it comes up when we consider local authority housing.  Do we need to further define &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;?  Will welfare officers and other agents of the State make it very difficult for people to prove they are cohabiting as man and wife?  I would not like those difficulties to be created for people.  Is there a need to further define what will be accepted as satisfying the condition of cohabiting?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a subject on which I like to take a very broad and liberal interpretation for obvious personal reasons.  Usually people are trying to prove to the Department of Social Welfare that they are not cohabiting and if they say they are cohabiting we accept their word.  People usually try to prove they are not cohabiting because they will get increased benefits under certain schemes.  Section 17 extends the provisions of certain schemes to cohabiting couples.  Under the existing provisions, depending on the means of the couple, an increase in old age or blind pensions may be paid for a husband or wife where the pensioner is living with or is wholly or mainly maintaining his spouse, provided that the spouse is not in receipt of social welfare payments in his or her own right. Section 17 extends those provisions to cohabiting couples.  We must recognise changing trends in society.  This section <Col N="1900" /> provides that a couple cohabiting are treated in the same way as a married couple for the purpose of the non-contributory old age and blind pension schemes.</P>

      <P>I was listening in while I was trying to deal with some of my constituency problems.  I welcome what my colleague says but I have one question for the Minister.  In the case of a person who has left his wife for a particular reason, but has not deserted her legally, and is living with a single woman, will the Minister outline how the wife in this case will be affected by this change if the cohabiting couple should make a claim? Obviously there will not be two separate payments made.  How will this case be investigated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be any change in the person's circumstances because they are treated separately.  For the purposes of the non-contributory old age and blind pension schemes we are just extending to a cohabiting couple the provisions which already apply to a married couple.  As I pointed out to Deputy Owen, people are usually trying to prove they are not cohabiting.  In the case the Deputy mentioned, the spouse's entitlements are dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As my predecessor indicated in replies to previous questions on this subject, it has not been possible to isolate the costs of caring for and managing persons with AIDS or HIV from general health expenditure due to the range and level of services which have to be provided to each individual patient.  During the course of his or her illness an infected person passes through a spectrum of illness, each with varying degrees of severity and each requiring different types and varying levels of care and management.  For example, services would be required by persons with HIV and AIDS in the following areas: primary care level; outpatient clinics; hospital services; community care services, such as public health nurses and home helps; tertiary and hospice care; voluntary agencies such as CAIRDE, the AIDS Alliances, Body Positive and the Irish Haemophilia Society; literature and documentation produced by the voluntary and statutory sectors and financial assistance from a variety of sources, both public and private.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in estimating costs is complicated further by the evolving epidemiology of the disease where early-intervention therapies have been introduced recently for the care and management of persons with HIV and this has added a dimension to the situation which was not present before.  In addition, the cost of managing categories of patients would differ, depending on the category in question.  The public and private sources of funding which enable services to be delivered by both the statutory and voluntary sectors also render the estimated costs extremely difficult. Despite these difficulties, however, my Department are endeavouring to draw up approximate cost indicators for AIDS-HIV patients.  This will have to be done in the context of work of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am chairperson of this committee, <Col N="1902" /> reflecting my intention that AIDS will be dealt with by me as a priority.  Up to now, a total of 252 cases of AIDS have been reported to my Department.  Of the patients concerned, a total of 101 have died.  In addition nearly 1,200 tests for HIV have been confirmed as positive and it can be expected that there are more persons than this with the infection in Ireland.  As there is no cure for AIDS at present, these people with HIV will regrettably develop full AIDS and will require ongoing care and management at primary, secondary and tertiary levels as they progress through their infection.</P>
    <P>It is vital therefore that we develop a fully integrated framework to deal with AIDS and HIV and, towards this end, the national strategy committee will be bringing forward recommendations on the components of such a framework in the very near future.  These measures will be funded and will enable us to respond efficiently and effectively to the evolving situation.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in the UK each health authority are given a budget of £30,000 per year to provide care for persons with AIDS.  Would he not agree that to allow a general practitioner about £20 to provide a primary care service to an AIDS patient, under the GMS scheme, is grossly inadequate?  Would the Minister not agree also that a situation where he is announcing once again the appointment of a second urinary specialist &mdash; a move first mooted in 1985 and announced by all his predecessors &mdash; is a very unsatisfactory response?  Is the Minister aware that St. James's Hospital have announced that they are at capacity in this regard and would he agree that there is a strain on the services available?</P>

      <P>I have been concerned for some time in relation to the situation at the National Neurosurgical Centre at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.  Since becoming Minister, I have been examining this very complex situation to see what steps might be taken to resolve the difficulties.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I will do my utmost to assist in reaching a satisfactory conclusion to the matter.</P>
      <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that two additional consultant neurosurgeons have recently taken up duty at the hospital, one of whom has a special interest in paediatric neurosurgery.  This means that there is now a complement of six neurosurgeons attached to the neurosurgical centre.</P>

I have asked the Medical Council how long more they expect to deliberate on this question and I am hoping to receive a positive response.  I have also taken further measures which may help to ease the problem.  I would ask for the Deputy's forbearance while we ascertain whether the matter can be resolved quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 53 together.  In relation to the recommendations made by the Commission on Health Funding I understand that the thinking behind the commission's recommendation in relation to the publication of maximum waiting periods for access to specific non-emergency procedures was that the setting of these would facilitate the monitoring of the performance of health agencies in <Col N="1905" /> meeting overall service objectives, particularly as regards the objective of ensuring equitable access to hospital services.</P>
      <P>Maximum waiting periods, as envisaged by the commission were intended as a monitoring tool for management rather than a guide for individual patients.  In the case of patients, the maximum safe waiting period for elective surgery will vary greatly depending on the precise medical condition of the individual patient. The admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.  Should a patient's condition deteriorate, it is open to his general practitioner to contact his consultant with a view to expediting matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that without a maximum waiting time we cannot say we are providing an adequate or equitable service for public patients?  Would he also agree that what is for both himself and hospital managers a monitoring tool could mean the difference between waiting three years or a more acceptable period for a hip replacement operation?  Would he further agree that it is time we set aside a fund so that we could give some guarantee about the maximum time a patient would be expected to wait for certain life improving operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The more successful an operation is the greater the demand for it.  The reason there are long waiting lists for orthopaedic operations is that they are so successful.  Whereas ten years ago people were content to put up with an arthritic hip, they are no longer prepared to do so.  When they are made aware that this facility is available the list gets longer.  Therefore it is a measure of the success of the operation or procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same holds true in the case of cardiac surgery.  People seem to think that all their problems will be resolved if they undergo cardiac surgery, especially coronary artery by-pass grafts, but these do not prolong life.  I wonder therefore <Col N="1906" /> whether we should rethink this question of waiting lists and rather than leave it up to one consultant to decide whether a person should be put on the waiting list if we should have a review committee in each hospital to monitor waiting lists and to see to it that those in need are given priority on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>I recognise what the Deputy is trying to say, but waiting lists are a measure of the success of high-tech medicine.  If it is noted that a particular waiting list is vanishing or disappearing, this means that there is no great demand for the operation.  As the Deputy is aware, I am having the waiting lists validated, with regard to public and private beds, so that we have a much better picture of where we stand.  Following a request to the head of a particular hospital &mdash; I have spoken to him &mdash; to validate the waiting list he discovered that almost one-third of patients had had their operation and someone had forgotten to remove their names from the waiting list.  As soon as the figures become available I will give them to Members of the House.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 4, 58 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy when the says great hardship is being caused.  It is recognised that the present system of subvention in respect of dependent persons in long-stay care in nursing homes is unsatisfactory in many respects.  The purpose of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is to establish a new framework for the regulation of the nursing home sector in Ireland and a new system for the payment of subventions to dependent persons in genuine need of nursing care.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Act provides for the introduction of an equitable system for the payment of subventions according to standard criteria throughout the country. Under the Act a subvention may be paid by a health board to a person following an assessment of the person's level of dependency and of his-her means and circumstances.</P>
      <P>The details of the new method of subvention will be set out in regulations under the Act.  The drafting of these regulations is at an advanced stage.  The draft regulations will be the subject of discussion with nursing home interests and bodies representing the elderly.  When these regulations have been finalised the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, can be commenced.  It is my intention to commence the Act later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it is a scandal that we are still waiting for this system to be put in place?  His predecessor announced that it would be put in place by the end of last year and it was first mooted in 1988, four years ago.  It is unacceptable for the Minister to say that his departmental officials are still working on the regulations, given the discriminatory practices in relation to access to subventions as between the Eastern Health Board area and other health board areas and that many people who have a statutory entitlement to be accommodated in a <Col N="1908" /> public nursing home have to scrape and scrounge in a way that was not envisaged by the Health Act, 1970.  Would the Minister accept that it is unacceptable to say that his officials are working on the regulations and that the Act will commence later this year?  Would he give us a date today and stick by it, as he was prepared to do earlier in relation to the appointment of the consultant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it should commence earlier, but if I make any more demands of that Department I am afraid that they will lock me out.  Since I was appointed I have been pushing and pressing them.  I am very concerned about this matter and I only hope that legal action is not taken against us over it.  I agree with the Deputy but I have put the Department under a lot of pressure. I therefore ask him to bear with me.  I can promise him that we will publish the draft regulations as soon as possible.</P>

The matter is not as simple as we would like it to be. When I sat on the opposite benches I, too, made demands and I ask the Deputy to believe me when I say that the matter is receiving attention.  While I do not think it will commence before the middle of the year, when I say &ldquo;this year&rdquo; I mean this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £5 million revenue and £1 million capital has been made available for the development of additional mental handicap services throughout the country.  Because of the particularly serious situation which exists in the Dublin area £2.65 million has been allocated for the development of an extra 45 residential places, 20 respite places to serve 240 people, 125 day care places, a home support service for 300-500 families, 20 emergency places, an improved and expanded service for people with mental handicap who are also disturbed and 15 day places for children.  The operational details of the additional services to be provided and the people with mental handicap to benefit are being considered by the Mental Handicap Central Planning Committee of the Eastern Health Board.  Their proposals are awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the report <i>Needs and Abilities</i> have been accepted in principle by the Government.  I would like to assure the House of my intention to develop services for persons with a mental handicap as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Of course the speed with which this can be achieved will be determined by <Col N="1910" /> the availability of funds in the context of the State of the Exchequer's finances.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the health services in the Eastern Health Board area will include a single new authority which will be responsible for all health and personal social services in the eastern region. It will take over the present function of the Eastern Health Board as well as some of the functions of the Department of Health and will ensure that health services in the region are delivered in an integrated and co-ordinated way.  I am happy to say that in so far as mental handicap services are concerned there is already considerable co-ordination in health board areas because of the establishment of co-ordinating committees which are representative of the health board and the voluntary agencies in each area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's concern for the mentally handicapped. However, Deputy Spring specifically asked about the 24 trainees at St. Michael's House &mdash; I am not sure if the Minister is aware of this &mdash; who were told last year by a placement officer that alternative places would be found for them in sheltered employment.  They have now been told that there is no sheltered employment available for them and that their future cannot be guaranteed in this centre after June.  We know there are changes in the European Fund which has been promoting training for these people, but we cannot just forget about people because they are handicapped.  Is the Minister aware of what has happened and of the advice of the placement officer?  The parents of these children need some assurance about their future.</P>

The number in North Great Charles Street is 83 and 31 mentally handicapped people are catered for at Castle Industries in Coolock.

They will only have a tiny fraction of that sum available.  To suggest that they will be able to deal with the problems relating to this group of 24 people or other services in the Eastern Health Board is not to tell the truth to the public.  Would the Minister not agree that the <i>Needs and Ability</i> document sponsored by the Government would in 1992 have required extra spending of £18 million on the current side and £5 million extra on the capital side to meet the needs identified?</P>

      <P>I have not learnt to print money yet.  The central planning committee is very important.  The committee ensured that people with moderately severe and severe mental handicap obtained access to residential places.  Before that it was usual for mildly mentally handicapped people to usurp all the available places.  Mental handicap is a big problem to which we must apply ourselves.  It was neglected by Governments over the years.  As a result of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it will be given priority.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions made it clear that we must look at this problem and agreed that there should be a seven year programme to help alleviate the problem.  It cannot be solved overnight and if the Deputy was sitting here he would be giving me the same answer that I am giving him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10, 23, 65, 104, 151 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>The Third Report of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group recommended measures specifically designed to achieve better management of waiting lists in acute hospitals in Dublin.  These recommendations are of equal relevance to all acute hospitals in the country.</P>
      <P>In December last, having considered the report, my predecessor asked that an immediate countrywide validation of waiting lists be carried out.  I attach considerable importance to the validation exercise as I am particularly concerned to ensure that all hospital authorities should provide accurate, reliable and up-to-date information on in-patient waiting lists in order that action can be undertaken to tackle the most pressing problems in this area.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists which are not routinely validated can give a distorted picture of the real demand for service.  Studies have shown that a significant number of patients whose names are on waiting lists will not require treatment for a variety of reasons.  They will have self-deferred, been admitted elsewhere, have moved house, or their condition may have improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or died waiting.</P>

    <Col N="1918" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases the condition improves.  The validation process which involved a bulk postal review of all patients on the in-patient waiting lists for over three months is as follows: each patient is written to, asking if they wish to remain on the list; where a reply is not received within two weeks or where the patient indicated they no longer wish to be treated the consultant concerned is asked to review the patient's notes and to approve the issue of a letter to the general practitioner advising that the patient's name will be removed from the waiting list unless the GP advises to the contrary.  I am satisfied that this process provides proper safeguards to ensure that no patient is inappropriately removed from a list.</P>
      <P>The majority of agencies have submitted validated returns at this stage.  I have asked that those outstanding be submitted as a matter of urgency.  The information will then be collated and examined and I will make the results available as soon as possible.  The information being collected in the validation exercise will show the waiting lists for public and private patients for all specialties.</P>
      <P>For the following specialties, more detailed information is being collected: ENT, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, cardiac surgery, plastic surgery and vascular surgery.  The information will indicate the number of patients waiting from three to 12 months, the numbers waiting over 12 months and will also provide breakdowns for particular procedures in these specialties for adults and children where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The health agencies have also been asked to put formalised arrangements in place for ongoing review and validation of all waiting lists and thereby ensure that comprehensive and reliable data on patients waiting treatment is readily available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's provisional returns, could he indicate whether he has evidence about the projected waiting time for public versus private patients, which is the key issue <Col N="1919" /> being collated? Will he publish these returns on a regular basis so that the House can examine progress and the speed in catering for the needs of different categories? Is he satisfied that a system which at no stage makes personal contact, other than by post, with a patient on a waiting list does not result in some people being forgotten? I can envisage people waiting for a cataract operation not being successfully communicated with by post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no figures that can help the Deputy at present.  I will press the hospitals concerned to make the information available as soon as possible and every Member will get a copy.  That is important.  I agree that this should be done on an ongoing basis so that we will know exactly how things are.  Regarding communication, the letter to be sent out was prepared in consultation with a consultant in St. Vincent's Hospital.  The Kennedy group were quite happy as a result of the medical advice on the matter that this was the best way to approach it. If a person does not reply he or she is not automatically taken off the list.  We ask the consultant to discuss the matter with the general practitioner.  Every effort humanly possible is made to contact the person.  I have examined this matter and I cannot suggest a more effective alternative. When the results are publicised, anybody who feels that he or she may have been overlooked can make contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the correct way to set about reducing hospital waiting lists is not to undertake a barren exercise in validating the lists but rather to provide the degree of hospital services necessary to deal with these lists and to carry out the operative procedures and treatment for which many people have been waiting two years or more? The hospital budget is totally inadequate and these lists are getting longer all the time instead of shorter. What are the Minister's proposals to deal with the lists in that regard?</P>

    <Col N="1920" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy and I will tell him why.  Every rational person believes that validation is important because in many cases it was discovered that people who had been operated on had left the country.  It is not possible to solve the problem by providing an unlimited number of forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome supplementaries from Deputies, but I would appreciate a little courtesy when I am replying.  Many people are unnecessarily put on waiting lists.  Cardiac surgery, especially coronary by-pass surgery, does not prolong life.  Perhaps review committees should be set up in hospitals to see whether putting people on waiting lists is justified.  Many people who are on waiting lists do not require urgent treatment.  When a person is put on a waiting list anxiety develops and the patient thinks he will die if he is not treated. I am not trying to save money in this area.  A similar problem arose when the Deputy's party was in power.  More money does not necessarily mean better health.  If we considered health services in a different way many waiting lists might not be necessary.  Hip implants are very important because they help to mobilise people and get them back into society.  We have an obligation to those people, but other operations might not be necessary and people might be better off without them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the validation of waiting lists, particularly in the Dublin area, is there an indication of an extraordinarily long waiting list with regard to any particular speciality or is there any indication that following validation there would be a significant reduction in the waiting period for the procedure to be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are over 1,000 people on the waiting list for cardiac surgery. I invited the four cardiac surgeons to come to see me with a view to increasing the number of operations carried out. <Col N="1921" /> They listened very sympathetically to my proposal and agreed to carry out an extra 40 operations per year.  In addition, a second cardiac surgeon will be appointed in Cork and some inroads should be made in that area.  Ophthalmology is an important area because cataracts must be treated.  This is an area where I would like to see more funds applied.  In the treatment of ENT patients most cases require the insertion of grommets, which is not a very specialised technical operation. There will have to be an increase in this type of treatment although some doctors argue that many patients recover without the insertion of grommets.  That is true with the proper treatment.  The removal of tonsils is fashionable from year to year.  If a member of the royal family gets his tonsils out everybody wants their tonsils out.  When the removal of tonsils goes out of fashion people believe that tonsils are very important because they are part of the immune system and that they should not be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We should consider these matters in a more objective way.  I believe that many patients needing grommets will have recovered by the time they are treated, but the treatment of cataracts, glaucoma and orthopaedics is very important and more funds should be applied to these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage that in 12 months time no additional resources will have been made available and the Minister will use the validation process as a yardstick for his stewardship.  I accept that validation is necessary but it will not solve the whole problem.  Would the Minister give a commitment to the House that he will in the validation process determine the number of patients who opt for private treatment because of the length of waiting lists for public treatment? Second, would the Minister not accept that validation would go only half the way towards solving the problem? <Col N="1922" /> Most people on waiting lists are waiting for out-patient appointments which would determine whether or not operations are necessary.  It is in this area that huge delays occur.  I would ask the Minister what steps he will take to ensure that the waiting time of a year and a half to two years for out-patient appointments with consultants is reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that many people are waiting for outpatient appointments and many have opted for private treatment because they felt that the waiting list for public treatment was too long.  Measures have been taken to ensure that the private patient does not take precedence over the public patient. We have arranged lists for public and private patients and we have designated beds for public and private patients.  I have examined the system and I admit that I am sceptical about it.  I want to ensure that we do what is best.  Many beds in public hospitals were never designated as public or private beds and private patients took up these beds.  Now that we have designated a certain number of public beds we have to make sure that there is no queue jumping.</P>
      <P>There is much dissatisfaction with this system and many people, particularly women who engage private obstetricians, want public beds.  However, they cannot have it both ways.  Public beds should be designated for public patients and private beds for private patients.  If that system is adhered to there would be a much better result.  I agree with the Deputy that validation would solve only half the problem.  As Deputies know, the resources are limited and I am restricted in what I can do.  I agree that many patients have jumped from the public queue to the private queue and I wish we could solve the problem in a simpler way. When lists are validated we will be in a better position to know how to tackle the problem.  When I came to office all the resources had been allocated and the cupboard is bare.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister not heard the phrase &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; somewhere before, when two categories of people were put on separate lists and which did not produce equality of the kind that would be expected? In relation to the issue raised by Deputy Creed, is it not the case that the huge waiting times before getting a first appointment with a consultant mean that many people do not get even to the starting line when waiting for treatment? Could the Minister clarify his statement that many people would be better off without operations? If that is so, how did those people get on waiting lists in the first place if they had been screened by GPs and consultants? Would the Minister perhaps be reverting to George Bernard Shaw's theory of medicine that a bag of greengages is the best treatment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, doctors differ and patients die.  I agree that the position in relation to out-patient appointments is far from satisfactory and people have to wait an inordinately long time.  We have to try to speed up that process.  The Deputy is correct; it is not good that some people do not get past the starting line.  The Deputy asked me one other question.  I suspect that perhaps Alzheimer's Disease is setting in; I have forgotten the other part of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, doctors differ and patients die.  I have been in family medical practice for many years.  While I <Col N="1925" /> might advise a patient that he or she could live his or her normal life span without an operation, another doctor might tell the same patient that he or she might as well have the operation.  I have worked both in hospitals and in medical family practice.  I would not advise a patient to have a major operation for some minor disability when a high risk was involved, but other doctors might not agree with me.  That is why I say that perhaps many patients would be better off without an operation.  One man wrote to me through the Department in relation to an operation he was waiting for, an operation that would correct indigestion. The operation is major and I certainly would not recommend it to anyone.  Another practitioner had suggested to the man that he undergo that operation and he now wants to know how quickly he might have the operation.  My advice is that he should not have the operation.  I should adopt a very pragmatic, sensible approach to the issue and not think that everyone should have operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 35, 61, 93, 113, 144, 149, 157, and 159 together.  That will give some indication of the interest in this issue and in my reply.</P>
      <P>I have met separately with the Tallaght Hospital Board, the Tallaght Community Council and the Tallaght Regional Hospital Action Group for discussions regarding the proposed hospital project. At those meetings I reiterated the Government's commitment to the Tallaght Hospital project.  It was explained that all possible funding options were being actively explored and that in this context the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group had been asked to examine the hospital needs of the area and to make recommendations on the functions, scope and scale of the proposed hospital and on possible methods of funding.  The Dublin Hospital Advisory Group are currently examining these needs.</P>
      <P>When the hospital was originally planned in the early 1980s the number of beds was based on the planning norms of the time.  However, in the last ten years there has been a dramatic change in acute hospital practice, with developments in diagnostic techniques, the introduction of day surgery and new and improved treatment regimes, all leading to a significantly reduced length of stay for patients attending general hospitals. Therefore, the large number of beds originally planned would not appear to be necessary at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of interim services in the Tallaght area will be considered in the <Col N="1928" /> light of the group's recommendations, which I expect to receive shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the estimated cost of the original Tallaght Hospital project was £118.  It is not possible at this stage to provide estimated costings for a revised project or an out-patient facility, pending the recommendations of the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group.</P>
    <P>The Working Group, representative of the Meath Hospital, Adelaide Hospital and National Children's Hospital, was an <i>ad hoc committee</i> which was set up to consider a management structure for the Tallaght Hospital and it is not intended to publish the group's report.  However, I have received the report and I am actively considering the matter at present.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister for Health well in his new appointment.</P>
      <P>A colleague from my constituency, Minister Flood, is in the House and I am sure that he would testify to the number of occasions on which I have raised this issue with the Minister's predecessors.</P>
      <P>When does the Minister consider that he will be able to announce the outline of his plans for what is apparently now to be a scaled-down hospital? The only question about which the people of the most populous region in the country are concerned is when construction will start on whatever shape of hospital is to be provided &mdash; and we can argue about that matter another time.  Those in Tallaght, Clondalkin and the surrounding region want to know when construction is likely to begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into office I thought that I should see the groups concerned immediately to know what their exact thoughts were.  I then met the Tallaght Hospital Board.  I felt that 11 years was a long time for considering the construction of the Tallaght hospital.  The discussions concerned the possibility that the Government would not be able to provide £118 million.  It was also suggested, by virtue of the fact that such advances have been made in hospitals, that we should consider a more realistically <Col N="1929" /> sized hospital.  Until five years ago there were no day surgeries and we did not have the keyhole surgery that is now available.  For example, a patient who would normally have spent 14 to 18 days in hospital after a gall bladder operation can now be released after three days.  We are now looking at a completely different picture.  I did not lay down any rules but I put it to the Tallaght Hospital Board that they might perhaps consider a more realistically sized hospital.  The opinion in America now is that smaller hospitals are much more cost effective, more personal and provide better care than the huge hospitals.</P>
      <P>I visited all hospitals in Dublin.  When meeting the Meath Hospital Board I suggested that, as proof of sincerity, interim arrangements should be made if there were to be a hospital.  I suggested to the board that they come back to me in two weeks with proposals for the provision of outpatient services there on an interim basis.  The suggestion was also made for a first aid ambulance service that could provide basic care and treatment for minor ailments and could also take people to the nearest casualty hospital. The area is so far out of the city that mothers who try to bring their children in on buses, for example, are faced with great inconvenience.  That is one proposal that should be considered to prove to the people that we are serious about what we are saying.  I would welcome the provision of such a service in the centre, near the centre or perhaps even on the site.  I gave the board two weeks to come forward with proposals and I am sorry for looking for their ideas in such a short time.</P>
      <P>I also met the Kennedy Group and Dr. David Kennedy.  I suggested to Dr. Kennedy that he could perhaps speed up his deliberations on this issue and come back to me with his ideas before July or August.  I suggested that he might come back to me with proposals for alternative methods of funding by the end of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also met financiers from the United States who had indicated an interest in the project.  They seemed enthusiastic <Col N="1930" /> and I suggested that they meet the chairman of the Tallaght Hospital Board.</P>
    <P>Those are the measures that I have taken in this regard in my four weeks as Minister.</P>

      <P>If it is not unacceptable to talk about a first aid station for a population of hundreds of thousands of people, at a time when the Minister has £40 million at his disposal this year for hospital capital projects, would he not agree that this flurry of meetings in which he is engaging misses the central question of why he will not allocate money to the project?  Would he not agree that the board of Tallaght hospital have taken into account the new norms in bed ratios and day surgery in designing their most recent plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they have not. There have been various figures trotted out about the size of the hospital.  I would ask the Deputy to realise that I am endeavouring to do something about it. It may be the Deputy's duty to criticise no matter what I do.  I might point out I have been four weeks in the Department and I am not there to perform miracles; certainly I cannot perform the miracle of the five loaves and two fishes.  But I can assure the Deputy I will consistently work very hard to see that hospital erected; that is the commitment I have given them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbittee will be aware of the various figures.  For example, originally it was to contain 750 beds, then they decided to reduce that to 650 and they have examined various other figures.  I suggested around 350 to 400 beds.  Perhaps that is not an ideal figure but let us ascertain whether we can get a good hospital record.  I am not talking about a first aid station as such.  I am talking about a first aid ambulance station.  That does not mean there will be merely a St. John <Col N="1931" /> Ambulance man located there.  It does not mean that.  It means we will provide some form of service for minor casualties so that an ambulance would be on standby wherever immediate therapy is necessitated.  That is what I thought we might provide, if the people accept this proposal and if we get the requisite funds. It is as an interim measure so that people could be taken to the nearest hospital.  If Deputy Rabbitte has other recommendations, better suggestions, I gladly invite him to my office when I will give them sympathetic consideration.</P>

Does he agree that the loss of the Adelaide ethos and tradition to the Tallaght Regional Hospital would be regrettable? Furthermore, is he aware of the fears that may be provoked in the minds of many people in the region when he talks about private financiers in the United States or wherever else?  Does he accept that what we do not need in Tallaght is a Blackrock Private Clinic-type institution?  Finally, why is he not publishing the work of the Kennedy Advisory Group?  When does he propose to respond legislatively to the recommendations of the Kennedy report which, as I understand it, cannot be implemented without legislation being brought before this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will look at that and communicate with the Deputy.  I am very conscious of the special ethos of the Adelaide Hospital.  I did suggest to the Adelaide Hospital &mdash; and I am not laying down laws &mdash; that they might consider remaining where they are and where they are providing a vital medical service in the inner city area.  We have lost a lot of hospitals in this area, including Mercer's, Baggot Street, Sir Patrick Dun's and Steevens.  We might find the inner city area depleted or devoid of hospital care. From the time I was very young we always went to the Adelaide Hospital.  Indeed, I have great regard for and sentimental attachment to that hospital.  It was a suggestion I hoped they would consider.  But, if they are committed to Tallaght, then I will ensure that the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital is preserved there.  I would want to do so, as I think we all would.</P>

      <P>I should say we would not want, and I would not allow, a Blackrock Clinic type of hospital there in the first place.  This will be a public hospital providing first-class, quality care.  There may be some suggestion that if there were not a large number of beds one would lose out on attendant technology. Our job is to provide a first-class quality public hospital, no private hospitals.  That is very important as we have sufficient of the latter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the reports referred to by the Deputy relate to the community-based study carried out by the Eastern Health Board of behavioural risk factors for premature mortality in certain disadvantaged areas of Dublin <Col N="1933" /> The development of health promotion strategies for socially deprived areas is a major priority of the health promotion unit of my Department and of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the development of such strategies was conducting baseline research to determine specifically the health risk profile in selected areas.  The Eastern Health Board, with financial support from the health promotion unit, conducted a study of behavioural risk factors among young adults in areas with high mortality versus those in low mortality areas.  The second phase, which is well advanced, is to develop specific interventions to address the behavioural risk factors involved, particularly nutrition, smoking, alcohol and exercise.  In fact, the health board and the health promotion unit are already finalising details on a nutrition intervention programme in response to the findings of this study.</P>
      <P>Incorporated in the current health promotion activities of the Eastern Health Board are programmes which are specifically targeted at socially deprived areas.  These include: family development programmes aimed at first-time mothers in deprived areas which involve structured interventions promoting physical, mental and emotional health; the travellers programme which involves a mobile health clinic for travellers with medical and nursing personnel involved in health promotion; the healthy cities project.  The health board, in association with the three Dublin local authorities, are involved in the World Health Organisation's healthy cities project which specifically involves anti-smoking strategies, exercise and sport for disadvantaged youth and, in association with the health promotion unit, the board are promoting an anti-smoking programme for use in general practice and by other health professionals.</P>
      <P>On a national level the health promotion unit, as the Deputy is aware, is actively involved in major programmes on nutrition, exercise, alcohol use and anti-smoking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1934" /> not agree that it is not simply a matter of nutritional programmes and behaviour where circumstances in which mortality rates are twice those in some deprived parts of our city, compared with others? Would he not agree that the clear differential access to health care is a very significant factor?  Would he not agree that intervention in this area requires specific ministerial action to ensure that primary care of the highest possible quality should be available?  Apparently this is not being made available under the present capitation system because of the natural stress on doctors, paid on a capitation basis, who do not have a private practice.  Would he agree there is need for a project, such as the Kilkenny project, to provide more comprehensive check-ups to groups in the target and age groups, at high risk of premature mortality?  In short, would he not agree that he needs to address this matter in a much more decisive manner than has been apparent from the measures he has outlined to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is multifactorial; it includes employment status, education, cultural norms, housing, a number of other factors.  The Deputy referred to primary care.  I should say the GMS service is available to them.  If the Deputy considers the capitation system unsatisfactory I should point out that it is at present the subject of consideration under a review of the GMS.  Where this incidence is most prevalent in inner city areas we would hope that general practitioners would be able to provide this service in a more structured way, during proper hours.  It would be my hope that that service would be provided.  I shall examine the possibility of initiating a study on nutrition along the lines of the Kilkenny project.  Where there is poverty there are nutritional problems, too.  Poverty is one of the main problems so we need to deal first with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is an extremely low take up of immunisation schemes in certain socially deprived areas of Dublin city?  Obviously <Col N="1935" /> this will have a knock-on effect on children as they grow up, and a number of deaths have occurred as a result.  Does the Minister agree that community health care is the key area to be targeted?  It is an area that is not sufficiently funded. Would the Minister agree that the problem could be solved to some extent by public awareness programmes administered by the health boards?  More funding should be targeted towards community health care by way of a prerequisite to better health for people who live in socially deprived areas of the city. I am not talking solely about the inner city because, for example, there is an extremely low take-up in the Neilstown area of, in particular, the three-in-one vaccine.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy has said is correct.  I have instructed my Department to examine the Hickey report on the public health services.  I hope the recommendations in that report can be implemented as soon as possible. This would ensure that public health doctors play a greater role in ensuring that people have their children vaccinated.</P>
      <P>Greater attention is being given to primary care and community care.  These are the areas where the problems arise. If more funds are directed to community care the health service will save money in the long term.  That cannot be quantified in the short term but it is the proper way to approach the financing of the health service.  This issue has to be made a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Heart surgery for public patients is performed in three locations &mdash; the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin; Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>There is a total of 1,113 adults on the waiting list for cardiac surgery, 1,068 of whom are on the Mater Hospital waiting list.  There are 47 paediatric cases on the Crumlin waiting list.</P>
      <P>The admission of a patient to hospital for cardiac surgery is a clinical decision taken by the consultant concerned and is based on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list. I think the Deputy will understand this. Emergency cases are dealt with immediately. However, the number of emergency cases arising will obviously affect the waiting times for non-emergency admissions.  This has been the admissions procedure over a number of years.</P>
      <P>Significant additional resources have been allocated to cardiac surgery over the last two years, in spite of severe financial restrictions.  Special additional funding was approved for the provision of ten additional cardiac beds at the national cardiac unit.  The total capital cost was £421,000, made up of £235,000 for renovation and upgrading works and £186,000 for equipment.  Furthermore, £400,000 additional annual staffing costs were approved which is, of course, a cost which must be provided on an ongoing basis each year.</P>
      <P>A second post of cardiac surgeon has been sanctioned in Cork and it is hoped that this post will be filled by the end of 1992.  This appointment will double the cardiac surgery output at the Regional Hospital in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that as an immediate step in expanding <Col N="1937" /> services this year I have allocated £120,000, for the provision of 40 additional open heart operations at the Mater Hospital in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give details of the number of people who have been on the waiting list for major cardiac surgery for the past five years. Would he not agree that there has been a 12 per cent increase in the waiting lists for cardiac surgery over the past nine months and that this problem cannot be resolved by carrying out the 40 extra operations to which he referred unless, as the Minister suggests many of these operations are unnecessary.  Can he indicate how he is going to tackle this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out to the Deputy that open heart by-pass surgery is a relatively new procedure.  My concern is that there will be such a demand for this service, it will gobble up all the health budget and that the mentally handicapped people with mental illness and the elderly will be relegated to the bottom of the list.  As I said, when one creates a service one creates a demand.  Every country in the civilised world has found that the only way costs can be curtailed in the health services &mdash; it is a bottomless pit &mdash; is to have waiting lists.  Unfortunately the more successful an operation, the greater the demand for it and, consequently the longer the waiting list.  It is not so very long ago that we did not have such operations. Nowadays practically everyone I meet has a CABG, as it is called.  They have all had coronary artery by-pass operations. It has become very fashionable. Waiting lists are a measure of the success and advances in technology and medicine. People who do not recognise this fact are blinding themselves to the reality of the health service.  As I said when I was a backbencher, we need to have a national debate on this issue.  The demand for the service is now so great that I am afraid it will gobble up all the health budget.  I ask Deputies to bear this in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that this operation, which has become very popular and very expensive, does not prolong one's life but, does it not save life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition is not life threatening; it is just cardiac, or chest pain which can also be treated by way of tablets &mdash; they have the same effect.  A person's life cannot be lengthened by an operation any more than it can be lengthened by taking the tablets prescribed for the condition.  People need to bear this in mind.  I would defy any consultant-cardiologist to contradict what I am saying.  An operation may improve the quality of life but the same result can be achieved with tablets.</P>
      <P>People who are crippled by cardiac pain, so to speak, should undergo the surgery.  As I said, hospitals should set up monitoring review committees.  GPs should also be encouraged to categorise their patients.  Not everyone on the waiting list may need an operation.  The Deputy might find what I am saying amusing but that is the harsh reality.  We have to look sensibly at this issue.  There will no doubt be more major advances in the area of technology.  Kidney transplants cost £20,000 and a large number of these operations are carried out every year.  Advances in his area are taking place at a phenomenal pace.  Tests carried out on a machine installed in one Dublin hospital cost £600 each.  These advances in technology and medicine are placing an enormous strain on our health services.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 18 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the bulk of this comprehensive section is a tidying up exercise but I have a number of doubts in relation to it which I will ask the Minister to resolve.  The legal conditions of the property sale should be taken into consideration in means testing &mdash; it is not covered in the Bill or the explanatory memorandum &mdash; because there could be conditions within the terms of the sale of property which would be relevant at a future date in relation to conditions for benefits.  For example, a person could acquire a property and could have already been means tested.  They could be left a house by their mother or father and it would be unfair to again means test such a person.  It would be a very cumbersome process and very difficult to deal with because if it was a local authority house it would take a considerable time to dispose of it.  It would have to be dealt with by way of a transfer order from the county manager and would have to be registered in the Land Registry.  As those of us who deal with local authorities know, it could take 12 months or longer if there was a dispute in the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final paragraph of the explanatory memorandum there is a reference to &ldquo;increases in another pension&rdquo;.  Does that mean industrial pensions, UK pensions <Col N="2017" /> from social welfare sources, invalidity pensions and EC pensions?  Somebody drawing a UK invalidity or disability pension could find if they returned to live here that because our pension rates are higher they would be means tested and paid the difference between the UK and the Irish pension. Will anything in the section interfere with that?  Trying to clarify that situation in Newcastle-on-Tyne via the EC section of the Department created very long delays. When the Minister is bringing in regulations because the difference between the UK pension and the non-contributory pension entitlement here is small, it might be worth considering giving the person the full pension until the matter is processed.  There would be no great difference between that and giving a payment, for example, from a community welfare officer through the health board to the individual concerned.  If over-payments had been made they could be deducted and, if there had been an underpayment, the matter could be rectified by way of a lump sum.  This is an opportunity to make provision for something which causes many problems for Members of the House and local authorities.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of discussion on the previous method of means testing.  It is totally unacceptable for many reasons, all of which I will not repeat.  How is means testing carried out?  When regulations are made for the purpose of calculating or carrying out means testing we should try to achieve uniformity because deciding and appeals officers are interpreting the regulations in a variety of ways.  The Department will say that there is a uniform interpretation but that is not the case.  Members of the House should be given a simplified document stating how means testing is carried out which would save the Department, officials and Members of the Oireachtas an enormous amount of time.</P>
    <P>The main objection to this section is that the Minister is introducing, for the first time, means testing on contributory benefits.  Last year I represented a person in a very important case, which I cannot <Col N="2018" /> refer to here, but I will tell the Minister about it privately.  The reason I cannot refer to it is that it subsequently went to the High Court.  The learned judge has not yet delivered his judgment so the <i>sub judice</i> rule applies.  The same thinking appears to be in this section and in the explanatory memorandum, which was virtually quoted by the appeals officer in the case.  This happened over a year ago and I said at the appeal that it was an attempt to introduce by the backdoor a means test to a contributory pension or benefit.  I should like to have the Minister's assurance that that is not the case because it would be highly dangerous to introduce means testing for a contributory pension.  It is akin to saying that you would introduce a means test after you had paid car insurance and had an accident; that the insurance company would note what you had in your house or how much money you had in the bank before they would pay for the damage caused by the accident.</P>
    <P>In general terms I welcome the section, but if it means that we are introducing a means test for contributory pensions &mdash; I would like the Minister to reassure me on this point &mdash; we will be in trouble and in my opinion it will be a sad day for this House.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that this is a tidying up operation.  With regard to Deputy Bell's point on a means testing of contributory pensions, will the Minister clarify the position because from my reading of the section I do not see that it is there?  However, I would be very opposed to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two or three points on this section.  I have taken a different angle but I assume I am in order in raising this point.  Section 18 (a) states... &ldquo;where such income is attributable to a period prior to the year immediately preceding the date of calculation but is received in a subsequent year...&rdquo; A great number of people who were self-employed prior to becoming entitled <Col N="2019" /> to a pension have experienced difficulties. It would be true to say that these people would be applying for unemployment assistance rather than unemployment benefit.  The way the rule is interpreted in my neck of the woods is that the income earned in the previous 12 months is taken into account.  I can give an example: the man who owns his JCB and is a self-employed JCB driver. As the Minister will be well aware, during part of the year he would not be able to do all the work he could get and he could work 18 hours a day, but in the slack periods he would have no work.  Naturally when he is not working he has no income.  I am not making the case for the man who had managed to stockpile money because he had made £50,000 in the previous six months.  I am making the case for the man who makes an average income when he is working because he has to pay insurance for the year, he has to maintain the vehicle and his family would have nothing to live on during the months he would not be working.  I am sure there is a standard procedure but the way it is interpreted leaves a lot to be desired.  Four or five cases come immediately to mind and when the man is not working, the family have no income.  He would not have managed to save because he would have spent all the money on plant and machinery.  I think this may come under the provisions of section 18, where income is attributable to a particular year.  I am sure many Deputies come across similar problems quite regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second query relates to the transfer of the family farm to the son or daughter. We are all well aware that farmers would not transfer their lands but for the fact that they were unlikely to get the pension at 66 if they still retained their land.  From what is happening around the place, I cannot see this continuing.  Usually when the person aged 66 and over divested himself of his property he was usually entitled to the old age pension.  The trend at present is to have an off-farm job as well as working part time on the land. The social welfare officers are beginning <Col N="2020" /> to say to the person who has inherited the land that because he is not a full-time farmer the only reason his parents divested themselves of their property was to get the old age non-contributory pension. Usually the person who inherited the land was not a full-time farmer even though he now owns the land.  I know of eight or ten cases where the family farm was transferred to a son or daughter in another way but the pension was never paid because the Department said that the son or daughter who had inherited the property did not reside full-time on the farm.  This is a specific query but I think it comes within the section.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to be reassured that contributory pensions will not be means tested.  If the Minister's answer is in the affirmative, I have no fault to find with the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two queries on section 18 (a).  If the Minister can confirm that this is a beneficial change, we will not oppose it.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>...that arrears of income which relates to a previous period and which under present rules would be assessed as capital will now be assessed as income for the period to which it relates;</P>
      <P>I believe this may apply in the following case.  If a young person has a motor cycle accident, the compensation may be paid some years later because the wheels of justice grind slowly.  Let us say he gets £10,000 compensation.  Under the old system that was regarded as capital and the interest on the capital was regarded as means.  As I understand this section, the £10,000 will be regarded as income and will be assessed as income for the period to which it relates.  Will the Minister clarify if that is the case?  I wonder if the £10,000 will be regarded as capital and the interest regarded as means in subsequent years?  I know this is a difficult query.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second query relates to those who qualify for both a British and Irish pension. If the British elect a Labour <Col N="2021" /> Government, it is expected that pensions will be increased.  However there is a charge for cashing the sterling pension and getting Irish currency.  When assessing the Irish pension the person should get, do we take account of the net amount of the British pension the person receives in púnts, because sometimes the rate of exchange fluctuates?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 in the main is good news.  It provides for amendments to the rules in regard to the calculation of means for pension purposes, old age (non-contributory) pension, widows (non-contributory) pension, lone parents allowance and carer's allowance schemes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to assessing means for unemployment assistance.  Section 18 relates to pensions. The Deputy is right as regards self-employed people who wish to go on unemployment assistance; if, for instance, the person was a painter and worked during the summer from May to October and then became unemployed, their means for unemployment assistance purposes would be assessed over the preceding 12 months and if their income was in excess of the eligibility limit, they would not qualify for unemployment assistance.  I have come across a few of those cases and some method has to be found for assessing self-employed people.  Those people usually appeal the decision and in the meantime they are paid the supplementary welfare allowance. The Deputy is talking about unemployment assistance and it has nothing to do with these pensions.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the court case to which Deputy Bell referred &mdash; and about which he said he would speak with me afterwards &mdash; but there is nothing in this section or no change of policy that would result in means testing for contributory pensions.  The Deputy appears to be familiar with the background of the case and I will be interested to hear what he has to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell him that <Col N="2022" /> under this section it is not intended to means test such a person.  There is no means testing for a contributory pension. That is not provided for in this Bill or in any other Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would be a total contradiction of contributory pensions.  I will speak to the Deputy afterwards about that but I can give him assurance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to means testing and the need for uniformity in the system.  I have given an undertaking that in my period in the Department of Social Welfare we will endeavour to get uniformity between all the means testing arrangements.  If we could achieve that then we could publish the guidelines in that regard.  Guidelines can be obtained from the Department at any time, and Deputies have often put down parliamentary questions as to the means testing for the different schemes.  The rules which have to be consulted would almost fill a book and are very confusing.  It would be important in the coming year to streamline the means testing arrangements so that the guidelines would apply to all schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the United Kingdom situation. That matter is covered in part of this section and is mentioned in the explanatory memorandum.  A person can qualify for an old age non-contributory pension here even though he or she may have a small United Kingdom or EC pension.  A difficulty which has been encountered by Deputies on all sides is that in theory and in law when means are assessed for non-contributory pension account is taken of the amount of the United Kingdom or other pension.  When increases are granted in the United Kingdom that results in an increase in that pension and the old age non-contributory pension here should then be reduced.  In practice sporadic reviews of means in those cases take place and suddenly, after three or four years, everybody is being assessed together, which results in difficulties for <Col N="2023" /> some recipients.  Then the Irish pension is also increased and it all gets very confusing. Under this Bill, for the purposes of adjusting the rate of pension payable to a person, by reference to increases in another pension to which he is entitled, separate increases in other pensions may be assessed in aggregate.  One of the rules of the Department of Social Welfare for assessing the pension is that if the increase in the other pension was £1.80 per week, no account is taken of it since it is less than £2.  If the increase in another pension was £2.25 the person would be affected&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Their pension would be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If they receive an increase every year in their UK pension of £1.80 we will try to streamline some provision in that regard.  I do not know the answer to the query raised by Deputy Kavanagh concerning exchange control. I do not think account could be taken of bank charges etc., for the encashment of non-Irish cheques.  Usually a UK pension is paid to the Department of Social Welfare, they encash it and do not charge for it.  When people are paid direct I do not know if that is taken into account.  Different banks have different charges and some banks do not impose any charges &mdash; maybe they are becoming few and far between, but there are occasions when the official does not charge for encashment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 17 we amended the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; to get over the problem of cohabiting couples. Section 18 provides that the means of cohabiting couples will be assessed in the exact same manner as for married people.  Another provision in the section is that maintenance paid by either spouse under a separation order will be subtracted from the means of the paying person because under a court order they have to pay maintenance to their former <Col N="2024" /> spouse.  Not many years ago the income tax legislation was changed to take account of that situation, so this is more or less following on what happens with income tax.  That is basically the purpose of the section.  The section is a technical one but if any Deputy has any further questions I will try to answer them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification in relation to section 18 (a).  The Minister said this paragraph applies to means tested or non-contributory pensions or income.  The manner in which the new section is drafted means that people will be means tested retrospectively for the period in which they qualified and the capital will be treated as income.  If that is followed through it could be a penal clause.  I have no problem as regards account being taken, say, of an inheritance some years ago but in this case they qualified in a period when they had nothing and now it is being treated as income instead of capital for the retrospective period.  That is my interpretation of it but perhaps the Minister has another view on it.</P>

It covers only arrears of pension.  At present these are regarded as capital and a person is assessed on the interest earned whereas under the new system it will be evened out and there may be some winners and losers.  As I said, accident settlements are not covered by this paragraph.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I did not intend to speak to this section <Col N="2025" /> because amendment No. 42 deals with the assessment of means of the self-employed in respect of unemployment assistance but as the Minister and Deputy Connaughton referred to it and in case we do not get to the amendment, I would like to refer to it in a fleeting way.  There is nothing more ridiculous under the social welfare system than telling a carpenter or a painter that they have an income of £100 per week simply because they did some work last year.  At present I am dealing with the case of a married man who has a wife and four children and who has rarely been out of work.  He is a carpenter but cannot find work in that line.  He has been assessed as having an income of £105 per week this year because he did some work last year. While I accept we will deal with this matter later I suggest to the Minister that this provision should be scrubbed straight away.</P>

      <P>Having made and defended a case earlier, I would not be happy in defending that aspect and do not understand the logic behind the idea that because a man did some work last year he is now considered to have the same income.  While I appreciate there would be technical difficulties in trying to devise a system to meet cases involving the category of self-employed person referred to by the Deputy I am not happy with the position.  However, we should cease talking about it because it is not related to this section and we may antagonise the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that this was intentional but the wording of section 18 is open to interpretation.  Neither am I saying the Minister is a dishonourable man, that he will say one thing in the House and do something different at a later stage but Ministers move on and their successors may not have listened to the discussion in the House or be aware <Col N="2026" /> of what the original intentions were.  As I said, the Minister should specify in the regulations what is covered so that the Members of the House will know what his intentions are.  The wording of section 18 (a) is so open that one could drive a horse and cart through it.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek some information from the Minister on this complex section. My initial query concerns the amalgamation of the two existing maternity allowance schemes.  While I am not worried about the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment I ask the Minister to indicate what implications this proposal will have for those women who would be entitled to make a claim under the general maternity allowance scheme which is directed at women who are not in employment or who do not intend to return to work and satisfy certain PRSI conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister explain if those women who would be eligible to receive £50 per week under the general scheme will be affected by the proposal to amalgamate the two maternity allowance schemes?  In his speech the Minister mentioned that since April 1991 employees earning over £25 per week are covered by the social insurance system and that as a result a large number of part-time <Col N="2027" /> workers are now covered by the system. He also referred to those employees covered by the legislation operated by the Department of Labour.  Those are two specific categories of workers and I am concerned that the Minister is likely to exclude in the future those who would otherwise qualify under the general scheme for the £50 per week payment as well as the child dependant allowance.</P>
    <P>In the absence of regulations it is nearly impossible to work out what we are being asked to support.  Indeed, this is only half complete in the sense that regulations will have to be introduced covering various aspects of the Bill.  As a result we are trying to negotiate here with one arm tied behind our backs.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline at this stage what his intentions are in regard to the minimum amount to be prescribed in regulations given that he is trying to address the problems of part-time workers earning over £25 per week who are now covered by the social insurance system?  In his speech the Minister stated &ldquo;this minimum will take account of the fact that women on low earnings who were not previously covered by social insurance will now be covered&rdquo;.  He stated also that the minimum amount would be prescribed in regulations.  It is important that the Minister give us some indication of what figure he is talking about so that we can compare it with the amounts payable under other social welfare schemes, such as disability benefit. Will it be £25 or £50 per week?  This section needs to be teased out further with the Minister who should outline what his intentions are in more detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Byrne, it strikes me that it might be better on certain sections if the House agreed to hear the Minister first so that he could enlighten or elucidate. Perhaps in this way he might dispel some of the anxieties and fears.  Deputies would then be addressing positive statements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be better on this section if I read into the record what the intentions are.  Deputy Byrne said he is opposing the section but I believe he is opposing it only in an effort to find out what the intentions are.  Most workers should benefit.  As Deputies may be aware, there are two maternity payment schemes currently operated by the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment and the general maternity allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment an allowance representing 70 per cent of the woman's reckonable weekly earnings, subject to a minimum amount, is payable for 14 weeks to women in employment who are covered by the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act which is operated by the Department of Labour.  The allowance under the general maternity allowance scheme is payable to insured women who do not qualify for maternity leave under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act.  Under this scheme, a weekly allowance of £50 with additional increases for child dependants is paid for a 12 week period.  Department of Labour legislation relates to hours worked per week and some people do not qualify under that.  The scheme in my Department is more flexible.  Anyone earning over £25 per week now is in the class A rate.  If we did not amalgamate these two schemes some people without the protection of Department of Labour legislation would not be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the extension of the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment, to cover certain part-time workers who are not entitled to maternity leave under the extended provisions of the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act.  These are women who work fewer than eight hours per week and are not therefore covered by that Act.  By virtue of earning more than £25 per week they are covered under the Social Welfare Acts, since 6 April 1991. <Col N="2029" /> In extending the scope of this scheme the opportunity is being taken to consolidate the provisions relating to the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment. Section 19 also provides for the discontinuance of the general maternity allowance scheme previously provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1991.  That Act provided that the general maternity allowance scheme would be discontinued by order.  Section 19 (1) provides for the substitution of new sections 24 to 28 in place of the sections contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy Bell.  Deputy Byrne asked a question about the new minimum.  We are being quite generous there.  The floor, with regard to a part-time woman worker earning in excess of £25 per week, will be set at £60.  People in that category will get more money on maternity benefit than they would from a part-time job. That is a bit of good news.  We are not altogether stingy about this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne and I had more or less the same question to ask although stressing different elements of it.  I and other colleagues sought this change.  We welcome it because it tidies up a confused situation.  As Deputy Fennell will confirm, many women did not know the difference between the two benefits.  The Minister has clarified most of this but there is another element which he should clear up.  Does this change mean that the regulation will stipulate the provisions in the 1991 regulations for part-time workers?  If a woman was earning less than £25 a week, would she get no benefit at all?</P>

      <P>That is the basic question. It is the key.  At the moment women who are not in work are qualifying for a £50 maternity allowance payment.  By amalgamating the two schemes is the Minister only dealing with an organised workforce including those working only eight hours or 24 hours per week and is he excluding from benefit women who are not in employment but who are at the moment benefiting from the maternity allowance? Is an unemployed woman with social insurance coverage eligible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states that this section provides for new definitions designed to facilitate the introduction of attachment of earnings orders.  The sections in Part V of the Bill provide for standardising and streamlining these arrangements and for the granting of attachment of earnings in appropriate cases.  Perhaps the Minister will explain exactly what that means.  I assume that the family court would make the order.  How would the attachment order find its way from the court to the other spouse, who might be in receipt of social welfare benefit or might be working in a different part of the country or in England?  If that spouse is in another EC country, could the attachment of earnings order be enforced?  Could a wife have an attachment made of earnings on a building site in London?  If not, people who do not want to comply with the court order can simply skip the jurisdiction. That happens quite often, even without attachment orders.  Perhaps the Minister would consider entering into discussions with the United Kingdom authorities to see if, within the framework of reciprocal arrangements between EC countries, attachment orders made in our courts could be enforced.  The section will not be effective unless this can be done because people against whom such orders are made will leave the jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has put his finger on the worrying feature.  It is very difficult to enforce attachment of earnings orders.  The procedures are cumbersome and the horse has usually left the stable before action can be taken. Part V of the Bill is designed to strengthen provision in this regard.  Unfortunately people disappear to another jurisdiction, in most cases the United Kingdom.  The provisions of the Bill do not strengthen our hand in that case, but <Col N="2035" /> it may be possible in the context of closer European union to achieve improvements. There are provisions in law which enable us to follow up people outside this jurisdiction but this section does not strengthen the provisions in that regard.  It gives the Department of Social Welfare further powers relating to attachment orders so that some contribution will be made by deserting spouses.  That is the purpose behind this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We have supported legislation which provides that a deserting spouse must contribute towards the maintenance of the other spouse and children. Does the Minister intend to make those provisions applicable to the employer of the deserting spouse, because that is really the way to get to these people?  A person's whereabouts may show up in the British tax system, with which the Department of Social Welfare have a link.  If that was done it would provide an opportunity for employers to pay money from these people's wages.</P>

      <P>That is one of the intentions behind these sections.  They provide that a court may order the employer of a deserting husband or wife to pay money out of the person's wages. Orders such as this are made in other areas of public administration &mdash; for example, in the income tax code.  Since I became Minister I read a report which showed that the percentage of deserting spouses who pay maintenance is very low, and the State has to pick up the tab. The intention is to strengthen the existing powers to provide, as Deputy Ferris said, that people are made responsible for their actions and that they support their deserted wives and children.</P>

      <P>The existing provisions are very cumbersome and in many cases are ineffective.  These are technical provisions designed to speed up the process by which the Department of Social Welfare will be able to follow up the deserting spouse.  If the employer is required to pay money out of the person's wages it would be of help.  The position is getting very serious.  At present the taxpayers have to pay towards maintenance of deserted wives and families.  These sections will give more teeth to the Department of Social Welfare.  Even with the insertion of these provisions there may not be a dramatic improvement but at least there will be legally a more expeditious way of recovering money from a deserting husband.</P>

      <P>I do not have much personal experience of the operation of attachment orders but I have witnessed their operation on a limited number of occasions.  I acknowledge that the Minister is trying to place responsibility primarily on the deserting spouse. However, I do not believe that this will work because if a deserting spouse knows that an attachment order is going to be made against his employer he will not stay in that employment.  As Deputy Bell <Col N="2038" /> said, most deserting husbands would go to Manchester or London.  If I was an employer I would not employ a person with problems such as this.  The last thing an employer wants is problems with attachment orders.  I sincerely hope that the legislation will work but I can see many reasons why it will not.  I have very limited experience in this area but I envisage huge problems arising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Attachment orders are problematic, not just for people in regular employment but also for the self-employed. These people seem quite adept at evading responsibilities, not least of which is the payment of PRSI contributions and taxes.  Will the Minister confirm that strong measures will be taken with regard to attachment orders so that the self-employed in particular are vigorously pursued for payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point raised by Deputy Connaughton.  Racketeering is widespread in this whole area, with men who make girls pregnant walking away from their responsibilities. Not alone do they abandon the girl and the child but they take no responsibility for them morally, physically or financially. This is a pure racket.  People talk about those fathers who go over to the UK; some of them live just down the road, so to speak.  Up until now it seemed that no effort was being made to try to come to grips with the problem.  In the specific case referred to by Deputy Connaughton, the onus and responsibility should be placed on the male to prove the contrary.  In other words, when the case is under investigation the man should be obliged to get a clearance order from the court for production to the Department of Social Welfare.  That procedure could be carried out easily through the offices of the District Court clerk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason for the State to spend further moneys in tracking down guys who have no sense of moral or financial responsibility.  We should not make <Col N="2039" /> things easy for them.  No further money should be spent in investigating and running after those men, the responsibility should be placed on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have to agree with what has been said by Deputies in this regard.  At present there is a very limited amount of success in attempts to track down those people and make them liable.  I have some statistics in this regard that might be of interest to Deputies.  Since the provisions of the 1989 Act came into force on 29 November 1990, 5,796 cases in payment have been examined to determine liability on the part of a spouse to make contributions to the Department.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of the liable relatives in these cases examined to date can be classified as follows: (1) employed/self-employed, 16 per cent; (2) social welfare recipient, 47 per cent; (3) whereabouts cannot be traced at present, 37 per cent.</P>
      <P>Maintenance recovery action is at present pursued by the Department only in the case of persons within category (1), that is, those in employment with the means to make some contribution towards the relevant payment of benefit or allowance.  There are at present 1,018 cases in this category, including 83 cases where the liable relative is resident in the UK.  To date, 32 determination orders have issued to liable relatives directing that weekly payments be made to the Department.  The total weekly value of these orders is £1,707.  The recovery of payments on these orders has, however, not been very successful.  To date, total receipts amount to £1,056.  Payments have so far been received from six cases only.  Nine cases have so far been prepared for civil debt proceedings for non-compliance with the determination orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies would realise from the figures I have given that even since 1989 we have not been very successful in receiving payments from liable relatives.  Deputy Bell is correct in saying that it seems little effort has been made to trace liable <Col N="2040" /> relatives.  I know of one case myself in which there was no effort made.  It is often not the case that a deserting spouse cannot be found.  In some cases the spouse may have gone to England or elsewhere but in other cases he might just have gone down the road.  If the person concerned is on social insurance or in receipt of social assistance then he does not get the dependant allowance.  No contributions at all are made when people are working, even though in theory a spouse might have gone to court and the court might have made an order.  As everyone knows, it is often the case that the horse has already left not only the stable but also the farm.  Often the men concerned involved have gone abroad; at least, they cannot be found.</P>
    <P>The measures under debate are designed to give the Department of Social Welfare strengthened powers.  I would have to be honest and say that in the initial period I do not consider it likely that there will be any great improvement.  If I were to read out similar statistics this time next year, I suspect that they would not be much different from those I have just given.  I hope for an improvement in the situation in time.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 23.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 23 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the debate that has just taken place, I am rather concerned about section 23.  Obviously, <Col N="2041" /> I offer my full support to the Minister in his efforts to trace deviant parents.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, will extend to awards by court order prior to the date of introduction of the liable relatives scheme.  That clause is retrospective. It is my understanding that the orders were first introduced in November 1990.  It is important to have orders against deserting parents, be they men or women.  However, I am concerned that relationships between former spouses and their children that have existed for many years will be disturbed by sudden retrospective claims on agreements that have been worked out in this very delicate and sensitive area.  Over time children would have been placed in schools, a standard of living would have been established and so on.  My profound fear is that making the measure retrospective could cause untold misery and problems in the future and that the claims would not be worth the trouble gone through.</P>
      <P>It seems that there is no power provided within the section that would give anyone the right to appeal a decision that might be taken.  We all say that the Department should get the father and make him pay.  However, the position is never quite as simple as that.  I dealt with a case myself in which it transpired that although a father had deserted his wife and family and she was in receipt of a social welfare benefit, he did in fact continue to pay off the mortgage on the house, where the family was still in residence, and to meet other payments.  If the hammer were brought down on that man then his wife and her family would have suffered miserably.  Some people have been receiving relatively small sums of money on a regular basis for a long period and I am very worried that terrible damage could be done to the very delicate relationships that result from marriage breakdowns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 23, as the Deputy has rightly pointed out, <Col N="2042" /> is to extend the application of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, to awards made before November 1990, when liable relative contributions were introduced.  I understand what Deputy Byrne means.  However, the 1990 provision related to awards made after November 1990.  Surely it is only fair that those whose awards were made previous to then should have the provisions of that Act extended to them.  I do not think the Deputy has too much to worry about on this issue.  The Deputy seems to be worried that people who have straightened out their affairs since that period might find that their relationship &mdash; perhaps one of &ldquo;living in bliss by living apart&rdquo;&mdash; is upset.  The intent of the measure seems to be very obvious.  It is designed to extend the provisions that applied from November 1990 to awards made before then.  I think that the Deputy is worried unduly in this regard, although I might be considering the issue from a different point of view than Deputy Byrne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say that he understood my point.  He must remember that in circumstances in which marriages will have broken down, where second relationships will have been established, where a husband is still making some type of payment to the wife, everything is very delicate, with second relationships, second families, or whatever but there remains a transfer of payments from the husband to the wife.  The Minister is asking: why not make it all retrospective?  Yet when one examines the section dealing with deserted wife's benefit we discover there is no proposal there for retrospection; in that case it will apply as and from a date the Minister decides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>These were orders made prior to 29 November 1990, under which, say, husband X was to pay wife Y £Xs.  Those orders remain in force and those husbands are supposed to be paying <Col N="2043" /> those amounts.  All we are endeavouring to do here is extend the conditions applicable as from 29 November 1990, to orders made prior to that date.  The principle the Deputy is outlining is not being interferred with in this regard, or at least I do not think so; we are just trying to extend it.</P>

      <P>Here we have amendment No. 32 in the name of Deputy Byrne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 28, subsection (1) (b), between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a motion approving of each draft has been passed by each such House&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am very worried about the proposed regulations to be made under this section. As I have said before, so often throughout this Bill, we empower the Minister to bring in regulations, very often without knowing on what basis.  For example, it says in the explanatory memorandum:</P>
      <P>In addition, section 25 empowers the Minister to make regulations separately from regulations under the Deserted Wife's Allowance scheme specifying the circumstances in which a woman is to be regarded as having been deserted by her husband for the purposes of the Deserted Wife's Benefit scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> That could mean anything.  For example, the Minister's regulations could be so repressive as to render the provisions of the scheme unworkable for many deserted wives.  On those grounds alone the Minister should take my amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>To continue that line of thought, the provisions of this section mean that a woman's entitlement to deserted wife's benefit will be means tested, I might add a benefit contributed already by way of PRSI contributions. For example, in making the regulation the Minister will be allowed to determine the level at which he will cut off eligibility for benefit based on the wife's income. Effectively that is a total change from the circumstances prevailing.  At present a woman is entitled to benefit on the basis of contributions paid.  I contend there should be no means testing of her eligibility therefor.  This is a fundamental change.  I know there has been media speculation to the effect that the Minister intends to pitch the limit at an income of approximately £12,000 per annum for a woman who is deserted, means testing her on £12,000 of her income, debarring her from benefit on the basis that, although she is deserted &mdash; because she already has £12,000 income &mdash; she will not be paid deserted wife's benefit.  That is what the section means.</P>
      <P>The regulations also mean that the Minister &mdash; perhaps not the present one but one of his successors &mdash; effectively could apply that means testing successively at lower levels for budgetary reasons in the future.  This would mean a woman could be debarred from drawing deserted wife's benefit, although deserted, by having an income of, say, £8,000 next year.  Effectively it gives the Minister immense powers by way of regulation but, in addition, introduces a whole new method of means testing of benefits eligible by reference to contributions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I want to add my voice to what has been said by other Members about our difficulty in accepting the powers given to the Minister to introduce regulations.  On a proposal as major as this I contend the regulations should be included with or incorporated in the Bill because, in the long run, the Minister can decide absolutely anything.  For example, I had a difference of opinion with the Minister for the Environment when we were in the course of Committee Stage of the Control of Dogs Bill.  He was endeavouring to define a &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;, when all Members present were most anxious to know exactly what was the definition.  He could not define it in the Bill but we discovered he could in the regulations.  The same applies here in that the Minister can decide anything he likes about deserted wives.  I contend such major decisions should comprise part of the Bill rather than the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two or three points to raise here.  Why the change and what is the rationale behind it?  For example, how many people does the Minister expect will be covered by the provisions of this scheme?  As Deputy Ferris said, it is a new method of means testing.  Indeed it is similar to our debate of last evening on the curtailment of the dental scheme for people earning in excess of £25,000 per annum.  I know the Minister is empowered to bring in regulations.  In certain circumstances I could understand the Minister being guided by this House within certain limits, so that we would know exactly what he intended doing.  For example, I do not see the figure of £12,000, the cut-off point, referred to in the explanatory memorandum.  I am not sure whether the Minister himself said it might be pitched at approximately £12,000 or whether I read that in the newspapers.  One way or the other I would not be happy with the proposal until I ascertained exactly what the Minister proposes and, more importantly, <Col N="2046" /> why.  Is the Minister suggesting that there are very many deserted wives who earn or have a personal income in excess of £12,000?  Numerically speaking I should have thought there would not have been a great number nationwide.  Nonetheless the proposal is to introduce a new method of means testing.  I would have to predict that many people at present in receipt of deserted wife's benefit might well fear for next year or the year after when that ceiling of £12,000 would be lowered, that is if the Minister's objective is to save money.  Perhaps the Minister's purpose is different, for a reason I cannot see.  For example, is there some sort of scam of which we are not aware?  Is it that some of the Minister's officials are bringing back information to the effect that there is something gravely wrong in that area but, if there is, let the Minister tell us because certainly it is not obvious at present.</P>
      <P>Finally, would the Minister say whether he envisages any circumstances arising in which he could report back to this House when he decides exactly what he proposes introducing by way of regulation? If that proposal turns out to be greatly different from what we have heard in this House we are entitled to be told and have our say on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely opposed to this section on the grounds advanced today and those voiced in my contribution on Second Stage.  I contend this runs absolutely counter to the tenor of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare in that the Minister is introducing a new method of means testing. We must remember &mdash; as has been said repeatedly &mdash; that there are at least 50 means tested schemes administered by various Government Departments.  The last thing anybody needs is to be further confused by any more.  Inevitably when a cut-off level of, say, £12,000 is imposed &mdash; and we are now speaking of deserted wives who are working &mdash; there will be those who will either be more exploited <Col N="2047" /> by their employer or the temptation will be, for many on the borderline, to ask their employer to deduct, say, between £5 and £15 from their salaries so that they would continue to qualify.  Such a disastrous provision has no place in the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us the number of deserted wives earning in excess of £12,000 and how much of this money is clawed back by way of tax.  The allowance will be restricted to a deserted wife whose earnings are at or below £12,000 per year.  We must remember that we are not talking about massive sums of money in the context of the deserted wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>The setting of an income limit in this regard will be very unfair to deserted wives who have suffered enough trauma by being deserted.  A very important principle is involved here.  The Minister is seeking to break this principle in at least three sections.  Reference was made earlier to the arrangements in regard to dental and optical treatment.  The vast majority of women who pay money into this insurance scheme will never have to call upon it as they will not be deserted. However, some women are deserted by their husbands and it is wrong to further penalise these people.  I am totally opposed to this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>This regrettable measure proposes to target a very vulnerable group in our society.  I cannot think of any group in our society who are more unfortunate than deserted wives.  As its title suggests, the deserted wife's allowance is given to women who have been abandoned and deserted.  In many cases these women have to rear their children, pay the mortgages on their houses and plan for the future on their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is proposing that these women should live on limited income. Deserted wives who earn more than £12,000 will not be able to receive a deserted wife's allowance.  As Deputy <Col N="2048" /> Byrne said, this will open the floodgates to abuse of the system &mdash; these women may take up part-time work and try to manipulate the system in some way.  The deserted wife's allowance is very important to these women; this weekly income is crucial to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a fundamental point which I forgot to make the last time I spoke on this section.  Up to now the Department of Social Welfare classified the deserted wife's allowance, and other payments, under the heading of lone parent allowances as the payments and the contributions are the same.  I am concerned that in future a widow in receipt of benefit could be treated in the same way as the Minister is now proposing to treat deserted wives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party are opposed to the principle of means testing benefits.  There is a possibility that in future a widow who is receiving benefit from her late husband's contributions or her contributions could be means tested to assess her eligibility for a widow's pension. Admittedly the deserted wife's allowance is already means tested but benefit schemes have never been means tested. <Col N="2049" /> This is the first time it has been proposed to means test these benefits.  There is a possibility that all other lone parent allowances could be included in this section by the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister be so insensitive as to arbitrarily fix a figure of £12,000 when dealing with deserted wives?  One deserted wife might have only one child and may not have to pay a mortgage while another deserted wife may have ten children and have to pay a mortgage.  Consideration should have been given to the outlays of such women before the figure of £12,000 was set.  If we agree to this section without knowing what will be in the regulations we could make a bad situation worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could do better to put this issue into context than to refer to a letter which the Minister received from the recipient of a deserted wife's allowance.  She said:</P>
      <P>In common with other insured workers I have been forced since I started work in 1974 to pay into an insurance scheme which would give me certain entitlements.  I never anticipated a time when I would be claiming deserted wife's benefit.</P>
      <P>I do not believe any woman would think of taking out insurance to cover herself in the event of her husband deserting her; I do not think any woman believes she needs to insure herself against that eventuality.  She continued:</P>
      <P>A gross income ceiling of £12,000 per annum has been proposed.  What Government Minister or TD would singlehandedly raise and educate a family on a gross income of £12,000 per annum?</P>
      <P>She went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many women engage in paid employment &mdash; if they can get it &mdash; to try to keep their families out of the poverty trap.  To do so can mean <Col N="2050" /> expensive child-minding costs, transport costs, etc....</P>
    <P>These women also have to meet expensive maintenance costs.  Very few women receive training on how to replace tiles on roofs and so on.  All this maintenance work has to be paid for.  It is well known that the average weekly wage of women is only 60 per cent of that earned by men. That woman made a further point, to which I hope the Minister can give a positive answer.  She asked:</P>
    <P>Is there an underlying misogynistic motive to this &mdash; to keep women powerless, out of the workforce and subjugated to poverty?</P>

      <P>I could not have put it better myself. Please get rid of the tokenism and lip service and respond positively.  Does the Minister believe that women and their children can live on £12,000?  It is bad enough to be on a low income but to enshrine it in legislation does not give one great hope in regard to working towards equal pay and equal opportunities, particularly for parents.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that Deputy Owen is not here; perhaps she is watching us on the monitor.  Facing all the women members of Fine Gael can force any Minister to examine these sections.  However, people are being carried away by this section; they should retain their sense of proportion.  This section will apply to new claimants only and there will not be any effect on the deserted wife's allowance.  As far as I can ascertain, there is no other country in which a man can insure himself against deserting his wife and that the State will pay for it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps after such a long time on Committee Stage we are all getting tired.  However, we have had a good debate on many aspects of the Bill. Many schemes have been introduced over the years but this one is not in operation anywhere else.  Whatever about insuring against snow in July, I cannot understand the insurance aspect of a deserted wife's benefit.  I am not convinced that the deserted wife's benefit should be part of the social insurance system.  Indeed, I say openly and honestly, without fear or favour, that I will take a lot of convincing in that regard.  I do not think that too many people will disagree with my policy in this regard. Most of the plain people in the country feel the same way.  The principle is difficult for me to comprehend.  Deputies have asked which people will be affected by the regulations.  The decision announced some months ago said that it would apply to those who had an income in excess of £12,000.  However, there will <Col N="2052" /> be a tapering relief up to £14,000 because it would be a little harsh to have an arbitrary cut-off point.</P>
      <P>I have heard all the arguments about social insurance but I cannot give an estimate of the tax which will be saved as a result of this measure.  The deserted wife's benefit may be subject to tax if there is any other income.  I know from my past life that the Revenue Commissioners operate a principle of reliefs in the first year, a practice has grown up in that regard.  The deserted wife's benefit can continue indefinitely on the insurance record of the husband or wife.  I have been more than generous in saying this measure will apply only to new claimants. The number affected by the provision this year will be very small, the savings will also be small.  The decision in relation to this measure was announced by my predecessor, Deputy Daly, last December and I have no difficulty in supporting it.  While it may upset my good friend, Deputy Barnes, to hear it, if this option had been put to me last December I might have taken a harder line in relation to deserted wives.</P>

      <P>I listened on the monitor to what Deputies said about deserted wives, we all feel sorry for them.  However, there are also many deserted husbands. What about an allowance for a deserted husband?  If a man with three or four children has been deserted by his wife, under what circumstances will he get an allowance?  The second paragraph of section 25 specifies the circumstances in which the deserted wife's allowance is given, but there is no mention of the husband.  I assume the Minister means both, because there is a growing number of deserted husbands.</P>
      <P>Of course, as we all know, the deserted wife's scheme has often been abused and we must ensure that the benefits go to genuinely deserted wives.  Some situations in this regard have been manufactured and I do not blame any Minister for tidying them up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>He is baffled and mesmerised and cannot understand how holy, Catholic Ireland has such a ridiculous deserted wife's benefit scheme. Did the Minister ever consider why these countries do not have such a scheme? They all have divorce.  When marriage breaks down in Ireland, people do not have the option of taking the civilised route of divorce proceedings, they scatter helter skelter and run away from the problem, perhaps going to England.  We, the legislators, have not provided them with the civil right to go through the legal process of humanely and honestly breaking up and dividing their resources. The reason that deserted wife's benefit is built into the social welfare system is that it is the classic Irish form of divorce. Because the State is not able to accommodate the situation where Danny does a runner and the marriage breaks down, the State introduced a deserted wife's benefit scheme.  I do not see anything wrong with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the technical point raised by Deputy Bell. He is referring to section 25 (2).  This provides for a technical amendment to section 100 (2) of the 1981 Act, which deals with the circumstances in which a woman is to be regarded as having been <Col N="2054" /> deserted for the purposes of entitlement to deserted wife's benefit.  Under existing provisions the circumstances under which a woman is to be regarded as having been deserted for the purposes of deserted wife's benefit are determined in accordance with regulations made under section 195 (4) (a), which relates to the deserted wife's allowance scheme.  This arrangement was appropriate when the two deserted wife's payments schemes were introduced.  Following on the introduction of the lone parent's allowance scheme in 1990 the residual deserted wife's allowance scheme now caters only for deserted wives aged 40 years or over who do not have child dependants. Because of this change in the deserted wife's allowance scheme a woman entitled to deserted wife's benefit is technically, although not in practice, regarded as receiving reasonable maintenance from her husband if she is receiving maintenance equal to or greater than the maximum personal rate of deserted wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>Section 25 (1) (b) remedies this technical defect by providing for separate regulations to be made in relation to the deserted wife's benefit scheme specifying the circumstances in which a woman is to be regarded as having been deserted by her husband.  The regulations will provide that a woman will be regarded as having been deserted if the maintenance, if any, which she receives is less than the rate of deserted wife's benefit appropriate to her family circumstances.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states that this provision will come into operation by way of a commencement order.  This is a technical amendment and there is no change in the fundamental underlying principle of desertion.  It is a tidying up exercise to facilitate the changeover in the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point Deputy Byrne raised is a matter to which the Cabinet will be giving great consideration over the remaining period in office.  I would not necessarily disagree with the points the Deputy has made about the schemes which result <Col N="2055" /> from the fact that we have not faced up to other problems.  The Government will be considering the other aspects he raised <Col N="2056" /> in due course but they have nothing to do with the Social Welfare Bill, 1992.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue.  In my constituency yesterday morning 36 families woke up to find that the tyres of their cars had been slashed.  In some cases cars had one or two tyres slashed and in others four.  All of these families are incurring hundreds of pounds in expenses to put right the damage done.  Forty families in Tallaght were in the same position.  In one night in south Dublin 76 cars had their tyres slashed.</P>
      <P>I understand that this tyre slashing is part of an attempt by a gang of criminals to intimidate the Garda in Rathfarnham and Tallaght to prevent them from fully investigating a serious crime committed in the area some days ago.  I am saying on behalf of my constituents that the people of Rathfarnham will not give in to this type of intimidation and they will fully support the Garda in the work they are doing.  I am sure the people in Tallaght who were similarily affected will take the same view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to raise this today as I want an assurance from the Minister for Justice that the Garda will be provided with all the necessary resources to fully complete the investigation they are making into the original crime which took place some days ago.  I also want an assurance <Col N="2061" /> that the Garda in south Dublin will be given any additional resources and manpower they require to enable them to fully police the areas in the coming days so as to ensure that this gang are not let loose on the streets to terrorise and intimidate the local community.  I want a guarantee from the Minister that a similar incident will not occur because the Garda are understaffed and unable to provide the type of surveillance necessary.  I appreciate that the Garda have a very difficult job and that it is very difficult to totally police an area the size of south Dublin.  However, the Garda are currently under-resourced and understaffed. Will the Minister in this emergency consider drafting additional gardaí into the area temporarily until those responsible for the events of Tuesday evening are brought before our courts and are properly convicted for the incidents that have taken place?</P>
    <P>I had an informal discussion with the Minister for Justice yesterday and he said that he would look into the matter.  I am raising this out of concern for my constituents and to ensure that the Minister has an opportunity in the Dáil to state the action the Government intend to take to provide the Garda with the support they need.</P>
    <P>It is understood that a well known criminal in Dublin is behind the incidents that took place and that it is his gang who are seeking to terrorise and intimidate this community to try to force the Garda not to complete a serious and important investigation.  Some time ago a decision was made to engage in intensive surveillance of this criminal.  That worked for a period in curtailing the activities.  If the Minister or the Garda Commissioner think it is necessary at this stage to again provide such intensive surveillance, he will have the full support of Members of the Fine Gael Party.  I would urge the Minister to look into the feasibility of such an approach so as to ensure that not only those who committed these crimes in the Rathfarnham and Tallaght areas are brought to justice, but to ensure also that the person who directed them and who is the leader of this gang is brought <Col N="2062" /> before our courts and sent to prison following a proper trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share Deputy Shatter's concern about this dreadful vandalism against private citizens' cars which occurred in Rathfarnham and Tallaght in the early hours of yesterday morning.  I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy to the victims of these deplorable acts.  I assure this House that this type of wanton attack on the property of hard-working citizens will not be tolerated.  The Garda authorities are determined that the perpetrators of these acts will be brought to justice soon.  When that happens and these individuals are brought before the courts they will come to face the full rigour of the law.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested in the media that these incidents took place as a result of an arrest made by the Garda Síochána. We cannot know for certain that this is the case.  In any event, I want to assure the House and the general public that any such effort to deter the Garda from performing their duties is certain to fail. No thug or criminal gang will deter the Garda from enforcing the law in this State. Such futile attempts at intimidation only succeed in producing a greater resolve by the Garda to ensure that law and order is upheld.</P>
      <P>While it is not the practice for Ministers for Justice to make statements in relation to crimes which are under investigation, I can say that the Garda authorities have informed me that they are making good progress in this investigation and have taken steps to prevent a recurrence of these despicable acts.  For obvious reasons I cannot say in detail what these are, but they include a substantial increase in foot and mobile patrols in each of the areas involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manning levels have increased from 101 to 108 at present in Tallaght and from 52 to 62 over the same period in Rathfarnham.  Both areas in question, Bancroft in Tallaght and Butterfield in Rathfarnham are served by community <Col N="2063" /> gardaí.  I understand that both of these areas have neighbourhood watch schemes and I would urge the residents, not only of these areas but all over the city, to support and assist the gardaí in preventing and detecting crime.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that their resources are adequate to deal with crime and vandalism in these areas.  I have been further assured by the Garda authorities that the situation in relation to these incidents is being closely monitored and that any further action which may prove necessary to deal with the problem will be taken.  I am confident that no effort will be spared by the Garda to ensure that those responsible for these mindless acts will be apprehended soon and brought to justice in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his responsibility for development.</P>
      <P>When it comes to speaking about Africa and the underdevelopment and diffificulties of the people living in vast areas of that country very often we run out of superlatives to describe the hardships. The worst drought in 50 years is currently threatening 23 million people with starvation and death in the Horn of Africa in countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia.  What makes the current situation even worse than before is that countries that up to now have begun to be able to cope with their own food requirements, such as Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Nambia and South Africa, are all being affected by this drought.  South Africa was usually a country that could supply food to its neighbours but now they too will have to import food for the coming season.  Very little food is available for their own use, let alone left over for neighbouring stricken countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not need the harrowing <Col N="2064" /> reminders of television pictures and newspaper articles to highlight for us in the developed world the horrors and the magnitude of the catastrophe which can occur when these numbers of people are threatened with starvation and death. The world community has a moral obligation to respond immediately to this crisis and very substantial food aid supplies must be made available in Africa if many hundreds of thousands of people are not to die of starvation.  Crops have failed all over and the need for food aid will continue until the rains come and the new harvest grows.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in its own right, must respond to this disastrous situation.  I know the Minister has already received at least one application for £100,000 worth of aid from Trócaire and I am sure he has received other applications for assistance. Trócaire tell me that they are inundated with requests from countries like Malawi, Ethiopia and Somalia and they cannot meet all the requests.</P>
    <P>Despite the general disappointment expressed in this House and outside the bilateral aid budget for 1992 has been cut, there is £1 million available in that budget for disaster relief.  I am asking the Minister to release that money immediately.</P>
    <P>The situation is so grave that I am urging the Minister to propose at the next Council of Development Ministers, the setting up of a special programme for Africa similar to that set up in 1991.  This programme must make a commitment, as it did in 1991, of an extra 400,000 tonnes of food aid.  A number of countries, such as South Africa and Zimbabwe, will have to import millions of tonnes of food to feed their people, thus using very badly needed hard currency. Zambia will have to import 800,000 tonnes of food costing, according to one newspaper, £171 million.  These countries do not have that kind of money.  It is reckoned in Namibia that they have lost 80 per cent of their commercial maize crop.  Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland <Col N="2065" /> have all announced that they will need to import food.</P>
    <P>This is a crisis which is perhaps beyond any that has as yet had to be faced on the continent of Africa.  The responsibility rests on the Minister and his colleagues at the Council of Development Ministers to answer these calls from the threatened 23 million people.  I hope the Minister will be able to make his mark as being the one who proposed and guided through the EC this special programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, has already spoken of wanting to see Ireland play its part towards alleviating poverty, famine and disease in the Third World.  I hope these words will be put into action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Owen for her good wishes on my appointment.  We are fully aware of her deep commitment and the concern she has shown on the issue in question and on many other issues over a number of years.  I value her views on this and on many other matters related to overseas aid, to which she has paid special attention. The Government are very concerned about the serious situation in the Horn of Africa, where an estimated 23 million people have been affected, directly or indirectly, by drought, food shortages and conflict.</P>
      <P>While there has been some improvement since last year in the case of Ethiopia, this cannot, unfortunately, be said of the other Horn of Africa countries of Sudan, Somalia, Djibouti and Kenya. Particularly in Sudan the situation gives little reason for optimism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is doing what it can to confront this problem both bilaterally and through multilateral organisations, in particular the EC, which is a major donor in the area.  It contributes both long term and emergency food aid through the Lomé Convention.  Apart from this, in 1991 the EC Commission and EC member states combined provided over £80 million <Col N="2066" /> worth of food aid to the Horn of Africa, in which, of course, Ireland participated. Ireland also provided generous bilateral emergency aid.  The Horn of Africa has, in fact, been the biggest single beneficiary of Irish Government relief aid which, since January 1990, amounts to nearly £2 million.  This includes £250,000 which was a special allocation to the World Food Programme for food aid to the Sudan in 1991.</P>
    <P>However, the problems of this area remain vast.  The World Food Programme has estimated the total food requirements in the area for 1992 to be over two million metric tonnes.  The need is not just one of food aid.  In Ethiopia, despite the achievement of a peace settlement in 1991, there are an estimated four and a half million people affected by drought.  The 30-year civil war has left a legacy of a crippled economy, an infrastructure which has been destroyed and a massive number of refugees and internally displaced persons.  Food shortages and the resulting weakened condition of large numbers of people have rendered them highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and measles.</P>
    <P>In Sudan, which is still experiencing drought and civil war, the World Food Programme has estimated that although there has been an increase in food production, seven or eight million people will require food aid in 1992 necessitating food assistance of over one million tonnes.  Sudan too, suffers from a major refugee population and internal displacement on a massive scale.  A further problem is that of the displaced population in Khartoum, which totals at least one million.</P>
    <P>In the last year, the Government have been trying to force the people out of Khartoum in large numbers to completely inadequate sites, some distance from the city where they will be without basic facilities or means of livelihood. The Irish Government, along with their EC partners and UN representatives in <Col N="2067" /> Khartoum, have expressed concern to the Sudanese authorities and stated that any movement of these people should be on a voluntary basis and under proper conditions.  I will continue to actively pursue this matter.</P>
    <P>The other countries in the Horn of Africa region are also undergoing major difficulties.  Three years of civil war have left Somalia in ruins and without the basic essentials and there is ongoing instability and violence.  Over two million people, out of a total population of seven million, have fled from urban to rural areas in search of relief assistance.</P>
    <P>The problems in the Horn of Africa are on such a large scale that only a major international relief effort can hope to avert a crisis.  The Secretary General of the United Nations, in 1991, issued the first phase of its Consolidated InterAgency Appeal for its Special Emergency Programme for the Horn of Africa and this was renewed in February of this year.  The 1991 appeal called for $400 million and raised $260 million.  The second phase is seeking $600 million, most of which is for food aid.  This leaves a serious shortfall.  Part of the Irish bilateral emergency contribution to the Horn of Africa was made through this channel and a further allocation is being actively considered.  A generous response by the international community is crucial if a total crisis and a famine on the scale of 1984 and 1985 is to be avoided.</P>
    <P>A new Special EC Aid Plan for Africa, on the lines of the 1991 plan, has been called for and the Government will, of course, positively examine this proposal.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to draw public attention to the very serious crisis developing in this area and the urgent need to deal with it effectively.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Port Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Port dispute is of grave importance not just to the more than 200 workers directly involved <Col N="2068" /> and, of course, to their families whose livelihood is threatened but also to the future of Dublin Port and the many thousands of jobs indirectly linked to the port. I have no doubt that the Minister is well aware of the importance to the whole economy of this country's premier port. It must be of serious concern to him to see the Dublin Port and Docks Board in a mood of deliberate confrontation &mdash; one could even say on a collision course. The inevitable result of the board's apparent determination to liquidate Dublin Cargo Handling will be industrial chaos.</P>
      <P>The board have adopted a hamfisted approach to solving the problem in Dublin Cargo Handling by issuing an ultimatum to the workers to either accept the board's demands, which involve redundancy for nearly one-third of the workforce and various other dramatic changes in traditional work practices, or alternatively to face liquidation, which would undoubtedly mean the loss of all the jobs involved.  It would be a catastrophe for the men and their families and would place the whole future of the port in jeopardy.  Because the men yesterday deferred a decision to vote on this ultimatum the port board now say that there will be no further negotiations and that the liquidation will go ahead.  This strategy of the Port and Docks Board amounts to blackmail and is certainly no way to conduct industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last 20 years or more I have witnessed the tragic decline in the labour force of the docks.  Years ago members of virtually every inner city family were employed directly or indirectly by the Port and Docks Board including my late father.  However, the position is different today, and that surely makes it all the more urgent to save the jobs that remain. It would be a major social disaster in the inner city if more than 200 jobs were lost. Yet it seems that the port board are intent on allowing that.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene in this dispute before it is too late and to bring the two sides together in <Col N="2069" /> new negotiations to resolve the differences in the normal way between employer and employees and their unions.</P>
    <P>I would point out, in the words of Michael Hayes, General Secretary of the Marine Port and General Workers' Union, that the position in Dublin Cargo Handling is not hopeless and that the workers are willing to accept change and, indeed, acknowledge the need for it.  The dockers clearly accept the need for reorganisation and an end to restrictive practices. They want to negotiate and reach agreement but I regret that the port board are not prepared to negotiate.  Why is this?  Is it because the board wish to arbitrarily change the conditions of employment rather than wait for the findings of an independent assessor as was agreed following the Labour Court's recommendations of last year?  Is it because the board wish to impose draconian working conditions on the employees and disregard recently negotiated legally binding registered agreements? Is it because the board wish to transfer the business of Dublin Cargo Handling to certain interested parties, including some of the companies bought out in 1982, with the intention of using the liquidation as a vehicle to frustrate the legal obligations that would exist under a normal transfer of business?</P>
    <P>I pose these questions because these are the very real expressed fears of the workers in Dublin Cargo Handling.  I am sure the Minister will agree that since the inception of Dublin Cargo Handling work practices and conditions of the dock workforce have dramatically changed and the number of employed has been more than halved.  Surely this underlines the genuine willingness of the workforce to accept and facilitate change.  I want the Minister to be in no doubt that the Dublin Cargo Handling workforce are clearly indicating that they are prepared to negotiate change to the benefit of Dublin Cargo Handling.  I again appeal to the Minister, whom I know to be a fair <Col N="2070" /> and caring person, to use his good offices to reopen negotiations to bring to an end the threat of liquidation, thereby achieving long term industrial peace and stability, which Dublin Port so badly needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Harbours Act, 1946, Dublin Port and Docks Board are responsible for the management of Dublin Port.  The port is divided into three separate labour sectors: (i) the cross channel sector where companies employ their own labour and operate from allocated berths; (ii) a sector comprising oil imports and ore and Guinness exports &mdash; companies in this sector employ their own labour but operate from common user berths; and (iii) the deep sea sector where the berths are common user and the labour is provided by Dublin Cargo Handling Limited (DCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
      <P>The present difficulties relate to the deep sea sector of the port and the employees of Dublin Cargo Handling. Dublin Cargo Handling Limited were established in 1982 as an initial attempt to rationalise labour in the deep sea sector of the port as a response to the chaotic situation which had arisen, with nine stevedoring companies operating independently of each other and their financial viability being quickly eroded by rigid labour practices.</P>
      <P>In 1985 Dublin Port was left with a 100 per cent shareholding in Dublin Cargo Handling following the withdrawal of the private stevedoring company, Associated Port Terminals, in the face of heavy losses.  Dublin Cargo Handling have continued since to suffer heavy losses.  From 1982 to the end of 1990 Dublin Cargo Handling's accumulated losses, together with redundancy payments of £7.6 million, reached a total of £16.2 million. Dublin Cargo Handling incurred losses of approximately £1.5 million last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of these continuing losses, the board and management of Dublin <Col N="2071" /> Port and Dublin Cargo Handling took the view that the loss-making situation at Dublin Cargo Handling was unsustainable. A major study by Stokes Kennedy Crowley on the organisation of stevedoring in the port was commissioned and completed in May 1991. The study report concluded that the effect of Dublin Cargo Handling's losses limited the capacity of the port authority to fund necessary capital development and discouraged the growth of trade through the port.  The Stokes Kennedy Crowley report identified a range of problems, including overstaffing at all levels, high absenteeism and sickness, low average utilisation of dock labour, inefficiencies, poor labour allocation systems and no prospect of profitability.  The lack of choice for ships but to use Dublin Cargo Handling and the high cost of services were also highlighted.  The competitiveness of Dublin Port was also a matter of serious concern to the Culliton Review Group on industrial policy, with a low frequency of services and shorter opening hours being particularly highlighted.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Dublin Port, as the premier port in the State, is of critical national importance.  In the face of stiff competition from other ports, both in the State and in Northern Ireland, it is vital that an efficient and cost-competitive service at the port is established.  That is what the Dublin Port and Docks Board say they are trying to achieve by means of their current rationalisation and restructuring proposals.  The industrial relations difficulties centre on the need to bring operations at the port into line with modern practices so as to ensure the future viability of the port in the face of growing competition.  It is vital that work practices be changed if the efficient, and reliable movement of goods and services is to be assured.</P>
    <P>A six week unofficial strike took place at the port last December and January. Arising from intensive discussions <Col N="2072" /> between both sides a formula for a return to work on 20 January was agreed.</P>
    <P>This return to work formula involved provisions for further discussions between the parties, with the help of the Labour Relations Commission, to bring about a negotiated settlement to the issues of increased flexibility, involving a restructuring of stevedoring operations. In view of the fact that little progress in these talks was being made, the Dublin Port and Docks Board decided on 19 February that Dublin Cargo Handling should be put in liquidation unless the situation could be resolved.  In response, the Marine Port and General Workers Union served strike notice.  Despite further intensive discussions at the Labour Relations Commission, no agreement was reached.  These discussions centred on a set of proposals which Dublin Cargo Handling put to the Marine Port and General Workers Union.  These proposals provided for restructuring and redundancies.  The redundancy package on offer to workers was upgraded during the course of negotiations and would mean an average of about £40,000 per person.  Other aspects of the package include phased compensation of £8,000 in return for flexibility on the part of those who remain.  The 189 dockers and checkers were due to vote on these proposals yesterday but decided to defer the ballot.</P>
    <P>A settlement of the matters at issue between Dublin Cargo Handling and the workers is essentially a matter for resolution between themselves.  As I have indicated, the Labour Relations Commission have been extensively involved already, but if they or the Labour Court can provide further assistance in reaching a satisfactory resolution of the difficulties they remain available to do so at my instruction.</P>
    <P>The essential issue in this dispute is the future of the deep sea sector of Dublin Port and its ability to provide a competitive service.  That issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> The issues involved cannot be postponed for much longer, as the High Court is due to consider the petition to liquidate and wind up on 6 April next.  I fully appreciate that the issues involved are complex and historic but, having regard to all the implications, I would call on the parties to make further efforts, even at this late stage, to reach a settlement.  As I have indicated to the Deputy, whose concern in this regard I know is genuine, the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are ready to assist and I invite them to do so.</P>

      <P>The regional college has been an educational landmark in Ireland and we are very proud of the students from all over the country who come to Carlow.  We are also very proud of the new multi-purpose centre that has been opened there at a cost of £750,000.  I suppose that we would be even more proud if this very excellent multi-purpose centre could be opened quickly for the use of students and others who might wish to avail themselves of the facilities.  It is unfortunate that an investment of £750,000 is not being utilised to the full.  For that reason, I hope the Minister will inform me that any holdup will not be prolonged by his Department. I should perhaps be more positive and say I hope that any financial aid required will be provided by the Minister so that both management and staff will be able to enjoy this wonderful facility.</P>

      <P>The reason for the temporary closure was stated to be inadequate financial resources to provide the staff required to maintain and take care of the centre. My Department have been in touch with County Carlow Vocational Education Committee on the question of the RTC pay budget and have agreed to allocate additional pay resources in respect of the college.  This will enable the college to provide the required staffing to maintain the centre.  Additional funds for this purpose were also allocated in 1991.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to his new portfolio.  I look forward to as positive an answer to the question of the Old Borough national school in Swords, as was received by Deputy John Browne in respect of the matter he raised.  This school was built in 1809 for the poor of the borough in Fingal.  Since then very little has been done to the school by the State other than the provision in recent years of new toilets.  At present, there are 80 pupils, mostly non-Catholics, attending this school, the only Protestant school serving the areas of Swords, Donabate and Ashbourne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accommodation consists of one large room in which three classes &mdash; first, second and third &mdash; are taught by one teacher.  A portion of this large room has been fenced off, as it were, and there another two classes, junior and senior infants, are taught by another teacher. <Col N="2075" /> The remainder of the pupils &mdash; in fourth, fifth and sixth classes &mdash; are taught by the principal of this school is one prefab building in the back of the school.  The prefab building was erected in September 1990 and at this stage the upstairs portion of the school building has been declared unsafe.  In fact, it is my information that the whole building did not pass an electrical test carried out some time ago.</P>
    <P>The prefab classroom is completely unsatisfactory, particularly on wet days. There are no facilities for the teachers, who must make their coffee in the corner of one of the classrooms.  The cost of the prefab building to the Department and board of governors has been approximately £373 per month since September 1990.  For that reason I contend that £4,000 has been unnecessarily expended by the Minister's Department while the school awaits its refurbishment. The board of governors are not anxious to spend any more money on this dilapidated building as they feel they would be merely throwing good money after bad. The playground facilities are located in the car park on a slope of approximately 30 to 35 degree angle, the school gate opening beside a set of traffic lights on a busy road.</P>
    <P>Tender documents have been received in the Minister's Department.  I urge the Minister not to wait until 1993 to invite tenders for this project.  There is double urgency about the matter, and not only because of the unnecessary rental charges on the prefabricated building and unnecessary spending on the part of the board of governors.  It is the only school in the area catering for non-Catholic primary school children.  Indeed there is the risk of a claim of discrimination against these children, particularly since so many of the Catholic schools have been upgraded in recent years &mdash; a welcome development in itself.  There can be very few schools nationwide built as far back as 1809 which have not been upgraded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for her kind remarks.  Unfortunately, I do not think I can deliver in this case.  The position is that the Old Borough national school, Swords, County Dublin, has a principal and two assistants in this permanent school.  There were 75 enrolments in September 1991.  The school is in an old building of two storeys over a basement.  In February 1991 the school's private architect was given approval to apply for planning permission and by-law approval in order to provide a new roof and floor, ceiling replacement, complete replastering of internal and external walls, the provision of a fire escape, new heating and electrical system, window updating and consequential painting and updating.  A third classroom is to be provided in the project planning and full by-law approval was cleared in June 1991 for those detailed works.  Tender documents for the project were submitted to my Department in June 1991.  The question of the invitation of tenders for the project will be considered in the context of the 1993 budgetary situation as the 1992 budget is already committed.</P>
      <P>The scheme is an extensive and very expensive one as the original building is a two-storey school so that fire safety measures must be provided.  The Department are at present assisting with grant aid for rent of the Portakabin used because the two upstairs classrooms cannot be utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisional estimate for the works to be carried out is approximately £190,000 excluding professional fees.  I might point out that that sum does not include other necessary works such as on the boundary, tarmac and so on.  These estimates are based on 1990 prices. Because of the major cost and the size of the undertaking involved it is not possible to progress the scheme in the current year.  Finances for 1992 have been committed. It is not possible, due to the extent of the works, to allow the scheme to progress this year.  When the 1993 budgetary situation becomes clear it will <Col N="2077" /> be possible to progress the scheme to the next stage, which is the invitation of tender stage.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the school is situated in Swords village, that there are major plans under way to build a luxury hotel in the village and that the existing school is not in keeping with the general high standard of the area.  However, when the major renovations are completed the school will be in keeping with the renewed area.  Hopefully towards the end of the year we may be able to progress this project further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this time the Minister will have better news.  Our Constitution calls for the cherishing of all the children of the nation equally.  I wish to point out to the Minister that many of our children are not cherished by the State.  I refer specifically to those children denied remedial teaching in our post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>In particular I call on the Minister to provide a remedial teacher for the Fingal Community College in Swords, County Dublin.  This school is in a phase of growth and development, with 417 pupils at present and with a projected growth to 500 over the next couple of years.  I might point out that 15 to 20 per cent of the pupils attending this school have serious reading problems, some of them being between six and seven years below the average reading ability for their age. In September 1992 this school will be taking in ten students directly from special primary school classes because there is no provision in the system for their accommodation.  There is no remedial teacher in this school to follow up the education of these children coming there from special classes.  Because of the lack of this facility many students are disappearing within the system, eventually leaving school, with absolutely no skills in reading or writing and very little personal adequacy skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the Fingal Community College, the only remedial facility available, <Col N="2078" /> is provided by scheduling some part-time teachers to undertake sessions of special work with some of the more disadvantaged children.  Of course, this means that the other children are being deprived of extra optional subjects, of pass and honours classes, and so on. Surely that is not a proper manner in which to run our education system?</P>
    <P>The town of Swords probably is the only suburban area of north County Dublin in a growth pattern.  Even though this school is located in what would generally not be described as a &ldquo;disadvantaged area&rdquo; I would point out to the Minister there is a number of pupils urgently in need of remedial help.  The Minister and his Department must recognise that the services they are providing fall short of what is desirable.</P>
    <P>Added to the lack of a remedial teacher in the Fingal Community College this school is at present housed in a motley collection of buildings, most of them temporary. Although there are Departmental proposals to upgrade the school &mdash; which project I hope will get the go ahead in 1993 &mdash; the matter is still only at the planning stage.  This lack of adequate accommodation exacerbates the difficulties in the provision of even a minimal amount of remedial help.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter and at least allocate a shared remedial teacher to this school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>It may surprise Deputy Owen to hear that a proposal has not been received from the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee for the provision of remedial posts in respect of this college.  My Department allocate teaching resources to County Dublin Vocational Education Committee on a scheme basis.  It is a matter for their chief executive officer to allocate those resources to schools within the committee's scheme as he sees fit.  My Department recently notified County Dublin Vocational Education Committee of their teacher allocation for the 1992-93 <Col N="2079" /> session, which includes a number of remedial posts to cater for the needs of schools within the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should a proposal be received in my Department for the creation of an additional resource teaching post to deal with a particular category of children it will receive every consideration.  Perhaps the Deputy would take the necessary steps to ensure that that is the case.  If and when any such proposal is received <Col N="2080" /> in my Department I can assure the Deputy it will be referred immediately to the Psychological Unit of the Department for assessment.</P>

      <P>Expenditure <i>per capita</i> on health services is lowest in the North-Eastern Health Board area.  I would point out, however, that expenditure per head of population is an unweighted average and fails to take account of a number of important demographic and geographic factors. The difference in the cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialties, density of population and the present stage of development of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that, since a reply to a similar question from the Deputy was given in October, 1991, the difference between the North-Eastern Health Board and the board with the highest <i>per capita</i> spending has narrowed from £200 to £156.  The estimated average <i>per capita</i> expenditure in all health boards in 1992 is £467, as compared to £407 under the North-Eastern Health Board.  It is likely that developments which are now being planned by the North-Eastern Health Board in co-operation with my Department will bring that board's level of services and expenditure in closer alignment with the average <Col N="1940" /> expenditure for all Health Boards over the next few years.</P>

      <P>At present, a network of 80 Citizens Information Centres extends throughout the country.  Funding and other support services for these centres is provided by the National Social Service Board.  In 1991 funding amounted to £150,000 and this is expected to increase to £170,000 in 1992.  In addition to supporting these centres, the National Social Service Board also operate a Mobile Information Unit which travels extensively around the country, including areas not serviced by an existing centre.</P>
      <P>The National Social Service Board are very aware of a citizen's right to information on services and entitlements and every effort is made to promote this objective.  In 1991 new Citizen Information Centres were opened at Mitchelstown and Fermoy, County Cork, and in the Liberties areas of Dublin.  A further new centre was opened in Tullamore within the last few days.  The board are working with local groups in a number of other areas with the aim of establishing additional centres during the current year.</P>

Funding has also been provided for further service improvements in 1992 including:</P>
      <P>&mdash;development of cardiac and cardiology services at Crumlin and Cork Regional hospitals;</P>
      <P>&mdash;development of neurosurgery services at Beaumont;</P>
      <P>&mdash;improvements in a range of other acute hospital services including ENT, orthopaedics, liver transplants, metabolics, oncology and anaesthetics at various sites throughout the country;</P>
      <P>&mdash;improvements in geriatric services at the Meath and Mater Hospitals as recommended in the Kennedy report;</P>
      <P>&mdash;enhanced services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>Funding in respect of these developments has already been allocated on foot of prior discussions with the agencies.</P>
      <P>Discussions with health agencies regarding the utilisation of further resources, including the additional sums announced in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance, are in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extra resources will allow me to provide enhanced funding for those with <Col N="1948" /> AIDS-HIV, the elderly, child care and for some further improvements in cardiac surgery and the development of genetic counselling services.</P>

      <P>It is important that dental health education for young people be seen in the context of a broad health education programme whereby the individual is encouraged to take responsibility for all aspects of his-her health.  A general approach ensures that the many factors which contribute to the wellbeing of the individual can be taken into account and a well co-ordinated general approach ensures that certain health topics can be introduced in the young person's health career when they are most appropriate.  This co-ordinated approach also ensures that the topic can be revisited at regular intervals throughout the career of the young person to ensure a consolidated message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department have recently had detailed discussions with the Irish Dental Health Foundation regarding educational materials for young people.  The unit will be contributing to the development of materials which employ a comic style approach to highlighting the importance for young people of a healthy dental and oral health regime.  The comic style approach has been pilot tested and results show that this approach appeals to young people.  The message is readily understood and easy to apply.  The materials encourage a healthy diet to aid oral hygiene as well as the more traditional <Col N="1951" /> messages relating to brushing teeth on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Recently a number of health boards have developed sets of health education materials for use at primary school level. Within these materials which cover many aspects of health, personal growth and development, there is ample opportunity for the teacher to introduce aspects of dental health.</P>
    <P>The Irish Dental Health Foundation, which receives support from my Department through the Eastern Health Board, also play a very significant role across a broad spectrum of educational activities directed at raising the level of public awareness to the value of good dental health.  The role of the foundation embraces: oral health programmes development; public information services-publications; training and education for professionals and promotional activities.</P>
    <P>In addition to educational programmes the fluoridation of public water supplies is a major element in my Department's preventative strategy in relation to dental health.  There has been a major decline in the prevalence of caries in Irish schoolchildren since the introduction of the fluoridation programme.</P>
    <P>Health boards also operate a fissure sealant programme as part of the school dental service.  Fissure sealing is a technique used to seal vulnerable surfaces of teeth to prevent the onset of decay.</P>

      <P>Health boards are responsible under the Health Act for providing services for medical card holders who need nursing care.  In the case of a person who requires residential nursing care and who cannot afford to pay for it, a health board may admit the person to one of their own homes for the elderly, or make arrangements <Col N="1954" /> to have the person placed in a private or voluntary nursing home and contribute towards the cost of the person's care.  It is the policy of my Department to encourage partnership between health board and nursing homes in meeting the needs of the elderly.  I understand that health boards do not record the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, a person may avail of a place in a nursing home approved by the Minister and is entitled to receive a contribution of £50.61 towards the cost of his or her care each week from the health board. About 78 nursing homes are approved under this section.  Health boards contribute towards the costs of nursing home care under the arrangements referred to in the first paragraph above, payments under section 54 of the 1970 Health Act and grants to voluntary nursing homes under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, In 1991, these contributions and grants amounted to £13 million approximately.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 provides for a new system for the payment of subvention to dependent persons in nursing homes and will ensure that subventions are paid according to standard criteria by all health boards. The drafting of regulations which set out the detailed conditions under which subventions will be paid is at an advanced stage.  It is my intention to bring the Nursing Homes Act into effect later this year.</P>

Arising from these discussions it was decided to contact other interested parties before referring the matter back to Government. These consultations will be concluded shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 69, 99 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>I consider the availability of community rated type health insurance exclusively, with open enrolment and lifetime cover, to be essential to maintaining the appropriate balance between public and private health care, on which the successful operation of the Irish health services depends.  This is the approach adopted by my Department in relation to the EC Third Directive on Non-Life Insurance, which seeks to open up the insurance market, including health insurance, throughout the Community.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the text of the EC Third Directive on Non-Life Insurance which was adopted by the Council of Ministers in February 1992, will permit insurers from throughout the EC to enter the Irish health insurance market, if they so wish.  Health insurers entering the Irish market will no longer require a licence to do so from my Department.  However, the Directive also permits member states to impose certain restrictions on insurers operating within their territories.  Under this provision it is proposed to restrict the Irish health insurance market to schemes of health insurance that comply with the principle of community rating, with open enrolment and life-time cover.</P>
      <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board have always operated on the community rating principle and foresee no great difficulties, either technically or financially, arising out of the provisions of the Directive.  In view of the fact that the Directives, as passed by the Council of Ministers, permit us to maintain community rating and to protect our existing health care structure, no derogation from the provisions of the Directive has been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be necessary to enact legislation to regulate the future provision of private health insurance in accordance with the Directive and to make certain other amendments in the current legislation. <Col N="1957" /> This legislation must be enacted in sufficient time to allow all the new arrangements to be in place not later than July 1994.  It will, therefore, be possible for the House to consider all aspects of private health insurance during the passage of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain limitations, persons not covered under the GMS scheme can obtain affordable insurance cover against out-patient services, including general practitioner fees, from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Assistance with inordinate expenditure on drugs and medicines is available under the long term illness scheme, the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the refund of drugs scheme.  In addition, income tax relief is available on health insurance premia and on certain medical expenses, including drug and medicine costs.</P>

    <P>I have previously indicated that I <Col N="1963" /> expect the new arrangements, including the designation of beds, to improve the position of public patients for two reasons.

However, this improvement will not be at the expense of private patients &mdash; the number of private beds will be sufficient to cater for the level of private activity and will be increased, on a self-funding basis, as the need arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately in the past many persons with a mental handicap were admitted to psychiatric hospitals.  It is now the policy of my Department that persons with mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be treated in any other way.  The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, endorses this policy. It recommends that an assessment be carried out of the circumstances and needs of each person with mental handicap in a psychiatric hospital.  If the assessment indicates that it would be inappropriate to transfer the person, he or she will continue to be cared for in the psychiatric services in dedicated accommodation in as homely an environment as possible.  If the assessment indicates that the person with mental handicap no longer needs care in a psychiatric setting, the report recommends that he or she should transfer to a mental handicap service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 1,495 people with mental <Col N="1964" /> handicap accommodated in public psychiatric hospitals on 31 December 1990.  A further 310 people were accommodated in designated units associated with these hospitals but which are now part of the mental handicap service.</P>
    <P>While very few people with a mental handicap were transferred from a psychiatric to a mental handicap setting in 1991, the development of appropriate programmes and the assessment of the needs of these persons continued.  My Department has appointed an adviser with expertise in the care of people with mental handicap in pyschiatric hospitals to work with the health boards and voluntary agencies to further the policy of improving the care of that population.  In 1992 it is expected that up to 75 people for whom it is considered appropriate will transfer from psychiatric hospitals to a mental handicap service.</P>
    <P>In general I would point out that where persons with a mental handicap continue to be cared for in psychiatric hospitals, either because they are not suitable for a transfer or a transfer cannot be arranged at present health boards are being encouraged to care for them in separate accommodation and to develop programmes of activity suited to their needs. In some cases health boards, with my Department's agreement, have separated their care from the rest of the hospital and transferred responsibility for their care to the community care programme, which is responsible for mental handicap services generally in the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>The judgments arising from the recent Supreme Court hearing involving a 14 year pregnant rape victim have raised a number of complex issues which will need careful consideration.  It is vital that these issues be treated with insight and care so that their precise implications, including any which might affect public health policy, can be fully understood.</P>
      <P>Because of the constitutional, political, humanitarian and other questions involved, this process will inevitably take time and it would be irresponsible to attempt to come up with instant solutions or suggestions.</P>
      <P>Once all the implications of the judgments have been fully examined the Government will be in a position to announce proposals to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>I am at present engaged in a consultation process as part of the preparation of legislation to implement the Government's decisions on the restructuring of health services in the Eastern Health Board area and increased accountability in the health services in all areas.  I will be submitting my proposals to the Government in the coming months with a view to bringing legislation before the Oireachtas in the autumn.</P>
      <P>As far as the management of hospitals is concerned, it is my intention that health agencies will be encouraged, in the interest of the best and most efficient provision of health care, to involve in their management in a real way the professions who deliver that care.</P>

      <P>In the course of the 1990-91 review of the GMS contract it was agreed, between the Irish Medical Organisation and Management, that, as part of a co-ordinated drugs strategy, indicative prescribing targets would be determined for all doctors in the GMS scheme.  It was further agreed <Col N="1967" /> that these targets would be based on the best information available and that they would be refined and adjusted annually. This process commenced in 1991 when indicative figures were circulated to doctors for a six month period prior to the circulation last month of annual targets for 1992.</P>
      <P>These targets are intended to give doctors the opportunity to objectively assess their overall prescribing levels with comparable practices and they are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual doctor's right and obligation to prescribe as necessary.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that the comparisons being made were accurate and to ensure that the targets issued to doctors took account of as many influencing factors as possible, the GMS (Payments) Board, when issuing the target figures last year, asked general practitioners for summary information of patients on their panel who required expensive medication.  This information allowed the GMS (Payments) Board to update and issue targets to general practitioners in respect of the year 1992 which more accurately reflect these influences.</P>
      <P>In the case of over 1,000 of the 1,600 doctors in the GMS scheme, their 1992 drug targets are 5 per cent up on their actual prescribing in 1991 and in the case of other doctors, their targets will be 5 per cent greater than the actual average prescribing in 1991 for a panel of similar size and composition.</P>
      <P>The question of the utilisation of any savings arising from the operation of these targets will be considered in the light of the ongoing evaluation of their effectiveness during the course of 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the number of persons being cared for in the community is that there are 5,783 people attending day services and 1,515 people living in group homes.  A wide range of home support services is provided by the agencies and in the current year a further £1.2 million has been allocated to provide additional support services for up to 1,000 families.</P>
      <P>Information on the numbers of places available for adults with mental handicap in each county has been prepared in the form of a tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> At present these places are not adequate to meet all the needs of persons with a mental handicap and the Government is committed to expand the number of places available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government.  The additional funds allocated to the services for persons with a mental handicap this year are a sign of the Government's commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>Information on the precise number of respite places is not readily available since this service is provided in a flexible manner by all agencies.  Resources for respite care are being increased considerably this year.  Additional provision for respite breaks of one month for up to 500 persons is being provided and the service will be monitored to assess its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The position regarding long stay residential services is that there are 4,548 people with mental handicap in residential centres and 1,515 people living in group home accommodation.</P>
    <P>As regards people with a physical disability, there are approximately 340 residential care places available to cater specifically for this group.  Twenty additional places will become available when a new Cheshire Home is opened in Monkstown this year.  Planning is also proceeding on the provision of ten additional places in Sligo and 11 in Letterkenny. Health boards have been requested, in the context of the developments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> to assess the level of need for residential accommodation for people with physical disabilities and to draw up a programme to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>In relation to persons with a mental handicap, the report <i>Needs and Abilities</i> indicated a total additional need for 600 residential and 1,000 day places.  It also identified an emerging annual need for 40 residential and 200 day places. Additional places are being provided as recommended in the report and in line with the commitment of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>Cardiac surgery is carried out at three <Col N="1973" /> centres, the Mater Hospital, Dublin, Cork Regional Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that I have provided funding this year for the further development of cardiac services in Dublin and Cork.  As an immediate step I have allocated £120,000 within the last few days for the provision of 40 additional open heart operations at the Mater Hospital this year.  These developments will improve waiting times for cardiac surgery nationally.</P>
      <P>Cataract surgery is available at a number of hospitals throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that, as with other treatment, the admission of a patient to hospital for cardiac surgery or for cataract surgery is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.  Emergency patients are dealt with immediately.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that action is taken to tackle the most pressing problems in regard to waiting times.  As a first step it is essential that accurate and reliable data is available from all the agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Deputy will be aware that all accute hospitals were asked to validate their waiting lists.  Some hospitals are still in the process of carrying out this review.  On completion of the validation exercise, formalised regular arrangements are to be put in place by each hospital for the ongoing review and validation of lists which will ensure that comprehensive and reliable data on patients awaiting treatment is readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy, focused on the management and review of waiting lists and general strategies to improve waiting times for treatment.  In their report the group recommended that as well as establishing meaningful and comprehensive waiting list data, hospitals should target waiting lists by ensuring that explicit account is <Col N="1974" /> taken of waiting times in scheduling admission, including theatre lists, and that speciality teams have reasonable targets to guide their attempts to minimise waiting by patients.</P>
    <P>The group have been reconvened and part of their new remit is to pursue the implementation of the recommendations in relation to waiting lists in Dublin hospitals.  In addition, health boards and hospitals outside of Dublin have been asked by my Department to consider the good practice recommendations contained in the report and to report back to my Department on their plans for the implementation of the recommendations, including those in relation to waiting lists.</P>

      <P>At present, there are 255 long stay places available for the elderly of County Wexford in New Ross and in St. John's Hospital, Enniscorthy.

According to the draft plan, there is an over supply of long stay accommodation for the elderly in the county.

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of and concerned about the increasing number of alleged cases of child abuse, including child sexual abuse, that are being reported and, more particularly, the number of such cases where abuse is being confirmed.</P>
      <P>In 1986 the number of reports of alleged abuse received by health boards was just over 1,000.  Of these almost 500 cases were confirmed, of which 274 involved child sexual abuse.  By 1989, the latest year for which full details are available, the number of reports was over 3,200, of which over 1,600 cases were confirmed including 568 cases of child sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>In response to these developments, a number of initiatives have been taken by my Department and by the health boards.  In 1987 my Department published new child abuse guidelines which set out clearly the steps to be taken by the various parties involved in the identification, investigation and management of child abuse.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, units for the investigation and management of alleged child sexual abuse were established early in 1988 at Temple Street Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  During the same year, a special allocation was made to each of the other seven health boards to enable them to establish appropriate services in their areas.  Services are now in place in each health board area; some of them are based in a particular hospital in the region while others are provided on a community basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am generally satisfied with the range of assessment services that are now available, I am conscious of the need for further developments in the long term treatment of victims of child abuse, including improvements in the level of child and adolescent psychiatric provision and specialised residential facilities <Col N="1977" /> for children who have been severely damaged by abuse.</P>
    <P>Last year, my Department gave approval to the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services in the North-Eastern, Mid-Western and South, Eastern Health Board areas.  It is my intention to continue to develop these services as available resources permit.</P>
    <P>Approval has also been given to a number of new residential developments for children in care, some of whom would have been victims of child abuse.  Over 40 additional residential places are being provided in the Eastern Health Board area.  A ten place emergency hostel for homeless girls is already available.  Other developments include a new therapeutic unit for adolescents in County Kildare and a new residential home for boys in South County Dublin.  I expect these to be in place within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>New residential and hostel facilities are also being developed at Cork, Limerick, Athlone, Sligo and Galway.  These will result in approximately 30 extra places. In Cork a purpose-built residential centre at Shanakiel Road is now complete and will open shortly.  A new residential facility is being developed near Limerick. In Athlone, Sligo and Galway, new hostel facilities are being developed by local voluntary groups with the support of the relevant health boards.  Additional places were also recently made available at Stranorlar, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>It is also of the utmost importance to develop programmes aimed at preventing the incidence of all forms of child abuse.  In this context I would like to mention the child abuse prevention programme being undertaken by staff of the Eastern Health Board with the assistance of my Department and the Department of Education.  This progamme is currently being introduced into all the primary schools in the Eastern Health Board area.  It provides training for the teachers and the parents and follows through with a special curriculum for junior and senior pupils.  The aim of the programme is to encourage self-confidence in the children and to teach them coping skills.  Above all, the programme <Col N="1978" /> seeks to teach children never to keep secret anything which upsets, disturbs or confuses them.</P>
    <P>The response of parents, teachers and, indeed, the children themselves to the programme has been most encouraging. The question of implementing the programme on a nationwide basis is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, provides a statutory framework for the development of child care services, including tackling the problem of child abuse.  It is my intention to bring into operation this year most of Part II of the Act which contains many of the preventative and service-delivery provisions.  In particular, it is intended to implement section 3 of the Act which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection, including children who have suffered abuse and requires them to provide a range of child care and family support services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board is processing these applications strictly in the order in which they were received.  Each assessment should take between six and nine months to complete as the Adoption Board expects the assessment to be of an equivalent standard to that applicable for a domestic adoption.  The actual timescale involved in an individual case will of <Col N="1979" /> course be determined by the particular circumstances of that case.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is committed to clearing the present backlog of applications as quickly as possible.  The board has this week assigned a second social worker to the task and it is currently in the process of appointing a third social worker.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Adoption Board has been in regular communication with the Romanian authorities regarding arrangements for dealing with applications from Irish residents wishing to adopt in Romania.  The board has not been notified of the introduction of new eligibility requirements for adoption there.  In any event, this is entirely a matter for the Romanian authorities themselves.

      <P>I have studied the reports referred to by <Col N="1981" /> the Deputy and I share the Deputy's concern that the abuse of alcohol by young people represents a most serious social and health problem.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus that the most effective approach to the issue of alcohol use and abuse generally and by young people in particular is in implementing a comprehensive national alcohol policy. Such a policy should address such issues as the economic, social, cultural, legislative and educational factors relevant to alcohol use and abuse.  In pursuance of this strategy the Government requested the Advisory Council on Health Promotion to develop such a comprehensive policy.  Development work by the council is well advanced with the recent completion of an intensive consultation process with relevant groups including youth organisations.  I am expecting a report to be submitted to me by the summer of this year.</P>
      <P>The work programme of my Department's health promotion unit gives a high priority to the issue of young people and alcohol.</P>
      <P>The Drink Awareness for Youth (DAY) programme is a combined initiative between the health promotion unit and the National Youth Council.  It is a preventive programme which aims to inform and educate young people about the responsible use of alcohol and the dangers of abuse.  It is not an anti-drink programme.  It is also about youth &mdash; about growing up, decision-making, influences, assertiveness, relationships, self-esteem and leisure options.  The programme is now being used by youth leaders, teachers, probation officers and juvenile liaison officers.  It is also being used in the Garda training centre in Templemore with new recruits in community training workshops, prisons, FÁS centres throughout the country, and by members of the ICA.  To date over 800 people have attended the training seminars which equip people with the skills necessary to use the DAY pack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unit, in conjunction with the Catholic Communications Institute and Veritas Productions, produced a video &mdash;&ldquo;Handle With Care&rdquo;&mdash; which comprises <Col N="1982" /> a practical alcohol awareness programme for primary and post-primary schools concentrating on young people making informed decisions for themselves in relation to alcohol.  In addition, there is a comprehensive teacher's guide which accompanies the video.  The video is available from the health promotion unit and is primarily aimed at 10-15 year olds.</P>
    <P>A community-based programme &mdash; Drug Questions Local Answers &mdash; is also in operation.  This aims to create a community response to all drug problems and places particular emphasis on the problems created by alcohol abuse.  Seminars are held regularly by the health promotion unit throughout the country and attended by health and educational professionals and interested voluntary workers.</P>
    <P>A substance abuse prevention programme involving school staff is being piloted in selected second level schools during the current academic school year. The aim of this programme, which is a joint Department of Health/Department of Education initiative, is to enable students to develop their ability to take charge of their health and to make informed decisions about the use of all drugs, including alcohol in their lives. The materials and exercises in use examine such issues as self-esteem, assertiveness, peer pressure and decision making.  Following piloting and evaluation during 1992 it is hoped to have the programme revised and made available to all schools.</P>
    <P>The role of parents is increasingly being highlighted in terms of their influence on children and the support and skills required in handling alcohol issues which affect their children.  In conjunction with Cork Social and Health Education Project the unit is in the process of developing a parent education training programme.  A full-time project officer has been appointed to co-ordinate the programme which aims to help parents cope with problems caused by substance misuse, including alcohol.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit provides a range of information on alcohol, including a series of three booklets relating <Col N="1983" /> specifically to young people and alcohol. These booklets are directed at young people themselves, their parents, and youth leaders and have been widely disseminated and are available from the unit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, which was enacted by the Oireachtas on 31 May last, removed the entitlement to combine public and private elements of in-patient care at the same time.  The position now is that every patient is entitled to full public hospital services including public accommodation and public consultant care.  Alternatively one may opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the <Col N="1986" /> Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of being private patients of the consultant.  The possibility of preferential treatment is not confined to queue-jumping and can arise in relation to any specialty, including obstetrics.  The Commission on Health Funding did not suggest that any individual specialties should be excluded from the scope of its recommendation and the Oireachtas did not provide for any exclusions in the legislation.</P>

      <P>Following is a breakdown of all payments made to date in respect of the investigation ordered by the High Court on 16 September 1991.  Each of these payments was made on foot of an invoice submitted by the inspectors.  It will be seen that the payments fall into four categories; fees to the inspectors themselves; payments to O'Hare Barry Corporate Services in respect of staffing costs; payments to O'Hare Barry Corporate Services in respect of miscellaneous expenses; and payments to various third parties.</P>
      <P>In respect of claims for payment of their own fees, the inspectors submitted supporting evidence of their activities on each day for which they claimed payment. Payments for staffing costs were made on foot of time sheets, certified by the inspectors, recording the number of hours devoted to the inquiry by named members of the staff of O'Hare Barry Corporate Services.  Miscellaneous expenses include such items as accommodation, security, postage, courier and other office costs.  Accommodation was charged for on the basis of an agreed rate reflecting the estimated rental cost of the office space allocated to the inspectors and their supporting team.  Other office expenses refer to actual outlays borne by the inspectors.  Payments to third parties include expenses such as legal fees and stenographic services; they were submitted through the inspectors who certified them as being in order for payment. Such payments were made directly to the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>The statutory duties of the health boards in relation to members of the travelling community are no different from those which relate to the community at large. Health boards ensure, as far as possible, that all appropriate health services are available to travellers and that, where necessary, these are tailored to their way of life.</P>
      <P>Public health nurses and general practitioners in particular play a key role in the delivery of services to travellers in their areas.  This has been facilitated by the practice of appointing public health nurses with specific responsibility for travellers in a number of health board areas.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a greater focus on health education and special efforts have been made to reach the travelling community through the medium of videos and structured discussions with health board staff.  A number of videos on immunisation, ante-natal care, chest infections, nutrition and avoidance of gastric infections have been produced by the Eastern Health Board and made available to other health boards.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has been operating a mobile health clinic since 1986 which visits both official and unofficial halting sites.  The clinic, which is staffed by two public health nurses and a driver, visits 24 sites mainly in the Dublin area.  It has been active in the provision of immunisations, health education, counselling, child care advice and hospital referrals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late 1991 my Department provided <Col N="1999" /> a grant of £75,000 to the Eastern Health Board towards the cost of a replacement unit which will be operational by this summer.

      <P>The hospital in-patient charge is a small but important contribution towards the very high cost of providing public hospital services while at the same time maintaining the principle that only those that can afford to pay are required to do so. Medical card holders are exempt from the charge.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility for a medical card and the income limits increase according to a person's age. There is also a provision in the Health Acts whereby persons may be given a particular service free of charge to which they are not normally entitled on the basis that they are unable without undue hardship to provide the service for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>In view of the high cost to the State of hospital services, I would find it difficult to justify exempting one group of people from hospital charges without taking any account of their means.  However due to the higher income guidelines for persons over 65, and due to the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers in awarding cards in individual cases, the percentage of persons over 65 who hold medical cards and who are therefore exempt from the in-patient charge, is at present in the region of 84 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board provide secondary care orthodontic treatment for children who have severe orthodontic conditions.  Children requiring treatment are assessed and prioritised in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Western Health Board that there are no children in Category A, the category of greatest severity, currently awaiting treatment. There are 1,253 children in Category B and 659 children in Category C.</P>
      <P>Children who have been assessed as Category A receive immediate treatment and the Western Health Board are drawing up a programme to deal with those in Categories B and C as a priority.  In this context I might mention that it is expected that an appointment of a consultant orthodontist will be made by the board within the next few months.</P>
      <P>Additional funds have been made available by my Department to the Western Health Board specifically for the development of specialist orthodontic services and adult dental services.  In 1991 £374,500 was provided to the board specifically for these services and the board's allocation for 1992 includes a repeat of this special provision so as to permit the board to provide continuing orthodontic treatment for cases begun before 1992 and for the commencement of new cases in 1992.  These additional funds have enabled the board to make significant improvements in services.  The latest returns available to my Department show that the board was able to provide secondary care orthodontic treatment for 849 children in 1991.</P>

The availability of this equipment means that expectant mothers who would previously have had to be referred to England for this procedure can now be treated in Ireland.</P>

The Directives provide derogations from some of the structural conditions for certain categories of small premises and for premises engaged in a work plan to meet the requirements of the Directives in full.  Premises complying with the above provisions, including those qualifying for the derogations, may supply institutions with meat and meat products.</P>
      <P>The Directives do not apply to the cutting, preparation and storage of meat or meat products in retail shops or in premises adjacent to sales points, where the preparation and storage are performed solely for the purpose of supplying the consumer directly.</P>

      <P>There are no grants available at present for such enterprises.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department operated a pilot scheme of grant aid for investment in organic farming enterprises.  The object of the scheme was to provide aid towards the cost of facilities for the commercial production, storage and marketing of organic produce.  Under the scheme £88,000 was paid to 32 organic producers, co-ops and firms.</P>
      <P>A decision on offering similar grant aid in the future is dependent on the results of an evaluation of the effectiveness of the pilot scheme which will be completed in the next few months.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to payment of unemployment benefit is subject <i>inter alia,</i> to the condition that the claimant is not absent from the State unless where provided for by regulations.  These regulations specify that benefit may only be paid to a claimant who is absent from the State for two purposes: (a) on holiday and in respect of the first two weeks of any such absence in a calendar year, or (b) while representing Ireland in an amateur capacity at an international sporting event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was paid unemployment benefit from 9 December 1991 to 29 January 1992 and made a repeat claim to benefit on 19 March 1992.  The <Col N="2013" /> person indicated that in the intervening period she was in the United States where her sister was critically ill.  I have arranged that this question be accepted as an application on her behalf for payment for the period she was in the United States.  The application will be dealt with within the context of the existing regulations.</P>

      <P>Under present arrangements on the death of a qualified insured person, the surviving spouse continues to be entitled to treatment benefits for so long as the contribution conditions are satisfied by the deceased's insurance.</P>
      <P>After a certain period following the death of the insured person has elapsed however, the condition whereby a minimum number of contributions must be paid or credited by the insured person in the contribution year prior to the date of claim, can no longer be fulfilled.  The dependent spouse's entitlement to treatment benefit therefore lapses at this point.</P>
      <P>However, in the case of a qualified insured person reaching pension age, entitlement to treatment benefits is preserved. This preserved entitlement also extends to the dependent spouse in the event of the pensioner's death.</P>
      <P>The extension of cover for treatment benefit to widows in the situation referred to would have financial implications.  I would, however, be in favour of making some arrangements for widows in this situation and I will examine the possibilities in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the delay in making payment of moneys due to a person (details supplied) in County Louth under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 and 1991 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991; if he will outline the amounts due; and when payment will now be made.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 December 1991 the Employment Appeals Tribunal issued a determination in favour of the person concerned in respect of claims under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991 and under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991.</P>
      <P>In relation to redundancy payment, the employee concerned was awarded £406.00 in compensation under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991.  However since the employer concerned is insolvent and unable to pay the award this falls for consideration for payment from the social insurance fund. Therefore, following receipt of a claim by the person concerned for payment of the redundancy entitlement from the fund and receipt of the tribunal decision on 17 December 1991, my Department found it necessary to verify with the Department of Social Welfare on 3 January 1992 whether the person concerned was employed by her former employer in employment which was insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts &mdash; this is a necessary requirement under the Redundancy Payments Acts for an employee to qualify for a statutory redundancy lump sum payment.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Department of Social Welfare has had to carry out special investigations as regards the insurable status of the employee concerned in this case but that a reply from that Department in the matter is expected very shortly.  If it is confirmed that the employee concerned was insurable for all benefits, she will be paid the redundancy lump sum from the social insurance fund as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to minimum notice, the employee concerned was awarded £99.43 in compensation under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991 by the tribunal but has not pursued the question of payment with my <Col N="2015" /> Department.  The employee concerned, if she has not already done so, should seek payment of the compensation awarded from her employer, preferably in writing.  If the employer fails to pay the award, the Acts provide that the compensation due is recoverable by the employee from the employer as a simple contract debt in a District Court.</P>
    <P>The Acts also provide that proceedings for recovery of such compensation may be instituted and maintained on behalf of the employee by the Minister for Labour or by the employee's trade union.  I would be prepared, on receipt of a complaint from the employee concerned, to consider, subject to legal advice, exercising that discretion in this case.</P>
