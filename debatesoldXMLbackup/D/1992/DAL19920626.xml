      <P>I propose to take all the Votes for which I am responsible together, but I shall endeavour to answer questions on any particular Vote.</P>
      <P>The total estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible is £474,039,000, an increase of £22,657,000 or 5 per cent above the expenditure for these Votes in 1991.  Pay and allowances etc. account for 84.1 per cent of the total Estimates and show an increase of 8.8 per cent compared with 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will commence with the Garda Síochána Vote.  The 1992 Estimates provision <Col N="1569" /> for this Vote is sufficient to ensure that the Garda Síochána have the necessary resources to preserve law and order throughout our country.  To put our spending in this respect in perspective I can tell the House that the provision in this year's Estimate for the Garda Síochána of £341,260,000 represents an outlay by the State on policing this year of almost £100 for every man, woman and child in this country.  There is another key statistic I would like to cite at the outset which is that we have one garda for every 323 people.  This is one of the best police-population ratios in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>My priority in the Garda area is to obtain the maximum value for the Irish people from this colossal investment in policing.  I intend to maintain the present pace of recruitment, to increase civilianisation in the force and to facilitate in every way I can better law enforcement by the men and women of the Garda Síochána.  Whether it be subversive, ordinary, juvenile or complex white-collar crime, I intend to ensure that the Garda have the resources necessary to deal with the challenges they must face on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The first batch of the current round of the 1,000 recruits to be taken on commenced training in the Garda college in Templemore in April this year.  This new recruitment campaign together with the temporary extension up to the end of this year, of the retirement age from 57 to 60 will ensure that the strength of the force is kept to a maximum.  Indeed its strength at the end of this year will, at almost 11,000, be close to an all-time high for the membership of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>There are about 585 civilian clerical staff employed in the Garda Síochána at present.  This is the highest number ever. A further 105 civilian staff will be recruited this year and they will be assigned to posts which will result in an equivalent increase in the Garda operational strength.</P>
    <P>The current recruitment campaign together with the policy of increased civilianisation will result in a greater physical presence of gardaí on Irish roads and <Col N="1570" /> streets, a result I am sure that the public will be pleased to see.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes which are occurring at present within the Garda Síochána to provide a more community-based policing service to the public.  I am, of course, referring to such initiatives as community policing and the rural policing scheme which was introduced last September in 14 Garda districts.  The overall response of the general public to these initiatives has been extraordinarily favourable.  Additional clerical staff and resources have been provided to those areas involved in the rural policing scheme to ensure a greater service to the public, particularly in remote areas. Gardaí involved in the scheme now have more time at their disposal to engage in crime prevention strategies including visiting schools and the elderly living alone.  This scheme is being continuously monitored by the Garda authorities who are very satisfied with its operation to date.  The question of extending the scheme to other areas will be considered over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>In the urban setting 174 community gardaí are assigned to community policing duties in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, and these schemes will be further extended.  These gardaí provide a closer link between the force and the local residents in densely populated suburbs where the traditional Garda-community relationships of the countryside have not been the norm.</P>
    <P>Tackling the crime problem is of course a priority issue for me.  It is made all the more compelling in view of the indications that crime increased last year. While a swift and determined response to any increase in crime is necessary, care must be taken to ensure that that response is a considered and comprehensive one, particularly in view of changing crime and social patterns.  One thing I am certain of &mdash; a simplistic approach to the crime situation just will not work.</P>
    <P>As a first step, it is important to put the problem in perspective so that we can accurately assess what we are dealing with.  Trends from one year to the next <Col N="1571" /> may not be indicative of the real crime trend over a longer period.  We must also consider the impact of increasing crime levels worldwide.  Indeed, while Ireland has one of the lowest crime rates <i>per capita</i> of the 12 EC countries, we do have particular crime problems in certain urban areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to urban crime it is generally recognised that police response in itself is not sufficient; a more widely based community response is called for. With this in mind, a high level inter-departmental group was set up late last year comprising assistant secretaries from the Departments of Justice, Education, Environment, Health, Labour and Social Welfare and also representatives from Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and the IDA. This group commenced their work by examining the needs of young people in the Ronanstown area of County Dublin and I look forward to receiving their report at an early date.  The group will continue their work by focusing attention on the needs of young people in other areas where urban crime has been a problem.  I might mention that even prior to the setting up of this group a number of community-based projects involving the Garda and other statutory and non-statutory organisations have been established and are in receipt of State support.  These include projects in Ronanstown, Killinarden, and Cherry Orchard in Dublin and Southhill in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities cannot always spell out the details of their &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; work.  I would like to inform the House of two particular areas where such Garda work is ongoing and effective. The first relates to attacks on tourists. There is active and continuing liaison between the Garda, Bord Fáilte and other tourist interests in dealing with this problem.  Measures taken include the deployment of additional Garda patrols, including gardaí on plainclothes duty, in areas of high tourist interest and the distribution of leaflets to visitors advising on <Col N="1572" /> the crime prevention measures they can take.</P>
    <P>The second area is the problem of drug abuse.  Unfortunately, the indications are that the incidence of drug offending in Ireland has increased.  Indeed the House will be aware of many recent Garda successes in the drugs area.  The media have carried accounts of several successful Garda raids in recent weeks.  These operations, which followed painstaking Garda surveillance and intelligence gathering activity, are evidence that the Garda have the skills, the commitment and the resources to tackle the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>I will support the Garda in every way possible in the fight against drugs.  A Bill designed to deprive those who deal in drugs, and indeed other criminals, of the profits of their sordid business is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department and I hope to introduce it shortly to the House.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that I am commited to providing the Garda Síochána with the powers and resources neccessary to deal effectively with the crime of fraud.  Following an internal review prompted by my Department, the Garda Commissioner recently increased the strength of the Fraud Squad from 38 to 45 members.  The Garda authorities are fully aware that the squad can call on assistance from outside specialists, as and when they require it.  Also, I have established an Advisory Group on Serious Fraud under Mr. Peter Maguire, SC.  This group, who include senior representatives of the Garda authorities, the Director of Public Prosecution's office, the Attorney General's office, the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank and my Department, are to report to me by Christmas and I can assure this House that their advice will be carefully considered and acted upon by this Government.</P>
    <P>While speaking on the Garda Estimate I feel it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to refer to the small number of gardaí, 70 in all, who are serving <Col N="1573" /> today with the UN peacekeeping forces in Angola, Yugoslavia and Cambodia. These men and women, who have volunteered for these peacekeeping duties, are all superb ambassadors for Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>Traffic law enforcement continues to be a top priority for the gardaí.  The Garda Traffic Corps now has 364 members, including a Chief Superintendent. It is now proposed to assign ten civilian clerical assistants to the corps, bringing the total number of civilians to 27, thus releasing vital Garda manpower for on-the-street traffic duties.</P>
    <P>For sometime the question of false alarm calls has attracted attention both inside and outside this House.  About 235,000 alarm activations notified to the Garda Síochána annually are false while only 15,000 are genuine alarm calls. When attending to the calls the Garda have no way of knowing which are genuine and which are false.  Therefore, the alarms in question, which were intended as a useful instrument of crime prevention, are now, by and large, operating in a way which hampers effective crime prevention.</P>
    <P>I have therefore approved the introduction by the Garda Síochána of a new policy to deal with those installations which show an unacceptable pattern of false calls.  Under the new policy, owners of alarmed premises, where false calls exceed certain pre-determined levels, will, after a warning and further opportunity to rectify the situation, be informed that the Garda will no longer respond to their alarm calls.  Only alarms which are connected either to an autodialling device, a monitoring centre or a local Garda station will be affected by this policy.  Most residential alarms are not connected in any of these ways and are not therefore affected by this policy. Questions relating to the nuisance created by false activations of residential alarms are matters for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The policy will come into operation as from 1 September this year thus giving each owner of an alarmed premises adequate time to take remedial action <Col N="1574" /> where there is a high level of false alarms. This policy will succeed in making alarm systems once again an effective instrument in crime prevention.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on the details contained in the Estimate for the prisons for 1992, I should like to comment on more general topics.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate death of a young man in Wheatfield Prison last week has again provoked criticism of the prison system in general and of my stated intention of carrying out a full scale review to see whether changes in approach may be indicated.</P>
    <P>The first point to be made about the recent unfortunate death is that it occurred in the most modern institution in the State, an institution which contains services and facilities of the highest standard. The deceased was serving a sentence. It is hardly relevant to that death to assert that other prisons are outworn and contain inadequate facilities, including primitive sanitation, or that there may be a need for a specialist institution for remand prisoners.</P>
    <P>I do not need to be reminded of the many deficiencies in our prison system.  I have visited some prisons and have seen for myself the good and the not so good. Of one thing I am convinced, and that is the need for a thorough review of where we are going.  In an address to the annual delegate conference of the Prison Officers' Association at the end of April last I emphasised that I was not going to tinker with individual problems in a vacuum.  I said we needed a better sense of purpose and direction in the prisons so that we may get better results from all our efforts.  I said then, that I was planning the groundwork for a document that would set out an overall aim and objectives for the prison system, a set of priorities and a strategy to achieve them.  Our thinking was going to be informed by the principles of penal policy enunciated by international bodies of which we are members and by the thrust of the Whitaker report.  Once we got the fundamental aproach right, and anchored it to a realistic strategy, we could go on to tackle succesfully other features of the <Col N="1575" /> prison system that needed up-dating.  The process I announced at the end of April is in full swing.  An initial draft has been prepared and this will now be the subject of consultation among interested groups within the prison system.  I have always been prepared to acknowledge that there are many features in the prison system that are far from satisfactory and I am determined to find a coherent strategy to deal with them over a period of time, and as resources allow.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the Estimates. The total net estimate for the Prisons Vote exceeds the corresponding figure for 1991 by £3.060 million, an increase of 4 per cent.  The main variations are: the provision being made for pay and overtime is £57.589 million compared with an outturn in 1991 of £57.358 million.  The increase mainly reflects the full year cost of 169 additional staff which were recruited on a phased basis last year and the total provision for the Probation and Welfare Service, including the community service orders scheme, is £8.625 million compared with £7.25 million in 1991.  The increase is mainly as a result of an increase in staff costs.</P>
    <P>Nearly £10 million has been allocated this year to provide for the modernisation, up-grading and maintenance of our existing prison buildings &mdash; £6.5 million for expenditure on capital works and £3.49 million for the maintenance of existing buildings and equipment.  The main capital allocation is for completion of the new health care unit in Mountjoy Prison, for refurbishment, to include in-cell sanitation, of the existing women's prison, which is due for completion shortly, commencement of construction of a new kitchen in Mountjoy Prison and the up-grading of security, services and other facilities in a number of prisons including Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>Funds for the implementation of proposals for improvements sought by the director of prison medical services have been included in the Estimate.  Sanction has been obtained for the appointment of a pharmacist and proposals are also being formulated for revised contracts for <Col N="1576" /> prison medical officers.  The number of clinical psychologists is to be increased from three to six immediately, and possibly to eight later, to facilitate improved levels of counselling to prisoners.</P>
    <P>The Estimates will encourage the use of alternatives to custody to the maximum.  We already have at any one time about 3,200 offenders on supervision in the community as an alternative to a custodial sentence, including about 750 on community service orders.  Community-based sanctions of this kind have many attractions.  They are an effective penalty, they achieve positive results for the community and, of course, they avoid the huge costs of imprisonment.  I have a review already in progress which is focusing on the possibility of extending them to fine defaulters.</P>
    <P>A great deal of good work is being done to improve the prisons.  Those working within the system &mdash; Governors, staff, specialists &mdash; are providing an invaluable service to the community and I acknowledge that fact.  My main concern is to maximise the benefits for the community by having a system which not only protects the public from the depredations of the more serious offenders but also uses the system in a positive way to help as many prisoners as possible to resume a constructive life in the community on release.  I am satisfied that if an approach aimed at maximising the benefits for the community is adopted we will be on the right road and, as I indicated earlier, the process to clarify that approach is well under way.</P>
    <P>I move now to the courts Vote.  The general efficiency and operation of the courts is, of course, a matter of great importance and the Vote provides the funding necessary to equip the courts to function as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>The courts Vote covers usual costs such as salaries, office equipment, accommodation and telecommunications.  The estimated net cost of the courts system in 1992 taking into account the gross current expenditure and revenue accruing to the State through fines and so on is approximately £13.5 million.</P>
    <P>The computerisation of court office <Col N="1577" /> work is vital if the courts are to provide an efficient and effective service.  In the past few years considerable progress has been made in the computerisation of the District, Circuit and High Courts and the expansion of computerisation in the courts is to continue in 1992.</P>
    <P>Among the measures already taken are: the computerisation of the central office of the High Court; the introduction of a case tracking system for Circuit Court offices, which has been installed in three offices to date and is under evaluation in other offices; a family law accounts package which has been made available to the Dublin Metropolitan District Court Family Law office.</P>
    <P>In addition, an automatic office system to provide post-court documents such as fines and warrants is being introduced in the Naas, Nenagh, Portlaoise, Tullamore and Waterford District Court offices.</P>
    <P>Computerisation of the District Court is to continue, and two independent systems have recently been assessed in this regard.  In line with the computerisation of all court offices, personal computers are being provided to a range of court offices.</P>
    <P>The accessibility of the courts to the public is extremely important and the introduction of the small claims procedure in December 1991 was a vital step in furthering this accessibility.</P>
    <P>The small claims procedure is designed to provide a speedy, informal and low cost system to handle consumer claims. It was introduced on a pilot basis in four locations last December and has been most successful to date.  The operation of the small claims procedure is being closely monitored by my Department pending a full review later this year.  At that stage a decision on whether to extend the procedure to all District Court offices will be taken.</P>
    <P>In a major initiative the provision of a live video-link system in court rooms, is now under way.  The Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992, Part III, requires the provision in certain cases of an audio visual system, to enable witnesses under 17 years to give evidence and be cross-examined outside of the court-room setting.  The closed circuit <Col N="1578" /> television system being introduced on a pilot basis in the Four Courts, and later in two provincial courts, will provide an audio visual link between the court room and a separate witness room to allow court proceedings to be conducted as if a witness were giving evidence in the court room.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to Vote 23, for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  A sum of £11.305 million provided in the Vote represents an 11 per cent increase on the 1991 figure.</P>
    <P>The additional funds provided in the Vote are earmarked primarily for implementation of an approved programme of computerisation and for the recruitment of extra staff for arrears clearance at the registries.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the proposal, approved in principle by Government, to reconstitute the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds as a semi-State body.  This is being done to give the registries the commercial orientation and flexibility that will enable them to provide a fast, efficient and modern service to the public and to adapt to the changing demands of this technological age.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to announce the appointment of an interim board for the registries in the near future.  The interim board will operate on a non-statutory basis and their principal role will be to advise and assist in the various steps which need to be taken in readiness for the reconstitution of the registries.  I have, in the meanwhile, made arrangements for the preparation of legislation to formally vest the registries in a semi-State board.</P>
    <P>In order to offset the additional expenditure at the registries, I brought the Land Registration (Fees) Order, 1991, and the Registry of Deeds (Fees) Order, 1991, into effect on 1 April this year.  The orders provide for an overall increase in fees payable to the registries of 25 per cent approximately.  It is estimated that the increased fees provided for in these two orders will realise extra receipts in the amount of £1.725 million in 1992 and £2.588 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> I am particularly pleased to be able to report that services are already improving at the registries.  For example in the case of dealings, which are the main business of the Land Registry, I am informed by the registrar that the arrears of uncompleted dealings have been reduced by 7 per cent over the past two years and that a further improvement of the situation with regard to arrears and delays at the registries can be expected during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will turn to the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice which, in addition to providing for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister, provides for certain other services including Legal Aid and the Garda Complaints Board.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is for £18.871 million representing an increase of 10 per cent on the equivalent figure for 1991.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Exchequer provision in respect of the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice is £2.569 million.  That represents an increase of 9 per cent over the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board in 1991.  The number of staff employed by the board reached its highest level ever during 1991.  Additional solicitors and administrative staff were recruited to fill vacancies and also to permit the opening of new law centres.  In December last three new law centres were opened, in Castlebar, Dundalk and Letterkenny. Acquisition of premises for the two new law centres at Finglas and Clondalkin to replace the Aston House centre are almost completed and the additional staff for the centres have been recruited.</P>
    <P>Recently a new part-time law centre opened in Newbridge and the new law centres in the Dublin area will service part-time centres to be established at Blanchardstown and Balbriggan.  The board are currently examining the position of the part-time law centres with a view to opening further new ones.</P>
    <P>The total cost of running the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme in 1992 is estimated to be £3.87 million including value-added tax and retention tax, which are recouped to the Exchequer.  The scheme is administered <Col N="1580" /> by the courts under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, and orders made under that Act.  Representation is provided by solicitors and counsel who have indicated their willingness to provide legal representation to persons who are granted free legal aid by the courts.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware of the difficulties for the administration of justice in Cork which commenced in September 1991 as a result of the actions of the solicitors in Cork city who withdrew from the operation of the scheme because of their dissatisfaction with the level of fees paid.  This action was taken some months before a claim on behalf of criminal legal aid solicitors was lodged with my Department by the Incorporated Law Society. The solicitors in Cork have resumed legal aid work since 25 May pending the outcome of the negotiations with the Incorporated Law Society in which my Department are engaged.</P>
    <P>Provision of £346,000 is included in the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice for the Garda Complaints Board and this represents an increase of £26,000 over last year's provision.  This increase covers staff increments as well as an expected increase in tribunal and appeal board activity arising from the clearing of the backlog of complaints.  The assignment last year of three additional staff to the board has already enabled the board to make very significant inroads into the arrears situation which had developed. The board are satisfied that they now have the necessary staff to deal with all complaints within a speedy and acceptable time-scale.</P>
    <P>The assignment of the additional staff has also enabled the board to examine the operation of the complaints system with a view to streamlining it where appropriate.  One such aspect is the &ldquo;clogging up&rdquo; of the system with formal investigations in the case of the complaints of a minor nature.  Discussions between the board and Garda management on this matter have been successfully concluded and revised procedures for informal resolution of complaints were introduced at the beginning of this year.  These new arrangements <Col N="1581" /> are designed to ensure that less serious complaints are dealt with in a simpler way, as originally envisaged in the Complaints Act.</P>
    <P>In the course of this address I have informed the House where State resources within my control have been allocated.  I hope I have made it clear that my first priority in the use of these resources is to preserve law and order throughout the country and to protect our citizens as they go about their daily business.</P>
    <P>With every confidence I commend these Estimates to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion the Minister has brought a full Estimate for the Department of Justice before the House.  I have a certain difficulty in dealing with it because the traditional politics that we on this side are supposed to engage in dictate that I stand up and launch an attack on the Minister and draw attention to his political deficiencies or the deficiences of his Department. However, a great deal of what the Minister says and has been saying for some time about crime and the problems in our prisons makes sense.  One of the difficulties we have is that we constantly confuse talk with action.  The recognition that problems exist and the pious aspiration to tackle them are not producing the necessary action.  No doubt the Minister can say in response that he is in this office for only a few months, but a great deal of what he has had to say today mirrors what his predecessor said in previous Estimate debates and no doubt his predecessor when newly appointed to that office would have given the excuse that it was his predecessor who did not do the job properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First I wish to deal with the area of crime.  There has been a drastic increase in crime in urban areas.  Crime increased by 8 per cent in 1990, and I am reliably informed that it increased a further 8 per cent in 1991; although the figures have not yet been officially published they are being leaked all over the place.  I understand that crime is on the increase this year.  That level of increase is crime is not <Col N="1582" /> acceptable.  In some areas of our cities, elderly people do not feel safe in their houses; others fear that if they leave their own home they will be intimidated by people on the streets and there are incidents taking place that are entirely unacceptable in a civilised society.</P>
    <P>I very much agree with the introduction of community policing.  I was pressing for this for a number of years and I would like to see a dramatic expansion of it.  In fairness, the Minister acknowledges the benefits of community policing and its success within the areas where it was tried.  He says he would like to see it expanded within the next 12 months but what we need is an immediate expansion so that we can ensure that the Garda we have perform the functions that are necessary to protect the community. Community policing performs two functions; first, it enables the local Garda to develop a relationship with the local community and this can have a preventive effect in that those doing community policing have an admirable record of involvement in their local community outside their official working hours. Second, this acts as a deterrent to those elements within communities who are intent on creating trouble.  Let me stress that it is not enough to recognise that we have a problem and simply say that we will review community policing within the next 12 months to deal with the increase in urban crime.  People want to see more gardaí on the streets this summer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move to civilianisation, although I know there is some concern about it within the Garda.  There are certain types of clerical jobs which might be more appropriate to gardaí than to civilians but there are other jobs whose confinement to members of the Garda is a source of amazement to me.  I have no doubt that the increased employment of civilians to deal with basic clerical work will release more guards to engage in community policing.</P>
    <P>A recent communication from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors draws attention to the fact that the temporary arrangement which allows <Col N="1583" /> gardaí to defer retirement up to the age of 60 is to terminate at the end of this year.  At a time when there is an increase in crime there is a very strong argument to retain within the Garda men in the 56 to 60 age group whose experience is invaluable to the force.  The facility to remain within the force up to the age of 60 should be continued beyond the end of this year.</P>
    <P>We also need to ensure that we have a continuous stream of young people joining the force.  The failure to recruit sufficient numbers and the misrepresentation with regard to recruitment campaigns made by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers has resulted in a changing age profile within the Garda.  It is important that there are a reasonable number of young members of the force who will be able to relate to young people in areas where intensive community policing should be the objective.  There is as usual a disagreement with regard to figures.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors point out that if the retirement age of 57 is reimposed after 1992, numbers within the force will be substantially reduced within a couple of years.  If this question is not addressed, there will be a reduction in the Garda to the extent that by 1995 there will be only 10,400 gardaí, an effective decline of 1,000 since 1985.  That is a matter of serious concern and I hope the Minister will respond in a constructive way.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty in the fight against crime is what is known as the revolving door syndrome.  Crimes are committed, the gardaí investigate, people are properly brought before the courts and convicted. Overcrowding within the prisons has resulted in a number of offenders not fully serving their sentences.  I am not talking about people who are judged to benefit from a formal early release scheme.  I agree with such schemes, but the reality is that a significant number of people are released early, without intensive supervision by the probation service, in order to make space for the next batch of prisoners.  This syndrome is undermining the morale of gardaí.  I have had <Col N="1584" /> reports of instances of burglary in the city and county where gardaí have suggested to the victims that there is little point in pursuing the issue because anyone brought to court will be back on the streets within a few days.  Not only is this undermining the morale of the Garda but it is creating the perception within a hard core group of criminals that they are in effect immune and that if they are caught in pursuit of criminal activities nothing of any great consequence will happen.  We must remove ourselves from the revolving door syndrome.</P>
    <P>One solution is the greater use of the community service order scheme.  Some people are sentenced to prison who could pay their debt to society by engaging in community service.  This costs the State a great deal less than the £660 per week required to maintain someone in prison. It would ensure that spaces were available within our archaic prison service for those people who should be required to serve their full sentences.  I am proud to say that it was at my initiative that the first legislation to provide for community service orders came before this House in 1982.  There was some criticism that it was a &ldquo;namby pamby&rdquo; way of dealing with people.  The Private Members' Bill which I produced, and the consequent change in Government policy have been proven to be right.  Community service, as the Minister rightly says, is a success and its use should be extended.  In some instances it allows schemes to be implemented in local communities which would not otherwise be financed.  There is a cost saving in extending this scheme in that it costs less to have somebody supervised than to keep that person in prison for a week or two.  It would ensure that prison facilities would be available for those who should serve sentences.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's view, and that of his predecessor, that problems with regard to crime cannot simply be dealt with by policing, prisons and community service orders.  The problems are deeper than that and require a mixture of remedies. I am extremely disappointed that the ministerial committee appointed to look at the broad range of community <Col N="1585" /> initiatives in areas with crime problems has still not reported, even on the Ronanstown area.  I do not understand the delay.  The committee was established by the Minister's predecessor and nothing is happening.  There is no point in successive Ministers recognising the problems and speaking in platitudes.  If this committee cannot produce a report within the next couple of weeks the Minister should sack it and make the necessary political decisions.  The political buck rests with the Minister and he cannot keep passing the baton to various committees.  We recognise that a variety of initiatives are required.  Political decisions must be taken.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the prison service. I will not dwell on conditions within that service.  The Minister acknowledges that he is familiar with them.  It is a scandal that every couple of weeks I table Special Notice Questions, which are frequently ruled out of order by the Chair on the basis that they are not urgent, because yet another person has committed suicide within our prisons.  I have lost count of the number of Special Notice Questions I have tabled to this Minister and his predecessor following the report of another suicide.  I am told by the Chair that it is not an urgent matter.  Presumably it is not urgent because the person is dead and nobody can do anything about that. This is urgent because one suicide in our prison per year is one too many; two is far too many, more than two is a national scandal and we have gone well beyond that figure this year.  If we have yet another suicide it exhibits the inadequacies within our prison service in addressing the problem of individuals who cannot cope and find a way out by taking their own lives.  We are not identifying the people who are at risk of taking their own lives.</P>
    <P>If we read of this number of suicides in the prisons of South Africa, we would have a plethora of questions, probably some tabled by Government back-benchers, suggesting that the South African Government should be condemned because of this.  If we read of this number of suicides in prisons in other identifiable <Col N="1586" /> countries, what would be the reaction in this House?  There is a complacent reaction about it along the lines, &ldquo;yes, they are in prison, they are probably of no use and it is probably as well that some of them committed suicide, they are irrelevant people, they are statistics&rdquo;. They are not, they are individuals and it is not acceptable in a democracy in Western Europe that this number of people commit suicide.  The Minister made the point that the suicide that occurred this week &mdash; yet another tragic event &mdash; in Wheatfield Prison could not have been due to the conditions of the prison because it is a great deal more modern than, say, Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the conditions in prisons may be one of the elements that contribute to suicides in our prisons but I do not think they are the main reasons; they relate to the personal difficulties of the individual concerned.  Mere confinement may create problems for someone who has a psychiatric problem.  We do not have the sophisticated psychiatric service within our prisons that is required to identify those people who are at risk of taking their lives.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has told us there will be an additional number of clinical psychologists but there is something lacking in the identification process and in the sophistication of the system.  How many more suicides will we have this year while yet anoher ministerial committee consider what we will do to address the problems of having a coherent policy for our prisoners?  This is not good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with another issue.  I will not address the issue of legal aid because it will be dealt with adequately by my collegue, Deputy Cotter.  I wish to deal with the issue of marriage breakdown and divorce to which the Minister made no reference. We have yet another committee &mdash; I am not sure whether it is a ministerial committee <Col N="1587" /> or a committee of departmental officials &mdash; preparing a White Paper on marriage breakdown.  Many of us on this side of the House are familiar with the cynical political games played with the casualties of marriage breakdown by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1986.  There were press reports of the imminent publication of the White Paper &mdash; one of the longest political stories in town &mdash; but I do not know what has happened to it.</P>
      <P>I am thoroughly convinced of a number of things.  First, that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are now playing a cynical political game with the casualties of broken marriages.  This White Paper, when published, will be a snow job, it will be designed to make a pretence at a concern about people that the Fianna Fáil Party not only abandoned but used as a political plaything in 1986. I predict there will be no divorce referendum during the lifetime of this Government.  It is an outrage that the Government have taken so long to produce this White Paper.  The issues that have to be addressed are not complex, as the Minister pretends, as many of them were addressed in the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown in 1985, a committee on which the Minister and I sat and were regular protagonists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of what needed to be done, whether we have a divorce law or a modern separation law, was done in the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, which I introduced in this House as a Private Members' Bill.  A number of issues need to be addressed in the context of a divorce referendum.  One is in the pension and succession area to ensure that the spouses in a broken marriage, where a divorce takes place, have their pension and succession rights protected.  Indeed, the succession issue is largely addressed in the Judicial Separation Act, 1989.  The remainder is a matter of political decision-making.  Should there be a referendum? What proposal should be put to the people?  Will it be backed by the Government?  Do the Government or the Minister acknowledge that there is now a need for divorce to allow the casualties <Col N="1588" /> of broken marriages to remarry? Should we have family courts?  Of course, we should have family courts.  This is something the Minister talked about on the Joint Committee.  We agreed on the need for family courts but the Government will not provide the resources to introduce them.  We have a mediation service but it is still in the guise of the pilot service commenced by my constituency colleague, Deputy Fennell, in 1985 and has not expanded since outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>A mediation service allows couples, whose marriage have collapsed, to separate in a civilised way.  The current mediation service requires more staff and we need to extend it outside Dublin. Ireland is not centred in Dublin.  There are other parts of the country as the Minister is well aware.  Even if the Minister would open a mediation service in Castlebar I would give him two cheers for it, it might help his constituents.  No doubt I would criticise him for confining it to Castlebar but at least we would have another mediation service other than the one in Dublin provided by the State.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us, in his reply, when this report will be produced.  I challenge him to deny my assertion that there will be no divorce referendum during the lifetime of this Government.  I hope he proves me wrong and if so it will be a welcome initiative.  I suspect he will not prove me wrong.  Legislation to give all spouses a joint interest in the matrimonial home has been promised for four years but it has still not been produced. It is not complex, and if the Government do not produce it, I will do so in yet another Private Members' Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Shatter in wishing the Minister well in his first presentation of Estimates in his capacity as Minister for Justice.  I assure him of the support of this side of the House provided he makes the necessary efforts to bring about a system of justice in Ireland which at this time is lacking in many respects.  The Minister knows that. <Col N="1589" /> He learned much from his appearance on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  He is a changed man since but we are waiting to see the results.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Garda Síochána have the necessary resources to preserve law and order throughout the country. The fact is that law and order is not preserved, far from it.  The Minister concedes there are difficulties in the urban crime scene in some places.  That is a gross understatement of the position. Law and order in many parts of Dublin, and in the major urban areas, has broken down and people are living in fear.  Gangs are roaming the streets terrifying people, stoning them and causing damage to houses.  Vandalism is rampant and people are living in fear in their own homes.  It is no good saying so much money is being provided in the Estimates or the number of gardaí.  The Minister's system is not working.  In any urban Dublin concentration, particularly in local authority housing estates, inquiries or an opinion poll as to the major concern of people will show that it is stolen cars being driven up and down the roads, across open spaces, terrifying people and causing mayhem; the burning of cars and houses and the terrifying of people in their homes.  That is the order of the day in all too many of the local authority estates in urban areas, particularly in Dublin.  A softly, softly, calm approach towards such crimes is just not good enough.  That is the prime cause of concern to people, who are entitled to live their lives peacefully and quietly as citizens in their homes.  People are being denied that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that major-crisis steps are taken on that issue.  When the Minister was on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; he heard people describing the scene; he knows what is going on.  However, the Minister's speech showed no evidence of any radical proposal designed to take the issue by the scruff of the neck and deal with it.  That is just unacceptable.  We are told that there are not sufficient custodial places for the young people who comprise the gangs that steal cars and are such a danger <Col N="1590" /> to life and limb &mdash; their own life and limb included, let it be said.  Many of those youths come to grief, but so do innocent people.  Where in the Minister's speech was there any indication that he is organising the necessary facilities to cope with the problem?  There appears to be none. Speed and urgency are required here, not departmental committees, inquiries or investigations resulting in indications that legislation will be introduced subsequently.</P>
    <P>The drug scene in Ireland is absolutely horrific &mdash; there is no other way to describe it.  It is true that the Garda Síochána are working very hard to combat the problem within their resources and it is true that they have had some successes here and there.  But what is the end result?  The availability of drugs is rampant, it is on the increase and it is to be seen in virtually every estate in the major urban areas.  In that regard I am not referring to local authority estates only &mdash; I mean all estates.  The reports that I get from my own constituency, which comprises a fair cross-section of the community, are that parents are terrified because of the drug dealers who are operating in their areas.  The dealers come in in their big cars, do their deals and move on, causing havoc, mayhem and loss of life among young people.  The position is the same in all areas.  I cannot say that adequate resources are accorded our most urgent need of at least trying to contain the problem &mdash; I am not talking about resolving it.  The drug problem is not being contained, it is escalating. These drug dealers are flocking into the estates and bringing in young people, and I could provide names if they were wanted.  I am not launching a criticism of the Garda Síochána or the Drug Squad. They are doing their best within their resources.  However, their efforts are not working and are not adequate for the task.  The problem is getting worse and more and more of our young people are getting entrapped in the drug scene.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem horrifies me.  I should like to hear at least that the Minister and the Government recognise that this is a crisis that has to be dealt <Col N="1591" /> with as a crisis.  I should like to hear the Minister say that he has an action plan to deal with the problem.  I want to hear something new, not the same old, tired statements that the Garda are doing their best and that they have had a success here and a success there.  It would be hard for the Garda not to have a success here and a success there, so widespread is the dissemination of drugs in this country now.  I do not have the answer.  I do not have the knowledge as to the way the drugs are coming into the country or as to the distribution networks.  I know that they are major and widespread.  Whatever resources have to be provided to the intelligence network of the Garda Síochána to identify the main entry points and supply points must be made available. That is a matter of top priority because the drugs problem is eating into the fabric of the youth of our country. Waiting a year, or two or three years, for reports will not do.  Speed is always essential when the administration of justice is at stake.</P>
    <P>That matter brings me to the issue of civil law.  Speed is essential in the administration of justice.  There is truth in the old saying that justice delayed is justice denied.  In Ireland justice is certainly delayed for those who need it and for those who seek it.  The position in the High Court is that from the time a High Court action is set down for hearing, the unfortunate person making the claim has to wait two years plus for a listing of the hearing of their claim.  For example, if a working man was knocked down by a car driven by a drunken driver, was incapacitated and laid up for perhaps a year, then brought proceedings and all the paper work were gone through so that eventually the case was set down on the list, how many cases would be ahead of his one on the list?  There would be thousands of cases ahead of his case.  The High Court judges are valiantly working through the system but it would be more than two years before that man got justice. That is an unacceptable time.  It is Dickensian, although the delays were probably not so lengthy in the last century. <Col N="1592" /> The lists are getting longer by the week and the term.  Down through the years we have been given reports that the Department of Justice would revamp the system, speed up the procedures and bring in the parties before masters of the High Court and narrow the issues so that everything would be speeded up and settled. Where is any of that action?  Nothing has happened.  It was only talk.</P>
    <P>The one thing that the Minister and his colleagues home in on is the costs of solicitors.  In this regard I do have to declare my interest as a practising solicitor. The one factor of the law that the Government are hung up about and the only thing that seems to concentrate their minds is the fees charged by solicitors and the way in which those fees escalate the costs of the law.  Solicitors' fees, like any other fees, have to be reasonable and modest.  Solicitors' fees are in fact one of the few kinds of fees that are controlled by officials of the courts.  Their fees are assessed by taxing masters.  I know of no other profession to have that kind of institution examining their fees.  A major cause of high legal cost is the Government charge of 21 per cent on top of everything.  Barristers' fees receive very little attention.  The fees of the professionals who are an essential part of any court case &mdash; doctors, specialists, engineers, actuaries and so on &mdash; receive very little attention yet they are all a very important part of the equation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter mentioned the question of legal aid.  It is nothing short of a scandal that Ireland does not have a civil legal aid system.  The years and the decades are rolling on but we are not bringing in that basic human right that every citizen should have the right to have access to the remedies the law provides.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, which is magnificient legislation in every respect except one, which is that the bulk of people who need to avail of it cannot do so because they cannot afford it.  There is no great merit in the Government providing fine and essential legal remedies unless, at the same time, they provide the means and accessibility to avail of <Col N="1593" /> those remedies.  There is an old saying that justice is open to everybody, like the Ritz Hotel.  The Ritz Hotel is open to everyone but you must be able to afford their prices.  The same applies to justice. I know that there are law centres but if a battered wife telephones one and says that she needs a separation under the 1989 Act and asks for an appointment, she could well be told that the earliest date available was 27 February 1993. Alternatively, they could say that their lists are closed and that they are not taking any more appointments.  The person might also be told to try another centre or to come back to them in three months' time but, in the meantime, the person is going through the horror of a broken marriage with all that implies for herself and her children.  That is not acceptable in a modern, civilised society. The remedies are there but people are not in a position to avail of them.</P>
    <P>I do not know what it costs to get a judicial separation in the Circuit Court or High Court, the minimum is probably £1,000.  One major defect in the Act is that it requires the proceedings to be brought in the Circuit Court, involving high costs, and even higher costs in the High Court.  I moved amendments at all Stages of the Bill when it was going through the House seeking to provide that jurisdiction for separation cases, where not much property was involved, should be heard in the District Court.  It would not have been free but it would have very much reduced cost and accessibility of that remedy.</P>
    <P>District Court officers are first class in helping people applying for barring orders and matters of that kind and would have given the same help if there had been jurisdiction for judicial separation cases in the District Court.  However, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were totally resistant to the idea, the Progressive Democrats were non-supportive and the only support I got was from Deputy McCartan who was then in The Workers Party.  I foresaw what would happen, I knew that people would be coming to the clinics of Members asking for help under the new Act.  When they come to me I <Col N="1594" /> ask if they can afford to pay £1,000 or £2,000 to a solicitor and barrister to be represented in the Circuit Court or High Court and, of course, I always know the answer.  I tell these people to try the law centres but, as I said, they will probably be given an appointment for 1993.  Is the Minister satisfied with that situation?</P>
    <P>At the closing stages of the Bill Deputy Collins was Minister for Justice and I brought this point to his attention.  He said that when the Bill was passed he would see what could be done about updating the civil legal aid system and providing money to ensure that the legislation was accessible to all people.  What happened?  Nothing.  There has not been any change in that regard and people are being deprived of their rights.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about prisons, pressure on space, the revolving door syndrome and so on.  I want to refer to one aspect of imprisonment.  There are people in prisons &mdash; I do not know how many &mdash; not because they committed a crime but because of non-payment of a civil debt.  The system still applies and in District Courts people are sent to prison on a daily basis for failing to comply with instalment orders, to pay £5 or £10 per week in relation to something they purchased. They are given a certain time to comply with an order to pay but when they do not do so they are sent to prison. I know such orders are supposed to be made only in cases where people have the resources to pay but, in most cases in my experience, people do not know the rules and those who do not have any money find themselves in prison for failing to pay debts &mdash; usually to hire purchase companies &mdash; because they do not have the money.</P>
    <P>It is time that the notion of putting people in prison for non-payment of a civil debt came to an end because it is no longer appropriate.  Hire purchase companies and others who avail of these remedies should find some other method of recovering their money apart from putting people in prison.  It is an anachronism, it is out of date, it smacks of the 18th and 19th centuries and should be got <Col N="1595" /> rid of.  It should be taken off the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the question of fines.  The idea of imposing fines on people for driving without insurance, drunken driving and so on is an acceptable part of the system.  However, the range of fines for any one offence is very wide and at the discretion of district justices, who vary greatly in the fines they impose.  Seminars should be held for district justices &mdash; and possibly Circuit Court judges &mdash; at which some scheme of uniformity should be agreed.  Unfortunately, some judges tend to impose a fine of £250 for driving without insurance without inquiring into the means of the person on whom the fine is imposed.  A fine of £250 for driving without insurance means very little to some people but for others the judge might as well have imposed a term of three months' imprisonment because he will not be able to pay the fine.  Judges should be encouraged to operate a basic means test on the person on whom they are imposing the fine instead of operating a block system of imposing the same fine for every offence, irrespective of the means of the person involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me commence where Deputy Taylor concluded as that was one of the points I wanted to mention.  I believe the Minister should inquire into the possibility of having a welfare officer or an officer of his Department in the courts to assess the means of some of the people who are fined, for example, for not having insurance etc.  Some time ago I was visited by an elderly gentleman with a severe heart condition who is a non-participating director in a private bus company run by his son.  This unfortunate man was fined either £250 or £400 but he did not have the money to pay the fine as his only source of income is a non-contributory pension.  He informed me that all he had was £50 and that he had handed this to the courts but they sent him back the cheque.  He also informed me &mdash; he is such a gentle person &mdash; that if they came to take him to Mountjoy <Col N="1596" /> Prison that he would go quietly and would not resist; he was quite serious about this.  I knew immediately that if this man was taken to prison he would not come out alive, that he would die of a broken heart, given his medical condition. I got in touch with the Minister immediately and he responded that if this gentleman sent on the £50 this would be acceptable.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that this man had to go through a lot before he reached this stage.  That is why it is important to find some way of assessing the means of people like him.  It was not the intention of the Department of Justice or the courts that this man should end up in prison, but that is the law.  Let me therefore give an example to show the way in which I believe it should operate because to me the law is about justice.</P>
      <P>In the United States a little old lady was brought before Judge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz of the federal court &mdash; both Deputy Taylor and I know of him &mdash; having failed to meet the cost of a contract worth $20,000 in connection with some work on her house.  She was asked by the judge if she had engaged the contractor to carry out the work and she replied that she had.  When he asked her did she know that she would not have enough money to pay for the contract at the time she signed it she replied that she did.  He then asked her what was the reason she signed the contract to have this work carried out and she replied that the man had persuaded her that she could afford to have the work done and that he had talked her into it.</P>
      <P>She informed the judge that her income was around $500 per week and when he asked her if she could afford to pay the man $10 a week she replied that she could.  He then made an order under which she will pay the man $10 a week, even though she was nearly 80 years of age, until the sum of $20,000 is paid off. He then turned to the young man involved and said to him that if his mother ever appeared before him in court in a similar case she would be treated in the same way.  To me that is what justice is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> I would like to see more people go to the aid of the Garda Síochána.  On Tuesday night last on my way home from this House I came across a couple of gardaí, as I turned off the main road at Lucan, who were struggling with a couple of youths.  At the same time a gang of five or six youths were hurling rocks at them.  Given my suicidal nature I got out of my car and went to render assistance, if I could.  Other people who had been watching from their cars instinctively got out and also went to assist them.  When this happened the five or six youths who were throwing rocks ran away calling us names.  I asked one of the gardaí if I could help in any way and he asked me to hand him his radio so that he could call for help.  Within a few minutes help arrived.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that if people come across gardaí in such circumstances they should go to their assistance. This would be appreciated and would be of help in building a greater bond between the people and the gardaí who take terrible risks.  One of the gardaí involved must have been about six foot three inches or six foot four inches but he was panting and at the end of his tether.</P>
    <P>The youths involved has been throwing rocks at cars travelling on the Lucan by-pass and they could have killed someone given the speed at which traffic moves along that by-pass.  If one of those rocks had smashed a windscreen someone could have been killed.  I therefore wish to compliment these gardaí for the courage that they showed and continue to show against all the odds.  As I said, I ask people to lend assistance; they may not even get involved in a struggle, because if they do these gangs of youths will soon disappear.</P>
    <P>It should be said that if the young person the gardaí were trying to detain got into the car when they asked him to there would have been no trouble.  As I support the concept of community service where people are asked to paint buildings and so on, I would send him to the bogs of Ireland to cut turf for six months.  That is good healthy work.  We should find a few ex-sergeant majors to <Col N="1598" /> supervise these youths and they should be given good plain food, allowed to watch no television and play no snooker. This would do them the world of good and would lead to the cost of administering justice being reduced dramatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>We would also get cheaper turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to echo the sentiments expressed by Deputies Shatter and Taylor.  The people I speak of are bullies and like all bullies they are cowards at heart.  Indeed, some of them have never worked and never will.  That would be the best deterrent and it would not amount to cruelty.  Other people have spent their whole lives digging turf in the bogs for a livelihood and it is hard work but it would not be in contravention of the Convention on Human Rights.  These young able-bodied men have plenty of time on their hands, spend their money, wherever they get it from, on drink and then look for excitement after leaving a disco.  That is exactly what this crowd of rotters did.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that psychiatrically disturbed children are maintained in Trinity House.  There are two or three children who should not be there; rather they should be maintained in a mental institution where they can be properly cared for.  At present they are disrupting the work of the teachers at Trinity House who are doing their best.  The Minister should consider this suggestion as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Select Committee on Crime, of which I am a member, made a recommendation which was leaked to the press, that the age of criminal responsibility should be increased to 12.  I would disagree with this recommendation because many of these thugs are as young as ten or 11 and are street-wise.  If we go ahead with this recommendation we shall hold their parents responsible for their actions.  I think the gardaí would also be totally against this proposal.  They should be treated as young criminals and the <Col N="1599" /> courts should be allowed to decide what measures are required.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that many of these young people throw live rats into cars as they travel along Sheriff Street and Gardiner Street &mdash; I always advise people not to drive along those roads &mdash; in order to get the people out of the cars so that they can steal them.  We have to be very careful on this matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the need to have an inspector in court to present summonses on behalf of gardaí &mdash; I have been speaking to the Minister about this matter and I hope he will take action &mdash; in an effort to get the gardaí back on the street and to reduce the overtime bill having regard to the fact that gardaí on their day off have to attend the court to commence proceedings against some of these young hooligans.  I understand that this system under which an inspector processes a stream of prosecutions is in operation in Britain and is working very successfully.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider increasing the retirement age from 57 to 60.  I am 58 years old and feel fit and well.  I would hate to think I was on the shelf at this stage.</P>
    <P>While it is gratifying to read in the Minister's introductory remarks that Ireland, <i>per capita</i>, has one of the lowest crime rates of the OECD countries, I wonder how much unreported crime there is here.  I know we have much petty crime which must be tackled.  I should like to see people's faith restored in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone a long way, and I congratulate him on what he has done to date.  He has reached out to the people, through the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and other channels, so that the people know he means business.  If, during his term of office, the Minister can restore our people's faith in the administration of justice he will have done a great day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I want to concentrate on a small number of areas of greatest concern <Col N="1600" /> to Democratic Left.  The first is the appalling position with regard to free legal aid. Eleven years after the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Josie Airey case which forced our Government to introduce some form of free legal aid it is clear that the system is in a shambles and falls far short of the standards envisaged by the European Court.  Indeed it does not even deserve to be called a system; it is a total shambles, and a source of internationsl shame. There has been much talk in recent weeks about how European we are but no other country in Europe offers its citizens such an inadquate service in such a crucial area.  Those involved have done everything possible to persuade the Government to take action to improve the service.  Members of the Free Legal Aid Board have even resigned, all to no avail. Successive reports of the Free Legal Aid Board have painted a sorry picture of people being denied access to justice because of the inadequate resources of the board.  There are long waiting periods for even an intitial meeting with a solicitor, with large areas of the country without a full-time law centre.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey published just two weeks ago by the voluntary free legal aid centres demonstrated just how bad was the current position.  All but one of the State's legal aid services have crippling backlogs of casework, with two of the three Dublin centres closed completely to non-emergency cases.  The reality is that if one is poor, living in Dublin, in need of legal aid, one may have to wait until 1993 before one may even see a solicitor to seek advice.  The position is not much better in other centres such as Tralee or Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for this position, which hits people on low incomes most, almost always women in deplorable social conditions who often need rapid recourse to the legal system, rests with the Minister for Justice and his predecessors going back to 1959 who have refused to provide adequate resources to allow the board meet the needs of the people they are supposed to serve.  Despite impassioned appeals from the board, even their <Col N="1601" /> members' resignation, the Government have refused to come up with the resources.  The Government promised on a number of occasions to put the system of free legal aid on a proper statutory basis by introducing legislation clearly setting out people's entitlement.  For example, it was promised in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Programme for Government, published in 1991, but we still await the circulation of any detailed legislative proposals.  Will the Government allow our country to be shamed again internationally by another of our citizens having to drag the State before the European Court of Human Rights to re-establish what has already been declared to be a fundamental European, if not universal, human right?</P>
    <P>Another grave source of concern must be the continuing death toll in our prisons as a result of suicides.  The most recent suicide is a matter of particular concern because it occurred in our most modern, recently built prison, Wheatfield.  It clearly demonstrates that, like society as a whole, prisons can never be rendered entirely suicide-free.  However, there is an indisputable link between prison conditions and the number of suicides that take place in them.  That is why such a huge problem is encountered in the Mountjoy complex.  The recent report of the visiting committee of Mountjoy Prison is a shocking indictment of years of neglect and mismanagement on the part of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The public may have been shocked at the description of the Dickensian state of the prison and the committee's reference to the appalling, grossly overcrowded conditions.  The committee said those factors were contributing to &ldquo;violence, sexual assault, riots, drug addiction and episodes of ingrained viciousness&rdquo;. These conditions will be well known to anyone who was unfortunate enough to have to serve a sentence in that institution or even visit inmates.  They are also well known to the Department of Justice, having been drawn to their attention by successive reports of the visiting committee.  They were also highlighted in the report of the Whitaker Committee, published almost eight <Col N="1602" /> years ago.  Many of the problems in our penal institutions would have been avoided had the Government implemented Whitaker's basic recommendations on prison management and reorganisation.  Everyone knows that the problems encountered in Mountjoy are particularly severe as it was a prison built in the Victorian era.  There is overcrowding, inadequate sanitary facilities and poor recreational facilities.  I contend that Mountjoy should be phased out or we will run the risk of more prison deaths and outbreaks of violence such as those seen last September.</P>
    <P>Deprivation of liberty, in itself, is sufficient punishment for crime and should not be added to by forcing prisoners to serve their sentences in inhuman, humiliating and degrading conditions.  These conditions drive some prisoners over the edge into the last desperate act of suicide. Society cannot remain indifferent to the death toll in our prisons.  A human life is no less valuable because a person is in prison; the sense of loss and pain to the family is just as great as in any other case. We have had now 20 prison suicides in five years.  The suicide rate in our prisons is running at almost twice the level of that in Britain and cannot be allowed to continue.  There must be speedy implementation of all of the recommendations of the advisory committee on prison deaths.  Even at this stage there must be a return to the principles and recommendations of the Whitaker Committee and a planned programme of implementation of the reforms advocated.</P>
    <P>Like other Members I welcome the Minister for Justice who has moved his first Estimate in that portfolio in the House.  In regard to prisons generally I welcome his reference to what he described as a thorough review of our prisons.  If that thorough review is to be based on the very good, basic ideas set out in the Whitaker report, and nothing else, I would be very happy.  As the Minister will involve himself in wide consultation in the course of that review I ask him to initiate in this House a widespread debate on the issue so that we can have <Col N="1603" /> some input in whatever may be proposed. Following the review is it the Minister's intention to compile a report for circulation to the wider community who pay such astronomical amounts in taxes for the maintenance of our prison system?</P>
    <P>That leads me to questions in regard to a matter I had understood was to have been resolved long before now and which, in the context of the millions of pounds with which we are dealing in this House, brings into sharp relief the somewhat mealy-mouthed attitude of the Department of Justice.  I am thinking in particular of the Nicky Kelly case.  The Minister for Justice must be congratulated on having recommended to the Government and they, in turn, to the President who has by now, I understand, delivered the formal pardon to Nicky Kelly.  The eventual finding of our administration was that he was never a person who should have been charged or indeed sentenced for involvement in the Sallins mail train robbery in 1976.</P>
    <P>We were led to believe that the Government would then generously and expeditiously deal with the question of fair compensation.  I regret to report that I was advised as late as this morning that no serious negotiations have taken place. I understand there have been meetings of counsel but that the State counsel involved have no clear mandate.  I understand also that an ultimatum was delivered to the solicitors acting on behalf of Mr. Kelly to accept a mealy-mouthed figure, take it all or nothing.  I understand an amount which would not even cover Mr. Kelly's out-of-pocket expenses needlessly incurred to date endeavouring to pursue legal remedies before our courts. I urge the Minister to explain today his intentions in this respect; whether the Government intend to give any substance to the pardon issued him?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain also what is the position with regard to the other persons who were charged, some of them convicted and later vindicated by the Court of Appeal.  One man's case in particular, that of Mr. Breatnach, is currently before the High Court, and was <Col N="1604" /> adjourned without due notice, on 24 June, to next October, Why are those proceedings still being pursued if the Minister is being true to his word that Mr. Breatnach, and those others involved, would also be considered, in fair compensatory processes, as people who spent needless time, worry and much of their lives proving their innocence which we all now fully endorse and believe in?  I hope the Minister will avail of the opportunity, when replying, to clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's comments on the issue of policing and take note of the statistics he has given.  We must ask what are the majority of our Garda doing?  For example, the civilianisation programme must be intensified.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, too, to give consideration to the deployment of gardaí. Cologne, a city similar in size to Dublin, has six police stations.  I understand there are approximately 47 Garda stations in Dublin, with the result that much of the administrative work in the areas is duplicated. It is time we centralised Garda services in this city.  Last night I attended a meeting of residents from the Sutton and Verbena areas.  I asked them specifically whether they would prefer to see more Garda stations in the district or more policemen on the beat.  They said they would prefer one central Garda station with more gardaí on the beat.  I hope the Minister takes this clear message on board in his review of the management and development of our prison service.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I do not have time to refer to other matters.  Under the Programme for Government, the Minister has to meet 14 outstanding legislative commitments.  I ask him to ensure that a fair proportion of these Bills are circulated during the long summer recess so that we can come back to this House in October ready to do more good work in reforming the criminal law generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the 1992 Estimates for the Department of Justice. Like previous speakers, I welcome the <Col N="1605" /> sentiments expressed by the Minister, which I know are sincere.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the proposal to increase the number of civilian clerical staff employed in Garda stations.  I accept that because of the sensitive nature of some cases civilian clerical staff cannot be employed right across the board.  I urge the Minister to increase as a matter of urgency the number of trained personnel in Garda stations who carry out duties which do not entail a high security risk. Properly trained civilian clerical staff could deal with normal matters in Garda stations.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to crime and drug abuse, and it is important to put them into context.  I believe many people are inclined to exaggerate about the level of crime and drug abuse in our society.  My constituency of Dublin North Central which covers a large area &mdash; for example, Clontarf, Harmonstown, Artane, Coolock, Beaumont, Fairview, Marino, Donnycarney, Killester and Dollymount &mdash; has a vast social mix.  I carried out a survey on the level of crime and vandalism in these areas.  I got a very good response to the survey which revealed some very interesting statistics which I will pass on to the Minister for Justice and the local Garda Síochána.  As I said, it is necessary to put the level of crime into context.  Statistics are given from time to time on the overall level of crime in the country, but I believe that petty crime makes up a large percentage of these figures.  Consideration needs to be given to the amount of valuable Garda time devoted to dealing with these crimes and attending court.  There is much scope for improvement in this area, and, as I said, I will bring the results of my survey to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to attacks on tourists. People involved in crime regard tourists as easy targets.  I welcome the action the Minister has taken to deal with this problem during his short time in the Department of Justice.  Earlier this month he indicated that there is a downward trend in the number of attacks on tourists.  I hope these attacks will not affect our tourist industry in any way.  We need to <Col N="1606" /> continue with the action taken by the Minister and the Garda Síochána to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Fraud Advisory Group, I ask the Minister to indicate the level of white collar crime and fraud; the powers available to the Minister, his Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce to deal with it; and how many convictions have been secured in the case of people who have committed white collar crime?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that approval has been given to the introduction by the Garda Síochána of a new policy to deal with alarm installations which show an unacceptable pattern of false calls.  I believe ordinary individuals on the street who may require the services or assistance of the Garda Síochána from time to time will heartily welcome this announcement. Many people believe that too much Garda time is being taken up answering false alarm calls which are possible due to a lack of maintenance on the alarm system.  I welcome the Minister's statement that the number of false calls will be registered and a penalty imposed on the owners of premises which show an unacceptable pattern of false calls.</P>
    <P>I note the recruitment of extra staff in the Land Registry.  Perhaps it is because I have an uncle involved in land registration and who continually bends my ear about the unacceptable delays in this connection.  I trust the increased staff will remedy the situation.  The Free Legal Aid Centre in Coolock have brought to my attention the difficulties being experienced by them.  I understand a sum of approximately £2.5 million is being provided in 1992 for the civil legal aid scheme.  We should ensure that these centres are operated in the most efficient way possible so that the best value is got for this money and people who need the services can avail of them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I attended the launching of the Irish Refugee Council.  I was on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; this morning in regard to the council.  I know the Minister, and his Department, are fully <i>au fait</i> with this matter which will have to be addressed in relation to the 1951 Convention.  I am <Col N="1607" /> aware that we have ratified the principles of the Convention but there could be better co-ordination between the Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs and Labour in relation to visas.  I am pleased that the Irish Refugee Council have been formally established and I hope there will be co-operation between the Government and that body.</P>
    <P>I have asked questions in this House in relation to the Nicky Kelly case, to which the previous speaker referred.  In the light of that case, and the British experience, I ask the Minister to consider establishing a procedure to review cases in the event of new evidence coming to light.  Finally, I would like to refer to a matter on which I was ruled out of order a few days ago.  Will the Minister consider introducing a Supplementary Estimate later in the year to cover the costs of barristers and solicitors in the beef tribunal, which are a scandal.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on that matter and give the costs paid to barristers, solicitors, the number involved and the cost to the State of witnesses.  Will the Minister indicate how he intends to minimise the fees charged at this tribunal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity of saying a few words on this Estimate which is extremely important in so far as it tries to fulfil people's expectations that their rights will be protected. Much of what we say from these benches tends to be negative, and no doubt the Minister is well aware of that as he was good at being negative when he was on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he had some positive things to say from time to time. I wish to refer to one positive matter. Even though it was very humid on Wednesday we completed very important legislation.  That was probably the high point of this Dáil.  For the last five or six weeks while this House was dealing with the Criminal Evidence Bill, the <Col N="1608" /> public did not realise that such good work was being done here because it was perhaps a bit complex for television.  The spirit of co-operation between the Minister and Opposition spokespersons was unbelievable.  In the debate on Report Stage which went on to midnight on Wednesday in very humid conditions &mdash; nobody suffered from those conditions more than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; the level of co-operation and standard of debate ensured that we produced very good legislation.  The Minister promised to consider issues raised by Opposition spokespersons before the Bill comes back to this House from the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the public could not see the proceedings on this Bill because it would counter the bad image of politicians.  Politics is not considered to be a very respectable profession these days.  Had the public watched these proceedings they would have seen that this House is capable of doing great things.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, my colleague, Deputy Shatter, Deputy McCartan and others who contributed to that debate and brought it to such a satisfactory conclusion.  Let us hope that there will be more of that type of debate in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the civil legal aid system, mentioned by other Deputies, the status of civil rights and the ability of people, either on their own or through the intervention of the State, to defend their rights.  From the comprehensive body of legislation we have one would think all was well with regard to civil rights in our jurisdiction.  However, there are some extremely disturbing statistics. Some Members will be aware, for example, that 43 per cent of County Monaghan people qualify for medical cards directly or as dependants.  In Donegal the figure is in excess of 50 per cent, which means that 50 per cent of the people of Donegal are on small incomes.  That huge cohort of the population in Donegal are not in a position to afford litigation.  That does not mean that they wish to take such action but I am sure many of them do, and without assistance they would not be in a position to defend their civil rights. <Col N="1609" /> The State is intervening through the civil legal aid system.  All the reports and the experience of that system show that it is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to this matter, as did other Members.  The present system really only amounts to window dressing.  We may boast that there are law centres in various parts but when we look at some of the reports from those centres we know that the way they operate is entirely unsatisfactory.  They are understaffed and the demand for their services is too great.  The Legal Aid Board are afraid to advertise their services because they know that if they did the legal aid system would grind to a halt within 24 hours.</P>
    <P>What are we to do in these circumstances? Are we to provide money to open law centres all over the country, employing many solicitors?  That would be quite expensive.  Are we to employ private practitioners and pay them on a case-by-case basis?  That would be utter madness and the cost over time would be enormous.  I suggest to the Minister that there is another way or, as Fianna Fáil said some years ago, a better way.</P>
    <P>When we were dealing with Justice questions on 11 June last, I asked the Minister if he had considered delivering the legal aid service through private practitioners on a contract basis.  When I mention such a thing many people laugh because the legal system is a product of old times and it could not be described by anybody as being modern although the Government are committed to modernising it.  Last Wednesday evening in this House we had a wonderful discussion about wigs and gowns for almost an hour even though they were not really a very important part of the legislation. However we discussed it because it is such an emotive issue.  It raised the heat in the Chamber to such a degree that my colleague was unable to continue without removing his jacket.  I know that there are intricacies in the system and that it might be quite difficult to operate it on a contract basis but I want the Minister to seriously consider my proposition.  I am convinced that there are young, zealous, <Col N="1610" /> ambitious solicitors with a commitment to ensuring that justice is made available to ordinary citizens who would be able to work under contract.  Will the Minister perhaps set up a study group to look at this?  Some people think this would be impossible because of the way the system works but I believe it can be achieved.  I accept that it would be difficult for a private law office to establish the sort of business they would be likely to get, but I am convinced that it could be done and that within the next five or six years it will be done.  Will the Minister consider whether there is some merit in what I am saying and perhaps establish a pilot project to see how it would work?</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael party are not happy with the way the Government are carrying out their function in this area.  The Minister's speech was full of good intentions and fine language but we are unimpressed by the lack of action we perceive in the Department.  Because of our dissatisfaction we will be voting against this Estimate at the opportune time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Estimate, and I have no doubt that the Minister will be highly successful in his job.  The Minister outlined some of the important issues to be tackled.  The Estimate here is almost £500 million, an increase of almost 5 per cent.  The Minister said that £100 for every man, woman and child is being spent in this budget and that there is one garda for every 320 people.  Such figures tend to make people think that it is a dreadful waste of money, but that is due to the society and there is nothing we can do about it.  We have to have a police force, a court system and back-up services and society has to pay for it.</P>
      <P>I agree with civilianisation in the Garda and I suggest that we have regard to the question of Garda stations.  Near where I live there are four or five Garda stations within striking distance and some of them are very old.  Will the Minister consider building new Garda stations or stations in more centralised positions in order to serve the public better?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are in favour of recruiting more civilians into stations in <Col N="1611" /> order to allow gardaí to do more policing duties.  Much time is wasted by gardaí doing civilian work, preparing papers and in attenting court.  At about midnight on the Criminal Evidence Bill the other evening it was suggested that gardaí should not be required to attend court when documentation that a summons has been served could be used.  That type of change would help the Garda to accept the fact that there are greater opportunities for civilianisation in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Community policing is very important having regard to our quality of life.  In all parts of my constituency where there are laneways and uncontrolled open spaces, late at night, particularly at week-ends, young people gather and use extremely bad language.  Also they behave in a threatening manner.  The very fact that young people gather and sit around together late at night creates dreadful problems for residents in an area.  Since the Vagrancy Act was abolished gardaí cannot move people on.  If people are creating a disturbance they can be moved but they cannot be charged.  I know the Minister is looking at this problem and if he solves it it will be of benefit to society.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I have been extremely concerned about the drugs problem during the past year or so.  It is a major contributor to petty crime in the cities.  In certain areas drugs are the cause of over 70 per cent of all crime.  I was glad that some arrests in this respect have been made in the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>Rape is one of the most horrific crimes against a person.  There are indications that the incidence of this crime has increased dramatically over the past number of years.  I wonder if society is able to handle the battery of influences from all sources?  For example, the weekend before the bank holiday, Sky Movies had a free viewing of their weekend movies in order to publicise their wares. I watched two of the most horrific sex films free of charge in that time.  I believe this type of promotion should not be allowed and I now ask the Minister to speak to his very capable colleague, the <Col N="1612" /> Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, so that this is not allowed happen again.  If one does not wish to watch this type of film one simply does not pay the fee for the movie service. People must be mad to pay the movie companies for such viewing. Young people are able to tell you what will be on every TV channel for the next fortnight and they will stay up late at night to watch these films.  I maintain that Sky Movies should not have free access into everybody's homes.  I am certainly not the most anti-liberal person in this House but I strongly object to this service.</P>
    <P>People may assert that you can go down to the local video shop and take out one of these movies but I contend that you have to walk in and rent the film.  Some young people can become so clued into what is happening on television that the violence seems natural and normal.</P>
    <P>One film screened by Sky Movies over that weekend showed a young woman, an amateur prostitute one might say, who certainly revealed more than Deputy Shatter did the other day, being gang raped.  Explicit sex scenes were beamed into Irish homes at 2 a.m. and I believe we have to guard against that.  Other societies who have liberalised sex and drugs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Tourists expect to be able to leave their cars, with luggage, golf clubs and so on, in our towns and cities, but we know they cannot do so safely.  I commend the Minister on the action he has taken to help combat crime in this area.  Tourism is one of our major industries and it has certainly been affected by these crimes. <Col N="1613" /> I am delighted to see that the action the Minister has taken is bearing results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say for the ears of the Whips, that it is outrageous and nonsensical that we are debating the expenditure of over £470 million in the space of three hours.  To expect any Member, other than the party spokespersons who are allowed more time, to say anything meaningful about these Estimates in ten minutes is insulting.  I know that I sound like a cracked record at this stage but this is not the way we should deal with these weighty matters.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me I wish to make a suggestion to the Minister for Justice and to the Garda authorities that will probably sound heretical but I believe it should be looked at.  I urge the Minister and the Garda authorities to take a new look at the way we run the Garda force, to see if the existing traditional structures could not do with some fundamental change, instead of simply arguing about the proposal for an independent police authority, which I see has surfaced again in the Garda literature.  I think this misses much of the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking everybody into account the force comprises 11,631 people.  They are spending almost £263 million on salaries, wages and allowances and a good portion of this goes on overtime with a reasonable sum being spent on employing civilians. Apart from the civilians who are employed to do clerical duties, a concept I fully support, the whole Garda system is based on the proposition that a young man or woman is trained to be a good garda.  They then go out and do a good job as a member of the force and those who are very good are in line for promotion to sergeant and they then become good sergeants.  In the course of time some become inspectors and some are promoted to the rank of superintendent. After a period some may be promoted to chief superintendent, to assistant commissioner, to deputy commissioner and so on.  I have the greatest respect for the people in the job and the people who are following that career many of whom are excellent but they all come through the <Col N="1614" /> system which is based on the proposition that you train somebody to be a good garda and in the fullness of time some will eventually arrive at the rank of chief superintendent, where they are responsible for a division, or if they are assigned to Garda headquarters they will look after a particular sector of activity.</P>
    <P>What are they doing?  They are running an organisation which employs 11,631 people, a very substantial body of people, leaving aside all the comments that one might justifiably make about the number of gardaí.  The force have to run a widespread system of stations, and support the whole Garda operation on the £4.6 million being spent in this area.  They also run a transport fleet.  Their operational and capital costs will amount to £7.8 million this year; they are also running a radio system which will cost £3.1 million this year.  As one must realise, a whole series of skills is required to run the whole system effectively and get the best value for money.  At the end of the day good policing requires that we get value for money from all the services, personnel, stations, transport fleet, the radio system, etc.  Clearly, to run an organisation employing 11,631 people we need a well developed system of industrial relations and we need that particularly in the Garda force.  We do not want to have unnecessary conflicts with the 11,631 people.  Clearly, too, we need a very good training system.  While I acknowledge the improvements that have been made in recent years both in the facilities and quality and direction of training being provided, we also need personnel who know about fleet management because the fleet involves much more than patrol cars.</P>
    <P>The Garda have a range of other support services.  We need people who can co-ordinate a radio system and a computer system.  A wide range of skills is required, including a number not directly connected with policing.  One does not need to know anything about the detection of crime to be an effective fleet manager or to run a computer system, yet by and large the people who run these systems were recruited and trained as <Col N="1615" /> gardaí and over the years they have acquired other abilities.  That is not necessarily the most productive way of bringing those skills into the system and applying them to the problems with which the Garda have to deal.  There are specialist people in the radio and computer areas and people who have gained a great deal of expertise in running fleets but I suggest, without any disrespect, that most of these people are technicians rather than managers.  While we have specialists in a number of these areas we do not have anything like what might be called a dedicated corps of managers specifically trained for running that system.  If we are spending £474 million, we should consider why we do not have those managers.</P>
    <P>Not many years ago it came to my attention that there was at one time a rather arbitrary system for deciding the overtime requirement of the force and how it would be used.  Every year there was an argument about how much overtime was needed.  The Garda authorities put their argument to the Minister for Justice and they argued with the Minister for Finance.  I had the pleasure of being on two different sides of the argument. The authorities submitted that various notable events were to occur during the year.  After much haggling, a figure was fixed.  That figure was dismembered by the Garda authorities, who allocated it to various divisions.  The divisional officers allocated it by district, according to their general hunch.  It was then allocated on the basis of stations.  The result was that in some parts of the country gardaí were afraid to get involved in various events because they would bust their overtime allocation, while in other cases gardaí were looking for extra work to use up their overtime allowance in case it would be cut the following year.  That kind of thing results from having a system where people who are trained as police persons, men and women, eventually end up doing different jobs.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Garda authorities that they give serious consideration, if only for a defined period of years, to bringing <Col N="1616" /> people into positions in the Force who already have a well established track record and career path in management skills.  Only in that way will we use the £474 million to benefit the service provided by the force to the public.  Some people may regard this as heretical but it is designed to help them better to do the job of policing.</P>

      <P>Is maith liom an deis seo a bheith agam roinnt de mo thuairimí a nochtadh ar an ghné thábhachtach seo de shaol mhuintir na tíre.</P>
      <P>I should like to associate with the words of congratulations extended to the Minister for Justice and on a personal level to say that I am confident in respect of the portfolio held by him that we will presently get a manifestation of his characteristic and proven talents.  I would have the same confidence in the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to state how essential it is that we have an acceptable and respected system whereby wrongs can be rights and the constitutional and natural rights of all of our citizens are safeguarded and protected, a system which provides that appropriate remedies and deterrents are employed against all offenders.  That should be the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the legal process.  While I have absolute confidence in the Minister and the Minister of State and in their civil servants, I cannot honestly say that my confidence extends to the practitioners in our courts.  I will give one or two reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system itself is cloaked in what I would regard as the virtuous mantle of guaranteeing that the innocent shall be protected and, one would assume, that the guilty shall be punished.  Day in, day out, I have ample evidence of the reverse. Under this system, which is a type of linguistic and verbal gymnastics, enigmatical and perhaps fascinating, there is evidence that the guilty is more often proven innocent and that the innocent suffers.  The practitioners do not make any apologies about that.  The Minister of State read out here yesterday what I had proven on a television programme, that solicitors and lawyers are not <Col N="1617" /> interested in the truth, on their own admission.  They are interested in pursuing the interest of whomsoever they presume to defend.  Is that a good system?  Is that a system which should be funded by our people?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>On a former occasion I went back some centuries to give myself courage by referring to an orator in ancient Greece who invariably finished his contribution by saying <i>Cartago delenda est</i> and having repeated it often enough the day actually arrived when Carthage was destroyed.  I want the whole legal system examined and changed.  These great people might use the phrase <i>reductio ad absurdam.</i> An example of the absurd is the case where a father does not deny that he is the father of a girl and the girl is there to give evidence, if asked, that she is the daughter of the father, but a person employed in this great legal exercise can put to the judge what he calls &ldquo;a point of law&rdquo; which takes precedence over the fact.  In the Waterford case the unfortunate father, as I understand it, at no stage denied he was the father, rather in his statement he referred to allegations made against him by his daughter.  Nevertheless, the lawyer was able to present a case to the judge and prove that in law the man was not the father.  The man was acquitted and today the daughter, whose rights we were required to protect, wanders around, the victim of having attempted to get justice for herself in respect of appalling offences committed against her.</P>
    <P>Another case brought to my notice, not quite so serious, tends to bring to the whole exercise the characteristic of a lotto type attitude &mdash; dependent on the day, the pesonalities looking after your interest, the judge and the humour he is in, anything can happen.  This is not terribly different from the rules, regulations and principles that govern the lotto.  This was the case of a couple whose car was stolen.  Two days afterwards, because of the great work done by the Garda, the car was found in Swords, with the person who had stolen the car in it. He was one of these present day youths <Col N="1618" /> with what I call the chestnut hairstyle and he had rings in his ear.  He was brought before the court and the judge asked whether the prosecuting lawyer had evidence before him &mdash; we should remember this youth was caught in the car &mdash; this young gentleman did not have the permission of the owner of the car to be in it.  The unfortunate prosecuting lawyer said he did not but it happened that the owners of the car were there and could be called.  The judge said: &ldquo;I did not ask that question, I asked, do I have evidence before me that the young gentleman did not have permission of the owner to be in the car?&rdquo; There was some mumbling or fumbling by the solicitor, who was there on behalf of the State, but the judge said: &ldquo;Case dismissed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have respect for Deputy McCartan who is a member of that profession but in my listening to him he never allows the traditions or the requirements of the <i>esprit de corps</i> to override that which he regards as essential.  I should like to put to him a question about what is called &ldquo;free legal aid&rdquo;.  That is only a euphemism for guaranteeing that solicitors get their fees.  Looking at the <i>modus operandi</i> and what it is there in aid of, I do not see why the rest of the innocent community should be obliged to provide for a situation where a person who is guilty of some crime is given the right to silence, if he tells the truth he will be convicted but, at the expense of the rest of the community, he can employ a person whose professional expertise allows him &mdash; even though he is guilty &mdash; to bring in some doubt to &ldquo;get you off&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor made an excellent point when he talked about the judges not understanding the economic or the financial significance of imposing a fine of £250 on a person who did not have £250. In respect of a service which affects so many of our people it is extraordinary and terribly disappointing when parchments are being presented to solicitors and gentlemen and ladies take silk or are called to the Bar, I seldom see a Finglas, Ballyfermot or Darndale address.  Our values on everything will be conditioned by our homes, our social environment <Col N="1619" /> and we, better than anybody else, understand the difficulty in providing £250 rather than those who never had to worry about £250, where that sum merely refers to digits rather than practicalities and difficulties that people have to endure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the first Estimates the new Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, has presented to the Dáil and I am sure he would like to make an impression.  He can make such an impression by dealing forthwith with Ireland's blots on our justice books&mdash; such as the Nicky Kelly case, the Tallaght Two case, the applications for refugee status by such people as Marey Guatrami and the unfortunate Liberian, Foster.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal first with the Nicky Kelly and Tallaght Two cases.  Those cases were highlighted by Michael Heney in RTE television programmes.  Why is it that the Department of Justice have to be shaken out of their apathy by television programmes?  Is the Minister aware of the commitment by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, to the Meleady and Grogan families in November 1990 when Joseph Meleady finally accepted early release from Mountjoy jail?  Earlier when the then Minister for Justice offered Joseph Meleady early release he declined to take it, but when the former Taoisech, Deputy Haughey, gave a commitment that an investigation would be carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions and that the report would be ready in weeks rather than months.  Joseph Meleady accepted early release which saved the Government further embarrassment during the presidential election campaign. This report has been with the Attorney General since last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Heney programme raised many serious questions on the convictions of Meleady and Grogan.  One year later, a programme also produced by Michael Heney was shown, highlighting the injustice of Nicky Kelly's conviction.  Nicky <Col N="1620" /> Kelly has now been pardoned but the Tallaght Two have not.  Why is the report on the Tallaght Two still being examined by the Attorney General?  Surely the procedures are much the same.  What does this report contain which is keeping it under raps?  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>When will the Tallaght Two be officially vindicated?  When will Nicky Kelly be given compensation?  Following on from this what about Osgur Breatnach's proceedings through the courts for damages against the State?  Notebooks compiled by gardaí who interrogated Breatnach in 1976 are being sought by way of discovery since last May.  The High Court has ordered the State to furnish these but, without explanation, they have not been supplied.  The State applied to the High Court for an adjournment until October saying that this was with the consent of Breatnach but this was untrue.  How can the Minister stand before us today, debating Estimates for a justice system which shows so little justice or compassion.</P>
    <P>Why can I get no information from the Minister regarding the most dreadful case of Marey Guatrani and, indeed, others who are seeking protection from this so-called caring and Christian society.  Why have those seekers after safety been locked up in one of the worst Dickensian prisons, Mountjoy, where they have been attacked by other prisoners?  Where is the Minister's heart?  Where is the much vaunted Irish care for minorities?  Where does that show?  It is on the scrapheap, and what is the Minister going to do about that?  Action is required now &mdash; not next week, next year or the year after.  How can we hold up our heads when such dreadful things are happening on the doorstep of the Department of Justice?</P>
    <P>The continued delay in the ratification of the Convention on the Exchange of Prisoners has now reached the level of low farce.  It was apparent from the Minister's demeanour when I raised the matter at Question Time recently that he has no intention of ratifying the convention. I remind Members of the House that the purpose of that very humane convention is to allow prisoners to serve <Col N="1621" /> their sentences in their native country, close to family and friends.  Where is the Minister's heart?  Where is his christianity?</P>
    <P>I question the treatment that the Minister has already meted out to the Garda Síochána.  Could it be considered, as the editor of the <i>Garda News</i> states, arrogant or even rude?  What about the serious concerns that the Garda Síochána will have protecting this country from arms importation and drug trafficking when the internal borders come down within a few months' time?  What is the position of the request of the force for the establishment of divisional intelligence units to help them with the increased importance of coastal watch, counter smuggling and arms searches?  What does the Minister have to say about the dissatisfaction of the force regarding the conditions of many Garda stations?  It was appalling to hear the Minister say, &ldquo;Castlebar Station is one of the last remaining bad-condition barracks in the country&rdquo;.  Does the Minister have so little knowledge of his new portfolio that he would make such an incredible inaccurate statement?</P>
    <P>I turn now to the conditions of our Prison Services.  I am pleased that some action is being taken to improve conditions in Mountjoy, particularly in the women's prison.  The improvements do not come before time.  Many people have lost their lives in Mountjoy, presumably caused by conditions in which factoryfarm animals would not be kept &mdash; and the House knows of the Green Party's attitude to keeping farm animals in such dreadful conditions.  The Minister keeps human beings that way and then wonders why they kill themselves out of deep and uncontrollable depression, out of extreme hopelessness.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the small claims procedure.  That is an extremely important issue and it is one about which the Consumer Association of Ireland have been lobbying successive Ministers for Justice.  The reference to the small claims procedure in the Minister's contribution is full of the usual cliches such as the position is being &ldquo;closely monitored&rdquo;. The matter is a very simple one.  For <Col N="1622" /> goodness sake, surely we could just get out and do something.  People need to be taken out of the clutches of solicitors in respect of simple cases for which the fees charged are completely out of proportion to the amount of work involved.  The matter could be dealt with very easily.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that there has been an increase in the Vote for the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds, because serious delays have been experienced in those two sections.  I notice that a sum of £11.3 million is provided whereas the revenue in a full year will come to only £2.6 million.  I put it to the Minister that there is no reason that the ordinary taxpayer should be expected to pick up the shortfall of about £9 million. Why should the unemployed in Ballyfermot and Darndale, who pay their taxes every time they have a pint, be expected to subsidise land owners, property owners and house owners?  They are well prepared to pay their way.  If it costs £11 million to service the Land Registry, then that £11 million should be collected from those who are using their services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question relates to an issue that I deliberately did not raise today because it has been raised on so many occasions and we seem to get nowhere. <Col N="1623" /> It remains a concern of the House that the position of the alleged Tallaght Two has not been resolved.  Could the Minister say what is happening in that regard? Why has the matter been delayed for so long?</P>
    <P>My final question relates to the court system and two innovations promised by the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify what has happened with regard to the promised special court for dealing with civil appeal cases and why there is no apparent provision for it in the Estimate.  The other promise concerns the putting in place of procedures to allow alleged miscarriages of justice to be looked into.  What is happening there? Will legislation be introduced in that regard or will a special tribunal be established to deal with that or will it be dealt with in the manner recommended in the existing report?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals to establish a working group under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter McGuire, Senior Counsel, to examine the whole area of fraud.  I did not have the opportunity to comment on these earlier.  The Minister anticipates that the working group will submit a document to him towards the end of the year.  Does he intend to publish that document or to make it available to either the Law Reform Commission or Members of the House for consideration and deliberation?  Given what is envisaged, I urge the Minister to do that.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that there were approximately 750 people on community service work, which seems to be a very small figure over the whole country. In view of the Minister's commitment to working the non-custodial aspects of penal law, does he envisage any substantial expansion of the number of people ordered to do community service work in the coming year?</P>
      <P>Finally, I presume that the Minister will respond to the questions I raised about the Nicky Kelly case and the position of Mr. Breatnach and other in his general reply.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Shatter in raising this issue of the Tallaght Two, a case with which I have been involved for some time.  The Taoiseach gave me a reply in the Dáil some months ago that a report on the case was imminent.  He assured me that the result of the Attorney General's inquiry would be published.

I felt that the vast majority of those making contributions wanted to be helpful and ensure that better value is obtained for the money being voted here today.  I appreciate their remarks because the vast majority of contributions were helpful in trying to see that better value will be got for the Estimate introduced here today. Of course not every contribution was helpful but the Member to whom I refer has left the Chamber so I will deal with the matter some other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Shatter, I am having the mediation service reviewed and I intend to appoint a review committee <Col N="1625" /> very shortly.  The mediation service continues to operate as heretofore in the meantime and a sum of £122,000 has been allocated for that purpose.  However, I will look more closely at that aspect.</P>
    <P>Nothing has yet appeared on my desk in relation to the Tallaght Two.  I indicated that when a report is sent to me from the Attorney General I will deal with it expeditiously as I did in the case of the report on Nicky Kelly.  I am sure it is acknowledged that as soon as I received the report in relation to Nicky Kelly I dealt with it.  The issue of compensation has been raised in relation to that case &mdash; there have been comments in the newspapers about it &mdash; and I understand that negotiations are taking place between the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the legal representatives of Mr. Kelly.  I am sure the Deputies would not feel it appropiate to deal with the matter in the House.  I sincerely hope that the negotiations will be concluded soon.

I will not commit myself to complete agreement with the Martin recommendations in that regard as refinements may be needed.  However, we are at an advanced stage in preparing a decent response in that regard.  If necessary, I will give it priority and I hope to be able to deal with it this year.</P>

    <P>Deputies will be aware that we have taken steps in relation to fraud and that the number employed in the Garda Fraud Squad has been increased substantially recently.  We brought back some people <Col N="1626" /> who have considerable expertise in that area who had moved to other sections as a result of promotion.  They have dramatically inproved the situation.  It must also be remembered that they can &mdash; and do &mdash; seek outside expertise if and when it is required to deal with cases. I have looked at the names of people involved, there is considerable expertise within the Garda Fraud Squad as some of them are very highly qualified, one is an accountant.  The advisory committee have been appointed and I have asked them to report to me around Christmas. I do not know whether it would be useful to make the report public, normally matters of that kind are internal.  I expect that they will also be dealing with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on dishonesty.  I am sure there is general support in the House for implementing a system which will cater for white collar fraud, some of it on an international scale.  The Criminal Evidence Bill got a good reception in regard to how it would help to deal with that matter.  There is a positive attitude in the House in relation to what is being done in dealing with fraud.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to community service orders.  About 3,200 offenders &mdash; not all involved in community service orders &mdash; are on probation or release and are doing various work.  I hope that we can improve on the number of community service orders as an alternative to a custodial sentence.  Deputy Shatter has been quite active in this regard over a number of years and I said previously that I support his view.  As I said, a review is taking place at present and the Department are dealing with it urgently.  We have the consultative paper ready which deals with all organisations and groups within the penal service at present.  I hope, when we get it all together, we will be able to outline a strategy.  One of the strategies which will be adopted will certainly be alternatives to custodial sentencing.  I would not like to go any further than that except to say that other areas, apart from community service orders, could be considered.  I <Col N="1627" /> look forward to a very lively debate on the report when I introduce it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney made an interesting contribution in regard to the legal profession, trying to get justice in the courts and having a system whereby the guilty are proved guilty and sentenced in the proper way.  I should like to think that the courts have that as their primary concern and that that is the way they work.  He raised an interesting question about the level of fees paid and I will take a closer look at that.  He made a case in regard to a particular instance in which inquiries are concerned and it is something which will have to be addressed in a serious way before too long.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe also referred to community service orders and I take it that there is general support in the House for alternatives to custodial sentencing.  This means that there can be an important input to the review.</P>
    <P>I took particular notice of the question raised by several Deputies about the level of fines and I will take it up with the President of the District Court on their behalf.  Of course we cannot interfere in this regard as the laws are in place and the maximum penalties applying in any case are on the Statute Book; the judge makes his decision in that regard. However, something must be said in regard to a fine of £250 imposed on someone drawing the dole of £52 per week as against somebody earning £100,000 having the same fine imposed on him. Deputies have made petitions in this regard and I should like them to understand that these are looked at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are looked at in the way in which Deputy Taylor suggested today.  It is a very onerous task, administratively, in which to be involved and perhaps if we could deal with the fine at source it might relieve me of involvement. The Minister must look at every file and I spend a considerable amount of time doing that, it is not just a flick of the <Col N="1628" /> wrist, one has to examine the history of the case, circumstances at home, the Garda and probation officer's report and so on.  Deputies come across many of these cases in their constituencies.  I regard such cases sympathetically and I hope the Deputies realise this.  Deputy Taylor's attitude in this regard touched a chord so far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>Crime was mentioned by many Deputies and, while there has been an increase, I know we would all support the Garda in combating it.  Deputy Shatter said that crime increased by 8 per cent in urban areas in 1990.  He speculated about the 1991 figures.  He will be pleased to learn that the figure fell by almost 3 per cent in the Dublin area and rose by about I per cent for the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The question of prison suicides was raised also.  I would draw the attention of the House to the media report yesterday which indicated that there has been a major increase in the number of recorded suicides for the population as a whole. This should be borne in mind when we come to talk about the number of suicides particularly in our prisons.  Prison suicides are the source of great concern for me and it is not a question of two suicides to date this year, three or four last year or five the year before because even one is one too many.  However, I was taken aback by the recent suicide at Wheatfield which is the most modern prison in Europe.  Careful consideration was given to all the matters raised in planning the institution, including the need for surveillance and understanding on the part of the suicide team which operates there but despite this it still happened.  It would lead one to think that perhaps we should take another look at the advisory committee's report and that is what I am doing.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank those who contributed to this debate.  A good job is being done.  However, no one mentioned that the Garda Síochána are celebrating their 70th anniversary this year.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to give particulars of expenditure by the Office of Public Works this year on the basis of the programme format contained in the Appendix to the Estimate for Vote 10 in the Revised Estimate Volume for 1992.  The total amount sought for these programmes is £99,943,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> A sum of £51,641,000 is sought for Programme 1 &mdash; the accommodation programme. Of this £19 million is required for the capital building programme.  This covers the cost of erecting new buildings, as well as adapting and refurbishing others to meet State accommodation requirements.</P>
    <P>In 1992, approximately £3 million will be spent on the ongoing Garda building programme for the Department of Justice. Last year saw the completion of the new divisional headquarters at Anglesea Street, Cork as well as major Garda projects at Balbriggan, Carlow and Shannon. During 1992 schemes will be completed in Dún Laoghaire, Kells, Tipperary, Charleville and Monasterevin. The modernisation of stations at Togher in Cork and Carrick-on-Suir will also be finished.</P>
    <P>The latest phase of the redevelopment of the Garda Training College at Templemore was recently completed.  The entire project is the largest one ever undertaken by the Office of Public Works outside of Dublin and the first two phases have been completed within budget.  The project was initiated as a response to the Walsh report on Garda training and its overall objective was to create an appropriate setting for the training of a modern and effective police force for the future. In the 30 months since construction work began on site it has been transformed from a military style barracks providing a 26 week long elementary training course, to an up-to-date campus facilitating full third-level education for the Garda Síochána.  It would be my hope that this excellent training college would be given recognition in the future as an institution offering a high level of academic study.</P>
    <P>Other building work being undertaken for the Department of Justice includes the refurbishment of the Morgan Place wing of the Four Courts in order to provide additional court accommodation. This project commenced in 1991 and will be completed later this year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2.5 million is required to continue the ongoing employment exchange programme.  Works on the construction <Col N="1631" /> of a new employment exchange at Finglas, Dublin which commenced in 1991, and extensions of the Galway social welfare office and Mullingar employment exchange will be completed this summer. Schemes for new exchanges at Navan Road and Tallaght in Dublin and the extension of the Carlow exchange are expected to commence later this year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that work began during 1991 on the refurbishment of the Treasury Building in the Lower Castle Yard, Dublin Castle and it is scheduled for completion later this year.  The Treasury Building was built around 1712, making it the oldest surviving purpose built office building in Dublin and, consequently, it has considerable architectural importance.  The project also includes the restoration of some external architectural features in the vicinity of the Treasury Building, such as Palace Street entrance to the castle, to improve the general appearance of the area.  The cost of the project is £3.5 million and the building will be occupied by the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.  I am sure the House will be pleased with this decision.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on the provision of a new extension at the Revenue Computer Centre, Johns Road, Inchicore. The work is scheduled to be completed later this year.  Works on the restoration of the curvilinear range of glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens, the work of the renowned Dublin ironmaster Richard Turner, will commence this year at an estimated cost of £4.5 million over four years.</P>
    <P>A major refurbishment of the 1968 wing of the National Gallery of Ireland, which will take two years to complete at a cost of some £6 million, as well as repairs to the extensive roofs of the National Museum, will commence later this year.  Work is also scheduled to start shortly on refurbishment of State owned buildings at 9-10 Upper O'Connell Street, Dublin.  This new office development for the Revenue Commissioners will include the provision of a central public inquiry office which will constitute <Col N="1632" /> a major improvement of services to the public.  The development will have the major added advantage of enabling the Commissioners of Public Works to dispose of rented property in Pearse Street, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Progress continues on the implementation of the decentralisation programme, based on the need for a more widespread location of public service facilities and job opportunities.  Deputies will be aware of the importance which the Government attach to the decentralisation programme and I am particularly proud of the role being played by the staff of the Commissioners of Public Works in ensuring the success of the entire programme.</P>
    <P>Phase 1 of the programme was completed in 1989 and saw the move of about 800 staff to centres at Cavan, Galway, Sligo and Ballina.  Phase 2 is well on the way to completion with offices at Athlone, Killarney and Letterkenny having being occupied by over 500 staff. Projects at Ennis and Nenagh have been completed.  The Ennis building is occupied and was officially opened yesterday. Staff are now moving into the offices at Nenagh.  The remaining project, in Limerick, is scheduled for completion in the spring of 1993.  Over 1,000 public servants will occupy these latter three buildings.</P>
    <P>Phase 3 of the programme was announced in June of last year.  It involves moving sizeable sections from ten Government Departments to eight provincial centres, Cork, Dundalk, Killarney, Longford, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Waterford and Wexford.  The staff to be moved will be in the region of 1,500 persons. Developers have been selected for the offices in Longford and Cork and construction work is expected to begin shortly.  Preparatory work is in hands in relation to the other centres.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation programme is giving the opportunity to substantial numbers of people to return to their native areas on a permanent basis.  The very desirable long term objectives of helping to reduce regional imbalances and pressure on the Dublin area are also <Col N="1633" /> being achieved.  The towns to which public service staff have already been moved are now reaping the economic benefits and a welcome shot-in-the-arm has been provided to the business, commercial and social life of the communities.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, decentralisation projects are being designed, built and financed by private developers with the State purchasing the buildings on a deferred payment basis over 20 years. These payments will be met from the rent and rates subhead.  Rents, which have remained static for a number of years, have recently shown some upward movement. This factor is reflected in the increase in the allocation from just over £20 million in 1991 to £22 million this year.  The decentralisation programme will bring about substantial savings to the Exchequer in the coming years arising from a reduction in the figures for renting prime Dublin office space.  It is now interesting to note that public representatives who originally opposed the programme are now its greatest advocates. I am very pleased to have been responsible for handling the entire decentralisation programme since its commencement in 1987.</P>
    <P>In the light of developments affecting Departments' accommodation requirements, and in particular, the decentralisation programme, the Commissioners of Public Works have undertaken a detailed assessment of the accommodation allocations of each Department, with a view to achieving the optimum use of space and releasing the maximum amount for disposal.  Occupancy surveys of the allocations have resulted, since 1986, in the disposal of some 500,000 square feet of space.  An additional 400,000 square feet have been reallocated, under a rationalisation programme, to meet the needs of new Government services and to relieve overcrowding etc.  This figure includes some 31,500 square feet for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Disposal of a further 350,000 square feet is targeted.  Some notable disposals attributable, either in whole or in part, to decentralisation are Teach <Col N="1634" /> Earlsfort; Davitt House, Mespil Road; Nos. 21-33 Merrion Street; Hume House; Lincoln House and Phibsborough Tower in our capital city.</P>
    <P>The accommodation programme also includes building maintenance, for which a sum of £9,351,000 is required; purchase of sites and buildings for which £750,000 is sought; energy costs for which £400,000 is required; national lottery funding of £100,000 for conservation work at the National Library and £40,000 for visitors' services at Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The figure of £750,000 for the purchase of sites and buildings is £450,000 higher than the 1991 Estimate.  This is attributable to the acquisition of a site for a new Garda Divisional Headquarters at Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>A sum of £7,216,000 is sought for arterial drainage under Programme 2. This will provide for the survey, design, construction and maintenance of arterial drainage and embankment schemes.</P>
    <P>The 1992 allocation of £260,000 for survey and design work will allow the ongoing environmental impact assessment and cost benefit analysis of the flood relief schemes for the Mulcair River to be completed as well as the continuation of other studies.  This cost is met from subhead L.1.  This subhead also provides for hydrometric survey work involving the collection and analysis of data on many rivers throughout the country.  This survey work provides essential information on the country's water resources.</P>
    <P>The cost of construction work on arterial drainage schemes is met from Subhead L.2.  This year's provision is £3 million.  By the end of 1991 70 per cent of the Boyle River and 90 per cent of the Monaghan Blackwater River schemes had been completed.  It is expected that the latter scheme will be finished towards the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>At that stage, although some of the workers engaged on the scheme will be retained for the post-completion maintenance programme and efforts will be made to accommodate others on alternative projects being undertaken by the commissioners, it is regrettable that a number will have to be made redundant. <Col N="1635" /> It is no consolation that this is the norm at the end of arterial drainage schemes. But these schemes are, of course, finite projects and their wide geographical distribution does not always facilitate the continued employment of those engaged, for the most part, for the duration of a particular scheme at construction stage.</P>
    <P>On completion of these schemes, which have been in progress since 1982 and 1985 respectively, substantial benefit will have been conferred on more than 40,000 acres of land which heretofore had serious problems of flooding or waterlogging. This brings the total area of land benefiting under the national programme, which is carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945, since its commencement, to 650,000 acres.  This represents a vast investment of public funds over the years.</P>
    <P>Maintenance of completed arterial drainage schemes will account for £3,956,000 in 1992.  An amount of £1,132,000 is required under Programme 3 this year to cover the cost of engineering plant and machinery for arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>A sum of £7,201,000 is sought for Programme 4 covering our national parks and Wildlife Service.  This figure includes the cost of projects which will be partfunded by the EC Structural Funds for tourism-related projects.</P>
    <P>The care and protection of our Natural Heritage is entrusted to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.  Five national parks have been established and to date 71 national nature reserves, five refuges for fauna and 68 wildfowl sanctuaries have been designated.  Suitable sites for nature conservation purposes are constantly monitored.  I expect accelerated progress on the acquisition of such lands now that the EC &ldquo;Habitats Directive&rdquo; has been agreed.</P>
    <P>Both parks and reserves are managed by a dedicated staff of experts and ongoing management successes often go unnoticed by the general public.  For example, when the commissioners acquired Glenveagh National Park for <Col N="1636" /> the people one of the most immediate threats to the habitats there was the continuing encroachment of rhododendrons. The intense growth of this introduced plant prevents natural regeneration of our native woodlands.  I am pleased to say that it will be eradicated from Glenveagh Park within the next five years.</P>
    <P>Another example of committed management is the continuing research into the dynamics of our boglands.  This has resulted in a joint research project between the Irish and Dutch Governments, a recent highlight of which was the twinning of Clara Bog in Ireland with its counterpart, Bargerveen, in Holland. In addition, the staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Services provide, at a local level, an extremely important information and education service to the public through their contacts with private groups and organisations, advisory services and talks in schools and other educational outlets.  In this regard the recent appointment of twelve additional wildlife rangers is welcomed.</P>
    <P>However, the committed work by the Office of Public Works staff is being overshadowed by the current controversy about the provision of visitors centres at parks and reserves.  Before I outline the progress on these projects to the House I think I should briefly set out the philosophy guiding these developments.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are essentially a conservation organisation.  Areas of importance to our heritage are acquired and their subsequent management, including control of visitor access, is determined by the overall objective of conservation.  Visitor centres serve a dual role of providing for interpretation and public appreciation of the heritage while, at the same time, serving to control visitors so that the natural or cultural resources being protected are not damaged.</P>
    <P>This role of interpretation, in fostering an appreciation of the nation's heritage is crucial.  Although provocative and inspirational, interpretation is not merely entertainment.  It helps parks and other protected areas to contribute to people's understanding of nature and culture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> Interpretation is an integral component of the Office of Public Works' management policies for national parks, monuments and nature reserves.  The commissioners use a variety of different approaches to convey the significance of a park or monument to the public.  An interpretative programme for a park would include: (1) the recruitment of rangers and guides to provide tours, walks and talks for visitors; (2) the publication of a series of books, leaflets and pamphlets; (3) the provision of visitor centres containing display, exhibits and audiovisual programmes; and (4) the construction of information boards, panels, nature and historical trails.</P>
    <P>Interpretation is inextricably linked to a sense of place, a fact which is accepted worldwide.  Interpretation is therefore specific to a particular site, be it a national monument, national park or wildlife site.</P>
    <P>On-site visitor centres are essential elements in the management of public access to the heritage landscape.  This is also recognised worldwide.  The provision of visitor centres at Ireland's major heritage sites is all the more important given Government policy which aims to significantly increase the number of visitors to this country.  In recognition of this, given the commissioners' track record in the management of public access to our heritage sites, it is not inconsistent with their conservation ethos to avail of EC Structural Funds through the tourism operational programme.  There is no alternative funding mechanism to provide for such access and conservation needs.</P>
    <P>It is within this overall framework that visitor centres are provided.  The value of visitor centres in national parks and reserves, therefore, is that such centres, while managing public access, provide the opportunity to develop an interpretative programme to encourage public appreciation of the various areas and all they contain and thus secures their preservation and the protection of the environment generally.</P>
    <P>Not all the current proposals for visitor facilities at our national parks and reserves are controversial.  I was pleased <Col N="1638" /> to open new facilities at Killarney National Park earlier this year.  I recently officiated at the opening of a new centre at the National Historic, Literary and Nature Park at Coole/Garryland Reserve, near Gort, County Galway.  Last week I had the pleasure of opening an extension to the Visitor Centre at Connemara National Park.  Later in the year I hope to open two smaller centres at Dromore Nature Reserve, County Clare, and at Wexford Wildfowl Reserve.</P>
    <P>The provision of a visitor centre for the Wicklow Mountains National Park has been the subject of controversy.  People have conveniently disassociated this aspect of the park from all the other achievements in Wicklow.  The fact that we now have approximately 15,000 hectares of land set aside for conservation, that in these difficult financial times five staff have been recruited, that major commercial conifer plantations in the core area have been resisted and that over 5,000 school children last year were assisted by park rangers in deepening their understanding of conservation, have been conveniently overlooked.  The provision of the centre should be seen in balance with these achievements.  Apart from the Office of Public Works' recognised expertise in this matter both independent consultants and the planning authority have validated the choice which has been made.  We have now signed the contract for the centre and work will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>The Burren centre has aroused organised opposition.  Again in criticising the use of Structural Funds for this project opponents have overlooked the fact that in tandem with this funding the Government made allocations available to progress the land acquisition programme for the Burren National Park and the recruitment of staff for it.  I am aware of the strength of support for the project among the local community and their grievance that their view has not been given equal attention in the national media.  The project was the subject of an independent Environmental Impact Statement and the public were invited to comment on it.  The comments of the public are being <Col N="1639" /> assessed in detail with a view to responding in full to any criticisms raised and to satisfying the planning authority that the project will not harm the environment in any way.  The decision on the development must not be based on the incomplete story publicised in the media but on the facts of the proposal which will be appraised by the planning authority in a balanced manner.</P>
    <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service are responsible for identifying areas of scientific interest.  An area of scientific interest is an area of special interest for its fauna and/or flora, either as individual species or as communities, or for its geology or topography.  Selection of an area is based only on scientific criteria which relate to the fauna, flora and general ecosystem.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service intend to update their knowledge of these areas over the next 18 months and to compile a comprehensive computerised inventory, including maps, for them.  The interdepartmental committee set up in 1990 to consider the whole question of ASI's completed their report in mid-1991.  A Memorandum for Government has now been prepared.  It has been circulated to the relevant Government Departments and will be submitted shortly to Government for approval.</P>
    <P>The research role of the service is vital in the formulation of conservation policy and in assessing factors and trends affecting the natural environment.  Existing programmes will continue to be serviced in so far as possible.  These include surveys on our Greenland White-fronted Goose, badger and bat populations, sea birds, falcons, dune systems, blanket bogs and protected flora.  The blanket bog survey is due for completion this year and we will then establish the amount of blanket bog which is appropriate for conservation.</P>
    <P>In March 1992, Ireland, through the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, hosted an International Workshop to discuss the conservation of the Greenland White-fronted Goose.  Ireland is the winter <Col N="1640" /> home for half of the world's population and these geese are the third rarest in the world.  The aim of the workshop was to draw up an international plan for the conservation of this goose.  Representatives from the Governments of the Range State Countries for the goose, which are, in addition to Ireland, the United Kingdom, Iceland and Greenland, represented through Denmark, attended the workshop, as did about 50 other experts and interested organisations from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, Germany, Denmark, France and Belgium.  Conservation, farming and hunting interests in Ireland also attended.  The European Commission was also represented.</P>
    <P>The workshop was very productive and culminated in a formal declaration by all the parties which recommended the implementation of long term co-operative measures, including an international plan for the conservation of the Greenland White-fronted Goose. Arrangements are now being made to place this recommendation on a formal footing by the conclusion of an agreement between the Range States.  Ireland is acting as the secretariat in order to bring about this formal agreement.  The plan which was developed at the workshop is the first of its kind to be developed in Europe for a bird population and the agreement now being prepared is also a first.</P>
    <P>The conservation of wildlife is obviously a matter for international concern. Various problems and challenges are common to a number of states, and so international co-operation is essential. Thus our officials have regular working contacts with many international governmental and other organisations.  They also facilitate the administration and implementation of laws arising from the ratification by the state of international conventions dealing with various aspects of wildlife conservation.</P>
    <P>The provision for the maintenance, management and development of Inland Waterways under Programme 5 is £6,002,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could have a minute or two to conclude my remarks in regard to waterways.</P>
      <P>The function of the waterways division is to maintain, manage and develop as public amenities, the inland waterways for which the Office of Public Works have responsibility, that is, the Royal and Grand Canals, the Barrow Navigation and the River Shannon and its associated waterways.</P>
      <P>The commissioners have been developing facilities on the Shannon on a progressive basis for many years.  During 1992 approximately £2.4 million will be spent on the day to day maintenance and operation of the navigation and on a continuing programme of major development works.  The principal projects being undertaken in 1992 are the enlargement of the harbour at Banagher, County Offaly, and the construction of a new pier at Terryglass on the shores of Lough Derg.  Work has started on the reopening of the Lough Allen Canal.  This will link up the Shannon Navigation right into Lough Allen, thus giving a terrific boost to tourism and development generally in County Leitrim.  The project is being partially funded by the EC under the Interreg Fund.  A survey of the Erne navigation was undertaken last year and work to remove some obstructions will be undertaken later this year.</P>
      <P>With a view to the future, the commissioners have commissioned a study of the inland waterways of Ireland.  This is now virtually completed and will shortly be presented to the Government for consideration. It will be a benchmark report and it is likely to inform decisions on the development of inland waterways for the foreseeable future.</P>

    <P>The inland waterways of this country were under-utilised and under-developed for many years but recently there is a growing awareness and appreciation of their potential.  Not only are they a valuable <Col N="1642" /> part of our heritage, but they are also very important in the context of the development of tourism, a fact which is reflected by their inclusion for funding under the EC Structural Funds Operational Programme for Tourism and by the emphasis being placed on them by the Government, which in particular is being stressed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.</P>
    <P>I have referred to some of the activities of the Office of Public Works.  Such is the diversity of the activities managed by the commissioners on behalf of the people of Ireland, that even if I were to speak for another hour and a half I probably would not cover all of them.  I will be happy to reply to any questions asked by Members.  I will do my utmost when concluding the debate to refer to various points I have not referred to at this stage. I thank the Chair for her co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the affairs of the Office of Public Works.  It is the first time since my second coming to the Dáil, which began in 1989, that I have had the opportunity to discuss the affairs of the Office of Public Works in terms of their Estimate and annual spending.  The Office of Public Works are engaged in many activities.  The budget for this office is approximately £100 million.  It is seldom realised that this is one of the largest spending areas of Government.  I welcome this debate which I hope will enable us to comprehensively examine the various activities of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the nature of the Office of Public Works and the myriad of functions they carry out.  The Office of Public Works are often criticised for having too many functions and for not carrying out many of them as efficiently as they might: because they have, to use the old saying, &ldquo;too many irons in the fire&rdquo;, none of their activities are managed very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of 1988 the Government commissioned Price Waterhouse, a leading consultancy firm, to carry out a report on the Office of Public Works.  It is <Col N="1643" /> interesting to read the terms of reference they were given: they were to examine &ldquo;the present operations of the Office of Public Works in all its aspects and recommend whatever changes are necessary to ensure an efficient and cost effective service to the State&rdquo;.  I understand Price Waterhouse commenced their work at the beginning of January 1989 and they produced a voluminous report at the end of that year or early in 1990.  I gather that the then Taoiseach and Minister for Finance took major decisions on that report in spring, 1990.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that that report has never been published.  There is widespread public interest in this issue. The Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, have a major interest in this report in terms of efficiency in public spending.  This report cost £94,187 to produce.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this report has not been published.  What did this report say about the Office of Public Works and their operations? Did the Government consider their findings too embarrassing to reveal them?  As I said, I understand the then Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance took certain decisions in relation to the report in spring, 1990.  Why were those decisions not made known to the public? I ask the Minister to say when this major report will be published.  Perhaps he can outline some of its findings to the House. What are the major findings in the report and why have they not been published? It is unacceptable that the findings of this report have not been published two years later.  I hope the Minister will be able to give a comprehensive answer to that question.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at great length with the various activities of the Office of Public Works.  In the limited time available to me I will deal with a number of areas in which I see problems.  First, I will deal with the area of arterial drainage. Arterial drainage has cost the Exchequer an enormous amount of money since the enactment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  In the region of 34 catchments have <Col N="1644" /> been drained or partially drained in the intervening years.  The whole management approach to these schemes has been totally antiquated.  It might have been appropriate in 1945 but the procedures which have not been changed in the meantime are not adequate today.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about two schemes that are in progress, the Ulster Blackwater, a joint scheme between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and the Boyle-Bonet scheme &mdash; the headquarters of the Boyle scheme is located in my home town of Ballaghaderreen.  To take the Boyle-Bonet scheme as an example, it commenced in 1982 and was to be completed in six and a half years.  However, on the Minister's own admission, it is now only 69 per cent completed.  One must question why there has been such an enormous over-shoot in the length of time allocated for the completion of that scheme.  One assumes that together with the over-shoot of time there has also been a major over-shoot of cost &mdash; quite a substantial sum of money was allocated for this scheme.  Perhaps the Minister will reply to that question.</P>
    <P>Schemes such as these should be examined to find out the reason for the slowness to complete them.  In the Boyle scheme at present all the rock huts are completed, the channels are 80 per cent completed, which is reasonable, but on the structure side, the building of bridges and so on, there is only 48 per cent completion. The reason is that major redundancies of manual and semi-skilled workers were ordered by the Minister in 1987-88.  At the time 110 or 120 skilled or semi-skilled workers in bridge building were made redundant.  However, the permanent ancillary staff &mdash; engineers, supervisors, office staff and fitters &mdash; are still employed to service the people working on those schemes.  These people are working at about 50 per cent of their efficiency because they do not have personnel with the appropriate skills to do the structural work.  That is one reason that such schemes get bogged down.</P>
    <P>Every year Ministers request the man- <Col N="1645" /> agers involved to wind up these schemes. The thinking of the Minister, and the Department, in this regard is unacceptable. Under the 1945 Act there is an obligation on the Government to complete all schemes on schedule.  The Minister, in his speech, referred to improvement in efficiency and so on.  We should ensure that schemes in progress should not be left incomplete.  There should be no jettisoning of major channels or rivers that form part of a system, which apparently is what is contemplated at present.  The solution to the problem is those in charge should be given flexibility to recruit more seasonal workers. People with special skills should not be let go.  There is gross mismanagement in regard to the labour-human resources available to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>There is an argument to be made for adopting a more flexible approach in future arterial drainage.  To date the completion of rivers has involved carrying out channel work and so on that might be better done by farmers, landowners or public bodies.  That is very costly and time-consuming.  The whole system of arterial drainage should be looked at because in certain crucial areas work needs to be done.  Arterial drainage has had a very damaging effect on the environment. The habitats of many fine trout and salmon rivers have been destroyed as a result of arterial drainage.  I accept such work has benefited agriculture, but the right balance has to be found and we should be more selective in future.</P>
    <P>We should be selective and carry out work where major flooding occurs, for example in the area from Athlone to Meelick or Banagher in the Shannon valley which suffers from winter and spring flooding.  The Minister visited the area and met the Shannon Forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I set them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a better reputation than many of his predecessors for addressing this problem.  The area should be designated for a flood relief scheme to be carried out by the Office of Public Works.  On a stretch of river from <Col N="1646" /> Athlone to Meelick the gradients are very steep and as a result the flow of water is much more rapid.  As the water reaches a hollow in the system the speed of flow is much slower, and natural silts and objects dumped in the river over the decades are washed into these hollows.  People tell us &mdash; the Office of Public Works, and the Minister on their behalf, have denied this &mdash; that this nine or ten mile stretch of river, where the water level is lowest in relation to sea level, is a natural reservoir for silts washed downstream.  In that area also there is major drainage from the midlands bogs operated by Bord na Móna and the silts and solids dumped into the system in the last three or four decades by Bord na Móna have settled there.  That in itself is environmentally damaging to fish and marine life in the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People living along the river tell us that in summer the average water level of the river at that point is about two feet higher than it was in the fifties.  It is well known that the average speed of the river in that area 40 years ago was about three knots but nowadays, due to the build-up of silts in the area, the average speed is probably less than two knots &mdash; the average flow of the river is about five or six knots. Something needs to be done about this and it can be done in an environmentally sensitive way.  There is no doubt about that.  About 2,000 families are affected by flood almost on an annual basis.  Forty years ago, and even 20 years ago, this flooding only occurred after very heavy rainfall and when there was unusually high flooding in all parts of the river.  Due to the raising of the river bed on the stretch we are talking about and the consequent slowing down of the speed of flow of water enormous damage is being caused to at least 2,000 families many of whom are in my constituency in Roscommon. Naturally I have an interest in them, but many more are in the Minister's constituency of East Galway.  The Minister of State should address this problem.  There should be a more selective policy approach to arterial drainage. The blanket system has been a mixture of good and bad.  We should now <Col N="1647" /> select specific areas that can be beneficially drained while taking into account environmental matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length on national parks and the wildlife service. A huge amount of money was spent on them.  It is all very well to publish a list of figures and talk about increases but I often wonder what those figures mean. One would need somebody from the Office of Public Works to give an exact breakdown of the figures so that we could have a better impression of what is going on.  While there is an increase in funding, we know that the allocation to the research branch of the wildlife service was reduced at a time when that section was understaffed and grossly overworked. It is all very well to talk about an increase in funding for national parks, but we do not know how the money is being spent. The Minister did not throw much light on that today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined the detail of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The detail certainly was not revealed to me.  There seems to be a lack of proper planning in relation to national parks and areas of special importance.  There has not been a survey to show us how these areas should be properly managed.  The Minister in his speech referred to the national park in Killarney.  There is no vegetation or soil map of Killarney which is essential if one is to know how the eco-system works and how it should be managed.  We need more money for research.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he presided at the opening of Coole Park or some portion of the Lady Gregory centre in Coole Park in Galway.  The catering facilities in that park have been closed down because of water contamination. Had the Office of Public Works invested money in research and, perhaps, sought the advice of the county council that would not have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about archaeological <Col N="1648" /> sites.  We know that there are about 80,000 archaeological and historical sites and monuments here and that about 700 of these are designated as national monuments under the protection of the Office of Public Works. Restoration and improvement works are in progress on a limited number of those sites.  These 700 national monuments present the total work achievement of the 108 year existence of the national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works.  The remaining 70,000-plus sites are designated as historic monuments under the National Monuments Act, 1986, but they do not enjoy any active care or protection principally because of a lack of resources.  There is no doubt that many sites are being damaged by the natural process of ruin, for instance, by exposure to the elements.  Many very significant ones are being encroached upon and damaged by so-called farm improvement projects, commercial forestry and, in some cases, by urban development.</P>
    <P>Instead of the Office of Public Works being responsible for the care of our national monuments we should have a national archaeological service.  While the work being done by the Office of Public Works is very good the amount achieved over the 108 years has been very small and progress in regard to new sites is painfully slow.  We need a national archaeological service which would be operated in the way some of our commercial semi-State bodies operate. This service should protect and develop sites and take account of the fact that many tourists want to visit them.  The Office of Public Works in the way they are structured cannot really respond to the tourist need.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  The Minister ought to know better than me.  From what I see, and from what people say, they cannot respond adequately.  I await the Minister's response to some of the questions I put.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy <Col N="1649" /> Dukes in making a mild protest, at least, about the handling of the Estimates over the past few weeks.  The time given to process Estimates at one time was ridiculously long and now it is ridiculously short.  I recall former Deputy Kevin Boland in his time as Minister for Local Government reading a 120 page script from his Department and taking more than two hours.  The debate on that Estimate went on for six months to the exclusion of all other Estimates.  The Minister on one occasion spent the whole morning replying to the debate and then went on to deal with questions.  I do not know what kind of kidneys the Minister had, but in my memory, that was the longest a Minister spent replying.  We now have to deal with a sum of £662 million for the Environment Estimate in a very short time and only 13 Members will get an opportunity to contribute.  I hope consideration will be given to changing the system next year.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this Estimate. May I take this opportunity to compliment the Minister and the Office for Public Works for the wonderful work they have done in recent years and particularly over the past ten years.  Magnificent buildings have been constructed and improvement works have been carried out on our historic buildings in this city and elsewhere.  The appearance of our public buildings has improved considerably. A great deal of work has been carried out in improving the National Concert Hall, the Royal Hospital, Dublin Castle and indeed the Custom House, where I took the initiative some years ago in having improvement works carried out.  This work has added to the splendour of our capital city and is most welcome. It is not appropriate at present to complain about the money spent on Government Buildings and the Taoiseach's office as this is covered under another Estimate but I admire the work that has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with some regret that I raise the fact that Leinster House has been ignored.  While the weather has been very pleasant, this Chamber has not been an easy place to work in.  We have had to <Col N="1650" /> bring in these awful fans, which clash with the rest of the decor, to move hot air from one place to another.  I hope the Minister will use his influence to improve the working conditions in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>We brought a group of young physically handicapped children from the Marino Clinic in Bray to visit this House. Because of the wonderful assistance from the ushers, staff and the children's helpers they were able to see most of the House but because of the difficulties of access to the Seanad, they were not able to see that Chamber.  I think something should be done about access for the disabled. We are very fortunate that all 166 Members are able-bodied and can move around without difficulty.  However I remember the measures that had to be taken when a wheelchair-bound person was elected to Wicklow County Council whose meetings were held in a room at the top of the old courthouse.  I am sure that if one or two Members of this House were similarly disabled changes would have to be made as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I received a welcome letter from the Minister announcing that the contract for the visitors' interpretative centre at Whitehall, Luggala, would commence shortly.  This has been very controversial. Indeed the whole movement to set up interpretative centres around the county is attracting a great deal of controversy. Deputy Jacob, who is present, is chairman of Wicklow County Council and he and I among others have had to bear the brunt of the criticism because of our total support for this project in County Wicklow. A member of Deputy Jacob's own party is one of the most virulent opponents of the siting of this centre, and I had to take particularly difficult criticism from him at a recent meeting.</P>
    <P>A new description is being used to describe people who visit historical buildings and sites throughout the world.  They are known as &ldquo;eco-tourists&rdquo;.  Usually they have specialist knowledge and have access to historic buildings and monuments from which the general public are excluded, for example the Pyramids of Egypt, the Taj Mahal, the Parthenon in Greece, and the Galápagos Islands. <Col N="1651" /> Wicklow is not going to become that kind of place; the granite in Wicklow is particularly solid and it can take the millions of people who wish to visit our beautiful county.  The vast majority of visitors come from the city and county of Dublin. Indeed people who live in Wicklow become a little irritated at the vast numbers who visit at the weekend, when it is very difficult to work, as we Deputies do, because you find yourself in a line of traffic on the N11 from Wicklow to Bray. The tradition over hundreds of years is that the population of Dublin visit Wicklow and this will continue.  However, people are now far more mobile and they can visit every lane and boreen in the county.</P>
    <P>Having created the national park, we can expect more visitors and it will be necessary to explain and interpret the beauties of the county for the visitors.  It leaves me absolutely cold when I think of the virulent nature of the protests about siting the interpretative centre at Luggala. There have been attempts to deflect the protest by suggesting there should be many small interpretative centres surrounding the national park.  That may happen in the fullness of time but the design and location of this interpretative centre seems to meet the immediate needs of the area while remaining within the £4 million budget.  I am sure it will become one of the gems of Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a colleague of mine, the former Deputy Joe Birmingham, as Minister for the Environment, had responsibility for setting up a visitors' centre in Glendalough.  This tastefully designed building was built in a most sensitive area and there was no protest. However, I believe if it was attempted to build this now, ten years later, there would be a stream of protests.  People would now be telling us, the public representatives, that we were not capable of preserving the beauties of our county.  I believe that when this new interpretative centre is in operation, the protests will dissipate and people will appreciate the amenity of a tastefully designed building which will blend into the locality and will <Col N="1652" /> become one of the great attractions of the county.  I am still prepared to defend the decision of the Office of Public Works to site the centre in Luggala.</P>
    <P>People like Dr. Craig and his team have the difficult job of meeting those who are protesting about this centre. Because people are now taking a greater interest in the preservation of our environment there should be some structure where they can voice their protests and have the matter arbitrated on.  The planners demand that the centres are designed to meet the local needs and they are also subject to an environmental impact study, yet I believe there is a need for someone to act as a final arbiter.  It seems that the attack on the Office of Public Works has some element of justification in that there is no provision for an appeal, as there is under the Planning Acts.  Perhaps there should be some such provision in the future.</P>
    <P>The arguments made in respect of the Burren and Mullaghmore have been gathered together with the arguments made about Wicklow and Killarney. There seems to be a movement which proclaims that interpretative centres damage the environment.  All the projects are lumped together by the protesters. Every area has particular aspects. It is unfortunate that the protests were joined together in respect of Wicklow and Mullaghmore.  The opposition presented the case as if the same basic designs were to be used.  In a democratic society people are entitled to air their views but undue influence is given to people who have ready access to the media and seem to be able to appear whenever it pleases on television and to have their letters and reports included in newspapers.  I have been a Member of this House for 23 years and a Minister for five years.  On not one occasion did RTE invite me to put my side of the argument.  I have never been approached by <i>The Irish Times</i> to give my version of the story.  We survive anyway without making our case in that way.</P>

      <P>The people of Wicklow and those of us on the council who have had responsibility for several years to look after the county have maintained it very well.  We are used to people who tell us how to do our job and it does not worry us.  The elected representatives of the people of Wicklow have great concern for the county and its development. County Wicklow will be the foremost tourist area in the country.  It is adjacent to the largest centre of population.  We are improving our roads structure and more development is taking place so that we can encourage visitors to spent some time in the county rather than move through to other areas.  There are several projects for the building of hotels and they will be closely monitored.  If the people of Kerry, who have shown the way in this area, can maintain the physical beauty of that county and at the same time provide the most advanced tourism facilities, it can be done to the benefit of Wicklow.  We need interpretative centres so that the visitor has somewhere interesting to go, apart from just looking at the scenery or dipping a toe in the sea at Brittas Bay.  There is a need to keep people occupied and to enable them to see the area in the best light.  I am delighted with the decision that has been taken and I know the Minister will be asked to build many more of these centres in Wicklow, particularly in the west of the county from Blessington to Baltinglas.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to train local people as rangers and guides.  At the opening of the interpretative centre at Glendalough to which I as a public representative was invited, I was questioned by a young lady as to why I was attending the function.  Obviously she knew her job in some ways but she did not seem to come from the area or to know the people there.  The employment of local people would help to reduce the high rate of unemployment in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other aspects of the activities of the Office of Public Works could be commented upon.  I am delighted to have had the opportunity to mention some of the positive aspects of their work.  I would <Col N="1654" /> hope that they would develop a better liaison with the general public in explaining their objectives and achievements. Anybody familiar with the quality of the work done by the Office of Public Works should be aware that they will not engage in substandard planning.  There is a necessity for some public relations work to explain to people well in advance how a proposed project will influence the environment.</P>
    <P>This Estimate will not be opposed by my party.  There should, however, be more time for debate since very few Members will get the opportunity to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, on returning to a portfolio which he has graced in the past.  I thank him for his courtesy and co-operation with me as a backbench colleague and I wish him well in his onerous responsibility.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the excellent track record of the Office of Public Works in taking care of our public buildings, canals, monuments, nature reserves, national parks and so on.  It is not an exaggeration to say that they have been the heroes in terms of the conservation and protection of our heritage.</P>
      <P>I want to address the issue of the Wicklow National Park.  While it might be approaching parochialism, it has national significance, particularly in view of the controversy that rages when something new is proposed.  We seem to want to object when there is a controversy.  We need to have an outside view, now that our people have said &ldquo;we want to be in Europe and that we want further integration in Europe&rdquo;; we want to be perceived and portrayed in Europe as a progressive responsible nation.  The manner in which we are objecting to proposed developments in the Burren and Luggala in County Wicklow is regrettable and I hope we will depart from that practice in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, arrived in Glendalough and formally announced the national park. The news was greeted positively by the <Col N="1655" /> majority of people.  There was mixed reaction to it and much concern was expressed particularly by residents of the proposed national park.  Eventually the national park will comprise 30,000 hectares stretching from Killakee in the north of the county to south of Lugnaquilla and will have an average width of 10 kilometres.  The initial core area is around the beautiful vale of Glendalough and consists of 3,700 hectares.  In the Powerscourt Estate 2,500 hectares was acquired recently which is additional to the original core area.  I understand that Coillte lands totalling some 5,000 hectares, after harvesting of the commercial timber on those lands, will eventually be taken over, will revert to the Office of Public Works and become part of the Wicklow mountains national park.  It is very important that we get things right from a developmental point of view from the start.</P>
    <P>There was much concern, following the announcement that a national park would be set up.  Landowners feared that there would be compulsory purchase of their land and that people would come onto their land and interfere with their property and livestock.  The concern of sheep farmers in County Wicklow to whom the mountainous areas of the county are very important and who have been there for generations is understandable. I remember bringing deputations &mdash; representatives of the Wicklow sheep farmers &mdash; to Ministers of the day in an effort to clarify matters and to allay their fears.  Those exercises were successful to some extent.</P>
    <P>The interests of people who will be living within and on the periphery of the national park are of paramount importance. I welcome the progress of the national park which can only be good for County Wicklow and for Ireland as a country particularly in the context of tourism where we are making such major strides.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's recent announcement regarding yet another aspect of the national park: the interpretative centre a Luggala.  As has been said <Col N="1656" /> there has been much controversy which was uncalled for but in some ways understandable. The Minister who has taken professional advice and has been assured that the project is in keeping with all EC conditions has announced that it will proceed.  The expenditure of £3.8 million is welcome and the obvious spin-offs for the economy will be extremely helpful.</P>
    <P>However, the concerns to which I have referred will continue to exist so we must find a formula to allay them.  For the further development of the Wicklow mountains national park there must be a rapport or liaison which will satisfy the people concerned that this is positive progress and not something that will be to the detriment of their way of life and that of future generations nor indeed of the environment now and in the future.  I made a suggestion both in writing and verbally to previous incumbents of this portfolio with a view to having this problem dealt with.  I have asked that a small body, a committee, a board of trustees, a board of management &mdash; call it what you wish &mdash; be set up which would act as a liaison mechanism between the residents of the area and officialdom with regard to putting to bed their fears.  I suggest this body consist of the Office of Public Works, Wicklow County Council &mdash; the local authority &mdash; farming organisations, Coillte Teoranta, other local organisations and any interested parties that the Minister and his officials deem appropriate.  It is very important that such a body be put in place.</P>
    <P>The Luggala interpretative centre is only one part of the national park which is a colossal area covering the whole mountain plateau of the Wicklow mountains. As it develops over the years there will be other projects and other controversies. The way to alleviate the situation is to put in place a mechanism whereby there will be communication with the people on the ground, with officialdom and with the Minister.  I earnestly request the Minister to address that issue.  I know he will give it careful consideration.  I know the situation on the ground.  I have taken a positive view of this very welcome project but it is important that the needs <Col N="1657" /> and the fears of the people be recognised and allayed, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Those within the confines or on the periphery of the national park have another fear in relation to planning permission. This is particularly so in the case of landowners or the sons or daughters of landowners to build houses for themselves on their land.  They fear, because they are within the boundaries of the national park, there will be objections from the Office of Public Works where, perhaps the view from the national park may be deemed to be obstructed by the building of such houses.  I am not talking about any monstrosities.  I am talking about ordinary homes for rural people.  I dearly hope this will not be the case and that cognisance will be taken of the need of the local people to live in the area where their families have lived for generations.</P>
    <P>I hope the Office of Public Works will avail of the good will of those people in the future.  I apologise for being parochial but this park, and its interpretative centre, are of national significance.  I compliment the Minister on what he has done.  I want County Wicklow to be portrayed as a progressive and developing county that welcomes with open arms positive development, developers and investors who are prepared to invest in the county in a positive way.</P>

      <P>Those involved in the debate this afternoon who had an opportunity to hear the Minister attempt to complete his speech within the time limit will recognise the amount of work undertaken by the staff of the Office of Public Works, headed by the Minister of State. I am sure Members were impressed at the diversity and importance of the work. I join with Deputy Kavanagh in his expressed hope that by next year a better way will have been devised to deal with Estimates of this importance and that we will be able to organise a debate in such a way that Members and the public may have access to it.  A great amount of the work of the staff of the Office of Public Works, and the Minister of State is not <Col N="1658" /> known and sometimes it is only the issues of controversy that we hear of.</P>
      <P>In the few moments available to me I want to place on record my praise for some of the restoration work that took place in recent years.  The Minister of State, and his staff, deserve to be complimented. It is a matter of great pride to the Irish people that we have craftspeople whose work is of such a high standard that they have been able to restore buildings such as the Custom House and our own Seanad Chamber, works of beauty that are part of our heritage.  Some of the buildings &mdash; the Seanad being one of them &mdash; were originally crafted by people brought in from other countries by the developers, builders or aristocrats from countries such as Italy and France.  Today we are proud that our people have been able to do the plasterwork and the very complex restoration work on furniture and paintings.</P>
      <P>The most recent development worthy of great praise was at the writers' centre and the writers' museum in Parnell Square, Dublin.  Excellent restoration work was carried out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with such restoration work in mind that I was struck by a very important statement at the parliamentary forum during the recent Rio Summit, which I was privileged to attend.  That statement put the issue into perspective.  This comes within the ambit of the Office of Public Works who have responsibility not only for our buildings and national monuments but also for the incredibly wild natural beauty that we have in Ireland. It is the duty of all of us to retain that beauty and to protect it for future generations. In order to get across the enormity of that responsibility and the time limit within which the preservation and conservation work must be done, one of the speakers at the forum said that if one of our best known national or international museums of art or archives were plundered by thieves or ravaged by vandals there would be an international outcry; that if even a small amount of the property of our museums or art galleries were stolen it would be recognised as an international issue.  He said that we have <Col N="1659" /> to treat our natural heritage in the way we treat the collections of art that have been collected in museums throughout the world.</P>
    <P>That statement put the issue into perspective. We must recognise our natural heritage as being precious and irreplaceable. Indeed, it is sometimes more important than the works of art produced by human beings.  We should try to instil that kind of awareness in our own people and tourists.  We should try to impress on them that our natural heritage is as precious irreplaceable and beautiful as any of our human art monuments.  Perhaps in that way we would all have a greater interest in protecting and preserving our environment.  The Office of Public Works certainly have a responsibility in relation to the awareness needed and the importance of taking speedy action to preserve our heritage.</P>
    <P>At international level, but particularly at national level, there is a great need for access to information.  We need more information on what the Office of Public Works do from one year to another.  I agree with Deputy Jacob that a series of information networks should be set up. When new initiatives are embarked on or restoration work is undertaken people should be given information not only about what is taking place but also about the complexity and the sensitivity of the work.  That would give people a sense of pride and of belonging.</P>
    <P>I accept that all work costs money, but I should like to see the development of open days when the staff who have been part of a wonderful project that is approaching completion would be available to give the public information and an explanation about the work and perhaps, even to receive some praise.  The preservation of our heritage is one of the most important programmes in Ireland and throughout the world.  The nineties will be remembered as the decade when we attempted to evaluate, preserve and, hopefully, conserve what was almost lost to us and what we are only now, belatedly, coming to recognise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for additional <Col N="1660" /> accommodation this year in the Four Courts in Morgan Place.  I wish to impress on the Minister of State and, I hope, the Minister for Finance the importance of making provision to deal with the scandalous condition of some of our other court houses.  Some of them are not fit for the serious work that must take place in them.  Privacy should be ensured in a building in which legal proceedings take place.  I do not have time to go into this issue in detail; it has been raised in the course of many other Estimates debates.  There is a need either to provide new premises or refurbish the old premises.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to Garda stations.  I welcome the central site chosen for the Garda headquarters in Dún Laoghaire.  My constituents were concerned that the station be sited in a central position.  I accept that such a suitable site costs money.  I pay tribute to the gardaí who are working in very cramped conditions there.  Their new accommodation will be more up to date and spacious.</P>
    <P>Many Garda stations do not have adequate facilities.  Some lack proper sanitary facilities, and other facilities which prevents greater integration between staff.  As Chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, I am concerned that we do not yet have full facilities for men and women.</P>
    <P>Finally, as spokesperson on the Marine for Fine Gael, I welcome the developments to our inland waterways.  I was very interested to hear the Minister's proposals. I was also very interested in the comments by Deputy Connor on the advantages and disadvantages of arterial drainage.  In regard to conservation, we must take into consideration that in draining we should conserve and preserve fishing and the other natural habitats which have been available to the flora and fauna in those areas.  I hope we have learned our lesson in time in that regard.</P>
    <P>Irish people have become incredibly interested in the tourist and fishing potential of our inland waterways, particularly canals.  We should have a network of canals, replenished with fish where suitable; <Col N="1661" /> pleasure craft should also be provided so that people could cruise through some of the most beautiful parts of the countryside which is not really recognised. Many canals flow through land which is pleasant but not dramatic in terms of mountain and sea compared with coastal counties.  If a network of canals and waterways could be linked it would mean huge potential for tourism. People could take a pleasant and leisurely journey through other places as well as visiting established tourist areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kavanagh who said that the Office of Public Works should use all their influence to ensure that any public building planned, designed or refurbished will provide access for the disabled.  A former Minister and Deputy Kavanagh made the point that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas do not have a disabled representative and, therefore, the question of access has not arisen.  However, has that been a bar to disabled people seeking to run for office?  If they did run for office would we remove the obstacles in their path and give them the facilities they need?  If we continue to ignore the problem it could constitute discrimination and I should like the Office of Public Works to use all their influence in this regard to ensure that there is access for the disabled in all areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire much of the incredibly important and beautiful work carried out by the Office of Public Works in various locations, including the offices of the Taoiseach.  Of course, a sum of £17.5 million having been spent on them, one would have expected its completion to such a high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret that the fine work carried out by the Office of Public Works in many areas throughout the country is being undermined by a series of insensitive decisions regarding the placing and location of interpretative centres in areas of great scenic beauty.  As I said, everybody appreciates the work of the Office of Public Works in many areas, including tourism.  They did an excellent job on the National Concert Hall, Dublin <Col N="1662" /> Castle and Kilmainham.  The work is an outstanding testament to the expertise of the staff and they deserve our congratulations for their skill and professionalism.</P>
    <P>The question of the siting of interpretative centres is a delicate issue which must be approached sensitively.  The trouble is &mdash; as in relation to Maastricht &mdash; that when someone dangles EC money in front of a Government Department or any other body attached to Government, very often there is mad rush to accept it without thinking projects through properly.  In praising the Office of Public Works I must mention their excellent track record in Glenveagh, County Donegal, and Letterfrack in Connemara. The Democratic Left support extending access to areas of beauty and interest to the maximum possible number of people. We reject the elitist approach which would like to preserve many of these areas for the wealthy.  Very often huge tracts of land in Wicklow or Donegal are the sole and private preserve of extremely wealthy families and only they can enjoy the natural scenic beauty to which the average citizen never has access.</P>
    <P>In making that point I wish to record my appreciation of the degree of access afforded to people in the Luggala area of Wicklow to the beauty of Lough Dan and its environs through privately owned lands.  The construction of interpretative centres for visitors must be done sensitively and with adequate consideration of the wishes of the people who live in the area.  Part of the attraction of our countryside, especially for visitors from abroad, is our low density of population, the sense of isolation and the feeling of being away from it all.</P>
    <P>We must be extremely conscious of the dangers of over-development.  When people visit areas of scenic interest they generally want to see the scenery, not buildings.  I spend almost every other weekend walking in the Wicklow and Dublin mountains and it is that sense of isolation and freedom from the pylons and density of housing which makes me appreciate what we have.  It is very <Col N="1663" /> important to retain this freedom and one of the big fears in the siting of interpretative centres is that they will not be appropriately placed and designed to blend with the environment.  It is also very important that there should not be a knock-on effect as a result of building these centres, whereby landowners in the area would also seek planning permission for other developments such as guest houses, hotels or leisure facilities.  That would destroy what the interpretative centres are supposed to encourage.</P>
    <P>Plans for the two centres &mdash; at Mullaghmore in the Burren and Luggala in the Wicklow mountains &mdash; have generated particular local opposition which we cannot ignore.  The Government and the Office of Public Works should not ignore it because local people are speaking out in the interests of their environment. The opposition in the Wicklow area around Luggala and its immediate environs must be listened to.  It is not the decision to build the centres which has created the controversy, but their location.  The decision of the Government announced earlier this week to go ahead with the interpretative centres in Wicklow is particularly unfortunate and insensitive and seems to ride roughshod over the wishes of large numbers of people in the county.  I know this area particularly well and I must ask the Minister of State what is the reason they have decided to place it in the centre of a wilderness area when it would be more suitable and more appropriate to build it in nearby villages.</P>
    <P>I understand that Wicklow County Council commissioned a study in relation to the proposal to build an interpretative centre at Luggala and that that was carried out by Professor Adrian Phillips of TCD.  Although that study has been completed the council have not had an opportunity to discuss its findings.  Therefore the decision to proceed with the project would seem to indicate a lack of consideration for the views of the local elected representatives and people. Surely the decision on whether to proceed with the project at Luggala should <Col N="1664" /> have been deferred until Wicklow County Council had an opportunity to consider the findings of this study.</P>
    <P>The decision of Dublin Corporation to build a roadway in the wilderness area of Bull Island, gave rise to my concern about the tendency to ride roughshod over the views of members of local councils. However, while I support the concept of attracting people to visit beauty spots including the location in question, if the position is not controlled properly we could end up with a situation similar to that at Bull Island where people along the sand dune have literally to walk across a three or four lane highway if they want to get to the water's edge.  Indeed, the local authority are now trying to restrict access by cars to the beach.  It is obvious that they have not thought the matter through.</P>
    <P>When I visited wilderness areas in the United States, in particular Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park, I was shocked to find, because so many people are attracted to these places of natural beauty, that I was confined to the boardwalks.  Can one imagine board-walks being provided at Luggala, Djouce or War Hill and people being told that they should not leave them?  If this were to happen we would destroy the ambience of these nature parks.</P>
    <P>I should warn the Minister that the people who oppose the decision to build these centres at the locations proposed will continue to protest.  If the Office of Public Works proceed with these projects, despite the opposition, it will lead to bitterness and resentment.  They should also beware that EC funding for such centres, is now under threat.  The European Commissioner, Mr. Bruce Millan, in a letter to Democratic Left MEP, Mr. Des Geraghty, suggested that EC Structural Funding for the proposed Burren interpretative centre has been frozen pending the outcome of an investigation into any possible breaches of European Community environmental legislation.  He went on to say that &ldquo;no Structural Funds will be given to this or <Col N="1665" /> any other project if there is a breach of EC environmental legislation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was going to quote letters received from the European Commission with which the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is familiar.  However, he might take the opportunity to address some of the points I have raised during the course of my short contribution.  I wish that it was longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister of State said that the Office of Public Works are essentially a conservation organisation, and so they were and what a good job they did, too &mdash; I use the past tense, unfortunately.  For many years the Office of Public Works were a well respected body charged with the care of our ancient monuments, public buildings, national parks and wilderness areas but alas that is no longer the case.  What has happened to this august body, a body who have taken unto themselves extraordinary, all sweeping and undemocratic powers?  They no longer care what the people think or what are the attitudes of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The most recent crime against our environment and ecology, which they are mandated to protect, is the construction of so-called interpretative centres dotted around our country in the most unsuitable places and against the wishes of the people, locally, nationally and internationally. I am at a loss for words in relation to their attitude, to their planned destruction of some of the most beautiful parts of our island.  We do not have much in this country but we do have our wonderful and unique wilderness areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do these people think they know best and why will they not listen?  Do they not realise that damage is being done?  Is it the carrot of money from Europe that drives them inexorably and relentlessly to further destruction?  The unyielding and inexplicable attitude of these most frightening of powerful bureaucrats who seem to be unanswerable to anybody and out of control terrifies not just me but a large number of people who care for more than money, be it from Europe or from the increased numbers of tourists they hope to cajole in to visiting our beautiful, precious places.  Do they not realise that these acts are going to lead to the destruction of the beauty and the irreplaceable treasure they have been mandated to protect? Yet, we are now discussing allocating them even more of the country's money to assist them in this destruction.</P>
      <P>Luggala which is one of the few remaining wilderness areas will be destroyed and for what?  Mullaghmore &mdash; unique, wonderful and mysterious &mdash; will also be destroyed.  Let us destroy what has been created over several millenia. Do the Office of Public Works think that the people of Ireland, of Europe and further afield appreciate or even approve of what is being done?  Do they not realise that the places which appear in books, films and in literature throughout the world are famous and treasured for what they are and not for what they are trying to make of them?  Are these unaccountable commissioners for the so-called Office of Public Works so deaf or is it that they will not hear?  I call for their immediate resignation and replacement by people who care and not by those who think that they are the State's property developers destroying our land with our money and the money of other Europeans who also treasure these wonders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was highly amused at the Minister of State's statement that the Burren proposal <Col N="1667" /> has aroused organised opposition. Of course it has.  Large numbers of people are horrified by the proposal and when this happens people tend to come together and work together.  May I ask him if he thinks it should be disorganised opposition?  He is possibly thinking of the antics of some of the members of his own political party over recent issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Office of Public Works appreciate that.  I would like to deal with the proposal in relation to Luggala as it appears that this project is likely to proceed shortly.  Let us examine the word &ldquo;interpretative&rdquo;.  I could ask &ldquo;interpreting what&rdquo;?  The ambience of a wilderness area is precisely that &mdash; it is wild and untamed by man.  It is also desolate. Therefore, by definition, it attracts a small number of people at any one time. How can one interpret the feeling one has when standing on an outcrop of rock overlooking Lough Tay and Lough Dan in solitude apart from a few other like-minded hill walkers and some grouse and sky larks?  Hundreds, if not thousands, of day trippers will now be decanted into this area with all the consequent accoutrements such as ice cream vans and the other alleged advantages of civilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite apparent to me that the people who call the shots in the Office of Public Works have not the foggiest idea of what a wilderness area is about, nor are they willing to learn.  This act of environmental vandalism must be stopped.  In the last resort I appeal to the people of Wicklow to come out <i>en masse</i> and physically prevent this scheme being operated.  What else can they do?  They <Col N="1668" /> have spoken to their elected representatives. Wicklow County Council have spoken out on this and have called on the Minister to defer this scheme, all to no avail.  The Minister seems determined to proceed at all costs and at the expense of local democracy.  What else can I call on them to do but to stand in the way and prevent this scheme from proceeding.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the proposal to add a third 18-hole golf course in the National Park in Killarney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is true.  Part of the National Park in Killarney is being used for this third 18-hole golf course.  It has been orchestrated by certain local interests acting against the long term interests of the people of Killarney and their efforts to nurture and protect the area and its amenities for future generations in Killarney and for those who visit there.  These people are motivated by sheer unadulterated greed.  It should be put on record that this proposal has been opposed by the local angling organisations, such as the Lough Leane Trout Anglers and Killarney Salmon and Trout Anglers' Association.  It should also be pointed out that the maintenance of golf courses generally, the Killarney golf course in particular, causes severe problems due to the amount of fertilisers, nitrates and phosphates which find their way into the spawning streams and the lake itself.</P>

      <P>I have been a Member of this House for ten years during which period I have been honoured to serve the people of my constituency and of the country generally as a public representative.  Never in those ten years here have I heard such an utterly ridiculous, eccentric, extreme contribution on the part of any Deputy as that just made by Deputy Garland. The fact that he has left the House before I have had an opportunity to respond shows that he himself knows full well that what he has put on the record of this House could not stand up anywhere.</P>

      <P>It is disgraceful to call on public servants by name in this House to vacate office, to which they have been duly appointed, having been selected by the highest committee, an independent body who appoint senior civil servants and having an excellent record of public service.  I heard Deputy Garland talk about a wilderness.  I suggest he is walking into the wilderness himself with such an attitude.</P>
      <P>I thank all Members for their contributions to this debate.  The variety of comments illustrates the impact the Office of Public Works and their activities have on the day-to-day life of this country.  I will ensure that all of their comments are passed on to the commissioners or further consideration in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will endeavour to respond in the time available to me to the various comments made.  Deputy John Connor was the first to respond on behalf of the Opposition. He spoke about the Office of Public Works having too many irons in the fire, contending that we were unable to manage them well.  I am surprised at those remarks on the part of a Deputy representing an area where the Office of Public Works have made massive investments <Col N="1670" /> over the years, creating major opportunities for infrastructural and land improvements, waterway management and so on, bringing such tremendous facilites to the area.  Therefore I am all the more surprised the Deputy would make such a bald statement.  He spoke about gross mismanagement of arterial drainage. If he takes into account the topography of the areas with which we deal, the rock depths, soil types, fishing stocks, often the very serious compensatory demands being made, frequently with strong political representation he will realise somewhat the difficulties involved.  I have seen examples of people claiming £500,000 per acre for damaged land, when we have been able to settle for perhaps £19,000 or £20,0000.  In addition, there are demands to employ more staff. It must be remembered that the Office of Public Works are managers of human resources and, in an effort to respond, of course, endeavour to accommodate all demands.  But no matter how good we are, or how broad our attitude, it seems we cannot be right in the eyes of some people.  I was very disappointed at that generalised statement on the part of Deputy Connor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connor referred also to the Price Waterhouse report.  Consideration of the Price Waterhouse review of the Office of Public Works is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The Government decided to have this report made available to them. It was not sought by this House or any <Col N="1671" /> Member thereof; consequently, it is not a public document.  We have no difficulty with that report; as a matter of fact we were very pleased with it.  The review has been raised with the Minister for Finance in the House on a number of occasions. The position is that the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works have agreed a programme for implementing many of the worthwhile, detailed proposals contained in that Price Waterhouse review.  That programme has been approved by the Minister for Finance and is now being implemented. The intention is to achieve more commercial management of the Office of Public Works' operations and improve efficiency, taking into account modern technology and general effectiveness. The Minister is satisfied with the progress being made in implementing that programme. The main elements of that programme are the introduction of revised accounting systems to provide more comprehensive management and cost information; a review of the property management/property services function, the establishment of cost ranges for construction projects, a review of the Central Building Maintenance Workshop, a review of the central procurement and stockholding policy of the Government Supplies Agency; a review of the Central Engineering Workshops, a reorganisation of the heritage service and implementation of the Office of Public Works information technology plan, including accounting systems, resource databases and office information systems, and an overall corporate development plan for the Office of Public Works. Those were the main recommendations which would be made about any commercial company if and when Price Waterhouse were consulted and requested to take an overview, when they must justify their presence and carry out a critical analysis.  The State paid them £94,000 for their advice, with which the Minister for Finance is very pleased, and to which, under his guidance, we are responding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connor also referred to arterial drainage schemes.  As I have <Col N="1672" /> already said, there are two in operation &mdash; the Boyle/Bonet and the Ulster Blackwater. Work commenced in July 1982 on the Boyle scheme which was scheduled to take five years to complete at an estimated cost of £14 million, which has been progressively updated to £21.75 million. However, due primarily to the curtailment of funding for arterial drainage &mdash; I might add that this happened when Deputy Connor's party were in Government &mdash; progress has been substantially less than had been originally expected. At present, after ten years of operation, 70 per cent of the scheduled works have been completed at a cost of £16 million.</P>
    <P>As a drainage scheme comes to completion, as appropriate, engineering staff are redeployed to duties elsewhere. Thus, for instance, in the case of the Boyle/Bonet scheme two engineers were transferred to other duties in 1991.  In the case of the Blackwater scheme one engineer has been assigned part-time to other duties and a senior engineer has not been replaced on that project.  Staff engaged in engineering services have been reduced from 140 to 83 since 1988, a reduction of over 40 per cent.  Staff engaged in administration of drainage at head office have been assigned additional duties, with particular reference to the Shannon navigation scheme.  I can tell the House, as somebody who has served in the Office of Public Works for almost three years, from 1987 to 1989 and again over the past few months, that, <i>pro rata,</i> the number of appointments we make at the non-professional, non-academic level <i>vis-à-vis</i> the more professional people is greater.  We have maintained that balance over the years, always dependent on the needs we must meet.  We must take into account the job to be done, the need for staffing and, of course, the scant resources available.</P>

      <P>What about redundancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The redundancy scheme went ahead and many people took that option.  It added a new dimension, giving bright, young staff an opportunity <Col N="1673" /> to surface within the public service, giving others an opportunity to take an earlier break in life and perhaps find fulfilment outside.  That scheme has worked reasonably well and, as a result, the public service, has benefited.</P>
      <P>The problems associated with the Shannon basin are long-standing with a history of reports and investigations stretching back over the past 150 years.  Those reports all highlight the complexity of the problem, in financial and technical terms, compounded by the multiplicity and variety of interests involved.  The complexity of the problem may well explain the reluctance of successive Governments to attempt a comprehensive solution. The Office of Public Works have a twofold interest in the Shannon.  The commissioners are bound by the Shannon Navigation Act to maintain the Shannon as a public navigable waterway.  The basic levels and minimum levels of water required for navigation are maintained by means of various weirs constructed in the last century.  Sluices which were subsequently provided at those weirs are always operated to discharge water in excess of what is required for navigation so as to give the maximum relief possible from flooding.  Manipulation of the sluices, however, have only very limited effect at times of high flow on the river.</P>
      <P>The basic problem is that the capacity of the channel is not adequate to cater for the volume of water involved.  The solution to that problem is possible only in the context of a drainage scheme for the entire catchment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which would include an enlargement of the channel.  The Act does not provide for the improvement of particular areas in a catchment on a piecemeal basis.  Accumulation of silt at Meelick Weir is very often alleged to be the cause of flooding in the Athlone to Banagher section of the river but this is not the case.  Recently, when repairs to the weir were being carried out, the opportunity was taken to remove weed growth and silt from the upstream side of it and the quantity of silt found was very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB have statutory control over <Col N="1674" /> water levels in the Shannon but their policy is to exercise this control in a manner which is inappropriate as far as this legislation is concerned.  In an effort to promote co-operation and to bring together the various interests &mdash; about 40 in all &mdash; concerned with this vast natural waterway, to facilitate the co-ordination of their views and special interests, the River Shannon Forum was set up by me in March 1989.  The forum has had frequent meetings since its inception, and flooding, pollution and tourist development are the most frequently discussed topics.  It is an agency that contributes very positively to the successful management of the river.  We appreciate the contribution of this forum.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £350,000 under subhead G covers the cost of contract work and grant assistance to various organisations who have an interest in that area. The salaries of the 11 staff involved and all associated costs are provided for in the administration budget of the Office of Public Works.  The allocation is purely for research purposes, laboratories, materials, equipment, etc. and not for staff.</P>
    <P>Coole Park was also mentioned.  I invite any Member of the House, their friends and families or acquaintances to come to see the tremendous work that has been done in Coole Park.  It is an example of the superb management of a wonderful natural resource, of an historic and literary resource, of the maintenance and restoration of old buildings.  The catering problems there at the moment are to do with the water supply and have nothing to do with Office of Public Works development.  At this time of the year there is always a problem with water supplies in this area.  There is also a problem in the autumn when the rain comes and there is a diversion of the water, the cause of which the geological people and others have not been able to identify as yet. Because of these and other technical difficulties we have decided to close the facility temporarily in order to try to solve the problems.  We are confident that any visitors that pass along that roadway will <Col N="1675" /> find this a beautiful new haven of nature in the future.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about taking the National Archaeology Service outside the Office of Public Works.  This was considered by previous Governments and they decided that the Office of Public Works was the only organisation with the capacity and resources to manage archaeology in its totality.  Our track record is such that we have tremendous co-operation with all the third level institutes and all the professionals involved.  We have an opportunity to preserve and conserve and utilise the archaeology of Ireland to demonstrate our heritage.  I am confident that the Office of Public Works will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Joe Jacob and Liam Kavanagh for their contributions and for the warmth of their support for the Wicklow National Park.  Their speeches contrasted with those we heard previously. All the Oireachtas Members in Wicklow were fully supportive of the proposal to proceed.  Deputy Kavanagh referred to planning.  Section 84 of the Planning Act makes it mandatory for the Office of Public Works to have a detailed consultation with the planning authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> any State developments. This means that we must do as any applicant and that is to lodge our application and back it up with site maps, plans, detailed designs etc.  The planning document then comes through after negotiation and we always more than fulfil the demands made by the planning authority. We would prefer to go through the normal planning system but the Members of this House felt it was in the best interests of the country that the State should have this facility.  Anybody comparing any of our projects with similar ones done in the private sector will find that we have always exceeded the demands placed on us and fulfilled the requirements in their totality.  Such is our commitment to adhering to proper planning requirements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to the appeals system.  If the system operated for the State as it does in the private <Col N="1676" /> sector we would be in the appeals mechanism. However, there must be a balance. If every project put up were to be appealed, we might never make progress. One must balance the need of the State to serve the people of Ireland against the legislation that is there.  Our staff are exemplary in ensuring that we fulfil all the planning demands.</P>
    <P>I am confident that we can proceed with the various developments that have been outlined.  I am sure people will appreciate the efforts being made to ensure that the Wicklow National Park at Luggala will be properly managed.  I am confident that this will happen at many more centres in the future so that there will be an opportunity for all of the people of Ireland and the many visitors who come here to enjoy the nature that God has bestowed on all of us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh spoke about recruitment. We have a policy of favouring local employment but that must be balanced against the rights of individuals and against performances at interviews.  We will take into account what the Deputy said and I would hope that as many people as possible from County Wicklow will be employed in whatever facilities are planned by the Office of Public Works operation in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh also spoke about public relations.  He said that we should have proper public relations to sell our message.  Other people also referred to that today.  It is not our policy to oversell what we do.  We put our proposals and allow people to take an objective, critical view of them.  We hope they will be the positive proposals that we put forward. We do not want to be seen to be over-selling our projects.  We would like the people to judge them.  Perhaps the question of public relations is something we could look at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is too modest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the difficulty.  The Office of Public Works have been far too modest for far too long and the tremendous work they have done <Col N="1677" /> has not been recognised by the public <i>en masse</i> as it is by individuals visiting our sites and seeing the great work that has been done.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Kavanagh, spoke about Leinster House.  Leinster House is not air-conditioned. That is very obvious to us all. It has an air-handling unit which heats the Chamber in the winter.  Air conditioning will be tackled in the foreseeable future, as soon as the scarce resources that are needed are allocated for the project.  I would like to see an improvement in that area.  I would not like to see a situation continue where people have to remove their jackets and create holy murder.  It is unbecoming for politicians to be in such an environment.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the situation pertaining to the disabled and that wheelchair access to the House is not ideal.  I am pleased to say that works are being undertaken to improve the situation.  To enhance access for wheelchair users to the visitors' gallery in Dáil Éireann, a new lift was recently installed and a special platform for wheelchairs was provided for the gallery itself.  An external ramp will be provided this summer recess at the visitors' entrance to the building. In regard to Leinster House itself, there is already a ramp at the Kildare Street entrance providing access to the ground floor and from there access may be gained to the first and second floors by means of a lift.  During the summer recess it is proposed to provide a ramp in the corridor leading to the bars which will extend wheelchair access to the office block and to the restaurant and bars.  Other areas of the House are currently being studied with a view to establishing the measures necessary to improve wheelchair access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Kildare House, there is satisfactory wheelchair access from the basement carpark to lifts serving all floors.  Alternatively, a door at the entrance to the carpark at the ground floor level can provide wheelchair access to the ground floor of the building and the lifts.  It is not possible to provide access for wheelchair users at the main entrance to Kildare House due to the <Col N="1678" /> significant difference in levels between the ground floor and the public pavement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jacob referred to developments on private property in the environs of the national park in County Wicklow. I should like to assure him that the Office of Public Works will not be involved in making decisions on such matters.  These are purely matters for the planning authority of Wicklow County Council whom I am sure will continue to make their decisions in a positive and objective manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes referred to the importance of our tourism and fishing industries and their potential.  I concur with the points made by her in this regard.  Even though she is a city Deputy, she has a great knowledge of these matters.  She referred to the sensitivity displayed by the Office of Public Works in dealing with many issues including those concerning our waterways.  I wish to point out that our fish stocks are continually topped-up. We will continue to co-operate with the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries authorities.  We also hope to carry out work in the Ringsend area.  As a result of major investment in the area, the coarse fishing championships will be held there this year.  However, much work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes also referred to the wild and natural beauty of our country, the Burren and other areas.  I believe everyone accepts that conservation is our aim.  We will continue to preserve the unique areas of our country so that everyone can enjoy them in a carefully managed way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said that the Office of Public Works ride roughshod over the people.  He compared the Office of Public Works to Dublin Corporation.  I am shocked that a democratically elected public representative would make such a statement.  The Office of Public Works have never tried to ride roughshod over anyone.  Our attitude is one of consultation, dialogue and consensus and that will continue to be our policy.  It is unbecoming of a democratically elected public representative to make such a misleading <Col N="1679" /> statement about a State organisation or Department.  He spoke about the possibility of locating interpretative centres in various towns.  That is the argument used by the people who are against the building of these centres.  People cannot interpret a national park from a town and they cannot interpret a town from a national park.  If one wants to properly interpret an area and understand how precious it is one must do so in its natural state with proper access and back-up facilities.  People can visit those areas in an organised way and enjoy the environment if they are managed properly.  That is and will continue to be our policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne suggested that our EC funding is under threat.  This is not true. We have had many meetings with the European Commission and we fulfil all the requirements of the various EC directives and conventions under which we operate.  There is no difficulty with Community funding.  We do not rush in looking for Community funding but, as a State organisation, we have a duty to respond to the demands of Government.  When negotiations for Structural Funds, Cohesion Funds or heritage funds take place the Office of Public Works are obliged to put forward a programme. This programme is then put forward to the Commission by the Government and the Department of Finance, our chief negotiators, as part of an overall proposal. Under the principle of subsidiarity, the Government, and State agencies involved, allocate funds to the various projects.  Once we carry out those projects under the various EC directives there is no difficulty with any directorate in Brussels or the Commission.  There has never been any threat to the funding available to Ireland, and I am confident that this will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the points made by Deputy Garland.  He has left the Chamber but, perhaps, he is listening to the debate on the monitor in his office.  I was absolutely shocked by some of the comments made by Deputy Garland.  He went from the sublime to the ridiculous. <Col N="1680" /> He seems to forget that he is living in a democracy.  He refuses to accept the will of the Irish people, even though 70 per cent of them recently voted to be part of a greater integrated Europe.  I regard his statements as extreme and eccentric. Having regard to the statements he made, I wonder if he is living on this planet, not to mention on this island.  The statements he made today were the most debasing statements ever made by any Member in this House and were unbecoming of a public representative.  It is tragic that a public representative would use the national Parliament to heap blame and baseless abuse on outstanding public servants.  I do not accept what he said.  The vast majority of Members have never used this House in that way.  I am confident Members will maintain the traditions of this House and continue to respect the quality and dedication of our public servants who respond to the demands of Government in carrying out public policy on behalf of all of the people of the country.  If Deputy Garland had any respect for this House and public servants he would apologise to the people he named here.  This is a sad day and I have never before seen a public representative stoop to such a low standard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the services given by the Office of Public Works.  These services are so wide and diverse that I would love to have a full day's debate on them in a very reasoned and calm atmosphere.  This would enable me to allay any fears people may have and give as much information as possible to Members so that they would understand that the Office of Public Works in carrying out their duties, are cognisant that they are the main conservation organisation in the country.  The Office of Public Works carry out work on behalf of many State Departments and agencies and implement Government policy on behalf of all the people.  We will continue to pursue a policy of being fair to everyone and carrying out our work to the highest standards.  I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate. I look forward to working with them in <Col N="1681" /> the interests of the country for as long as I am privileged to be in this office.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if we have taken licence beyond which might have been ordered.  On the one hand the order says that the Minister has ten minutes to reply but on the other it says that the Minister shall be called not later than a certain time.  In so far as that time has not been reached my interpretation was that we would give the Minister in his reply an opportunity to display his undoubted eloquence.  There are some minutes remaining during which Deputy Connor is entitled to put a specific question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Minister be in a position to publish a register of the national monuments in the care of the State, as provided for under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987? When will he be in a position to pursue a policy of providing public access to all national monuments in the care of the State?  May I ask him what was meant by the circular sent to the managers of arterial drainage schemes asking them for costings of the winding-up of the schemes?  The Boyle-Bonet scheme is <Col N="1682" /> almost 69 per cent completed and why should such a circular be sent to the manager of this scheme and what does it mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the circular in regard to arterial drainage schemes.  When an arterial drainage scheme is published, a design is put forward and various analyses are carried out.  When it is decided to proceed, costings are carried out and a certain amount of money is allocated.  A timescale is also set for the scheme.  Once the timescale is concluded it is mandatory on the Department of Finance, who have overall responsibility under the Constitution for the finances of the State, to query the excess expenditure, the reasons for it and when it is hoped to complete the scheme. Before the budget is announced by the Minister for Finance each year the question of whether the scheme has been over-run or can be allowed to continue must be teased out in the Estimates.  That must happen each year once the period allocated has expired.</P>
      <P>As regards sites and monuments, as the Deputy knows we have published a sites and monuments record for 30 of the 32 counties and the records for the other two counties will shortly be concluded. We are very pleased with the work in this area and we will follow it up with further publications, illustrations and information. The purpose of the sites and monuments record is to ensure that the statutory authorities involved in various developments, whether they be local authorities, the Department of Agriculture and Food or any other State authority grant-aiding work or carrying out work on behalf of the State, would have all the information at their disposal so that when decisions are being made they can refer to these records and ensure that the register makes the information available and that the monuments will be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards access to monuments, if we were to provide access to all the monuments in the country a motion would have to be passed in this House to freeze all the moneys available each year for all <Col N="1683" /> the Departments and, perhaps, after ten years we would be able to provide access to all monuments.  There are so many monuments in the country that it would not be possible to give an estimate of the amount of time and money that would be required, and the legalities involved, to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>No money would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we would have to provide money.  If we provide access we must ensure that there are no encumbrances to access.  We must be absolutely certain that we do not infringe on people's property.  We have put preservation orders on monuments even though we may not have access to them. We have been asked by local authorities, public representatives and various heritage and historical societies to put preservation orders on certain monuments. It would not be possible to provide access to all monuments without providing massive amounts of money for legal costs, access costs and particularly management costs.</P>
      <P>We operate a priority programme every year for the monuments that become popular, some of which will attract 5,000 visitors.  As these monuments become popular and people visit them on educational tours, historical trips or whatever &mdash; international people visit monuments for various reasons, because they have a particular interest in them or because they relate to the history of a particular part of the country &mdash; we respond to the increased number of visitors.  We are committed to providing access to the monuments most often visited. There are 36 centres in the country which catered for 1.5 million visitors last year and we will continue to proceed down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the report on the inland waterways which will be presented to the Government for consideration be published or will it be only for the information of the Government?  It is a report that would be of tremendous interest to many people.  With regard to the archaeological survey of Ireland &mdash; I know Deputy Connor joins with me in welcoming the finalising of the records on the remaining two counties &mdash; the Minister mentioned that the publications take the format of hardback books, and he is right in saying that they will be of tremendous value to Coillte and to the farm development services centre, but I would like to know whether these books will be available in hardback form to people interested in archaeology and to tourists? If so, they would add to the State's coffers.</P>
      <P>On the question of sites and monuments, it has been brought to my attention that some of the holy wells of Ireland, particularly St. Brigid's in Louth, are in great disrepair, filled with silt and dirt.  I would like to know whether these wells come under sites and monuments, or does this matter need to be brought to the attention of the Office of Public Works?  I know that many tourists are interested in touring holy wells. Finally, does the question of tree preservation come under the aegis of the Office of Public Works or is it a matter for local planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Barnes' question about the inland waterways, we have put together a report for analysis by the Government and if they are satisfied with it, it will be published. It will then be available to the public who can make a critical analysis of it and, hopefully, assist us in ensuring that we achieve its objectives.  On the archaeological survey, in each county where the book is published copies will be made available to the local libraries as well as to all State and semi-State agencies and local authorities.  They will also be available <Col N="1685" /> in the Government Publications Office for any individual who wishes to buy them.</P>
      <P>We have no responsibility for holy wells unless they have special architectural or archaeological features.  If the Deputy or any Member of the House wishes to bring a matter to our attention we will certainly investigate it and see if we have a role to play in that regard. Tree preservation is a matter for each local authority.  The local authority would consult with Coillte Teoranta who would make a recommendation on the matter. Unless trees are on our property we would have no role in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>To go back to the point I was making about access to monuments and the Minister's response to it, he made great play of the difficulties involved.  I am fortunate enough to have on my property an early Christian, 7th century, high cross.  Three years ago I signed a document providing access to the public to this monument which is visited by about 100 visitors each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The exercise providing access was very simple and cheap and I did not seek compensation &mdash; the law should ensure that people are not compensated in such cases because these monuments belong to the people.  From my experience of this matter the process, which seems to be a very simple exercise, should be speeded up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his response the Minister seemed to imply that because I criticised certain aspects of the operations of the Office of Public Works I was criticising them in every way, but that is not the case.  The Office of Public Works have had a marvellous record during their 108 years in operation and they continue to do magnificent work.  I was speaking about the deployment of labour on a drainage scheme, but the Minister has not satisfactorily dealt with that matter.  A number of persons are permanently employed on these schemes but the <Col N="1686" /> people who were made redundant were non-permanent.  In the case of the Boyle-Bonet scheme about 150 people were made redundant.  The permanent ancillary staff who remain there can tell us that they could use three times the number of skilled people working on the scheme. My criticism was that the number of people required should have been employed until the scheme was completed. That matter, which was dealt with in a rather facile way by the Minister, is worthy of greater consideration.  He tried to imply that I was making belittling remarks about the Office of Public Works and the way they manage their human resources.  It is not good management of human resources to make redundant people with skills to carry out structural works.  In the scheme in question only 48 per cent of the structural work has been completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the civic attitude adopted by Deputy Connor in providing access to the monument on his property.  That does not happen very often.  In most cases if we seek access people request astronomical fees.  Obviously the Deputy came forward and made the monument available to us and we deeply appreciate that. There are a number of people in the country who have acted in the same way. However in some cases where we have tried to gain access to monuments, high amounts have been sought.  If any Member of the House wishes to forward a proposal on behalf of a person who wishes to provide access, we will be only too delighted to sign the necessary agreement.</P>
      <P>I would not like to be facile in my attitude or my response to anybody.  I was quoting the Deputy in his remarks that we have too many irons in the fire and we do not manage them well.  That is exactly what he said.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to regionalise any aspect of the public service, apart from the decentralisation programme. On the matter of drainage, we have experienced, expert staff who are permanent staff of the State.  Nobody can dismiss these people but they can leave <Col N="1688" /> voluntarily if they so wish.  We recruit people on a temporary basis for schemes which are set up.  These people know they are recruited for the duration of the scheme or as long as they are needed and they sign an agreement to that effect.  We would like to recruit a group of people for one year to finish each scheme but the finances do not allow us to do that. We have to live within our resources and consequently the work takes much longer and that does not make anyone happy.</P>
      <P>Vote put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 June 1992.</P>
