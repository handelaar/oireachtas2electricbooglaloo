      <Quest>if he will give details of the persons he or his predecessor appointed to boards of State agencies since the terms of the review of the Joint Programme for Government was agreed on 18 October 1991; if he will outline, in respect of each such appointee, whether he/she has made and signed a declaration in respect of any interests relevant to their membership of such bodies; and, if so, where such declaration may be inspected by members of the public.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to circulate <Col N="1770" /> a list of the persons appointed in the period to the following: Temple Bar Renewal Ltd; Temple Bar Properties Ltd.; Law Reform Commission; Board of Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery; Board of Visitors of the National Museum of Ireland and Botanic Gardens; National Archives Advisory Council; IMMA; Irish Manuscripts Commission; and National Concert Hall Board.</P>
      <P>Copies of the guidelines for State bodies prepared by the Department of Finance and approved by the Government were forwarded recently to all the bodies under the aegis of my Department. Some agencies previously had a system for registration of interests exceeding the provisions of the Companies Acts which require disclosure of directors' interests relating to the company of which they are a director. All will now conform to the new guidelines issued on 11 March 1992 which require a much wider disclosure of interests by directors of State companies, going far beyond matters relating to the company of which they are a director.</P>
      <P>As yet, no compelling case has been made for making public this additional information which is essentially given in confidence so that the affairs of the body in question can be properly conducted without conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>The guidelines make clear that State companies which are plcs. are subject to the Companies Act in the normal way and also confirm that State companies established by statute only should voluntarily conform to the requirements of the Companies Act until their legislation can be changed.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if, in connection with the forthcoming Maastricht referendum, he will give details of the funds, if any, the Government are going to make available to bona fide groups opposed to such a treaty.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be completely unacceptable for the Government, who are responsible to the Dáil, to seek approval to allocate taxpayers' money for the advocacy of a position which the Government consider could be disastrous for the country and against which all the main parties in the Dáil voted so decisively no later than last week.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the recent debate that the referendum campaigns of the Government and of these parties will be directed to securing a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June. This will, in their view, be in the best interests of Irish industry, agriculture, investment, employment and domestic and international interests generally; and will emphasise our overwhelming concern with strengthening the position of the Community &mdash; whose founding members were themselves once divided by bloody conflicts &mdash; as a core of stability in Europe and a force for peace in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is, indeed, one of the countries in the Community which could least <Col N="1774" /> afford a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote. The Government have a duty and an obligation to promote their policy, so overwhelmingly endorsed by both the Dáil and Seanad, on such a fundamental question.</P>
    <P>The use of public funds on this occasion is in line with the practice followed in previous EC referenda in 1972 and 1987, and with the use of such funds to publicise and promote other Government policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed with the Taoiseach's response. He is clearly endeavouring to muzzle the people on the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side.</P>

      <P>A question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's reply and the fact that the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side will clearly be unable to mount the same kind of campaign as the Government, would he agree that the only fair way for the Government to deal with the matter now, as they are not making any funds available to the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side, is to provide that when they publish advertisements or posters they will be informational only and will contain the other side of the argument as well? Is the Taoiseach saying that he will be advocating a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the publicity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I will be advocating a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the publicity. The two most recent opinion polls reveal very interesting statistics. The Landsdowne Market Research poll indicates that 61 per cent of Green supporters are in favour and only 13 per cent against. In the more recent IMS opinion poll 52 per cent of the Green Party supporters were in favour and only 13 per cent were against the Treaty. I wonder what Deputy Garland is really concerned about or is he saying, in effect, that he is out of touch with what the party's grass root supporters are saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What upper limit will the Government place on the expenditure for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote? Will it be equivalent to or greater than the amount of money spent on the campaign for the ratification of the Single European Act? In view of the Taoiseach's statement, which I accept fully, that it is the Government's responsibility to campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, does he not accept that in the public's interest of making a value judgement on the question before them they should have an adequate opportunity to hear the viewpoint of the other side? Will he not reconsider making funding available to those of us who seek to present the other viewpoint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to reconsider the position. It is up to all of us, as politicians to ensure the public get a balanced view so that they can make their own decision. The amount of money appropriate to running a successful campaign will be provided and I will have no hesitation in making that figure available to the House after the campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 18, 43, 59 and 62 together. At the invitation of the national executive of the association I attended the first PDFORRA annual delegate conference in Galway on 13 May 1992 where I addressed the delegates from the four commands, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>As regards pay and other conditions of service the position is that these matters were the subject of an independent review by the Gleeson Commission. The commission received submissions from teams representative of privates, non-commissioned officers and officers and undertook a thorough examination of all the issues involved. Their findings represented an objective assessment by an independent body. The implementation of the financial aspects of the commission's recommendations &mdash; pay, allowances and so on &mdash; was approved immediately by the Government following the issue of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition members of the Permanent Defence Forces now, for the first time, have representative structures, through which to represent their members in regard to conditions of service. A commitment has also been given to establish a scheme of conciliation and arbitration. <Col N="1780" /> The scheme will provide that where there is no agreement at the conciliation level and the matter is arbitrable it may be referred to an independent and unbiased arbitrator.</P>
    <P>It is open to the associations to pursue the various matters which come within their scope of representation by formulating proposals and presenting them through the newly-established machinery. Any such proposals will be carefully and fully examined by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that Army personnel engaged on Border duties carry out the same duties, often under bad conditions, as members of the Garda Síochána? Is it not the Minister's duty to compensate the security forces for their poor working conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was addressed by the Gleeson Commission who specifically referred to the fact that the provision of aid to the civil power necessarily involved contact on a regular basis between Defence Forces personnel and members of the Garda Síochána. However, the commission came to the conclusion that the great majority of military personnel were engaged in duties that were quite dissimilar to the work of the Garda Síochána and that the work of the military and the Garda Síochána was not broadly comparable in most respects. The commission made this point clearly.</P>
      <P>As I stated the conciliation and arbitration machinery is open to members of the Defence Forces and they should use this mechanism to pursue any claims they might have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 54 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On becoming aware of the problem encountered recently by the widow of a deceased soldier in relation to mortgage protection insurance, the Department took immediate steps to remove any possible ambiguity about the situation by arranging and paying for additional mortgage insurance for military personnel currently serving in Lebanon and whose local authority mortgages are covered <Col N="1782" /> by the group policy in question. The same arrangement will, if necessary, be made for personnel going overseas on UN service in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is the wish of everybody that a similar occurence will never again take place but we have to be prepared for them. Is the Minister saying that if something similar happens in Ireland the same circumstances will prevail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it the question arose because the insurance company refused to pay on the mortgage protection policy as the soldier in question was serving with UNIFIL who declared he was in a war zone. The Department do not accept that. The Department have made it clear that our soldiers abroad are in a peace-keeping role. The decision of the insurance company was taken on the basis that he was in a war zone. It would not arise here unless we were in a war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether Army personnel serving here in dangerous positions such as Border security or, indeed, in the transfer of prisoners or cash escort duty would be covered under the same conditions as outlined? Would he agree that these Army personnel &mdash; God forbid if any of them were killed in the course of their duty &mdash; have the same problem and if killed in the course of duty would the Department fund the extra premiums needed for such cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position. It was the insurance company that decided our peace-keeping forces abroad were in a war. It is my understanding here, unless in the last few minutes somebody has declared war, that our soldiers are covered in the course of their duty because we are not in a war here. The insurance company that covers the mortgage insurance policy referred to here, decided that the soldiers were in a war zone and because of that were subject to <Col N="1783" /> the hazards of war. I am not aware, and I do not think the Department or the local authorities are aware, that any other insurance company adopted this attitude and, more particularly, none of the insurance companies indicated that they would regard a soldier on active duty here &mdash; transferring prisoners or engaged in cash escort duties and so on &mdash; as being in a war so I presume the insurance policy will cover them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given my answer to the question. I am not aware of any of the other insurance companies who offer mortgage protection insurance for any of our Army personnel having adopted the same attitude as this company. As I replied on 13 April, if the need arises, or if some of the insurance companies are changing their attitude, it is essentially a matter between the local authority and the Department. The Department <Col N="1784" /> moved quickly when this matter became clear and arranged for the extra premium to be paid and the same would apply in any future cases.</P>

The escorts were provided by direction of the Government at that time in the interests of national security. They were not requested by the banks. I am sure if any other large organisation wishing to move large sums of money made such a request it would be considered.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement indicated that he proposed to seek a contribution of £2 million from the banks towards the cost of the provision of these cash escorts. It is proposed that the contribution would be divided between the Departments of Defence and Justice. I understand negotiations are continuing on that matter. I am not aware that legislation will be needed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 41 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The roles, functions and activities of the Defence Forces are already well established. For many years past, their main preoccupation have been: aid to the civil power; fishery protection; search and rescue; and UN peace-keeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House has already been informed a major study has been under way in relation to the establishment, number and deployment of the Defence <Col N="1786" /> Forces. In addition, a working group is at present examining the administrative structures and systems in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty does not contain any provision for a common defence policy nor does it contain any mutual defence commitments. It does provide for an Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 which may consider the framing of a common defence policy. Any new agreement in this area must be unanimous and would have to be ratified by a referendum. The question of publishing a White Paper on Defence Policy in that context and its timing can be considered by the Government at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>In regard to accommodation and facilities my Department have to manage within the financial constraints imposed by the many and competing demands on the Exchequer. I would point out in the period from 1987 to the end of 1992 over £33 million will have been spent on new accommodation and refurbishment to existing buildings.</P>
    <P>As regards remuneration, the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission have been implemented and increases due under the modified terms of the Agreement on Pay and Conditions associated with <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will apply to the Defence Forces. In addition, representative associations for members of the Permanent Defence Force have been established and a scheme of conciliation and arbitration is being formulated. Remuneration and conditions of service will come within the ambit of the proposed scheme.</P>

Bhí sé beartaithe ag an Tánaiste bualadh leis an Déardaoin seo caite ach bhí sé socraithe roimh ré go bpléifí Meastachán na Roinne Cosanta sa Teach an lá sin. Anois tá sé i gceist go mbeidh an cruinniú le cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge an Déardaoin seo chugainn. Bhí an Teachta Deasy i láthair sa Teach an oíche sin, más buan mo chuimhne, agus thug mé, mar chonacthas domsa é, freagra cuimsitheach ar an cheist seo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire Stáit an aontaíonn sé go ndéanann ráitis den chineál a rinne cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge an-dochar do na hiarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. An bhfuil an tAire Stát in ann a chur in iúl don Teach seo go bhfuil an Rialtas iontach míshásta leis an ráiteas a rinne an cathaoirleach, agus an bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Rialtas Proinsias Mac an Aonghusa a scaoileadh as a phost mar chathaoirleach ar Bhord na Gaeilge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Mar fhreagra ar cheist an Teachta Spring ba mhaith liom a rá <Col N="1789" /> arís an méid a dúirt mé ar an athló, is é sin, gur trua, tar éis do Rialtas na Breataine an deontas a bhain siad de choiste Ghlór na nGael in iarthar Bhéal Feirste agus ansin é a cheadú arís dóibh, go ndearna cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge an ráiteas sin mar go bhféadfaí dochar mór a dhéanamh do chás na Gaeilge sa Tuaisceart, go háirithe i súile na nAontachtaithe. Ach chuir mé i dtuiscint freisin gur scríobh Proinsias Mac Aonghusa an t-alt sin mar iriseoir neamhspleách agus nach bhfuil aon cheangal idir an méid a bhí le rá aige sa chomhthéacs sin agus a dhualgais mar chathaoirleach ar Bhord na Gaeilge. Glacaim leis, ar ndóigh, go mbíonn sé deacair ag daoine in amanna an t-idirdhealú seo a dhéanamh idir imeachtaí duine i gcomhlíonadh a ndualgas poiblí agus rudaí a dhéanann siad ina ngairmeacha proifisiúnta.</P>
      <P>Chomh maith leis sin rinne mé trácht ar an méid a bhí le rá ag an Taoiseach nuair a labhair sé ag Ard-Fheis Fhianna Fáil i mbliana nuair a dúirt sé: &ldquo;The democratic leaders of constitutional nationalism know that we fully support their untiring search for dialogue and for political structures based, not on domination, but on an honourable accommodation between both traditions on this island&rdquo;.</P>

An aontaíonn an tAire Stáit liom go ndearna an ráiteas seo ó chathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge andochar don Ghaeilge? Freisin, cad é an difríocht idir an cás seo agus cás an Bhreithimh Ó hAnluain nuair a d'iarr an Rialtas ar an bhreitheamh seo éirí as a phost mar chathaoirleach ar an Law Reform Commission; agus an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag Aire na Gaeltachta, nuair a chasann sé féin agus cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge ar a chéile, a rá go gcaithfidh sé éirí as an bpost sin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is barúil phearsanta de chuid an Teachta Gilmore é sin maidir le raiméis agus na rudaí eile a dúirt sé. Tá <Col N="1790" /> muinín agam féin agus a lán eile sa Teach seo as an Tánaiste agus Aire na Gaeltachta agus is cinnte go mbeidh sé in ann an gnó seo a láimhseáil go sásúil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>D'admhaigh an tAire Stáit don Dáil nuair a pléadh an cheist seo cúpla seachtain ó shin nach raibh aon fhreagracht ar an Rialtas as rudaí a scríobhann cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge ina ghairm phroifisiúnta, ach, ag an am céanna, os rud é go bhfuil sé ainmnithe don phost seo ar Bhord na Gaeilge ag an Rialtas, agus go bhfuil sé seo ag dul go díreach in aghaidh pholasaí an Rialtais, ba cheart duit iarraidh air éirí as a phost mar chathaoirleach ar Bhord na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>There is a clear conflict between the chairman of a State-appointed body and Government policy on a matter of life and death. Does the Minister of State not agree therefore that in a case like this, as Deputy Gilmore has said, the man should be asked, without further ado, to resign from office, as happened in the case of Judge Rory O'Hanlon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím gurb é seo ceann de na deacrachtaí agus mar a dúirt mé ar 8 Aibreán, ba chóir do dhuine a bhfuil íomhá phoiblí aige nó aice, mar shampla, mar chathaoirleach bhord Stáit, bheith iontach cúramach faoi aon ní a dhéanann sé ina ghairm féin lena chinntiú nach dtarraingeoidh sé a phost poiblí isteach i gcúrsaí conspóideacha.

An bhfuil an tAire chun iarraidh ar chathaoirleach <Col N="1791" /> Bhord na Gaeilge éirí as a phost nó nach bhfuil? Tá an cheist chomh simplí sin.</P>

      <P>Mar áis don tseirbhís farantóireachta san idirlinn, chuir mo Roinnse suim £115,000 ar fáil chun a chumasú don dá chomharchumann áitiúla &mdash; Comharchumann Inis Meáin agus Comhar Caomhán, Inis Oírr &mdash; muiroibreacha a dhéanamh ar an dá oileán chun na saoráidí a bhí ar fáil a fheabhsú. Tuigim gur cuidiú mhór iad na hoibreacha sin agus go mbeifear in ann feidhm leanúnach a bhaint astu mar áiseanna do na hoileánaigh, fiú tar éis do mhuiroibreacha a bheith déanta amach anseo chun freastal ar an tseirbhís farantóireachta.</P>

Tá £250,000 curtha ar fáil do Roinn na Mara chun an staidéar atá riachtanach a dhéanamh. Sin pointe a haon. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil fadhbanna ag na hoileánaigh ó thaobh sheirbhís fharantóireachta de agus san idirlinn chuireamar £115,000 ar fáil chun a chumasú don dá chomharchumann áitiúla ar Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr, muiroibreacha a dhéanamh ar an dá oileán chun na <Col N="1794" /> saoráidí atá ar fáil a fheabhsú. Beidh sé sin ag feidhmiú go leanúnach ina dhiaidh seo. Tá cuid mhaith den airgead seo íoctha cheana. Tá £70,000 íoctha le hInis Meáin agus, maidir le hInis Oírr, tá deontais de £45,000 ceadaithe a bhfuil £40,000 íoctha cheana. Is iad muintir na n-oileán atá ag déanamh na hoibre agus ba mhaith liom iad a mholadh.</P>

      <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana, <Col N="1795" /> cuirfidh mé an t-eolas thart leis an tuairisc oifigiúil. Maidir leis an cheist a chuir an Teachta de Rossa, tá deontas in aghaidh an eagráin de £3,000 sa tseachtain ar fáil ag &ldquo;Anois&rdquo;. Maidir le díolaíocht an nuachtáin, tá meándíolachán de idir 4,000 agus 4,500 in aghaidh na seachtaine aige, de réir na bhfigiúirí a cuireadh chugam don bhliain 1991. Chomh maith leis sin tá deontas speisialta de £25,000 anuas air sin á chur ar fáil do &ldquo;Anois&rdquo; i mbliana. Beidh uas-mhéid de £5,000 iníoctha má bhaintear amach spriocanna áirithe díolacháin. Caithfidh mé féin a rá nach bhfuil mé sásta le díolachán &ldquo;Anois&rdquo; agus dúirt mé sin roimhe seo. Bhí cruinniú ag Aire na Gaeltachta le lucht stiúrtha &ldquo;Anois&rdquo; faoin cheist chéanna. Caithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh murar féidir an meándíolachán a ardú go luath.</P>

An gceapann an tAire Stáit gurb é polasaí eagarthóireachta an nuachtáin, idir ailt agus eile, atá ina chúis leis an díolachán bheith chomh híseal sin. Is dócha go bhfuil thart ar leathmhilliún duine ar a laghad sa tír seo gur féidir leo páipéar Gaeilge a léamh ach ní dóigh liom go bhfuil &ldquo;Anois&rdquo; ag déanamh aon rud chun na daoine seo a mhealladh.</P>

Is ceist é seo do lucht stiúrtha &ldquo;Anois&rdquo;. Caithfidh siad, mar sin, cúrsaí a chur in ord agus tréaniarracht a dhéanamh chun an díolachán a ardú.

    <P>17. D'fhiafraigh Mr. Rabbitte d'Aire na Gaeltachta cén uimhir postanna a cuireadh ar fáil sa nGaeltacht anuraidh trí iarrachtaí Údarás na Gaeltachta; cén uimhir postanna a cailleadh anuraidh; agus an ndéanfaidh sé ráiteas faoi.</P>

      <P>Tuigtear ó Údarás na Gaeltachta gur cruthaíodh 897 bpost nua lánaimseartha i rith 1991 i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cúnamh ón eagraíocht i gcomparáid leis an sprioc de 600 post nua a bhí ann don bhliain sin. Ba bhliain dheacair í 1991 agus is cúis dhíoma í gur cailleadh 887 bpost sa bhliain sin &mdash; rud a d'fhág glanmhéadú de 10 bpost a bhí ann ag deireadh 1991 i gcomparáid le deireadh 1990. Bhí an cúlú eacnamaíochta domhanda agus na deacrachtaí móra trádála a d'eascair as sin do chomhlachtaí Gaeltachta ina gcuid margaí baile agus thar lear ina chúis mhór do na torthaí fostaíochta mífhábhracha sin.</P>
      <P>Leanfar go dícheallach leis na hiarrachtaí a bhíonn ar siúl ag an Údarás d'fhonn an ghlanfhostaíocht i dtionscail faoina scáth a chaomhnú agus a mhéadú ar an mbealach is éifeachtaí is féidir agus ar an gcostas is lú is féidir don Stát.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní féidir liom figiúr dearfa a thabhairt don Teachta, ach sa <Col N="1797" /> bhliain 1991 bhí deontas caipitil de £11,600 ar fáil. Maidir le hairleacan, bhí £6.45 mhilliún ar fáil acu, ach ní féidir comparáid a dhéanamh idir na figiúirí sin. Tá cuid den airgead sin á chaitheamh ar fhoirgnimh a thógáil le haghaidh 1992 agus 1993 agus beidh na jabanna sin ann sna blianta sin nó ina dhiaidh sin. Ní féidir linn a bheith bródúil os rud é nár cruthaíodh ach glanmhéadú de dheich bpost. Caithfear a chur san áireamh, áfach, gur cruthaíodh 897 bpost agus ní ceart a rá gur caitheadh an oiread sin airgid ar deich bpost. Ba cheart freisin a chur san áireamh gur 600 post an sprioc a bhí againn.

Tá an cúlú eacamaíochta ag cur isteach ar gach tír, ach, mar sin féin, cruthaíodh 897 bpost sa Ghaeltacht anuraidh.

      <P>On 6 May 1992 I met representatives from each of the two associations &mdash; RACO, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and PDFORRA, the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association &mdash; and a wide range of issues was discussed at the meetings. These associations have been established pursuant to section 2 (1) of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, following elections which were conducted within the Permanent Defence Force. They are the appropriate associations to represent the views of their members in relation to matters coming within the scope of representation of the associations formally established under that Act.</P>
      <P>The representative arrangements drawn up in agreement with the associations provide for representative activity at the following levels: barracks level; command level; Defence Forces Headquarters level and national level.</P>
      <P>A range of matters has been agreed as appropriate for discussion at each of those levels. Accordingly, matters which the associations may wish to pursue will, in the first instance, be raised at the appropriate level. I will be available to meet members of the national executives should such a meeting be necessary at any stage.</P>

      <P>As regards UNPROFOR, the Secretary-General of the United Nations requested the Irish Government to provide four military officers to serve as observers with the force. Four Irish officers took up duty with UNPROFOR on 28 March 1992.</P>
      <P>The UN requirement from Ireland in relation to UNTAC is for a total of 17 personnel &mdash; 14 officers and one non-commissioned officer in addition to the two officers already serving with the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC). The 15 additional personnel are due to depart for Cambodia at the end of the month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="1802" /> Nos. 23, 29, 44, 48, 50, 56, 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>Since publication of the Gleeson Commission's report there has been continuous attention by my Department to the recommendations therein in order to ensure their implementation.</P>
      <P>The Gleeson report contained a total of 170 separate recommendations covering all aspects of the Permanent Defence Force remuneration and conditions of service as well as organisation and management.</P>
      <P>On the basis of a simple count, which is not an adequate reflection of progress, about 75 per cent of the recommendations may be regarded as disposed of or almost so. Substantial action has been taken in regard to the balance which relate to the complex areas of organisation, management and so on.</P>
      <P>The increases in pay for all ranks which were recommended for introduction have been fully implemented and pay has been further enhanced by application of the increase provided for under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>Increases in security related allowances &mdash; for security duty and prison duty &mdash; and in overseas allowances have likewise been fully implemented and these allowances have also attracted subsequent increases. Border duty allowance was increased by 77 per cent arising out of an interdepartmental committee report before the Gleeson Commission issued their findings.</P>
      <P>New allowances for bomb-disposal teams, for instructors, for officers on substitution duty and for personnel maintaining essential public service are fully in place as recommended and administrative arrangements to provide for a number of further new allowances are nearing completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been ongoing discussions between my Department and the representative associations in regard to the implementation of recommendations on non-pay aspects of conditions of service. Meals provided for soldiers now have a greater variety of food items and better nutritional value and more personnel <Col N="1803" /> now receive free meals and accommodation. Uncertified sick leave facilities for non-commissioned personnel are now in operation. The first phase of a new comprehensive welfare and counselling service for the Defence Force, involving the employment of civilian specialists in social work, has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The Commission's recommendations in regard to military personnel on overseas service have been implemented. For those in Lebanon this has meant increased allowances and free telephone calls home to relatives. Charges have been waived for certain items of equipment which attracted a charge in the past. Personnel have been reassured that requests for free repatriation on compassionate grounds will be sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>The Commission also made a wide range of recommendations in the areas of management, military structures, organisation and deployment, manpower and personnel policy and super-annuation. These are complex matters and a programme to address them systematically and comprehensively is being pursued.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress is already evident and an examination of organisational and administrative changes affecting the Permanent Defence Force is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new scheme of promotion on merit for commissioned officers as recommended by the Gleeson Commission is being phased in and a number of competitions for promotion to lieutenant-colonel and to more senior ranks have been held in line with the new arrangements. The competitions which have been held are regarded as interim arrangements pending completion of discussions with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers aimed at agreeing a comprehensive scheme for officer promotion at all levels in the context of a defined career programme.</P>
    <P>The time-frame for completion of implementation of recommendations in the areas to which I have referred is dependent on the complexity of the issues <Col N="1804" /> involved and in many cases on the necessary consultative process with the representative associations. From inquiries which I have made I am satisfied that the implementation of the Gleeson recommendations has been pursued with vigour and determination. This has been and will continue to be the underlying approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the approximate 25 per cent of the Gleeson report recommendations that have not yet been implemented, could the Minister give an indication of the amount of time, energy and effort going into examination of those issues? Could he also be a little more specific on when he expects the full and final recommendations to be implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is that it is not possible to give a time-frame for implementation of the recommendations because of their complexity and of a consultative process which must be carried on with the representative organisations. The Deputy's underlying concern is the seeking of an assurance that there will not be any delay in implementation of the recommendations and I can give the Deputy that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Gleeson report, could the Minister advise the House what structure or arrangements exist to ensure that the increases in pay and allowances already implemented will be kept in line with the cost of living increases that will inevitably occur so that there will not be an appalling repeat of the cyclical occurrence in this State of soldiers' pay and conditions falling behind those of others and leading to massive frustration? Will the Minister indicate the overall time-scale for the more important structural changes to take place, which changes fall within the 25 per cent of recommendations that have not been acted upon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy, in relation to the approximate 25 per cent of recommendations yet to <Col N="1805" /> be implemented, that it is not the case that none of them have been addressed. There are ongoing discussions in that area.</P>
      <P>As I told Deputy Durkan, I cannot give a definitive time-scale because of the consultation process that has to take place. I assure the Deputy, however, that there will be no undue delay on the part of the Department or the military authorities.</P>
      <P>There are two points I should like to make on the question of keeping increases in pay and allowances in line with general cost of living increases. The position that arose previously may have been because there was no representative organisation in place at that time. Judging by the outcome of the recent conference, and the activity of the representative organisations, I do not anticipate any Government in the future being allowed let such a position develop again. In addition, a conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Defence Forces is almost complete, which scheme will obviate the danger of a recurrence of what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the discussions and consultations which must necessarily arise from the findings of the Gleeson Commission, who listened to all sides and prepared a very detailed and well reasoned report, should be kept to the minimum and should not in any way be designed to frustrate or impede the implementation of the recommendations and, in particular, of the structural reforms necessary to update not only the distribution of the Army network throughout the country but also the interplay between the Department and the management side of the Army? I feel there would be a great inclination at that level to maintain consultation and demand discussion simply as a device to avoid the implementation of the report. Could the Minister give an assurance that consultations will be brought to a speedy conclusion in order to ensure the full and early implementation of the recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1806" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hypothetical question because approximately 75 per cent of the recommendations of that committee have been agreed to. I do not anticipate the difficulty the Deputy forsees in relation to the remaining 25 per cent although, obviously, the 75 per cent that have been implemented probably would have been the easier ones. I can give the Deputy the assurance he seeks, that the complexity of the issues involved will not be used as a delaying tactic on the part of the Department or the military authorities with regard to implementation of these recommendations.</P>

      <P>Pensions and allowances payable by my Department are paid on the 20th of each month. The April pension cheques issued before the postal dispute began and, therefore were delivered on time. Arrangements are being made to have cheques available for collection by pensioners at military installations throughout the country and at the Department's offices in Dublin and Galway.</P>

      <P>The remuneration including overseas allowance payable by my Department to members of the Permanent Defence Force on UN peace-keeping missions is based on the recommendations of the independent Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces. The Commission received submissions form three military teams &mdash; representative of privates, non-commissioned officers and officers &mdash; all of which advocated increased allowances calculated by reference to rates of home pay. In the event, the Commission recommended a 25 per cent increase in the rates of overseas allowance payable to all personnel serving in Lebanon. The current rates of overseas allowance for a six month tour of duty in Lebanon range from about £4,000 for a private to about £5,650 for a commandant. The allowances are tax-free.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>All members of the Permanent Defence Force, both men and women, are trained in the use of firearms. However, while women perform armed security duties within barracks, it has been the policy up to now that they do not undertake duties of an operational nature, for example, security duties in aid of the civil power.</P>
      <P>As I announced in this House on 14 May 1992 when introducing the Defence Estimate, the Minister made a decision in principle to end the restrictions which prevent women from serving in all areas of the Defence Forces. Detailed planning is now underway to implement this major change in the status of women in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will call a special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference to discuss the incidents that occurred in Coalisland, County Tyrone in the last few days and to impress on the British authorities the importance of the accompaniment of the Army by members of the police when they come into contact with civilians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the Private Notice Questions dealing with events in Coalisland together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties arising from the behaviour of troops belonging to the Parachute <Col N="1812" /> Regiment have been the subject of ongoing contacts with the British authorities since shortly after the deployment of the regiment in County Tyrone last month. At the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference on 27 April, I expressed concern at reports of harassment, ill-treatment and aggressive behaviour which had been conveyed to us by public representatives and other reputable individuals in the area. I emphasised the importance the Government attached to ensuring that the members of the security forces operated within the law and exercised due care and courtesy in their dealings with the public.</P>
    <P>On 12 May in an unprovoked incident a group of soldiers from the Parachute Regiment entered business premises in Coalisland and caused injuries to a number of customers and damage to the premises concerned. Immediately following this incident, which was widely condemned by elected representatives in the area, the Government made clear to the British authorities their view, first, that appropriate disciplinary and criminal action must be taken against those responsible and, second, that the incident confirmed our view that the Parachute Regiment was not an appropriate unit for contact with the public in Northern Ireland and that we would wish to see them withdrawn from this role.</P>
    <P>In the period immediately afterwards there were indications that the visibility of the Parachute Regiment in Coalisland was significantly reduced. While welcoming this development we maintained our position that the Parachute Regiment should be withdrawn entirely from duties involving contact with the public. The British authorities also informed us that the officer who took part in the incident on 12 May had been removed from duty and that the police were investigating the possibility of criminal charges being preferred.</P>
    <P>On Sunday last, 17 May, members of the Parachute Regiment were again deployed in Coalisland. This followed an incident in which soldiers belonging to another regiment were set upon and a number of items taken, including a <Col N="1813" /> machine gun which has yet to be recovered. While attacks of this kind are to be condemned, and the disappearance of weapons of this calibre is clearly a serious matter, the reintroduction of members of the Parachute Regiment into the town was clearly an inappropriate, and in our view ill-judged, response to these events, given the background of recent days. Almost immediately members of the regiment were involved in a confrontation with local people during which shots were discharged resulting in injuries to three individuals. The British authorities, from whom we have sought a full report on this incident, indicated to us that the soldiers concerned fired in the air or into the ground. The use of live ammunition in such circumstances raises serious questions which we will be pursuing with the British authorities when the full report is to hand.</P>
    <P>In the light of these events the Government are reinforced in their view that the Parachute Regiment is not suited for service in Northern Ireland, given the likelihood to contact with the public which service there involves. We will moreover continue to insist that all members of the security forces are accountable under the law and that any violations of the law must be vigorously pursued by the authorities.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion by Deputy Barry that a special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference should be called to discuss the incident, the Deputy will appreciate that at the conference on 27 April it was confirmed that there would be no further meeting of the conference before the week beginning 27 July 1992 in order to give an opportunity for the political talks process to make progress. I am satisfied that the British authorities are very fully aware of our deep concern and, therefore, the Government would not wish at this point to call a further meeting of the conference.</P>
    <P>I will, as I have made clear on a number of occasions, continue to press for full implementation of the commitment in the Hillsborough Communique that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, there is a police presence in all operations <Col N="1814" /> which involve direct contact between the armed forces and the community. It is moreover essential that such police accompaniment is organised in an effective manner so as to prevent the recurrence of incidents such as these.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before calling the Deputies, I wish to say that having regard to the number of Private Notice Questions to be dealt with today one round of supplementary questions must suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be appropriate for Members of this House to condemn the attack on the Parachute Regiment which resulted in a young soldier losing both of his legs some time before the current spate of activities by the regiment. In view of the fact that the RUC were present with the Parachute Regiment on 12 May and given their inability to cope with the activities of the regiment on that occasion, would the Minister agree it is time the practice of having troops on the street at all in towns like Coalisland was reviewed? An unequivocal declaration of support for the primacy of policing by the RUC in areas would be one way of ensuring that this kind of incident does not occur and that the British army do not come in contact with civilians in this way at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what the Deputy has said. I want to assure him that there was police accompaniment during the incident on 12 May. I can also assure him that the matter is being reviewed and investigated. When the information comes to hand I will let him have it, if he so requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that, as a result of representations made to him, including representations from me, about the conduct and activities and attitude of people in the Coalisland area to this regiment, the British authorities would have had good advance notice of the possibility of trouble and that the incidents which occurred at Coalisland should not have come as a surprise to <Col N="1815" /> them? Would he agree that the Parachute Regiment, by their training, tradition and experience are unsuited to very sensitive areas such as Coalisland? It would appear that this regiment know more about Goose Green than it knows about Gortgonis in that area. Would he agree that at the very least there should have been police accompaniment on all of these occasions in line with the commitment given in the Hillsborough Communique? Will the Minister find out why there was no police accompaniment when the second incident occurred which involved a new, inexperienced regiment in the area? Will he also find out what were the most exceptional circumstances in which that patrol were not accompanied by the police?</P>
      <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to say to Michael Mates that the only result of macho posturing will be that the Provos and their fellow travellers will gain. Today that organisation will recruit members in an area where in a recent election Sinn Féin once again showed a decline in their vote. Will the Minister bring this to the attention of Mr. Mates, who ought to know about it, and warn him of the consequences of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three parts to the Deputy's question and I will try to deal with them separately. With regard to the Parachute Regiment in Coalisland, I expressed the view on television last night that not only are they unsuited to Coalisland but they are unsuited to the North of Ireland and should not be there. With regard to the issue of police accompaniment, as the Deputy suggests I will have the matter investigated. As I said in reply to Deputy De Rossa, there was police accompaniment on 12 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>But not at the incident involving the Kings Own Scottish Borderers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. That matter will be dealt with. With regard to the final part of the Deputy's question, I should say that both Deputy Currie and <Col N="1816" /> I have been living on this island long enough to know a little more about the situation in the North than Mr. Mates probably does. His remarks were probably a result of inexperience and were more adjusted to the security rather than the political elements of what is required in the context of our involvement in, for example, the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek some clarification from the Minister. I understand that the Government in lodging their complaint with the British Government were seeking the withdrawal of the Parachute Regiment from the Coalisland district. Can I take it from what the Minister has said &mdash; he repeated the statement he made on television last night &mdash; that the Government want the Parachute Regiment to be withdrawn from Northern Ireland?</P>
      <P>Second, would the Minister accept that because of their record in Northern Ireland, particularly in 1971 in west Belfast, in 1972 in Derry &mdash; Bloody Sunday &mdash; and in 1976 in South Tyrone, the disdain in which this regiment are held by the Nationalist community there is provocative and that they should be removed forthwith in the interests of both communities in Northern Ireland because their activities of recent weeks are playing totally into the hands of the paramilitaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what the Deputy said. As a matter of record, it is Government policy to have this regiment withdrawn from the island of Ireland, albeit in this case from Northern Ireland. I agree that their record has been deplorable from 1972 onwards. To say the very least, the sooner they are withdrawn from barracks in Coalisland and brought back to the United Kingdom the best for us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is true that when it was agreed there would be no meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference until the end of July, that reference was to ordinary meetings but that the Conference allows, in certain <Col N="1817" /> circumstances, for special meetings to be held, would the Minister agree that the present circumstances are special and warrant the calling of a special meeting of the Conference at which the Minister could put before the Secretary of State, and the Minister responsible for Security, the points that have been made in this House, with which I am sure he agrees? There can be no involvement of security forces with civilians in Northern Ireland unless they are accompanied by members of the police who should have the first contact. The paramilitaries are a totally unsuitable regiment because of their history over the past 20 years in the North of Ireland, to have any role in the security of Northern Ireland. For security forces to descend to the level of terrorists is only acting as the recruiting sergeant for the Provisional IRA and this behaviour should, at all stages, be avoided by them. We expect much more discipline from them than we have seen in the past week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that in circumstances where British soldiers of whatever regiment behave in the manner in which the Parachute Regiment behaved, they are, effectively, recruiting officers for the IRA. The sort of behaviour that was evident in Coalisland entices young people to protect their community, particularly by joining the IRA, and that is most unfortunate. In relation to the calling of an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting, there is a precedent, as the Deputy quite properly said, but in this instance the Deputy should accept that ongoing investigations should be allowed continue until the point is reached when the possibility of such a conference might be considered. I would be anxious to leave the arrangement as it is until the end of July and not to in any way interrupt the undertaking given on 27 April last that there should be a gap in the conference.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply to both Private Notice Questions. I will first reply to Deputy Bruton's question on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. I regret that the dispute now disrupting postal services is causing problems for users of the services. I must stress to the House that An Post are in serious financial difficulties &mdash; accumulated losses of the company had amounted to £13.8 million by the end of 1991 and a loss of £8.5 million is being projected for 1992. Remedial action is urgently required if An Post are to be put on a sound financial footing.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism, <Col N="1819" /> Transport and Communications is monitoring the whole position very closely and the Labour Relations Commission are seeking a means of resuming talks to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Ryan's question, I wish to state that in the course of discussions on the dispute with the Labour Relations Commission, differing interpretations of the findings of the tribunal arose. The Labour Relations Commission have, therefore, decided to seek elaboration from the tribunal on a number of issues. Once these elaborations have been received the Labour Relations Commission will consider what further action can be taken to help resolve the dispute. I can assure Deputies that I am keeping in close touch with the matter. I hope that the initiative by the Labour Relations Commission will lead to further negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the continuance of this dispute is particularly difficult for very small businesses, especially those in the tourist trade who do not have faxes and other facilities available to them and who depend on bookings by post from overseas? Second, would he agree that the continuance of the dispute, coming as it does on the heels of the bank dispute, creates a problem of international credibility of industrial relations and reliability of services here? Would he further agree that from the point of view of both sides in this dispute, their common interests are being undermined by the damage being done to the image of reliability of the service and that if An Post are to become a profitable service there must be a large increase in the volume of business they transact? Any suggestions of unreliability in the service would damage the prospects of An Post as a whole achieving profitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that hardships and difficulties are being experienced by certain sectors as a result of the continuance of the postal dispute. Second, it is unfortunate that the postal <Col N="1820" /> dispute has arisen so soon after the highly publicised dispute in the banking system. Structural problems which have arisen must be dealt with if the continued viability of An Post is to be maintained. Third, the social partners are still committed to resolving industrial relations problems which arise through the well-tried dispute settlement procedures that exist &mdash; the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. As I outlined in my reply, the Labour Relations Commission remain available to the parties and they are at present seeking to obtain elaboration from the Post Office Tribunal which considered all these issues so that they can go back to the parties to see if they can resume negotiations on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern is to have the negotiations started again. Given that we are into the third week of this dispute, one that affects the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people and has put at risk thousands of small businesses, I am appalled that contact has not been made today with a view to starting negotiations, as resolution of the dispute can only be secured through negotiations. Would the Minister accept that the resolution of this dispute has not been helped by the attitude adopted by the management of An Post in not paying the salaries of 2,600 employees and also by the one-sided stance taken by the Government, particularly by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, on this issue? In the national interest would the Minister accept his responsibility as Minister for Labour to intervene with a view to getting the parties together and ensure that they remain in negotiations until the dispute is resolved because it is not in the long term interests of anybody that the dispute should continue? I ask the Minister to intervene immediately.</P>

If one were to resume negotiations immediately, because of the different interpretations that are being put on the tribunal recommendations, we would not be able to make much progress.

The exception taken by Deputy O'Sullivan, quite correctly, is that whilst the one round should go around it should not exclude supplementary <Col N="1824" /> questions from Deputies like him and me who did not put questions down. That has been the precedent and it has been a long-standing practice in the House. The Chair ruled on that and then proceeded to allow a second round of questions from Deputy Bruton who had put the question down. It appears that the ruling does not apply.

Has the Minister read the proposals issued by the trade unions on 13 May, and if so would he not accept that the proposal suggesting a reduction in overtime as recommended by the tribunal should constitute real grounds for negotiations on this matter and that it represents a movement on the part of the unions?

There is not much progress on other issues because of different interpretations of some of the recommendations of the tribunal. The best way forward now is for the Labour Relations Commission to get elaboration from the tribunal on those aspects of their recommendations which are causing the problem at the moment. On foot of that clarification both sides should be invited in to see if matters can be progressed. We are all anxious to have the matter resolved as quickly as possible. The central issues have to be addressed and the viability of An Post has to be assured when the negotiations are concluded.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Minister, and Members, that when we adjourned on Friday we were discussing amendments Nos. 24 and 25 and the proposed arrangements for dealing with withholding tax in sections 10 and 11.</P>
      <P>As I said on Friday, I am very disappointed at the Minister's response and, indeed, with the response of everyone in this House, who seems to be of the same opinion &mdash; with the exception of myself &mdash; that professional people are there to be discriminated against. The Minister is selecting professionals and saying, perhaps because he thinks their earnings are too high and that some are exploiting the poor &mdash; maybe some are &mdash; he has a special tax regime to deal with certain professional people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on Friday, doctors in <Col N="1892" /> a rural practice or in a working class urban practice, are probably earning modest sums of money. These doctors are being discriminated against as opposed to doctors or specialists working in the Fitzwilliam Square area who are not being so discriminated against. There is an underlying tenor going through this debate that they are all on the &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; anyway and this is a way of getting our own back on them. This is very rough justice and it is creating a bad precedent. Enshrined in Finance Bills for some years was a discrimination against business people and professional people on the one hand and PAYE workers on the other. PAYE workers had an unfair advantage with regard to PAYE and PRSI allowances. There was never any logic in it. I suppose I will have to withdraw this amendment because I am not getting any support from any side of the House. I am disappointed with the Minister's response but perhaps he will do better next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 25, to delete lines 30 to 48 and in page 26, to delete lines 1 to 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, this amendment seeks to oppose the stated intention in the Bill by the Minister to treat certain benefits, specifically disability benefit, unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and injury benefit as being liable for tax in <Col N="1893" /> the same way as income derived from any other source. The purpose of my amendment is to oppose the taxing of social welfare benefits. There is a very strong argument in equity to oppose it. We have just listened to a plea from Deputy Garland on behalf of the professional classes. I am quite sure he had a point when he sought to distinguish between, for example, a doctor serving in part of a constituency like my own and the more wealthy elite of the medical profession. When one thinks of the arguments we have advanced during this Finance Bill for people who would be considered wealthy or well off in our society, it is regrettable that we end up considering a proposal from the Minister that social welfare benefits should be liable to taxation.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that the benefits we are talking about have been paid for under the social insurance scheme. The people concerned have paid 7.75 per cent of their income down through the years up to a ceiling of about £19,000. They have been funding their entitlements under the social insurance system out of their own pockets and in conjunction with their employers down through the years. It is grossly inequitable that should someone become ill and be eligible for disability benefit that having funded that social insurance scheme they should be liable to taxation. For somebody who is unemployed, through no fault of his own, it is unfair when he re-enters the workforce that his unemployment benefit will now be taken into account, along with whatever he may earn for the given tax year. There is a serious inequity here. The Minister's stated objective, with which I would generally agree, about income, whatever its source, being liable to taxation is a good one. When we have such gross inequity in our society, when some of the richest, most powerful and wealthy in this community can pay for the best advice and expertise to teach them how to avoid, minimise or even evade their tax liability, it is disgraceful that we should be considering it in the context of the poor social welfare recipients in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> I am aware an argument was made by the Commission on Taxation in the mid-eighties concerning this issue. No doubt the Minister will draw to my attention the particular paragraph of that report. The Commission on Taxation said they believed that the exemption of short term social welfare benefits from income tax was contrary to equity principles which dictate that the amount of income rather than its source should determine the amount of tax that is payable. Because these benefits are funded separately from the social insurance scheme I do not agree with that statement of policy that it is contrary to equity principles. In any event, one should read the rest of the chapter on the question of the taxing of short term social welfare benefits in the commission report. It is clear, if one does that, that that statement or policy is qualified by a number of other considerations, one of which is the recommendation that there should be a basic income for all people in society, below which nobody can fall. At that time they recommended that as being in the region of £55 to £60 a week. Translated into today's figures that minimum threshold would be between £62 and £72 per week. We know that some assistance payments fall below that figure.</P>
    <P>Finally, my real objection to seeking out social welfare recipients to make a contribution in income tax is that it is entirely unconscionable that people who have worked all their lives, people who have paid social insurance, people who have become ill, people who have become unemployed, people who have become been injured, people who have become redundant and are entitled to pay-related benefit should have to pay tax while the exemption levels are so low. If the exemption levels were fixed at some reasonable level, I would be prepared to consider the Minister's proposal on its merits. That is not the case. People are now liable to income tax at a level of about £70 per week. It is unjustifiable. It is a disincentive to work. It is unfair and takes no account of the inequities in society and it takes no account of those <Col N="1895" /> who use every loophole in the system to salt their profits offshore.</P>
    <P>I propose this amendment which effectively deletes the section, because while some progress has been made in tackling the gross inequities that were brought to our attention by the Commission on Taxation and by several reports and comments since then, it is nowhere near sufficient to warrant us chasing people who are unemployed, who are in receipt of social welfare, to pay income tax. They have paid their social welfare stamps and this type of proposal is entirely premature while we have such low tax exemption levels and while we have a separate system for social insurance and taxation. I hope the House will support me and that the Minister will take on board some of the arguments I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand it, the Minister has accepted the proposals put by Deputies Quinn, Garland and Noonan on Committee Stage and his amendment No. 27 is almost similar to amendment No. 28. I thank the Minister for accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak first to amendment No. 26 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte. I have a good deal of sympathy in the points Deputy Rabbitte made. Needless to say, I have a good deal of sympathy for many people who find themselves recipients of social welfare benefits. However, on balance, I do not think the Deputy has made his case and I am inclined to stand over what the Commission on Taxation had to say on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, of course, that the exemption limits are far too low and, like Deputy Rabbitte, I sought to have these increased. There are far too many low earners paying tax and this should be put right. At the same time, it is generally perceived that there is a certain amount of racketeering whereby, towards the end of the tax year, certain employees suddenly go sick and draw sickness benefit free of tax with the ridiculous effect of allowing them to earn more net, after <Col N="1896" /> taking their sickness benefit, than they would have earned had they stayed in work until the end of the tax year and paid tax. I feel the balance of advantage lies with the proposals in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 29, the Minister's amendment No. 27, as Deputy Carey says, seems to cater for my amendments Nos. 28 and 29.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Rabbitte. Section 15 is about penalising the sick who are on disability benefit, those unfortunate enough to be unemployed, those who have suffered industrial injuries and those who are on pay-related benefit, by taxing them. Coming from this Coalition Government this is nothing short of outrageous and totally unacceptable to those in benefit who have paid 7.75 per cent under the social insurance code.</P>
      <P>The reason this amendment must win out here today is because these people have already been horrendously victimised in the Social Welfare Bill. If the Government were implementing the recommendations of the report on social welfare and payments were at the level recommended in 1985 it would be another matter. In 1985 it was argued that the minimum basic payment should be between £50 and £60 a week. By today's standards that would be between £62 and £72 a week. Even though there is an increase of 6 per cent this year, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowances are still only at £53 a week, at least £10 behind the figure recommended in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the logic behind penalising yet again those who are unfortunate enough to be ill, injured or unemployed? Why should unemployment benefit drawn by a person who is unlucky enough to be unemployed be treated as income when all it does is to put bread and butter on the table of the family man or woman who has been unfortunate enough to lose his or her job? Is the Minister to penalise such people if ever they should get <Col N="1897" /> employment after that second six-month period so that they will be deemed to have earned during the period of their unemployment?</P>
    <P>It is important to note that as a proportion of the overall budget the social welfare budget has been declining, expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of the gross domestic product has also been declining and the Exchequer contribution, as distinct from the social insurance contribution to social welfare, has been declining.</P>
    <P>Every politician who has his finger on the pulse of the electorate knows, for example, that old age pensioners, both men and women, who have worked all their lives and who are in receipt of a small contributory old age pension from CIE, Dublin Corporation or the ESB are outraged that they are to be caught in the tax net. How can the Minister expect us to stand over this section of the Bill given the scandals that are hitting the headlines every day of the week involving people with vast incomes who are not paying their fair share?</P>
    <P>As regards the famous annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I wish to remind the House that if there is to be equity and if the meagre social insurance payments of those in receipt of disability benefit and the unemployed are to be deemed as income, then the full force of the law must be used against those employers who according to the report owe the State £137 million in pay-related social insurance contributions. When are we going to hear that employers will be sent to jail and the tax code will be implemented fairly?</P>
    <P>In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General deals specifically with the self-assessment system, which was considered to be a progressive change in taxation policy and was introduced after hundreds of thousands of men and women took part in a major demonstration to call for tax reform. The Comptroller and Auditor General commented on the inability of the Revenue Commissioners to collect the vast sums of money outstanding and stated that <Col N="1898" /> they had informed him that their audit visits, under all programmes, only impacted on 9 per cent of the taxpayer base in 1990. He went on to say that less than 1 per cent of cases had been subjected to a full self-assessment audit.</P>
    <P>There are people in this society who are making huge sums of money. The Minister's colleagues in Fianna Fáil sometimes argue that there is approximately £1 billion, on which tax should have been paid, in offshore accounts in the Isle of Man, Jersey, etc., and that the Minister is thinking of ways to entice that money back to this country. When the Minister proves to this House, to the average PAYE worker and to the unfortunate recipients of disability benefit and unemployment assistance that he intends to go after those elements in our society who have milked the system, we might be in a position to consider his suggestion that social insurance payments should be deemed as income for tax purposes. It is only when we see company directors, landlords and the long list of tax evaders whose names are published annually being sent to jail and not given a slight slap on the hand, that we will be convinced that the Minister is determined to achieve equity in the taxation code. I wholeheartedly support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Section 15, taken in conjunction with the provisions of this year's Social Welfare Act, represents a severe attack on social welfare recipients and is an insult in particular to the unemployed, the sick, and those who have been injured at work. I am puzzled about why this group are being targeted at this time. While it is true that long term social welfare payments, such as pensions, have been taken into account for tax purposes, unfairly so in many cases, we should loosen the tax net for those pensioners caught in it at present rather than extend it to cover the small number of recipients outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will be considered to be a draconian provision by those who lose their jobs. While it is always difficult to come to terms with redundancy, it is no longer <Col N="1899" /> considered to be temporary while one waits to take up another job but rather permanent. One therefore needs all the assistance that one can get, in particular, financial assistance. These provisions, along with the provisions contained in the Social Welfare Act, will penalise workers who have been made redundant on both the tax and social welfare fronts. Heretofore one could look forward to easing some of the problems resulting from the loss of a job by applying for a tax rebate after a month or two. It appears however that it will not be possible to do this under this provision. As the burden on the unemployed will be increased by the Government under this Bill, as well as under the Social Welfare Act, I cannot support this section as it stands but feel obliged to support the amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to disability benefit, as anyone who knows how the Department of Social Welfare have operated in recent years will know, the day is long gone when people could lightly claim disability benefit. The qualifying conditions, in particular the medical conditions, have been applied severely and rigorously. Consequently only those who are genuinely ill and incapable of work qualify for this benefit. Even though we are talking therefore about people who are genuinely ill and who have suffered a severe reduction in their income as a result of their illness, the Government's answer is that they are an easy target, they will tax them further and will ensure they will not gain any tax advantage. That essentially is what the Government are saying. However, I believe if we can provide an advantage for people who are ill, in most cases seriously, we should do so.</P>
    <P>In regard to those who have been injured at work, unfortunately, the number of injuries continues at a high level. However, this is not the fault of the worker. It would not be in order for me to go into this matter at this stage except to say that no worker goes out deliberately to sustain an injury at work. Indeed, there is nothing to be gained financially by being injured at work, even though some people might think so, <Col N="1900" /> particularly when a common law award is made. Anyone who has been injured would much prefer to make a full recovery than to receive even a large amount of money. Consequently, I object to these people being targeted in the Bill. Previously, people injured at work used to receive a higher rate than those on disability benefit but the Minister for Social Welfare abolished that and they now receive a reduced rate. The Minister for Finance will now take more from people who have been injured at work, and I oppose those provisions for the reasons I stated. The Minister is targeting unfortunate victims in society, those who are sick, unemployed or who have been injured at work. The Minister has also targeted what is left of pay-related benefit. I hope the Minister will reconsider this proposal and accept the amendment. When he introduces the second Finance Bill in the autumn he should examine the harshness of the PAYE system in relation to old age pensioners, including widows' and invalidity pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My party will not support this amendment. The Minister must take action in this area because it is invidious that people out of work who receive sick benefit, tax arrears and social welfare payments can end up with take home pay which is more than that of their colleagues who remain at work doing the same job. Deputies who have spoken in favour of the amendment know what happens, particularly after Christmas each year, when there are very high levels of absenteeism. During the last few months of the financial year when there can be tax rebates and PRSI payments do not have to be made, it can pay to stay out of work. In country constituencies they call it &ldquo;diving&rdquo;, I do not know what they call it in the city; there are many &ldquo;divers&rdquo; who are ripping off the rest of the taxpayers in the same manner as people owning offshore companies. The sums of money involved are not as big but the principle is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the general thrust of the Minister's measures in the anti-evasion sections and I will not oppose him in <Col N="1901" /> regard to this measure. However, there is a case to be made for people in bad circumstances and they should not be seriously disadvantaged. Perhaps the Minister will consider an amendment which would simply deal with the problem of people having more take home pay when they are sick than when they are working. The amendment could say that taxation of social welfare would be to a point which would bring the total income below what they would receive if they were working. The figure could be £5 or £10 below their income, which would be a better formula, because there is a danger that certain categories of workers who have been injured will have a genuine problem as a result of the Minister's present approach being too hard on some individuals. Perhaps it could be couched in a way which would be a kind of reverse of pay-related benefit &mdash; I am sure it is not beyond the Minister's officials to come up with something of this kind &mdash; which might solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I presume that the Minister is more interested in putting an end to excessive absenteeism than in the yield from this measure. I know it is an attempt to improve work practices but the Minister could achieve this in a different way. I notice at the end of the section that the Minister says this measure will not be effective when the Bill is passed, the Minister will have to bring orders before the House to implement it. Effectively, this section will remain moribund until these orders are introduced. Perhaps the Minister will again examine the matter and decide not to bring in an order until the autumn in the second Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody can argue against the principle that if somebody has an income which brings him, or her, into the tax net, from whatever source, that it should be considered for taxation. The way in which the Minister is proposing to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation &mdash; which made many other proposals not being implemented by the Government &mdash; is not the correct procedure. Deputy Noonan's comments support <Col N="1902" /> the point I wish to make, which is that this measure is premature. Deputy Noonan said that this is not a revenue gathering measure and I do not know if the Minister has calculated the yield in this regard. However, the draughtsman in the Department of Finance who scurries across to the Department of Social Welfare to scrutinise the administration of their operation is being hopelessly misled because our understanding is that the Department of Social Welfare have now assured Deputies, including my colleague, Deputy Pattison, that the kind of abuse which lives in the folk memory of many people &mdash; and certainly is part and parcel of the demonology of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; is something of the past. Computerisation has now been introduced in the Department of Social Welfare and this system enables them, if they wish, to identify people who are abusing the system in the way it was abused in the past. We all recognise that that is not the point; what is at issue here is whether you transform the whole system to eliminate a particular abuse. We presume, as Deputy Noonan said, that this is not about revenue, otherwise the Minister would be making nonsense of the whole system of redistribution. The Minister is squeezing social welfare payments and tightening up regulations in relation to their allocation, including the referee system for disability payments and so on. As I said, there can be monitoring of payments by computer to very quickly root out collusion between employers and employees so why introduce this measure in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister, contrary to the normal administrative practice of the draughtsman and the Department of Finance &mdash; and indeed every other Department &mdash; at least has decided to bring in the regulations and have them debated in this House prior to their coming into effect, which is not the normal convention in regard to legislation. Perhaps it is a recognition within Fianna Fáil that they still have a constituency which might depend on this. To that extent, the Minister's amendment and the other two amendments representing <Col N="1903" /> the other parties in this House recognise that and the Minister has accepted it. However, I have a better suggestion for the Minister: he should accept the proposal contained in amendment No. 26 and come back in the autumn with the regulations as an integral part of his second Finance Bill. There is no rush in relation to introducing this matter. A great deal of fear has been generated because many people will now have to comply with form filling which they would not otherwise have had to do.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the very short amount of time available for the remaining 200 sections but I should like the Minister to indicate what level of revenue this measure is expected to yield. Will that yield be automatically transferred as a bonus payment into the coffers of the Department of Social Welfare for distribution within the system or will it be simply retained as a Government saving? What system of administration does the Minister have in mind for the operation of that measure?</P>
    <P>If the Minister goes along with the argument of the Progressive Democrats and some Fine Gael Members that a great deal of abuse is taking place then surely he has the wherewithal to eliminate the abuse rather than change the system.</P>
    <P>The principle of persons earning income or getting income from any source and then paying tax on it is not one with which the Labour Party disagree. With the present low threshold of income tax allowances, and bearing in mind the tax rebate as a result of redundancy or illness in one year, and in one year only, the Minister is being unnecessary harsh and uncharacteristically cruel if that is all he is going after. There are other ways of collecting revenue, as the Minister has shown. I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    <P>The best course of action the Minister could adopt in this instance would be to accept the amendment to delete this section and, if necessary, bring back the measure with the implicit regulations attached to it so that people can understand what he has in mind. Members <Col N="1904" /> would not then feel they were voting for some kind of pig in a poke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 26, tabled by Deputy Rabbitte, would remove from the Bill the enabling section provided for the treatment as income for tax purposes of the benefits specified in the section. As I said in the Special Committee, and during the Second Stage debate, that section is in line with the Government's general policy that income when received should be treated as income for tax purposes. In the case of the social welfare benefits in question, there is no reason that these benefits, which are, after all, a substitute for taxable employment income, should not be treated as income for tax purposes. The fact that up until now they have not been so treated is an anomaly.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have also been made on numerous occasions that the anomaly gives rise to absenteeism and acts as a disincentive to work. In fact, every report published in the past 20 years has made that point. I know it is not the only point and there are other disincentives but it has always been included. That would not arise if the benefits were taken into account for tax purposes as the section proposes.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the amendment. I emphasise that the extent to which taxation will arise in any particular instance will essentially depend on the amount of other income an individual has. I have said over and again that in this regard we are not talking about taxing a disability benefit. The measure will not apply to those who receive only a disability benefit; it is the other income received that brings people into the tax net as other income will bring people in receipt of other benefits over the threshold also. That is the relevant point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong for us to try to say that the principle of the section is to tax benefits. I shall certainly examine the details of the proposal when considering the commencement date, and the precise way the section will operate. We should not distort what we are talking about. The benefits will not be taxed but if people <Col N="1905" /> have income from other sources the joint income will be taxed if people are over the threshold.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what happens in the case of the person who receives an old age pension and a work pension or some other form of income. If those incomes joined together put someone over the tax threshold, then the income is taxable. I suppose one could make a case for a pensioner or a person in another category because they do not have the benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked about the application of a tax benefit and I should like to pose two questions in that regard. First, I shall answer Deputy Rabbitte's point. In a paper published in November last the ESRI presented the results of a study on the taxation of short term social welfare benefits. The study was based on the ESRI survey of income distribution and related matters conducted in 1987. It was found that taxation of short term social welfare benefits would most affect the higher paid. Fewer than 10 per cent of those affected were in the bottom 30 per cent of income distribution. That survey was based on 1987 tax rates. The income tax changes since 1987 in relation to exemption limits, child additions and the reduction of the standard tax rate would mean that the lower paid would be even less affected by bringing these benefits into the taxation system than was indicated by the ESRI survey. I ask Members to take the findings of the survey into account. It is apparent that people at the bottom end of the income scale will not be overly affected.</P>
    <P>Deputies Quinn, Garland, Rabbitte, Byrne and Pattison said there will be a considerable amount of work involved in bringing in these regulations and determining the way in which they should operate. An amount of work will have to be put in by the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners and certain matters will have to be teased out but it is time we tried to bring that work to finality. As I said in the Special Committee, I am not sure how quickly that can be done in that a certain amount of matching has to take place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> I wish Deputy Quinn was right in these matters. I often think he is right and that with the development of easy software packages we should be able to identify such issues and then address them quickly. However, they are very complicated when one tries to cross them or, at least, they are put forward as being complicated.</P>

      <P>We will have to take action, develop the principle in an Act and try to focus minds on it. The taking into account of disability benefit in the assessment of taxable income will yield a substantial amount of money, I believe, but that is something that can wait until all the conclusions and studies have been issued.</P>

      <P>I could only give an estimate because there is still much work to be done in this regard and the amount is £20 million. There are definitely arguments in favour of this measure.

We will come back to discuss the commencement date and whatever else there is to discuss at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it will not. Much of my reason for establishing the principle of this measure is to try to focus minds on it. I am not trying to blow all Deputy Rabbitte's arguments out of the water but I ask him to take account of the ESRI survey. Some of the data contained in it certainly convinced me of the merits of this proposal. Quite honestly, the Government are not going after the low paid in any substantial way. If results prove that to be the case, we will examine it when we are working on the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> What struck me was that the figure of less than 10 per cent of those affected featured in the bottom 30 per cent of income distribution. If one re-examines budgets of the past four or five years one will see that their position has improved substantially based on data supplied. In any case it would not have worsened their position. We will have additional time to consider other data. Certainly I shall be doing so as time progresses. I am doing this on the basis that I believe the contents of the ERSI report on taxation will have very little impact on the low-paid. If, in course of discussions, anything to the contrary is proved, I will bear it in mind, but recent examinations would indicate that no such contradiction will be proved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>While being sorry that the Green Party find it unable to support this amendment, I welcome the support of the Labour Party. Clearly the encounter with the old war horses, the annual encounter at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, has caused iron to enter Deputy Noonan's soul, which is regrettable because I have listened in the course of these discussions to much special pleading on behalf of people of some considerable means in our society. I do not make any apology for pleading the cause of people in receipt of certain benefits under the social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan advanced the argument that this amendment is about the phenomenon of absenteeism, that the Minister's purpose, rather than a revenue earner, is to tackle that phenomenon of absenteeism. I am easily won over to that argument. I am aware that it does take place, though not nearly as widely as is in the demonology of some politicians and commentators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the purpose of the relevant section of the Bill. If that is an accidental consequence, or even an intended consequence, so be it in that limited area of abuse. This proposal affects disability benefit, unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and occupational injury benefit. As a former trade union official <Col N="1908" /> I know a number of people who became unemployed after, say, six months of the year earning a reasonable income and whose prospects now of ever re-entering the labour force are virtually nil. As a result of this amendment at the end of the year such a person will have a significant tax liability. For the first six months of the year he will have been in receipt of a reasonably good income and in the second six months of the year received pay-related benefit. He, or she, will have a substantial tax liability now as a result of this amendment. These are people who, through no fault of their own become unemployed and have little or no prospect of ever re-entering the workforce.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and Garland are concerned about the phenomenon of shysters. There are shysters in all walks of life, not in the current Dáil, of course, but, in the past a few may have been elected to this House. There are shysters everywhere. Is the argument being advanced that those who are genuinely ill should be penalised as a result of those who take a dive at a certain time of the year? I cannot support that argument.</P>
    <P>Although I missed a particular part of Saturday's Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, at one stage I was accompanied by a constituent of mine, somebody who has transferred from one area of my constituency &mdash; under the so-called £5,000 grant &mdash; in order to purchase his house on a private estate. He is now out of work because of a heart condition, at 38 years of age, with five young children, with a new mortgage, and he will continue to be out of work. He estimates that this proposal will seriously affect his earnings. His wife works for a couple of hours per week with a contract cleaning company in the area. There will be casualties from this proposal. The reason I am opposing it is that I cannot see how it is a priority while there remains so much work to be done in terms of broadening the tax base and introducing equity into the system. This is not in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation; they hedged it around with qualifications to which I have referred. The ESRI report <Col N="1909" /> did indeed conclude what the Minister said. But they did not conclude that no social welfare recipients would be caught in this kind of all-embracing proposal to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>While the tax exemption levels are so low, while we have yet so far to go in combating the phenomenon about which Deputy Byrne spoke in terms of abuses that take place elsewhere in the system, I cannot see that this is a priority. I do <Col N="1910" /> not think I should forget the people who elected me here and because there is a certain intellectual argument about the equity of all income being subject to taxation there may indeed be an argument in principle in this case. But I do not believe that this is a priority. For that reason I wish to press this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to remove section 17 from the Bill. The section deals with profit-sharing schemes and the shares granted to employees. I am quite happy with the present legislation in this area which was introduced in 1982. It made a small contribution towards better labour relations and was an attempt at getting away from the &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; concept which results from the way society and industry are structured. We in the Green Party would prefer to move from the concept of employer and <Col N="1912" /> employee to that of people working with others through workers co-operatives or working in family businesses. However, we are light years away from that at present. We must accept the concept of employers and employees and the inevitable conflicts that arise between the interests of these two groups who comprise the bulk of our industry. I think we are all agreed that we are going through difficult times on the industrial relations front, having had a prolonged bank strike followed by a prolonged strike in An Post at present.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister proposed the total abolition of these schemes. We all received representations from trade unions on the one hand and from various employer organisations on the other, requesting us to oppose this proposal, and I am pleased the Minister has responded to some degree to these representations. At present there is a £5,000 limit on these transactions. I do not propose that that limit be increased because we must keep a reasonable balance in this matter. This scheme is designed to assist workers and people up to middle management to have a stake in the business in which they work. It is not designed to benefit the very highly paid managers and directors, nor should it do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> has put down a series of amendments which propose to increase the figure from £2,000 to £4,000. In other words, he is proposing an effective reduction of £1,000, from the present level of £5,000 to £4,000. I do not disagree with that proposal because it may make for a reasonable compromise. By inserting this section the Minister is accepting the principle behind this measure, but the limit of £2,000 is too low; it should be between £3,000 and £5,000. We are looking for consensus in the House. I hope that the principle of this proposal is accepted by the Labour Party and the Democratic Left. They have no amendments down on the matter but I will be disappointed if they do not feel reasonably favourably disposed <Col N="1913" /> towards it because it would indicate &mdash; I hope I am wrong &mdash; a certain narrow trade union attitude to employee remuneration which sees the basic wage plus overtime as the main aim of the trade union movement in securing increases in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the trade union movement as represented by these two parties would seek to broaden the horizons of the Left and of the trade union movement so as to achieve more worker participation in industry. We need more worker directors. It is important that workers feel part of the enterprise, not in battling with management for a greater share of the cake but in making a contribution, which will be recognised by management, to profit sharing schemes and co-ownership schemes. The Liberal Party in Britain have been pioneering in this area for many years in an effort to close the divide between management and labour. I would be interested to hear the other contributions on this matter.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A series of amendments in my name are being discussed with the amendment in Deputy Roger Garland's name and as Deputy Garland has made a very strong case I do not need to add to it. The Minister announced on budget day that he intended to abolish profit sharing, an idea first put forward by the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, and introduced in 1982 by the then Coalition Government. The Minister has since changed his mind on the principle and has restored profit sharing, but with a maximum market value of shares of £2,000. Effectively the principle has been conceded but the amount has been reduced from £5,000 per employee to £2,000 which, I believe, is too low. In the interests of achieving a compromise I have put down an amendment to increase the figure to £4,000 and a series of consequential amendments to make it consistent right across the table. Considering that we are discussing all these amendments together and as Deputy Garland's <Col N="1914" /> amendment is down first and, I hope, will be put, I will be voting for it.</P>

      <P>We are back to where we were on Committee Stage. I had an amendment down at that stage to delete the section with the effect of leaving the <i>status quo</i> intact. The arguments have been cleared articulated. The Minister has compromised to save face in his Department. His arguments, as usual, have a certain degree of plausibility, but they do not convince. If the section was all right it should have been left alone and if it was not it should have been abolished. The Minister's response in putting in £2,000 instead of £5,000 is half hearted even though sums of £5,000 were very seldom taken up. The fact is that this was left in there as an incentive. This is not a revenue gathering mechanism, it is part and parcel of the price tag of scraping the barrel in order to appease the Progressive Democrats. It is contrary to everything the Minister believes and is contrary to the document he published in his capacity as Minister for Labour. This has clearly brought down on the Minister's shoulders the wrath of the social partners in the form of the FIE and the Congress of Irish Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty in supporting this amendment if it has the effect of restoring the <i>status quo.</i> It will not cost the Government a substantial amount of money. The sum involved is less than £2 million. Since we were so concerned in the previous vote to deal with the problem of absenteeism, it is extraordinary that this provision is being halved especially as the money in these instances did not disappear. If it was not on deposit in somebody's account it was being recycled for other productive purposes either by direct consumption or through further investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan's amendment tinkers with the problem. I can see that the Deputy is trying to save the Minister's face by allowing the original provision to stand to the tune of 80 per cent. On balance, this is a classic instance where the Minister was driven by either the <Col N="1915" /> political concerns of the Progressive Democrats or the bureaucratic concerns of the officials in the Department. They were certainly not the concerns the Minister previously stated. For that reason we will be supporting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I am astounded that the Minister took this decision but I understand why. I can see where his advice came from. It came from employees of Aer Lingus who consider themselves to be experts in industrial relations. They believe that the legislation allowing this tax relief was useless and counter productive. I do not know what motivated the departmental advisers, but as Deputy Quinn said there has been harmony, great productivity, few accidents, great savings on waste and so on in companies that have availed of the legislation. One of the big bonuses has been that American companies who have been notoriously secretive about transferring shares in their companies had finally agreed to participate in this share system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am puzzled about the Minister's attitude. There have been publications, particularly <i>The Evening Press</i> showing that the Minister said he was right to abolish this incentive. We know about pressure groups, but I am talking about the principle of this which was to improve industrial relations. The Order of Business was held up for an hour today, and some of the problems discussed during that time related to bad industrial relations in a semi-State company. When the Minister was in the Department of Labour he encouraged one company in my constituency, Semtex, to take part in profit sharing. The Minister, when he was Minister for Labour exhorted members of SIPTU, the only union who were reluctant about profit sharing and the share system, to participate fully in profit sharing. When the Minister joined the dream ticket with the Taoiseach &mdash; another man who champions himself as a businessman who wants to further industrial relations &mdash; they abolished one of our most progressive pieces of legislation. This has not <Col N="1916" /> occured for the simple reason Deputy Quinn put forward, to reduce incentives by £1 million here and a £1 million there in order to keep Deputies O'Malley and Molloy or their compatriots happy. There was something more sinister about it.</P>
    <P>Merrion Street has no understanding of industrial relations. They have pushed this proposal on people. This section reveals that although Merrion Street has a finger in every Department and dictates to them when estimates and budgets are being calculated, when it comes to real knowledge of manufacturing industry, they do not know what they are about. They are far from reality.</P>
    <P>If one is sweating, working on the floor of a company that is making great profits and one is tied by something called <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> or a national wage agreement, and one wants to get a bit extra and provide for the future, profit sharing is a great system to keep everyone steady.</P>
    <P>There were no industrial relations problems in the Syntex Plant which is near to where I live. If the Minister takes out his files on that company he will see that since its foundation in 1974, the Irish have taken it over. The Americans set it up and there has been a share participation. The American corporation gave these shares out to employees. The first people to take advantage of them were the skilled trade unions. The leader of the union there is a man from the North of Ireland. He persuaded the craftsmen to join with him in profit sharing. They made huge savings in that company. That is the only success I can name immediately, but I know there are others in the mid-West. SIPTU were very slow to participate in this scheme.</P>
    <P>It was the policy of the ICTU not to really encourage the scheme, but in recent years they have come to see the benefit of it. Employees in the craft unions now have substantial savings in this area. There have not been any labour relations difficulties there. The company pays out under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The big benefit has been that the Americans had confidence in <Col N="1917" /> Syntex because of all the productivity and the good industrial relations so they put huge research and development into it. It has taken 18 years to do this and now the dream ticket has come along and blown a hole in it. They have abolished this benefit. These men are to lead us out of our huge unemployment problem and they could not even deal with this basic simple thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor at the Department of Finance is now Taoiseach, so he knew what was being prepared. It was not today or yesterday that these options were put to Cabinet. What was the Minister for Labour doing when this came up? How did he approve it? How did the Department of Finance put that across?</P>

I had the privilege of working with fellows on a factory floor, sweating it out every day. We saw the fellows in Mount Street and Merrion Street doing very well. This scheme ensured a proper return to people in manufacturing industry, although I know there are service industries which have taken advantage of it. Maybe the Minister was trying to get after GPA who are already in the scheme. Maybe he was trying to get after Tony Ryan because he is a successful businessman. Maybe there were some difficulties there. Could there be a hidden agenda? Are they after the banks?</P>

      <P>There was general consensus on Committee Stage that the principle of this scheme was good and that the Minister was correct in restoring it. We debated the matter thoroughly on Committee Stage. Restoring the scheme in such a way that an employee can take out £2,000 every year is welcome. It is good for industrial relations and for generating participation in the workplace. The feedback I have been receiving is that the bulk of correspondents who got in touch with me following the budget announcement are reasonably satisfied at the compromise which has been arrived at. The figure the Minister has set meets the vast majority of cases. That is what we should be concerned about, not encouraging hyperbole or over indulging in major issues. The scheme has been restored and can be reviewed annually. The best way to proceed is to monitor participation in this scheme and if there is a major demand at the end of next year we might make further amendments. We should accept the goodwill of the Minister. <Col N="1920" /> We have witnessed the democratic process in operation. He has responded to reasonable arguments and we should be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>On budget day I described the budget as an itsy bitsy kind of thing. This is an example. This initiative showed a complete philosophical chasm. There was no overall plan in the budget. They were turning every stone looking for a few pennies, irrespective of what effect a measure might have on any group within the economy. This measure had a devastating effect, particularly on bigger companies and middle management. The Minister knows this and that is the reason he has back tracked. He showed he had not a clue about the dynamics of company management. I would not blame the moguls of Merrion Street. I blame the lack of Government philosophy in putting the budget together. They were collecting pennies and hoping they would end up as pounds and they succeeded in needlessly aggravating important sections of the community. The Minister should have understood that this measure, which was introduced in 1982 as a great innovation, was a great aid to company management and a way of motivating people in the workplace. Today when the Country at large is continually berating the Government about the tax take and the fact that there is no reward for people, to implement the Minister's original proposal would be to compound matters. That makes people ask why they should be bothered. There is enough of that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I spoke about the new mathematics this Government have created, whereby three is greater than 11. A person earning £3,000 has more disposable income than a person earning £11,000 and a family on £7,500 from social welfare is better off than a corresponding family on £16,000. They have created &ldquo;new mathematics&rdquo; and this is another example of how they have compounded the errors they made. The Minister has back-tracked a little, but that is not enough. He should realise that this was a massive blunder which upset the <Col N="1921" /> management structure in a great many companies. From talking to people in middle management, I know they were completely frustrated by this action and saw it as a vindictive move to take a few well earned pounds from them. The Minister has restored this incentive in part but he should do the decent thing and restore it entirely because of the input it makes to good management and increased output. It motivates people and gives them a sense of belonging. Therefore, I will support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to defend the position of my union, SIPTU. I know Deputy Carey sweeps with a very broad brush on occasion but the reason SIPTU have taken up this position is that the overwhelming number of people who are members of the largest union in the country simply cannot afford to subscribe £5,000 for shares annually, even at market value or even do so occasionally. That is the difficulty with the comments on it. Members have not commented on what is included in the amended Bill but on what the Minister said on budget day. What the Minister did on budget day was wrong, we are all agreed on that and I do not think there is any need to go back on the arguments on why this was wrong. I am surprised that a former Minister for Labour would have made that decision having regard to the industrial relations implications and the other points made by Members, but in fairness to the Minister for Finance he had other matters to pro-occupy him round the time the budget was being framed and I for one would be prepared to forgive him on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has got it about right now and whereas Deputy Garland has gently chided me by expressing the hope that I would not take up any narrow trade union position which is an opprobrium I will have to live with, difficult though that may be, I would rather not be put in the position of having to vote for the <i>status quo</i> because it has little regard for the factual position on the shop floor. I think the Minister has got it about right when he sets the figure at £2,000 per <Col N="1922" /> annum. That is about as much as the people for whom this scheme was designed are capable of taking up. If we are talking about improving industrial relations and involving the kinds of people envisaged in this scheme, the average run of the mill industrial worker, the shares option facility exists until section 12 of this Bill revokes it for the people who can afford to invest £5,000 or more per annum. On Second Stage the Minister remarked that £200 million is tied up in the share option scheme that exists. I have not an exact account of what was said on Committee Stage in the Seanad but I believe the Minister said the average take up was of the order of £1,400 or £1,450 per annum. That would be my experience of the situation as well. I find it difficult to be moved by the argument in favour of restoring the <i>status quo.</i> I am glad, and I agree with Deputy Carey on this point, that the Minister has replaced the scheme but I think the ceiling is not far out from what is needed.</P>
    <P>We might quite properly have spent a great deal of time today discussing the trade dispute in An Post but with all due regard to the relevance of the industrial relations argument, regardless of what you read about the level of earnings in Sheriff Street, the average staff member working for An Post would not be troubled by the ceiling we are opposing in the Bill as it now stands. The average staff member has enough difficulty finding money to pay his mortgage instead of having £5,000 to subscribe for shares on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>One point which nobody has referred to &mdash; perhaps I have misunderstood it &mdash; is the top-up arrangement. I thought there was a top-up arrangement in place for the years 1991-92 which means that anyone who wants to take up the option in the current tax year can benefit from a ceiling of £4,000. Therefore this measure causes me even less pain. I plead with my colleague. Deputy Garland, not to force an emergency parliamentary party meeting of the Democratic Left as to what we will have to do on this amendment if he presses the amendment for the <i>status quo.</i> I am in agreement with the principle <Col N="1923" /> but I think the ceiling of £2,000 or thereabouts more or less meets the demand. If we decided earlier to tax recipients of certain social welfare benefits, then it seems to me that we give someone the opportunity to subscribe at market value for shares to the value of £2,000 annually. That is fair and I find it very difficult to justify a benefit greater than this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it strange that everybody thinks the figure is about right. I get the impression we are developing a society where there seems to be something wrong when one is successful. Why is it better that we set this ceiling at £2,000 rather than at £5,000? When the ceiling was set at £5,000 it did not cause any great problem &mdash; I did not read about people taking to the streets to protest about this or the trade unions complaining bitterly about it.</P>
      <P>The scheme was a good one and it was highly successful. People seem to forget that the few big businesses we have in this country started out as a small business. We need to encourage people to start businesses which, we hope, will get bigger. The bigger the business becomes, the better it is for this economy, for the people we represent, and the 300,000 who are now lingering in the dole queues.</P>
      <P>What was wrong with setting the ceiling at £5,000? If the Minister had come in and said that in order to pay social welfare benefits he would have to cancel the scheme because the country is broke, that would be acceptable, but the reality is that there is no immediate saving to the State &mdash; perhaps there are possible savings in the future but the Minister cannot say he is saving £2 million or £3 million as a result of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a country with a very small population that is dying because of the lack of employment opportunities. We need to encourage people to change their attitudes towards work, to change their attitudes towards their employers and trying to make businesses grow bigger. If I were Minister, the first thing I would <Col N="1924" /> do is introduce this scheme in State commercial companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If this scheme was in place in An Post at present would we now be experiencing the terrible difficulties that exist for those who are trying to keep their businesses in operation? The State should be the first to introduce the scheme in State commercial companies. They have to show that there is a place for everybody's contribution in State companies. People should share the profits when profits are made. The State should lead by example. However, what we do in our anxiety to convince people of the equity of the taxation system is to start abolishing things that appear to create inequity. That is a load of nonsense. I do not blame civil servants for this decision because the politicians make the decision around the cabinet table. As both Deputy Quinn and Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> would know from their days in Government, the &ldquo;sell the <i>Asgard</i>&rdquo; list would be sent up prior to the budget discussions by every Department because they had to submit areas where they could make savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians and Ministers had to make decisions and they considered various ideas and suggestions. Another &ldquo;sell the <i>Asgard</i>&rdquo; list would arrive and eventually decisions had to be taken. For a party like Fianna Fáil, who parade themselves as the pro-business party, who charge £1,000 a team to play golf and the best of luck to them if they can get it &mdash; I hope there are more successful business people around who can pay Fine Gael, Labour and the Democratic Left the same amount to play golf &mdash; this Finance Bill is the most anti-business Finance measure ever brought into this Dáil. All the Government are doing is sending up the greatest smoke-screen ever invented. I thought P. J. Mara was good but the two new arrivals seem to outstrip him to a far greater degree than I had ever anticipated. They are still managing to convince <Col N="1925" /> the electorate that they are pro-business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are sending up massive smoke-screens. I would say to the Minister that instead of restricting the scheme he should extend it to State companies and introduce new thinking into commercial State companies, into ordinary business and encourage people to participate. We are the people who should be giving the example and not be coming in here trying to defend reducing it from £5,000 to £2,000. That is petty. It was not causing a problem at £5,000. It was a success in that it prevented strikes, it resulted in greater participation in companies and it created wealth. The more wealth we create the more taxes will be generated. If everybody sat on his laurels we would all be screaming. Whether it is £2,000 or £5,000 it highlights a line of thinking that actually frightens me, especially when we have in real terms 300,000 on the dole queues.</P>
      <P>Where does the Minister think we will get jobs? Who will invest? Who will get up, take on the risk and create jobs for those who are seeking them? Young entrepreneurs cannot get money. If they walk into a bank nobody will give them money unless they have security, and so they leave us. If those is business wish to expand they have to sell their house to the bank before they can obtain a bigger overdraft. What sort of atmosphere are we creating for business in this country? We should be leading by example and extending this scheme to State companies, showing employees in those companies that they are as important as anybody else if they are prepared to row in and make a profit. Then we would all be better off.</P>
      <P>The last point I wish to make &mdash; and I should not say this because I will be accused of having a vested interest &mdash; relates to the insurance business. We are told that people want to abolish mortgage interest relief. Has anyone ever heard such nonsense? People buying their own homes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister should accept the amendments before us. Having had a three-day debate on Committee Stage, the Minister must accept that the original decision was a wrong one. The Government decided to look at every option regarding the availability of allowances and instead of ensuring that people had pride in their work, decided to ensure that anybody who had a say in the company in which they worked would not have the benefit in future and instead would revert to the old days of the fifties and sixties. I would like to ask the Minister whether there was any vision in the Cabinet when this decision was made? I would ask the Minister to take on board the points made by my colleagues, especially the suggestion made by Deputy Barrett to extend rather than restrict this provision to other areas. Is it any wonder that the 281,000 people registered as unemployed on May Day have no confidence in any jobs being created when vision on the Government benches is so narrow?

      <P>I referred to this provision at length on Second Stage so I do not intend to dwell on it at length now. I should like to point out to the Minister <Col N="1927" /> that before he introduced the provision he should have consulted with Kerry Group plc and Tilletson in my constituency. Kerry Group plc introduced this scheme for their workers in 1986 and it proved very successful. I have discussed it with a number of the staff all of whom agreed it created a buzz in the workplace. Kerry Group plc employ in excess of 3,000 people, the majority of whom have shares in the company. That is one of the reasons Kerry Group plc. is one of the best in the country and one of the reasons it has such a growth rate is because the workforce is so highly motivated.</P>
      <P>At a time when we are talking about incentives for employers and employees this afforded one of the few real incentives for employees. I notice at various conferences throughout the country it is usual to invite people such as Jack Charlton, Ciaran Fitzgerald or Mick O'Dwyer to speak about motivation. This was one of the greatest motivation factors in the workplace ever introduced in Ireland. I appeal to the Minister to go some way towards meeting this proposed amendment. If he cannot go the full way I appeal to him to accept Deputy Noonan's proposal of £4,000. I agree with Deputy Barrett that rather than restrict this provision we should expand it and we should consider other options along similar lines which would give an incentive to employees. Several American firms coming to this country were impressed with the scheme of incentives for employees. In some cases it was one of the reasons they invested here.</P>
      <P>The Minister has listened to many contributions but he should give very careful consideration to this. If he cannot facilitate us this year perhaps he will reconsider the position for next year.</P>

      <P>In a previous contribution I stated that, in framing the budget, the Minister probably overreacted to the succession of scandals. The sentiment coming through this Finance Bill is that the Minister has developed an anti-business mentality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Carey's very eloquent <Col N="1928" /> contribution in relation to Syntex in Clarecastle. There are &ldquo;Syntexes&rdquo; all over the place. There are successful businesses in Limerick and Kerry and other places. In such circumstances, successive governments encouraged people to take out shares, and have a stake in their companies. This was one area where there was positive encouragement. I listened with interest to what Deputy Barrett said about the semi-State companies, and possibly this whole concept should have been broadened. I think there is an element of begrudgery in this. The Minister realised afterwards that his proposal to abolish this scheme was not a very wise decision but could not, naturally, admit that it was a mistake and reinstate the limit of £5,000, so he restored it to a limit of £2,000. I agree with Deputy Noonan that this limit should be increased to £4,000.</P>
    <P>Having shares in a company may be called a fringe benefit, but in the context of the valid improvements in the social welfare system, prevailing wage rates and the poverty trap, one often has to give this type of incentive to encourage people to remain in the workplace. In recent times it has been said that the average industrial wage is £231 a week. In my area around Newcastle West, where SIPTU prevail, the average industrial wage is £150 and one does not have to be a wizard to work out what people earning that much take home at the end of the week. Is it any wonder, in a situation like that, that a person with two or three children decides that it is not worth his while working? It is desirable to have incentives like the share option scheme. It is not wise to lash out and remove such benefits on the grounds that they are an unfair concession to workers. Quite often they are topping up a wage which could be classed as inadequate in comparison with social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognised the folly of what he did originally and partially rectified it. He may not be able to go the full way to the £5,000 but at least we have given him the option to go to £4,000 and I would ask the Minister to support what we have put forward.</P>

      <P>I have been involved in discussing aspects of this over a great number of years and it is true that there has been great reluctance on the part of the trade union movement to become involved. It was one of the schemes that was thought to be of some benefit during the joint labour committees and Basil Chubb's committee on partnerships and co-operation at all levels. The concern was that on its own it had not been successful and there was no great interest in it. A small number of companies, mainly multinationals, used it to try to encourage participation by their employees. A large number of other companies used it as an incentive to their senior executives. Yet other companies used it to displace traditional bonus packages. Whatever way it was used, there was some merit in it.</P>
      <P>As part of the Programme for Government last autumn the Government decided that reliefs, exemptions and shelters would all be examined. Profit sharing and the various share option schemes were all matters to be considered and they were not dealt with individually but together. That was the decision the Government made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Carey would know, Syntex used the scheme well. They spent about three hours one morning last February with me and my officials explaining the benefits and how it operates. They were one of the companies that played a role in convincing us that we should keep it on. The reason I changed my mind about this scheme, as opposed to other schemes, was that it could lead to directors with incomes inclusive of export sales relief dividends of £4 million paying only £44,000 in tax and relief dividends of £3.5 million into their bank accounts: to directors with incomes of £2.5 million <Col N="1930" /> paying only £32,000 in tax and receiving sales relief dividends of over £2.5 million; or to directors with £7.5 million paying tax at £20,000.</P>

      <P>I have listened to eight speeches from the Fine Gael benches. Just because I have tickled a little bit at the abuses whereby people can make millions and pay less than 1 per cent tax, I am interrupted. I have readily accepted that there is some benefit in this scheme, but other people have to accept that there are in this country some people who pay tax at 48 per cent and there are people who pay at 27 per cent and if they work an hour's overtime they pay almost 50 per cent while other people use shelters, reliefs and exemptions in a way that is legitimate under the system, and cross things like share options, share reliefs and purchasing shares to evade tax so that they pay less while the ordinary, complaint taxpayer pays more. Let me say to Deputy Barrett that I have great admiration for businessmen who show enterprise and work legitimately and invest the money in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in detail on Second Stage, in a number of cases, not just one, the approved share options schemes were designed and structured in such a way that only a single person benefited. They used limited partnerships under the share <Col N="1931" /> option scheme as a vehicle to avoid tax. Notwithstanding the amendments made in relation to such parnterships by the Government in 1986, with which I would have agreed, they involved operations both inside and outside the State, one of the features of which was the generation of substantial losses in the earlier years which could be offset against the taxable income of the limited partner up to the amount of his contribution.</P>
    <P>While I agree with what Deputy Barrett had to say, that we should look at some of these operations to see if jobs have been created and provide reliefs for them, they can avail of considerable capital allowances. In addition, we have an excellent structure in relation to expenses while business can avail of the new wear and tear allowances. As I mentioned the last day, under one of these schemes which involved a limited partnership, the people concerned bought shares in a gas exploration company in Texas to gain reliefs with the result that they only paid a pittance here. They should have paid at the rate of 40 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One Deputy mentioned that we are talking about a mere pittance but £280 million will be required to pay for the cuts in tax rates, the extension in the tax bands and the exemptions as announced in the budget. That was a major achievement in that we managed to pass on money which was held by way of various reliefs in the hands of a few individual taxpayers. I will not say that they were non-compliant taxpayers because they used the system legally so I have no complaint to make but this money is to be used to help 750,000 taxpayers. I make no apology for removing tax shelters which were availed of in some cases by half a dozen people, in others by either a few hundred or a few thousand and providing the money instead to 750,000 people. In fact I think this is the most sensible thing that I have ever done in my life and I make no apology for doing so.</P>
      <P>I should say that this particular share scheme was not abused; rather the point at issue is the way it was used along with others. I have met the Irish Profit-Sharing Association on a number of occasions, the ICTU, the FIE and several companies all of which have said, and the Revenue figures show this too &mdash; that the figure is less than £1,000 in the case of over 50 per cent of companies. I do not want to make up a figure, as I said on Committee Stage, but it would seem that in the case of over 90 per cent of companies the figure is less than £1,400 or £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Profit-Sharing Association could only point to Guinness where the figure is over £2,000 but they also avail <Col N="1933" /> of other schemes. I also believe that some companies can afford to carry the cost themselves rather than pass it on to the taxpayer. This does not apply to Guinness as they had no objection and were quite happy with the figure of £2,000. When the Irish Profit-Sharing Association put forward the figure of £2,000 they said it should be kept under review in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Garland, who made some valid points at the outset, to consider the following. Even though the vast majority of those who avail of the scheme are satisfied with a figure of £1,400 and if I leave the figure at £5,000, the people who have been affected by my decision to close off other share options schemes and who do not need the scheme as much in respect of operations both inside and outside the State &mdash; most of which I would argue, are not valid &mdash; would automatically go for the maximum of £5,000. It would therefore have the wrong effect. Every person who has been affected by the decision to remove shelters, reliefs or exemptions will say that this scheme provides a way around that. They will not be slow in doing so.</P>
    <P>In one recent prospectus, but not for this scheme, the headlines, &ldquo;Investment Opportunity&rdquo; and Tax Efficient Partnerships&rdquo; are littered all over the document. The result is that an investor would have more cash available in the first year of the investment than in the case of any other investment. Even though that was not a profit sharing scheme, people will invest their money in this scheme. Though it would not cost the State much to increase the figure from, say, £2,000 to £5,000 now, as employees never availed of the full amount or saw a need to go over the figure of £2,000, everyone would use it from now on for that purpose. I am not saying that I have made a mistake and that the figure should be raised once again to £5,000; I looked carefully at the scheme to see what was good in it and to ensure that it would not be abused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I announced this change in the budget on 29 January and it was brought to my notice that because of that at least two companies &mdash; I am sure there are many more &mdash; had not issued shares in the tax year 1991-92. As a result of the changes I have made in the Finance Bill an extra £2,000 worth of additional shares may be issued in the tax year 1992-93. Therefore in the tax year, 1992-93, £4,000 worth of shares may be issued. I should also make the point &mdash; this fact was not emphasised in the debate &mdash; that it is £2,000 per year for five years and the shares are to be held for that period. However, one will not have to cash them in at market value at the end of the fifth year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the problems which have now reached acute proportions in Dublin, namely&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) a crime rate treble that of the rest of the country,</P>
      <P>(2) unemployment of up to 70 per cent in certain areas,</P>
      <P>(3) the collapse of the housing programme for 8,500 families on waiting lists and many in substandard local authority flat complexes,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) the continuing depopulation of its inner city areas with the dereliction <Col N="1939" /> and the huge adjustment problems this has caused.</P>
    <P>(5) traffic chaos caused by a lack of coherent transport and road policy,</P>
    <P>(6) the passive, underused and even decaying amenities of the bay, the docks, the canals, the zoo, and the assets of our heritage,</P>
    <P>(7) the very poor level of education advancement achieved by some of its children,</P>
    <P>(8) the lack of any proper community involvement in decision making;</P>
    <P>calls for a complete overhaul of city government which would</P>
    <P>(i) establish a single greater Dublin Authority to achieve coherent planning for the whole Dublin area,</P>
    <P>(ii) confer on that Authority new executive powers over local job creation, transport, tourism and urban renewal,</P>
    <P>(iii) confer new powers of scrutiny in relation to other Departments and Public Authorities making decisions affecting the economic and social progress of Dublin and</P>
    <P>(iv) develop a second tier of Government with devolved responsibilities which would encourage greater community participation in decision making about their area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a very important motion as regards the city and county of Dublin. Nobody could deny that Dublin City and County have very grievous problems. Because the Fine Gael Party attach so much importance to this motion we are anxious that as many of our Dublin Deputies as possible be permitted to participate in this debate. With your permission, therefore, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to share my time with Deputies Shatter, Doyle and Cosgrave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin is a city with many advantages and many problems. Some of those problems are inevitable in any city but many arise from the fact that in Dublin city and county nobody is in charge. The local authorities act in blissful disregard of each other, although nominally there is one city and county manager. The county development plan and the city development plan are not alone unco-ordinated but are, in fact, frequently in contradiction with each other. As a result, massive and numerous shopping centres have been planned and, even worse, permitted on the outskirts of the city following the sprawl of housing. That process has accentuated the decline of the city centre as a place either to live in or to shop in. In this way Dublin has become a doughnut. A doughnut city is one with a ring of development at its edge but with no heart.</P>
      <P>The House will hear in the course of this debate a very valid account of the experiences of citizens of this city and, indeed, of their public representatives. More important, Members will hear very positive proposals to put somebody in charge of Dublin. There needs to be someone not only in charge of traditional local authority items but also in charge of many other matters such as economic and tourism development, crime prevention and transport, for which there is absolutely no central co-ordinating body at present. Despite improvements from the implementation of the provisions of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, Dublin's inner city is still full of environmental obnoxia. There are still too many derelict sites and buildings, vacant lots, urban blight, most of which is caused by official neglect, deed or omission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that Dublin's inner city decay has arisen largely because of what could be described as official vandalism. Moreover, some of the worst planning mistakes have been perpetrated by official agencies, such as Dublin Corporation, in the case of the civic offices development at Wood Quay, <Col N="1941" /> and the Central Bank in Dame Street. Those planning monstrosities are minor compared with the planning mistakes made in Dublin over the past 20 years. New suburbs have sprawled across former green belts, advancing ever further into the country, indeed overflowing into the adjoining counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath, requiring connecting roads to the city centre, and to each other, thus creating the need for ever more journeys. We must remember that more journeys mean additional economic costs, more energy consumption and more pollution. In addition, these suburbs require new schools, churches, health centres, postoffices, Garda stations, parks, community centres and so on, while similar utilities in the city centre are under-utilised or redundant. Enormous public funds were borrowed, adding further to the national debt, to provide facilities already readily available in the inner city and inner suburbs. From every conceivable financial, planning, environmental and social consideration the unco-ordinated sprawl of Dublin city over the past 20 years has been a major mistake.</P>
    <P>The descent into inner city decline was not merely a process of the dereliction of buildings. It was also a process of the dereliction of culture &mdash; the verve, wit and literature for which Dublin had been famous over centuries, quintessentially a tradition and product of the proximity and intimacy of people living at close quarters with each other, having been exchanged for a bland mid-Atlantic culture lived out in semi-detached suburbia, indistinguishable from suburbia in any industrial town in England, usually called a similar name.</P>
    <P>Not all our crime wave is attributable to this cultural desert but some of it does arise from this dearth of culture. Part of the explanation for the growing crime levels in Dublin is to be found in what I might describe as the cultural subfactors, such as little sense of tradition or belonging; poor social mix; bland anonymity in over-spread-out suburbs and the alienating effect of the delapidated inner city environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1942" /> Of course Dublin is not exempt from problems found to be unavoidable in other cities throughout the developed world, nor should we fail to recognise many improvements which have taken place in the city especially since the Urban Renewal Act, 1986 was introduced by Fine Gael. Unfortunately, progress since then has been much less than expected. Both the Dublin Transport Authority and the Metropolitan Streets Commission were abolished only weeks after Fine Gael left office in 1987, they having been part and parcel of Fine Gael's plan to transform Dublin. Fianna Fáil, and later the Progressive Democrats, not alone abolished these co-ordinating agencies but, in creating three local authorities where there had been one, have further splintered the administration and planning of Dublin, the reverse of what is required.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's plans for Dublin are quite different. We propose to establish one greater Dublin authority or corporation which will elect members and be presided over by the Lord Mayor. Among other things they would be responsible, first, for all traffic matters and public transport planning; second, crime prevention in liaison with the Garda and local communities; third, overall planning; fourth, all second-level education and, finally, the development of our tourist industry and economy generally.</P>
    <P>On the initiative of Fine Gael the Dublin city development plan now contains an objective that its inner city population be doubled within the next ten years, increasing the population from 71,000 to 150,000, still less than it was 25 years ago. This goal will require the provision, on average, of an additional 2,250 dwellings per annum between the canals. This would be a prime task of our proposed greater Dublin corporation who would also discourage all further development on the outskirts of the city, thereby preventing further sprawl.</P>
    <P>Our proposals for the re-population of the inner city take full account of the need for social mix. Between the canals I envisage the creation or re-creation of some high class residential squares and <Col N="1943" /> streets as well as a full price range of housing at which Government tax incentives would be targeted in order to achieve that objective. None of this will occur unless existing run-down flat complexes and housing estates are properly refurbished and, thereafter, properly managed. To this end Fine Gael propose an inner city refurbishment programme costing £10 million per annum over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling, while considering the state of our city, that no building of note or elegance has been built in Dublin since Independence. It was in the days of British rule that buildings such as the Custom House, the Bank of Ireland, the Four Courts, the GPO, King's Inns and Trinity College were built. There have been some notable restorations in recent years, such as the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Dublin Castle and Government Buildings. However, more than mere restoration is now called for. For example, the Dublin civic offices and the Central Bank building cannot remain as the only architectural commentary of this era. We owe it to past and future generations to plan and provide new buildings of note and elegance so that each generation can leave an impressive mark on the architectural heritage of this city. For example, in France, noted for the elegance of their cities, they call such urban renewal ideas <i>grand objectifs.</i> Dublin needs to set and plan some grand objectives of its own. This constitutes not alone our duty to posterity but is the key to restoring the city's elegance, life and verve.</P>
    <P>One of the main detractors from the quality of life in our inner city is its crime problem. I do not propose to comment on this at any great length, since our shadow Minister for Justice, Deputy Shatter will follow me. Suffice it to say that, so far as the citizens of this city and county are concerned, they feel officialdom has failed them in relation to crime and-or its prevention. They feel there is a great deal of complacency on the part of the Government, perhaps even a great lack of understanding in our courts of <Col N="1944" /> the extent to which their lives have been upset by crime and vandalism. The vast majority of people are reasonable &mdash; they do not want hairshirt or reactionary measures &mdash; but they do want effective laws and effective law enforcement. No contributor to a motion in relation to the renewal of life in Dublin, or to the renewal of Dublin city, can avoid commenting or dwelling on the overall questions of its attendant crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>Another matter that detracts from the quality of city life is traffic &mdash; a major problem in this city and county. As chairman of the city's traffic subcommittee I heard a submission on the part of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to the effect that, more than taxes or any other economic consideration, what most troubles their members in Dublin is traffic congestion and delays. I was not surprised to hear this because there is nobody in charge of traffic in Dublin. There are the Departments of the Environment, Tourism, Transport and Communications and Justice, Dublin Corporation and, henceforth, three local authorities but no person in charge of traffic overall. The Garda Commissioner is in charge of traffic law enforcement, he is the traffic authority, with the local authorities responsible for the building of roads. Fine Gael propose, as part of a new greater Dublin corporation, the reinstatement of the Dublin Transport Authority unwisely abolished by the present Government on their election in 1987. Fine Gael propose that that authority have all the necessary powers in relation to traffic management and control, expenditure, enforcement, in addition to a key role in the planning of public transport facilities.</P>
    <P>I am sorry we do not have time for a longer debate on this issue which is very important not just to Dublin city and county but to all Irish men and women. All citizens want to be proud of their capital city. I hope this debate will spark off some new thinking and, more importantly, some new action which will help restore to this city not only the environment but also the culture, wit and quality <Col N="1945" /> of life of the decades and centuries gone by.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a nationwide rise in crime. Last year there was an 8 per cent increase in crime and it is estimated by the Garda that there will also be an increase of 8 per cent this year. The Dublin crime rate is treble that of the rest of the country. There is a continuing growth in crime throughout Dublin. A number of recent horrific incidents illustrate the problems with which we are confronted. For example, on Sunday evening last in Inchicore a 22 year old man was attacked by two men who slashed him across the chest and arms with a carving knife. They then poured petrol over him and threatened to set him on fire unless he handed over his money. The man, who lives locally, handed over his wallet containing £80. This barbaric and horrific attack illustrates the level to which crime has sunk in our capital city.</P>
      <P>In Dublin there are approximately 1,400 burglaries every month, that is 50 for every day of the year; 1,000 cars are broken into every month, that is, 32 cars a day and approximately 700 cars are taken every month for so-called joyriding, that is 23 cars every day.</P>
      <P>We have within our communities too many victims of burglaries, robberies, muggings and assaults. There are streets within the city and county in which people are afraid to walk on their own at night for fear of attack. In some parts of Dublin elderly people living alone are fearful of answering their doors, not only at night time but during the day also. Both the young and the elderly are frequently harassed and intimidated by gangs of youths using abusive language and who are under the influence of alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have too much talk from the Government about the problem and too little action. We are told that the Minister for Justice has been taking public relations advice from Terry Prone on how to handle the media and portray a caring <Col N="1946" /> image. We say to the Minister for Justice that he should stop the public relations gimmickry and get on with the job &mdash; less Prone talk and more action is what is required.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael want a crime action plan to be implemented. The crime wave in Dublin must be urgently tackled not only for the sake of all of those who live in Dublin and visit Dublin, but also to safeguard our tourist industry. A crime action plan should contain a large number of measures, including the following: a substantial increase in community policing; the enactment of new laws making it an offence to intimidate and harass other persons or to behave in a manner that is threatening or abusive or which causes fear; the enactment of new laws to confiscate the proceeds of crime and to update financial penalties that can be imposed; the holding of a Constitutional referendum to extend power to the courts to refuse bail in circumstances where a court is satisfied that there is a substantial risk that if a person awaiting trial were to be released on bail further offences would be committed; increased use of community service orders; further expansion of the juvenile liaison scheme; the establishment of a drugs action force to counteract the growing problem in Dublin of drugs being made available to children in schools and clubs and to remove from our streets the evil purveyors of drugs; the enactment of a new juvenile justice Bill to replace the outdated Children's Act of 1908; an end to overcrowding in prisons and the provision of additional custodial accommodation for both adults and juveniles and the immediate bringing into force of the Criminal Law (Forensic Evidence) Act passed by the Dáil in 1990 so that the Garda can use the technique of genetic fingerprinting to identify the perpetrators of crimes of violence, rape and sexual assault.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to implement the 1990 Act is tantamount to criminal neglect. It is reasonable to <Col N="1947" /> speculate that if this act had been in force last summer when the horrific murder of a German tourist took place in the Phoenix Park, the technique of genetic fingerprinting could have been used to successfully identify all of those guilty of this murder. In such circumstances, different verdicts from the verdicts brought in by the court in recent days might have been secured.</P>
    <P>The current overcrowding in our prisons ensures that where a sentence of imprisonment is carried out, it provides a training in crime and adds to community alienation instead of providing a real deterrent and a mechanism for reintegrating prisoners into our society when they have finished their terms of imprisonment. The overcrowding has also resulted in many adults and juveniles not fully serving sentences of imprisonment and detention and being released into the community believing themselves immune from legal sanction if they continue a life of crime. The so-called revolving-door syndrome is undermining the morale of the Garda who find that too many of those they arrest and bring before the courts are released unsupervised back into the community because there is nowhere to send them. Many of those who are released feel free to commit further crimes and regard themselves as virtually immune from the law.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin are entitled to feel safe on their own streets at night and to feel that their children can freely play within their housing estates without being intimidated and attacked. Elderly people are entitled to feel safe in their homes at night. At present far too many do not.</P>
    <P>This is a complacent Government, content to engage in public relations exercises while doing nothing meaningful to tackle the growth of crime in Dublin. The Garda are aware of the problem. They suffer a deep frustration. The Government's failure to provide the Garda with the resources and manpower they require and with a modern code of criminal law <Col N="1948" /> means that the Garda have to fight against crime with one arm tied behind their backs. The Government's failure to provide necessary custodial places and detention centres is seriously undermining Garda morale, as it is widely known that even if persons guilty of offences are caught and sentenced they are unlikely to serve their full sentences. Far too often what appears to be a Garda success is undermined by a failure of political commitment.</P>
    <P>Seven years ago the Law Reform Commission published comprehensive recommendations for a new Dublin Police Act to reform the outdated legislation of 1842, which is still in force. Nothing has been done to implement the commission's recommendations. The Garda have to resort to using this grossly defective and outdated legislation far too frequently. It contains some interesting provisions.</P>
    <P>What relevance to the problems of Dublin has an Act which requires &ldquo;drivers of carriages and riders of horses to keep to the left when passing oncoming traffic&rdquo;? What relevance to the problems of Dublin has an Act which makes it an offence for a person to burn, dress or cleanse any cask or tub on the street? What relevance to the problems of Dublin has an Act which makes it an offence &ldquo;to empty any privy between the hours of 6 o'clock in the morning and 12 at night&rdquo;? What relevance to the problems of Dublin is a law which prohibits &ldquo;the beating or shaking in any thoroughfare of any carpet, rug or mat (except door mats) before the hour of 8 o'clock in the morning&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Finally, it must be asked, what relevance to the problems of Dublin is an Act which makes it an offence to &ldquo;keep any pig sty to the front of any street or road in any town within the Dublin Metropolitan District&rdquo;? This Act was originally designed to give specific powers to the police, now the Garda, to address the problems of crime in Dublin. It is crying out for reform. The people of <Col N="1949" /> Dublin are crying out for reform and action. Perhaps the rural roots of the seanachaí of Castlebar, the present Minister for Justice has a deep affection for some of these provisions which are acting as an obstacle to reforming the Dublin Police Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years the greater Dublin area was regarded as the most prosperous in Ireland. During the four decades after Independence it faired particularly well in the area of manufacturing and service-type industries. However, its dominant position was seriously eroded during the past two decades. During the eighties the net job losses in Dublin accelerated and indigenous industries recorded a loss of 17,000 jobs while foreign owned industries lost 5,000 jobs. Since our entry to the EC in 1973 Irish and foreign owned industries in the Dublin area have lost over 25,000 jobs. The increasing competitive environment in the EC and the changing demand for older, industrial products placed traditional firms in a difficult position, with many of them contracting out some of their activities, or closing down. The most significant losses occurred in the food, drink, tobacco, textile and clothing industries. Almost every sector of indigenous industry was adversely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin's legacy of a high proportion of such traditional declining industries represents a distinctive disadvantage. At the same time many new emerging firms have tended to locate away from the east coast due to incentives to do so. These incentives have been offered by succesive Governments. This movement has resulted in a high proportion of growing industries locating outside the Dublin area. This was based on Government policy and on the premise that Dublin could look after itself. Unfortunately, this is no longer true, with 29 per cent of the population Dublin has 31 per cent of <Col N="1950" /> the national labour force and has 33 per cent of national unemployment.</P>
    <P>A unique concentration of the nation's problems in its capital city brings with it a depressing effect, both socially and commercially. More than 18 per cent of the available labour force are unemployed. On top of that more than 40,000 who would otherwise be part of the labour force have emigrated from the capital since 1981. The problem is so severe that a five to seven year prospectus is needed to create a reasonable prospect of dealing with it. By 1996 the labour force will have grown by 60,000. If no new jobs are created the total unemployment in Dublin will be well over 108,000.</P>
    <P>It would be most unrealistic at this stage to contemplate zero unemployment by the year 1996. A very challenging target would be the creation of 53,000 jobs, thus leaving 11 per cent of the labour force unemployed as against the present 18 per cent. Since 1985 only 3,000 net new jobs were created in the capital, or 750 a year. To achieve the target which I have set out of 53,000 net new jobs by 1996 the job creation rate would have to be stepped up from 750 a year to about 7,500 a year.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the Fine Gael Document, The Jobs Economy, one of the quickest ways of providing jobs in a capital city such as Dublin is in the service industries, the tourist industry being the principal one. Tourism must be vigorously promoted making use of Dublin's all-year-round attractions. Above all, we need a national convention centre to handle international conventions of over 2,000 people. This would have a galvanising effect on tourism development.</P>
    <P>Birmingham has had such an investment. Like other cities which fought their way back to economic growth through tourism it is finding that the convention centre is its core investment. It has 22 hotels and an airport, with retail development totalling £2.5 million of new investment. <Col N="1951" /> Tourism-related jobs in Birmingham have increased from 10,000 in 1975 to 70,000 in 1985 and 90,000 in 1990. The conference centre is expected to lead to the creation of 12,000 to 15,000 jobs in the next two years. Before the initiative for a convention centre was taken at Birmingham the city was a drab, run-down city, but today it is commercially alive and very attractive to tourists. Dublin, if it had a convention centre, would have a better starting point than Birmingham. It is something that I have asked for and promoted for many years. Indeed, the previous Taoiseach was aware of the value of a convention centre for Dublin and set up an inter-departmental committee to examine the feasibility of establishing a convention centre at the rear of the old UCD building in Earlsfort Terrace. Perhaps the Minister for the Environment would state what progress that inter-departmental committee have made in relation to a convention centre for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I now wish to say a few words about the conservation and preservation of our city. Much has been written in recent times about the disintegration of our capital city, but few solutions have been found to arrest the problem. The architectural character of Dublin is essentially constituted by three elements. First, there are a number of buildings of international architectural importance. Second, there are extensive areas of Georgian architecture, north and south of the river Liffey, complemented by open-spaced and wide street layouts. Third, in suburban areas there are extensive residential areas of mainly Victorian character. Each of these categories which constitutes the essential character of Dublin that has suffered through neglect over the past decades, but of all of these the most seriously affected area is the north Georgian city.</P>
    <P>The north Georgian city is confronted by two serious and related problems. The first is a visible physical one relating to <Col N="1952" /> the deterioration of the physical fabric through age and neglect. The second problem is an economic one which results from a historical lack of demand for space in these buildings, a deficiency which has contributed substantially to its physical decay. The reversal of this decay in a market-led urban economy is dependent on the creation of concessions which will permit or encourage the generation of demand sufficient to underwrite the continued maintenance and upkeep of historic buildings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned the Urban Renewal Act of 1986 which has encouraged a number of new developments in and around the Liffey quays, particularly in the vicinity of Christ Church Cathedral. However, the financial incentives available in designated areas are heavily biased towards new development, thus ignoring the declining stock of historic buildings. As we look at Dublin today one has to accept that Dublin Corporation, through their mechanism of the development plan and zoning and listing procedures, have failed to arrest the neglect and deterioration of buildings in the inner city. The conservation and preservation of Dublin is almost outside the scope of Dublin corporation unless they get substantial financial assistance from central Government. Legislation would also be required which would give greater powers to local authorities such as Dublin Corporation to prevent the neglect of buildings.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance could be made under two headings. The 1986 Urban Renewal Act incentives could provide a model. They are at least indicative of the Government's willingness to forgo taxation in the field of urban renewal. The scheme should be extended and a new package of incentives should be specially geared towards conservation as the overwhelming need is to secure the physical fabric of the city.</P>
    <P>The north Georgian city area needs special attention. An urban development authority modeled on the London Docklands <Col N="1953" /> Development Corporation, and the Custom House Docks Authority should be established. This authority should have special responsibility for the area, and special funding would cover the acquisition of derelict sites, the repair of buildings and the environmental and infrastructural works. In order to finance such an authority central Government would have to be prepared to grant £100 million over a period of ten years. This sum is not extraordinarily high in view of the fact that the Government have already spent over £60 million &mdash; money which was well spent &mdash; of taxpayers' money on refurbishment of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin Castle and Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>I raise these issues because conservation and preservation have two main beneficiaries, namely, tourism and employment. Tourists are attracted in growing numbers to medieval cities. Up to 1967 York was bypassed as a tourist centre, but due to its promotion as a medieval city it is now a major tourist attraction. The same applied to Edinburgh and, to a lesser extent, to Glasgow. Dublin will benefit in the same way as these cities have in the past if the necessary steps are taken to refurbish and preserve the city. If not, Dublin will have nothing to offer tourists in 20 years' time.</P>

      <P>At the outset I congratulate Deputy Mitchell for his foresight in putting this composite motion before the House. Because of the time restraints and as I am Fine Gael's spokesperson on crime prevention, I shall confine my remarks solely to the crime rate in Dublin, which is three times greater than in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During March and April 1992 I carried out a crime survey in my new Dáil constituency of Dublin North Central, a constituency which covers the North Strand, Ballybough, Croke Park, Fairview, Marino, Clontarf, Killester, Beaumont, Artane, Donnycarney and Coolock. We issued 25,000 questionnaires to constituents <Col N="1954" /> in a constituency which spans all levels of society. Fifty per cent of the people said that the neighbourhood watch scheme is not working properly. Fifty-six per cent said that a business watch scheme is necessary. Eighty four per cent of citizens say that there is not a visible presence of gardaí on the street, day and night. Eighty four per cent do not feel safe inside or outside their homes day or night. Eighty five per cent maintain that we should have a national crime prevention week. Eighty six per cent maintain that we should have more plain clothes crime prevention units in operation on our streets. Eighty seven per cent of the citizens of Dublin want a charter for the victims of crime. Eighty eight per cent of the people of this city want bail to be restricted for habitual criminals. Eighty eight per cent, almost nine out of ten people, want more detention centres for young offenders. Ninety-six per cent of our citizens in Dublin want assets that are acquired criminally to be confiscated. This comprenhensive sample of people, taken from all strata of society, confirms my deep felt belief that crime is endemic in this city and that successive Ministers for Justice of the present Government have shown a frightening lack of understanding of the serious problems we Dubliners face daily as we go about our business. It is unforgiveable.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the present Minister for Justice speaks in vague generalities and with a hyped up PR machine behind him. He must think that the people of this city are fools. I would remind him that we are not, and that we are entitled to feel safe. We have a constitutional right to be safe in our homes. The recent withdrawal of 50 uniformed gardaí from the streets of Dublin for Border protection duty is a slap in the face to the citizens of this city. This action is totally unacceptable. It is a charter for criminals and it will further undermine the confidence of the citizens of Dublin in the beleagured Garda force.</P>
    <P>Coming on the heels of that are charges <Col N="1955" /> of contempt by the Minister for Justice for the Garda Representative Association at their annual conference last month. In yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> the Garda Sergeants and Inspectors Association described the Minister's appearance in Wexford and his address to the conference as being unsatisfactory and the association have called for a special debate at their next meeting on the Minister's address. That is unheard of in the history of this State. The sum total of all the Minister's actions is a body blow to the morale of our grossly understaffed Garda force, as is the Minister's pathetic attempt to pick up a few brownie points for himself by promising a determined co-ordinated onslaught on white-collar crime while denuding the streets of Dublin of gardaí. To make the citizens of this city feel safe, I call on the Minister for Justice and the Government to provide immediately for a more visible presence of gardaí on the streets of Dublin, day and night, for assets acquired criminally to be confiscated, for more detention centres for young offenders, for bail to be restricted for habitual offenders and for more plain clothes Garda crime prevention units to be introduced on a permanent basis, especially with the tourist season coming.</P>
    <P>I also urge the Minister to have another look at the neighbourhood watch scheme and to streamline it in view of the results of the survey which showed that 50 per cent of the population of Dublin North Central do not think it works properly. I also call for the introduction of an annual national crime prevention week and I call on the Minister to encourage the business watch scheme to be embraced more widely by the business community.</P>

      <P>I have read this motion a number of times to try to make out what it means. It talks of the establishment of a &ldquo;Single Greater Dublin Authority&rdquo; and also about developing a &ldquo;second tier of <Col N="1956" /> Government&rdquo;, presumably below the authority. What seems to be envisaged is one giant authority with numerous off-shoots. What is to be the size of this giant which, under the terms of the motion, is to have executive powers and to relate to &ldquo;the whole Dublin area&rdquo;? From its very name, it seems that it would be greater than Dublin, but how much greater? Would the Greater Dublin authority include parts of Wicklow, or Kildare, or Meath? Are some of these to be annexed to Dublin? Unfortunately, hastily conceived and ill-thought out proposals find no need to address such basic questions. This is a refuelled Fine Gael juggernaut careeing downhill with no steering wheel, no brakes and no goods, but with plenty of easy options.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael produced a document in 1990 which advocated 16 lower level bodies in Dublin. Are we to take it, therefore, that what is now proposed is a Greater Dublin Authority with 16 new second tier authorities? Up to now Fine Gael have supported the establishment of three new county councils in Dublin, in place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the existing county council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. I presume they still do. What of Dublin Corporation? Is it to be abolished or to remain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless we wipe out the corporation and the county council, what would now appear to be on offer is a Greater Dublin authority of indeterminate size, a Dublin City authority, the three new County Councils and a whole family of 16 entirely new local authorities. It is fairly evident that not much thought or serious consideration has been given to the question of local government in Dublin by the proposers of this motion. Of course, like the proposers of the motion, we can all agree that crime is bad; that unemployment is far too high; that education, housing and transport should be <Col N="1957" /> improved &mdash; but we are taking concrete steps to tackle these matters. On this side, we do not believe in jotting down the first ideas that come to mind and presenting them as a solution to real problems.</P>
    <P>Let me take a brief look at the recent background to local government reorganisation in Dublin. In 1985, the Fine Gael-Labour Government proposed to establish three new county councils in place of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. What was done? Lines were drawn on a map and what were called &ldquo;electoral counties&rdquo; were conjured up. What practical result has been achieved by 1987 when that Government went out of office? Nothing, beyond lines on a map, and an increase in the membership of Dublin County Council from 36 to 78, which made the operation of the council unwieldy. The existing county council continued to operate with 78 members and the promised three new county councils were not established.</P>
    <P>In 1989, we proposed the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas committee to look at the question of local government funding, functions and structures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael refused to participate &mdash; not a very good indicator or a real commitment to the local government system. In more recent times we have again seen a refusal to participate in an all-party committee focused on the economic and social well-being of this country by the same party which regularly advocates a far more developed parliamentary committee system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced with the refusal of Fine Gael to participate in an all-party committee on local government reform, the Government determined to press ahead with developing reform proposals through alternative mechanisms. An advisory expert committee was appointed and completed their report at the end of 1990. <Col N="1958" /> In March 1991 proposals for the reform of local government were published by Government. For the Dublin area, the three county councils and existing city structure proposed by the advisory expert committee was accepted, and the Local Government Act, 1991, allowed the 1991 local elections to be held on this basis.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1991 Act, dealing with reorganisation in Dublin, are entirely different from what was attempted in 1985. The 1991 Act has put in motion a process leading towards the establishment of the three new county councils. It sets out a framework within which the preparations for, and the transition towards their establishment can take place. This involved the establishment of three area committes by Dublin County Council, the appointment of three area managers and the preparation of a reorganisation report jointly by the area managers in consultation with their area committees and the Dublin City and County Manager.</P>
    <P>What has happened? The reorganisation process is well under way. Pursuant to the Act, a special competition was held by the Local Appointments Commission and three area managers were recruited and took up office last September. Also in accordance with the Act, three area committees Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown were established in February this year by Dublin County Council and are operating with delegated functions. These are the forerunners of the new county councils.</P>
    <P>The next important step is for the three area managers, in consultation with the area committees to prepare the reorganisation report and this work is in hands. Under the Act, this report will outline the detailed arrangements necessary for the creation of three new administrative counties, the establishment of new county councils in place of the area committees and the abolition of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. The report must deal with the various relevant matters including the <Col N="1959" /> allocation of assets and liabilities; property; staff; financial transfers etc. and the question of the co-ordination and joint provision of services between the three new counties and the city.</P>
    <P>The many issues which arise will be considered in the light of the proposals in the reorganisation report. In this way, the 1991 Act leaves it to the local authorities in the first instance to develop proposals for detailed working arrangements. As a firm believer in local democracy, I consider this is the first correct approach &mdash; and it is the only practical approach in a complex matter like this. The report will provide a full analysis of the situation and until I receive and study it, I will not rule out any particular arrangement for co-ordination or for any other purpose. It may be that special measures will be required in relation to certain aspects of local authority operations in Dublin to ensure essential co-ordination. I have an open mind on this at this stage. But I will not rush forward headlong with ill-thought-out ideas, with no regard to need, cost, performance or viability. I will address the issues in the light of a proper analysis, be it in relation to the operation of the new local authorities in Dublin or as regards transportation in Dublin and surrounding areas to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>I have gone into some detail to explain the whole Dublin reorganisation process which has been put in place. It is complicated because complex matters are involved. But action is under way, properly throught out and planned. That is the general approach of this Government. The top-of-the-head approach adopted in 1985 meant that nothing happened.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the establishment of regional authorities as recommended by the advisory expert committee will be finalised very shortly. These will address the need to place Dublin within a proper regional framework for strategic planning and for the co-ordination of public <Col N="1960" /> services. The Government fully recognise the importance of this kind of co-ordination but we do not propose to approach the question in a heavyhanded, top down bureaucratic sort of way. That is, I fear, what would result from the creation of the sort of super-authority advocated in this motion.</P>
    <P>Instead, we are addressing the need for co-ordination through a system which will be both flexible and comprehensive and which will not only be effective but also democratic. Above all, we are determined to achieve a proper balance between the need to maximise operational efficiency while ensuring that the democratic representational quality of local government is enhanced to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I believe that the role of the regional authority could be of particular value in the Dublin area. Because of its broadly-based co-ordinating role, the regional authority would be in a position to achieve results without conflict. It would not lead to the confusion as to the roles of existing authorities which would be an inevitable result of the sort of Greater Dublin authority which is proposed in this motion. The regional authority could play an especially important role in bringing together the various local authorities so as to provide a forum in which the necessary level of broad strategic co-ordination could be achieved and to provide the necessary backdrop against which the plans and services of the individual authorities could be better developed.</P>

      <P>To move now from the question of local government reform, I will outline some of the practical and realistic steps being taken by this Government to come to grips with issues referred to in the motion. It goes without saying, of course, that I reject the exaggeration, embellishment and overstatement in the language of the motion generally, but <Col N="1961" /> time does not permit me to deal separately with each issue.</P>
      <P>The problem of urban decline is being tackled with imagination and vigour in Dublin and I am delighted that the debate on this motion affords me the opportunity to put some of the facts on the record. The urban renewal scheme, in recent years, is generating a self-sustaining and dynamic process of renewal in areas that previously appeared to be devoid of any development potential. It is directly responsible in Dublin alone for projects with an estimated value in excess of £100 million which have either been completed or are in progress, with a further £165 million worth of schemes in planning. This is in addition to the Custom House Docks development valued at some £400 million.</P>
      <P>The success of the scheme in Dublin has been nothing short of spectacular. For example, between 1975 and 1986 Dublin Corporation did not receive one planning application for development or redevelopment along the quays. This has all changed now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy to acknowledge that it was the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition who put that Act on the Statute book, but it took the confidence generated by the next Government in 1987 for the public and the business community to acknowledge the incentives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To claim that the inner city areas of the city continue to be &ldquo;depopulated&rdquo; is to ignore the new private residential developments taking place in designated areas along the quays, in High Street, in Parliament Street, and in Bolton Street, with further developments planned for Ellis Quay, Gardiner Street and Patrick Street, to name but a few. Such has been the demand for good quality housing in central locations that the spin-off into adjacent non-designated areas is proof that people's perception about living in the city has changed. Dublin city is once again becoming a vibrant living city in which people not only work but also live and spend their leisure time.</P>
      <P>The inner city is, of course, the location for many of the old schemes of local authority houses and flats, some of which were in need of major refurbishment and renewal which could not be financed in the ordinary way by the corporation. To meet this need, over £25 million in grants has been allocated to the corporation since 1987, with the annual figure increasing from £1.25 million in 1987, with the annual figure increasing from £1.25 million in 1987 to £6.3 million this year. The eight estates to which the local authority attach the highest priority have been designated for funding under the remedial works scheme and the results being achieved are quite dramatic. Under the new bathrooms sub-programme, an additional £1.55 million has been allocated to the corporation in 1991 and 1992 to allow these basic facilities to be installed in some 400 dwellings. All of this expenditure is contributing in no small way to the maintenance of stable communities, in comfortable living conditions, in the inner city. We intend to continue to go down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The renewal and development of the Temple Bar area is set to become one of the most significant developments in Dublin in many years. The objective is to build on what has been taking place spontaneously in the area and to create <Col N="1963" /> a living, bustling cultural and tourist quarter which will attract a significant number of visitors with a variety of restaurants, speciality shops, galleries and theatres. It is also the objective of the Government to promote the provision of significant residential accommodation for students and others who wish to live in the Temple bar area.</P>
    <P>The largest and most ambitious single development project being undertaken in the city is, of course, the Custom House Docks development. This development, housing the International Financial Services Centre, is now becoming a reality and is tangible proof that with commitment and co-operation this Government are succeeding in promoting the transformation of formerly obsolete blotches on our cityscape.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme is, of course, based on private sector investment which is being attracted to the designated areas by the generous taxation and other incentives which are available. The Government have been contributing directly in various other ways to the improvement of the amenities of the city and to the preservation of its cultural and architectural heritage. Examples of major projects completed in recent years include the restoration of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham where a thriving museum of modern art has now been established, the restoration of the Custom House, the refurbishment of Government buildings, the works carried out at the Casino in Marino and at the Memorial Garden in Islandbridge, the ongoing improvement and restoration works at the Phoenix Park, and many others. All of these projects enhance the amenity and environment of Dublin, both for its own citizens and for visitors.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal must, of course, be complemented by effective action by local authorities against dereliction and that is why a considerably enhanced framework for such action was established under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990. <Col N="1964" /> An important feature of this legislation is that local authorities are now empowered to take action against threatened as well as actual dereliction. The Act also provided for the imposition of a levy on certain derelict sites in urban areas and this is showing itself to be a very real deterrent to leaving property in a derelict state.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some interesting names on that list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>All the indications are that the Act is operating effectively and that the Dublin authorities are making active use of its provisions in their efforts to combat dereliction. In fact, 103 sites have been entered in the derelict sites registers in Dublin, with 23 subsequently being removed as remedial works were carried out to render them non-derelict. I will continue to urge the Dublin authorities to use the derelict sites legislation in harmony with the provisions of the urban renewal scheme to ensure the attainment of the greatest possible improvement in the condition of the urban environment.</P>
      <P>The motion under discussion speaks of a high crime rate in Dublin. Crime is an inescapable aspect of today's modern society, particularly in large urban centres. Indeed, the experience in this regard in many western countries, which are much better placed than Ireland in terms of resources, is far worse than ours. Tackling the crime problem is one of the Government's priorities. This is being given effect through vitally important measures such as neighbourhood watch, the development of Garda community policing arrangements, the Garda schools programme, the juvenile liaison by the Garda on practical measures to deal with crime problems experienced in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is clear that crime cannot be dealt with by law enforcement alone &mdash; the problem requires a multi-disciplinary approach which takes into <Col N="1965" /> account the underlying problems of particular urban areaa. An inter-departmental group on urban crime has been engaged in an examination of the situation in urban areas that are particularly hard hit by criminal activity and its first report is expected shortly by the Minister for Justice. This will provide a basis for action by the various agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>The motion also speaks of transport and roads policy which is another of the areas where this Government are taking practical measures to effect real improvements. Over the past five years, we have spent approximately £130 million on major road improvement schemes around the periphery of Dublin, designed to improve traffic flow and to eliminate heavy commercial traffic from residential and other areas. Examples of these include the Shankill by-pass, the Western Parkway, the Blanchardstown by-pass and the Chapelizod by-pass. We are committed to further heavy expenditure on other major schemes of a similar nature over the coming years, particularly in completing the northern and southern sections of the ring road.</P>
    <P>We are now adopting a new and radical approach to dealing with Dublin's wider transportation problems. Last year, a baseline study was undertaken which reviewed previous transportation studies, assessed the transportation situation since 1971, and carried out a programme of public consultation &mdash; all of which provided an input to the recommended terms of reference for Phase II of the study. This phase has now begun and is known as the Dublin Transportation Initiative. I attach particular importance to the fact that this is an integrated initiative. It deals with all transport modes &mdash; walking, cycling, road, rail and bus &mdash; and also looks at how we can make optimum use of our existing transport infrastructure and facilities in Dublin. It is also integrated in the sense that it looks at the interaction between transportation and other policies, such as land use, <Col N="1966" /> economic development and the environment.</P>
    <P>I also want to emphasise that DTI is adopting an open approach involving a two-way consultative process with the general public, institutions and interest groups. It seeks to establish a &ldquo;vision of Dublin&rdquo;&mdash; a consensus view of the type of city in which people wish to live, work and enjoy their leisure time and aims to develop a transport strategy and programme which will build on that vision. There is significant public consultation, not only the usual discussions with institutions and interest groups, but market research and community meetings to establish the views of the wider general public. There is also an emphasis on public participation at an early stage, while all options are still genuinely open, and again at a later stage as strategies and plans are developed and refined.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the wholehearted support of all parties in this House for this bold new initiative, which will, in my view, provide the basis for giving Dublin a transportation system suitable to its status as a major European capital city and which addresses the real needs of the people who live and work in the metropolitan area. More importantly, it will provide a strategy in which Dubliners will have a very real sense of ownership, since it will have been developed with their full and effective participation.</P>
    <P>An interim report from the initiative is expected in September and a final report is planned for April 1993. This is a tight timetable for such a major body of work, but, that said, it does not mean that nothing will happen in the short term to alleviate Dublin's transport problems. A number of steps have already been taken. A computerised traffic control system has been installed in part of the city centre, with financial support to Dublin Corporation from my Department. Known as SCATS, it adjusts to real traffic conditions rather than to pre-programmed historical traffic patterns. The Garda have increased their enforcement of road <Col N="1967" /> traffic law, most notably by the use of new tow trucks which have been very effective in tackling illegal parking.</P>
    <P>I have notified Dublin Corporation of my approval of their proposals for the spending of £3 million of accumulated capital receipts from parking charges. This money will be used to fund the following measures: the implementation of a further phase of the SCATS programme; the introduction of traffic calming measures in both the cabra and Crumlin areas; the provision of cycle facilities and the carrying out of a series of minor road improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures will have a positive impact on the safety and convenience of road users and will benefit the environment in the city. The extension of the SCATS programme will have a significant positive impact on traffic flows while the introduction of traffic calming measures in both the Cabra and areas, will reduce unnecessary traffic intrusion and should result in a much safer local environment, especially for children.</P>
    <P>I have asked Dublin Corporation to consider earmarking future parking fees income to provide on-street or off-street parking facilities for both heavy goods vehicles, buses and coaches. This would help solve two problems &mdash; the intrusion caused by the parking of heavy goods vehicles in residential areas and the adverse impact on traffic flows and on amenity generally of bus and coach parking in busy city centre streets.</P>
    <P>The House has had the opportunity in the last six months, in dealing with my Department's extensive legislative programme, to debate issues relating to roads, planning, the environment and, most recently, housing in the Dublin area. With the pressure of time, I refrain therefore from covering again ground that has been well-trodden during these debates. But I am entitled to point to the scale and depth of that legislative programme as evidence of our commitment <Col N="1968" /> to working on a broad front to improve the living and working environment in Dublin, as in other areas, and to equipping our local authorities and other public authorities with the powers they need to respond to the problems of the day.</P>
    <P>All of what I have been speaking of relates to action: action to ensure adequate analysis, to formulate appropriate proposals and to implement them. That is the general thrust of this Government's policies and actions, not to promulgate panaceas for all our ills on half a page but to face difficult issues and to produce and implement practical measures to address them. It is on this basis that our programme of local government reform is proceeding. In this way it will succeed. The needs of the Dublin area are being addressed on the basis of a coherent strategy in the local government context: by realistic practical measures in the case of dereliction, urban renewal, transport and crime prevention. Dublin's needs will not be met by what seems to be another of Fine Gael's instant plans for all seasons but by action on the basis of a well-founded programme of realistic measures which can and will be implemented.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should say there are other major problems with regard to the concept of major bureaucratic institution being seen as the be all and end all of solving Dublin's problems. I am not here tonight to say we do not still have on our desk major tasks and major problems to overcome. I do not stand here tonight to say I have all the answers. I would have very much liked, in the context of a motion such as this, that Fine Gael would have addressed the real issues, would have dealt with the question of financial resources and not the rather loose mention of proposals and strategies which do not have a coherent plan for financial resource management and for the development of this city as a whole.</P>
    <P>If the concept of a greater Dublin is <Col N="1969" /> the answer to all these problems then the logical result is that we should have one Department to serve the whole of Ireland. All the emphasis in modern thinking has been to devolve authority, to release new energies on the ground in local democracy and local participation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister was talking in the latter unscripted section of his speech about the need for groups of experts to advance the needs of Dublin. I would like to remind him of that well known group of experts, namely the Dublin county council from his own party who, over the last decade or so, carried out a rezoning programme throughout County Dublin with tremendous skill where it was not required and set about making very substantial profits for backers of the Fianna Fáil Party and, let me say, with the aid and assistance of some &mdash; though not all &mdash; Fine Gael councillors on those same councils over the last decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The depredations of those experts and that expertise have wrecked havoc with the development of Dublin county and left an unfortunate legacy. There has been some turnabout in the Fianna Fáil group of experts in recent times but they are not totally converted as yet. The Minister ought to take a look at the record over the years and see the relentless, consistent motions proposed to rezone greenland areas &mdash; doing away with green space &mdash; and even amenity lands. Everything was fair game to those notorious rezoners. As a wag put it, <Col N="1971" /> they would have rezoned their own grandmother's back bedroom if there was money in it for some of the party's backers. That has been the sad saga over many years until now.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party welcome this motion as a timely opportunity to debate the problems and needs of the capital city of Ireland and of County Dublin. At the conclusion of the debate we will be supporting this motion. I would, however, make one general point of criticism of the motion in that it makes no reference whatsoever to the resources that are necessary if any of the fine aspirations contained in the motion are to be realised. To that extent the motion is unreal. We have to begin by facing the reality that Dublin cannot be revitalised to the extent necessary without a detailed consideration of resources. It ill becomes the Minister to make that point because he represents the Government and it is their responsibility to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to carry out essential improvements to the infrastructure in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate the position that we should simply throw money at the problems but it is impossible to build houses without money, to address educational inequality without money and impossible to create viable, sustainable jobs without investment. The Minister made the point that much high quality housing has been provided through section 23 and section 29 schemes and so on, and there is an element of truth in that. The crying need in this city and county of Dublin is not so much for high priced housing, which was never a problem and could always be obtained, but for dealing with those local authority housing lists which are getting longer by the day and causing such misery and such problems for so many of the Dublin families and so many of the young people.</P>
    <P>However, we should enter this debate and recognise that Dublin is and remains a great European city, a proud place in <Col N="1972" /> which to live and a good place in which to raise a family. With all its problems Dublin is a community that is capable of fighting back and of retaining the pride and spirit of a great community.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is undeniable that Dublin needs to be revitalised. Quality public services, quality public transport and a living inner city are essential if Dublin is to work. In the Labour Party we want to see an end to the division of Dublin by class and income. We want to see a Dublin where public amenity transcends private gain.</P>
    <P>In the local elections last year the Labour Party outlined a detailed strategy for Dublin.</P>

      <P>I have been endeavouring for a number of weeks to raise the question of granting recognition to the Baile an Lochaigh portion of Coláiste Pheig Sayers in Ballyferriter. It would have been coincidental had it been allowed last week because the Minister, in his wisdom, saw fit to recognise the college on a temporary basis last Thursday or Friday as a result of which there were great celebrations down in Ballyferriter which included bonfires, dances, craic agus féastaí of all kinds until the early hours of the morning. It would have been a major achievement for me if this had been on last week because no doubt the people would have said it was because of my motion on the Adjournment that this came about.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it gives me the opportunity to thank the Minister for allowing temporary recognition of the Baile an Lochaigh portion of Coláiste Pheig Sayers. I think it was a wise decision. I hope the Minister will see fit to grant full recognition to this college next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This college was built on the promise of <Col N="1973" /> a previous Minister. The people involved expended a large amount of their own money on the building. They went ahead in good faith only to be told later that no such promise was ever made. I am glad the present Minister has seen fit to recognise the college. The school will be a major boost to the local economy because the large number of students who will travel to the area will stay with local families and that is welcomed by these people. It will also facilitate the students who have to travel a long distance from the Baile an Lochaigh area to Ballyferriter. Now these young people will be facilitated in Baile an Lochaigh.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention here that the management of Coláiste Pheig Sayers in Ballyferriter and now in Baile an Lochaigh must be complimented on their initiative. Recently I visited Dún Chaoin and I was delighted to see these very same people restoring the house of Peig Sayers, the very house she first occupied when she came off the Great Blasket Island. I was most impressed by this initiative. The house will be restored and furnished as it was in Peig Sayers's time. These people are making a major contribution to the local economy and to the Irish language. In the end it is the Irish language, the students who visit Baile an Lochaigh and Ballyferriter and the people of the area who will be the winners.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and ask him to monitor and evaluate the progress of this college over the summer and, if possible, grant it full recognition in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Deputy has raised this matter as it affords me an opportunity to clarify the position in relation both to this particular case and to the general policy in relation to the granting of recognition to Irish language summer colleges by my Department for the purposes of receiving grants in respect of courses provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, let me say that after careful <Col N="1974" /> reconsideration of the application made by Coláiste Pheig Sayers, I have agreed to grant temporary recognition to the classes which will be held in Baile an Lochaigh this summer, subject to a number of conditions; these conditions include a specific requirement that the operation of classes in Baile an Lochaigh will not interfere in any way with any other Irish language summer college in the area, and also that my Department's regulations governing the scheme under which grants are paid to Irish language summer colleges will be fully complied with in all respects. The college authorities have been advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>In administering the scheme under which grants are paid in respect of recognised Irish language courses, especially in relation to the establishment of new summer colleges or the extension of existing summer colleges into new areas, my Department must take account of the position of Irish summer colleges already operating in those areas. It would not be in the interests of the colleges, or of the people of the Gaeltacht areas in which they operate, many of whom derive great economic benefit from the operation of the colleges, if my Department did not seek to regulate the development of the scheme. For this reason, it is the policy of my Department that recognition will not be given to the establishment of new Irish language summer colleges in cases where it is considered that there is already adequate provision.</P>
    <P>In the case of the initial application from the authorities of Coláiste Pheig Sayers to establish a new Irish summer college in Baile an Lochaigh, it was considered that the area in question was adequately served by Irish colleges already, and in accordance with the general policy, the application was refused. I might add that this decision was taken following careful examination within my Department, and also consultation with Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Following a number of representations from the locality, I asked for this case to <Col N="1975" /> be reconsidered within my Department, and following the recommendations made to me, I have already said, agreed to grant temporary recognition to the classes in Baile an Lochaigh this summer. My Department will be carefully scrutinising the operation of these classes to ensure that the conditions I have attached to the temporary recognition will be fully complied with, and the case will be fully reviewed in November 1992 in the light of experience during the summer, before any decision is taken as to future recognition of classes in Baile an Lochaigh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to outline the deplorable conditions that are in existence at Kilkee Community College in County Clare. The Minister of State is well aware that I, and other public representatives, have made many representations to the Department on this matter. I also visited the school on a number of occasions so I can comment from first hand experience.</P>
      <P>The community college campaign has now been on the road for ten years. The west Clare community saw this school as a lifeline, a sign that the Government saw the area as having a future. The Government laid emphasis on all their policies but in particular the need for decentralisation, to keep people on the land in their own areas and to give them the opportunity not only to be educated but to work there. I hope they will give a clear signal, once again, that they will give west Clare priority in this regard to ensure that the young people in that area have an opportunity to avail of the best possible education in their local schools, both primary and secondary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there have been so many delays in relation to this project a number of pessimists in the area feel that this school will never be provided and that there will be no further developments. I would like to be able to allay their fears <Col N="1976" /> and I am sure the Minister of State will do his best in his reply.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the buildings and the access ways in the old vocational college are in an atrocious condition. There is no doubt that most of the buildings on the site are dangerous and should not be occupied. The same applies in the case of the old convent school. We are talking about three different sites in relation to this school and many of the buildings should be demolished.</P>
    <P>I should like to concentrate on two of the buildings, the convent and the old vocational school which are a little over half a mile apart. One can imagine how much valuable teaching time is wasted given that the unfortunate pupils have to spend so much time each day manoeuvring from one site to another. I will give the Minister of State a number of examples when the debate concludes but I will give one obvious example now. One pupil loses 30 minutes teaching time in moving from one site to another. That is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that not only are the buildings inadequate for their purpose but they are also dangerous. Between the two main sites there are 23 classrooms, 14 of which are prefabs. Nine of these have far exceeded their lifespan and seven of the nine are dangerous and should not be occupied. Indeed, I am aware that one recently had to be demolished and the students have to take classes in an annex of a disused factory in the town.</P>
    <P>Given the state of the buildings, and the lack of facilities, the students had to be sent home on two occasions while certain sections of the school had to be evacuated on several occasions. The electrical wiring and appliances in the school are a serious cause for concern. There are a number of makeshift corridors and one can imagine, when it rains, the rivulets which run through those corridors. In addition there are a number of holes in the floor of some prefabs which threaten limbs. This is not the kind of facility that <Col N="1977" /> we should have in today's world in which to educate our young people.</P>
    <P>There are hidden costs in running the school, for example, heating costs. Because of the nature of the buildings the heating bills are astronomical, yet there is insufficient heat within the classrooms.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention two subjects in particular, the home economics course and science. The home economics course has to be taken in the convent area. Not only is the classroom inadequate, there are no facilities. There are two cookers one of which is not working. The teachers have told me that they have to rely on the theory as they cannot do any practical work given the lack of facilities.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of the science building in the old vocational school. The only science equipment that appears to be available is a few bunsen burners. This means that the teachers have to rely on chalk-and-talk which can be seen as a disadvantage in the case of many of the students. We do not want any student in west Clare, or anywhere else, to be placed at a serious disadvantage due to the inadequacy of facilities, both structural and educational. This point is particularly important at a time when so much emphasis is being put on technological education. We do not even have the simple necessities within the school system at Kilkee.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying that the parents, the pupils and teachers are only too well aware of the financial difficulties facing the Government. However I implore them to take this opportunity to grant permission to invite tenders so that the initial work can commence on the school. I would not raise this matter if it was not of extreme importance to the people of Kilkee and the west Clare area. I wish to take this opportunity to publicly thank the Minister of State for showing concern and taking a great interest in this matter. I also thank him for agreeing to <Col N="1978" /> visit the school to assess the situation on 11 June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy de Valera for raising this matter which gives me an opportunity to explain the position with regard to this project. It may be of assistance if I give some background on the project and also outline the very serious financial situation facing the Department which forms the context in which the advancement of this project to construction must be considered.</P>
      <P>The project at Kilkee Community College being undertaken by County Clare Vocational Education Committee involves the provision of an extension at this school to replace accommodation which the Department accept as being very unsuitable. The extension will provide 903 square metres of accommodation at an estimated cost of almost £500,000. This will provide general classrooms as well as specialist facilities for science and mechanical drawing as well as other ancillary facilities.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Department have taken steps to ensure that the recent planning of this facility has not been the subject of any unreasonable delay. Currently the architectural planning is nearing completion and the project will then be ready to go to tender.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, the Department are aware of the conditions at the school but the problem at present in proceeding to construction is one of finance. The Department have in planning many more projects than there is finance to allow to start immediately. As a consequence, only a limited number of projects can begin each year in the context of the funds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the 1992 capital allocation is fully committed but my Department will examine the cash flow position in relation to ongoing projects later in the year to establish if any additional projects could be advanced. Every effort will be made to include Kilkee should any <Col N="1979" /> additional projects proceed to tender this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to confirm, as the Deputy said, that I will meet representatives of the school in the near future at her <Col N="1980" /> request and that of her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to discuss the entire project.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 May 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>In the past month, payments totalling approximately £2.3m were received from the United Nations in respect of Irish participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The bulk of this amount &mdash; about £2m &mdash; represents arrears to troop costs.</P>
      <P>A total of about £14.6m is currently due to my Department by the UN. Of this amount, £13.8m relates to involvement in UNIFIL since May, 1978. The remaining shortfall of £0.8m arises out of participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) which commenced in April, 1964. The arrears in question are the subject of ongoing representations to the United Nations by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence made both bilaterally and in conjunction with our partners in the European Community.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether a detailed breakdown of unemployed persons' statistics such as age, sex, profession, trade or skill, previous occupation, and previous and present address would be beneficial as this would give a clear picture of the unemployed and could identify specific areas for address; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that as full an analysis as possible is available of unemployed persons. At present there are three major sources for such analysis.</P>
      <P>(1) The monthly area analysis of the Live Register count, published by the Central Statistics Office, provides details of the numbers registering at each of the 128 Local Employment Offices throughout the country, classified by broad age group and sex. The methodology used in compiling these figures does not make them amenable to classification by area of residence of those on the Live Register. The Department of Social Welfare is at present in the process of compiling a previous history and occupational analysis of new registrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) The results of the annual Labour Force Surveys, which are carried out in all member states of the EC using a <Col N="1831" /> common methodology, enable unemployed persons to be classified, <i>inter alia,</i> according to age, sex, previous occupation (in the case of those who have lost or given up their previous job) and area of usual residence at the time of the survey and one year previously. However, because the Labour Force Survey is a sample inquiry, covering approximately one in twenty households in the State, the lowest level at which these data can be published is planning region.</P>
    <P>(3) The results of the five yearly Census of Population enable the relevant tabular data, as set out in (2), to be provided at the level of DED/Ward.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the current sources of unemployment data provide sufficient information for analytical purposes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 79, 80 and 81 together. I presume the Deputy is referring to incidents last summer at Rossaveel Fishery Harbour Centre.</P>
      <P>My Department's harbour master at Rossaveel is and will continue to be vigilant in ensuring that vessels operating in the harbour comply with the maximum speed of five knots stipulated in the Fishery Harbour Centres (Management, Control, Operation and Development) Bye-Laws, 1979.</P>
      <P>I have requested the Harbourmaster to issue reminders to all Harbour users concerning the speed limits and the penalties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The master of a passenger ferry was recently fined when found guilty of breaching the speed limit during August, 1991. I do not consider that the time <Col N="1837" /> between the offence and Court hearing was excessive.</P>
    <P>In the event that persons continue speeding after conviction, they will be pursued with the full rigour of the law.</P>
    <P>Under Section 9 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1979, I am empowered, as Minister for the Marine, to set up an inquiry into the fitness or conduct of a holder of an Irish Certificate of Competency. The inquiry may cancel or suspend the Certificate of Competency Pending the outcome of the inquiry, I am enabled to suspend the Certificate.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Marine I have no power to remove or suspend United Kingdom Certificates of Competency. Alleged offences by holders of UK Certificate in Irish waters may be reported to the UK authorities who are empowered to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>As regards Kilronan, Galway County Council are responsible for that harbour and I will convey the Deputy's complaints to the County Council for appropriate follow up. The Marine Surveyors in my Department monitor vessels plying to and from the Aran Islands on a regular basis, i.e. fortnightly in the high season. In view of the complaints as to speeding I have instructed Marine Surveyors to pay particular attention to this aspect in their monitoring process.</P>

      <P>The statistics requested by the Deputy are not available and could only be complied by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time which could not be justified at this time. Court statistics are complied on the basis of the legal year which ends in July. The number of cases awaiting hearing in the High Court at 31 July 1991 in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford is as follows: Dublin, 7,849; Cork, 2,037; Limerick, 1,697; Waterford, 218.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the listing of cases for hearing in the High Court and the deployment of judicial resources is a matter for the President of the High Court and is one in which I have no function.</P>
      <P>I am aware however, of the importance of providing an efficient and effective Courts Service. A number of measures have been taken to alleviate delays in the High Court which includes the appointment of two additional High Court Judges in October 1991; the reconstruction in the Morgan Place Wing of the Four Courts, which is now underway, and which will make available three additional Courtrooms later this year; and the computerisation of the Central Office of the High Court. A suite of computer programmes are under test at present for the Central Office, a feature of which highlights areas of delay, and this system will come into operation over the next few months.</P>

My Department is satisfied that the expenditure by the school was <Col N="1843" /> in accordance with the provisions of the relevant grant schemes under which the School was in receipt of moneys from my Department.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the employment of the caretaker at Kill N.S., is that this is a matter for FÁS who pay the grant in this regard and conduct audits of their own finances. In regard to monies obtained through fund-raising, I understand that while this is a matter outside my Department's power of audit, it was investigated by a Sub-Committee of the Board and that there was no question of moneys having been misappropriated.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Primary Curriculum Review body recommended that Health Education be included in the Curriculum and on a cross curricular basis.

      <P>My attention has not previously been drawn to the problem referred to by the Deputy. As the Deputy may be aware my Department is responsible for type approval of terminal equipment, including payphones, to be connected to the public telecommunications networks. There are two main types of payphones approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>One type relies on a metered pulse signal from the Telephone Exchange to commence charging. Such metered signals commence only after the called party has answered.</P>
      <P>The other type of payphone, known as a &ldquo;pay on answer&rdquo; payphone, operates its own internal timing and charging arrangements and does not rely on the Telephone Exchange for a metered pulse. It will allow the caller to dial out without inserting any coins. Insertion of coins is required only when the called party answers and if no coins are inserted then the call is terminated. All such payphones clearly instruct the caller that no coins should be inserted until the called party answers. Premature insertion of coins will activate the timing and charging mechanism.</P>
      <P>Approval of terminal equipment is based on specifications drawn up by my Department consistent with international recommendations. However in the light of the Deputy's question I will have the specifications reviewed by my Department to see if those parts dealing with instructions for use of the &ldquo;pay on answer&rdquo; phones are adequate.</P>

      <P>The existing notification system for AIDs cases does not capture data on a county or regional basis. It is estimated that approximately 10% of known HIV positive tests are in respect of persons outside the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>A sub-committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee has recommended that the existing reporting system should be modified to enable the incidence of HIV/AIDS cases to be identified by county of residence without prejudice to the confidentiality of individual cases. This recommendation is at present being implemented, and will allow for improved planning and demand assessment for services at regional county level.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 35 persons with HIV infection are receiving services in the Southern Health Board region.</P>
      <P>Funding for such services are encompassed in the main by the allocation to the Southern Health Board in respect of services provided directly by the Board or on its behalf by the voluntary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware a range of recommendations have been made recently by the National Aids Strategy Committee in regard to the care and management of HIV/AIDS patients. These recommendations have been circulated to all health boards and are being assessed by them with a view to their implementation as required. On the basis of the recommendations I have initially allocated an additional £50,000 to the <Col N="1852" /> Southern Health Board &mdash; £20,000 of which is in respect of support and counselling services of the Cork Aids Alliance.</P>

      <P>A report has already been prepared by the Southern Health Board in relation to a number of ambulance calls which were recently the subject of publicity.

My Department, together with the Health Boards, is currently undertaking a major review of the ambulance service nationally. It would be intended that the recommendations of the Ambulance Review Group in relation to the provision of pre-hospital care would be taken into account by the Health Boards when considering any future developments in this area.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the derelict sites <Col N="1857" /> levy provided for in the Derelict Sites Act, 1990 is to encourage owners of derelict sites to take the action necessary to remedy the dereliction without delay. The levy applies in urban areas and in such other areas as the Minister for the Environment prescribes by regulations and is payable to the local authority concerned. It is charged by reference to the market value of the property, as determined by the local authority or by the Valuation Tribunal on appeal. The rate for 1992 is 3 per cent of the property's market value, but a higher rate, not exceeding 10 per cent, can be prescribed for subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Because the levy came into operation this year, full details of the likely yield from it are not available yet. However, it is anticipated that the yield to county borough and borough corporations will be of the order of £190,000 in 1992.</P>

      <P>In India, the Contract Labour Act 1970, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of 1976, and the Inter-State Migrant Workers Act 1979 are intended to protect workers in India against bonded labour.

      <P>During the 1960s my Department operated a subsidy on phosphate fertilisers in order to offset a phosphate deficiency which was general at that time. That objective had been amply achieved by 1972-73, when the subsidy was ended. Subsequently and following a sharp increase in world fertiliser prices resulting from the oil crisis of the early seventies, there was some decrease in usage, but in 1978-79 sales recovered considerably and have remained reasonably stable since then.</P>
      <P>Recent fertiliser use surveys indicate that tillage crops are generally treated adequately with phosphorous. About 75 per cent of grassland is also satisfactory but the application of maintenance quantities is required to maintain fertility. The remaining 25 per cent of grassland has insufficient levels of phosphorous for optimum grass production and requires substantial applications of phosphorous to build up soil fertility. Farmers should have their land regularly tested and should replace any nutrient deficiencies, including phosphorous, in order to maintain fertility levels.</P>

While the survey results will be analysed initially on the basis of forage acreage, those cases which fail to meet the stocking density criterion will be given a supplementary analysis taking equivalent feed acreage into account. I understand that cases which fail on the forage acreage basis but pass using forage and feed acreages combined would be recommended by the Panel to my Department for inclusion and that the Land Commission assessments would be used by the Panel were appropriate to support these cases.</P>

      <P>All self-employed persons over 16 years of age with reckonable income or reckonable emoluments of £2,500 or more per annum are self-employed contributors and are liable for payment of class S social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>PRSI contributions payable by self-employed people give entitlement to Old Age Contributory Pension, Widow's and Orphan's Contribution Pensions. In general, 3 years' contributions are required to establish entitlement to Widow's Contributory Pension while for Old Age Pension purposes the person must have entered social insurance before reaching 56 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned became a self-employed contributor when the social insurance scheme for the self-employed <Col N="1876" /> commenced in 1988. Because he was over 56 years of age at that time he cannot qualify for an Old Age Contributory Pension. However, he may qualify for a non-contributory Old Age Pension based on a means test. In the event of him failing to qualify for such a pension, he can apply for a refund of the Old Age Pension element of the contributions along with any interest due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed Injury Benefit under the Occupational Injuries scheme in respect of an accident at work on 2 October 1991.</P>
      <P>Following investigations, Injury Benefit was allowed from 5 October 1991, the fourth day of incapacity.</P>
      <P>The claimant was examined by a Medical Referee on 16 December 1991 and it was considered that she was not incapable of work. Injury Benefit was disallowed from 27 December 1991.</P>
      <P>Claims to benefit are determined by Deciding Officers whose decisions may be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of notice of intention to appeal against the decision, the claimant was again examined by a different Medical Referee on 23 April 1992. The examination confirmed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>The claimant's medical certifier was notified of the examinations in accordance with the standard practice and there is no record of the receipt of additional evidence such as a report of a hospital specialist or a company doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appellant was invited to complete a Notice of Appeal form on 8 May and to furnish any additional evidence she wished to submit in connection with her appeal. In the meantime it is open to her to claim Supplementary Welfare Allowance. It is also open to her to claim Disablement Benefit if she considers she is <Col N="1878" /> at any loss of faculty as a result of the accident.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my Department I unreservedly apologise for the distress and inconvenience which has been caused to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>Following the death of his spouse in January 1992, the person concerned applied for a Death Grant. On 13 March 1992 a cheque for £100 &mdash; the maximum amount payable &mdash; issued to him. Due to an administrative error which arose in the completion of documentation arising from the award of the Death Grant, it was taken that the person concerned had died. Consequently, his Retirement Pension was terminated. In addition letters requesting the return of his pension book and payment of an alleged overpayment issued in error to his personal representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> I have fully examined the circumstances which gave rise to the issue of the letters in question and I have taken steps to ensure that this type of error will not occur again. A letter of apology has issued to him from my Department in this regard.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a Retirement Pension of £66.70 per week including a Living Alone Allowance. In addition he receives Free Electricity Allowance. Following the death of his spouse, he received Free Fuel Allowance up to the end of the 1991-92 heating season.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned is now residing alone, he may be eligible for Free Telephone Rental Allowance. An application form issued to him on 18 May 1992. As soon as this is completed and returned to the Department, a decision on his entitlement will be made. He will be notified of the outcome immediately.</P>

      <P>There are a number of reasons which influence people's decisions to return to Ireland and the services of the State agencies are equally available to everyone in the State, including returned emigrants.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Labour, my main concern relates to the return of job seekers. I am not aware that returning emigrants are encountering special problems which would justify the setting up of national advisory service, as suggested.</P>
      <P>FÁS provides a comprehensive service to all job seekers, covering not only employment but training and employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among recent initiatives involving FÁS are the Transfrontier Committee which also has representatives from the <Col N="1880" /> UK Employment Service, the UK Department of Employment Training Directorate, and from the voluntary sector in both countries. The Committee is concerned with:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the provision of appropriate support for workers seeking to move between Ireland and the United Kingdom, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;minimising the difficulties of entry to employment and training markets by arriving or returning emigrants.</P>
    <P>As part of the SEDOC process, FÁS assists Irish emigrants abroad who are interested in finding employment here.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced a proposal to locate FÁS staff in offices of the State Employment Services in the Netherlands and Germany. Not only will these FÁS staff provide a service for Irish workers going there but they will also act as a useful contact for emigrants wishing to return home.</P>
    <P>An important role is also played by the Department of Social Welfare in helping returning emigrants, in that it arranges for the transfer of their welfare entitlements.</P>
    <P>Voluntary emigrant welfare organisations in Britain are also involved in the provision of many information and advisory services, including advising returning emigrants. These voluntary services are grant-aided by my Department on the recommendation of DÍON &mdash; the London based Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare.</P>
