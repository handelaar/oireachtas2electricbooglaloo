      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 11, 12 and 13. By agreement, it is also proposed that business shall be interrupted at 10.30 tonight. It is further proposed that No. 11 shall be decided without debate. Private Members' Business shall be No. 25 and shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Will there be an opportunity to discuss this matter before they come into effect? Is it not the case that these are due to come into effect in September? If they are to be debated here they have to be published in advance of the end of June. That leaves us with little <Col N="326" /> more than four weeks for their publication. Will the Taoiseach be a little bit more precise than this gramophone record of &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the question of the apparent change of direction by the Taoiseach's Department in relation to questions in the House. I had hoped from the Taoiseach's response that the questions might have been put on the Order Paper as they should have been, for today. Does the Taoiseach now intend that questions which were tabled by many Members in this House regarding statements he made in Killarney in relation to the Shannon region will be answered by him next week, seeing that he will not answer them this week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The details the Deputy is looking for will be obtained from the appropriate Minister and the appropriate Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>You made the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined it and then it goes back to the other Ministers. There is nothing new about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware, I am sure, that section 1 (c) of the Referendum Bill which we are currently debating provides for the distribution of a statement to every elector in relation to the referendum. Given that An Post have now effectively sacked 2,600 staff in the Dublin area, will the Taoiseach say how he proposes to ensure that the information provided for in this Referendum Bill will be circulated and if the Taoiseach and the Government will make some effort to bring the dispute to an end?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute in <Col N="327" /> question has been the subject of discussion in the House and there is a more appropriate way of dealing with the matter, Deputy. It is not in order now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the special committee to deal with the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill be established and when will it come before the House for approval? Will the Taoiseach or his Whip be disposed to discuss with Members in the House who do not attend Whips' meetings, the composition and strength of this committee? With regard to the Taoiseach's great programme of reform, there are up to 16 separate pieces of legislation which have been promised but none is forthcoming. The Taoiseach advised me in a previous reply that the Bill to deal with homosexual rights, which is necessary because the European Court indicated that Ireland is in breach of the European Convention, was in preparation. Will the Taoiseach confirm that that is so? Would the Taoiseach indicate that the current Minister for Justice has not scuppered that legislation and taken it from the draftspeople, as seems to be indicated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee for the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill will be discussed between the Whips. With regard to the Deputy's second question, that Bill is in the very early stages of preparation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Committee on Procedure and Privileges agree to the proposal for the establishment of the Committee on European Affairs, will that committee be formally constituted before the end of this session and will they be able to discuss in detail some of the aspects of the Maastricht Treaty and some of the subsequent developments <Col N="328" /> after Maastricht, including the size and the extent of the Cohesion Fund in a committee stage-type debate, with Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reason the committee would not be formally constituted as soon as possible after its return from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Secondly, that committee have their proposed terms of reference at present in regard to the matters with which they can deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the widespread interest in this issue, the fact that so far the public have not received the degree of information I know the Taoiseach would like them to have, can he give the House an undertaking that, if that committee wished to discuss in detail aspects of the Maastricht Treaty and subsequent European developments, he would undertake that the relevant Ministers would make time available to attend meetings of that committee, making themselves and their officials available in the interests of democracy and open government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That committee will decide within their terms of reference what they wish to discuss at any given time. Anyway I will not be blocking anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach attempt to break the deadlock in the dispute involving the free legal aid services? On the one hand the Minister talks about a crackdown on crime but, because of the present dispute, hardened criminals are allowed loose on the streets of our cities, especially in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has continued for almost a year now. What is the Minister doing about it. We can only hear about such <Col N="329" /> matters on the radio on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour.&rdquo; There should be a crackdown but the Minister is smug about the overall position.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, in view of the continuing deterioration of county and secondary roads, particularly in my county, would the Taoiseach say when the Roads Bill, 1991, will be reinstated on the Order Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage that the discussion paper on marital breakdown will be published this term? Will he say whether it will be linked to the promised legislation on joint ownership of the family home? I am referring to the discussion paper on marital breakdown promised last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I seek your indulgence. I should really have raised this point on Item No. 11 &mdash; that is the motion to take the Finance Bill, 1992, in Special Committee. Would the Taoiseach consider allowing an extra Member on that Special Committee. I would remind the House that I am a chartered accountant and contributed, I think, very intelligently and thoroughly to the debate on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last year and indeed before that. I consider it a disservice to the house that somebody of my <Col N="330" /> technical qualifications should be excluded from assisting the Special Committee in this matter.</P>

      <P>As the Green Paper on Education will have had a gestation period of exactly two years this month, would the Taoiseach say if and when this long awaited Green Paper, the subject of numerous official and unofficial leaks, will be published? Can we have a definite date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, that is not the question I asked. My question was about the White Paper, not about the Treaty. I am aware that there is a requirement, whether or not we like it, to put Treaty documents into the working languages of the Community. That was not my question. My question was about the White Paper and the document, <i>A Short Guide to the Maastricht Treaty.</i> What arrangements are in place for its circulation in the Irish language &mdash; in so far as it is an amendment of the Constitution of which <Col N="331" /> the Irish language version is the one which prevails? Would the Taoiseach say what arrangements are in place?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not promised legislation. I met the Council for the Disabled yesterday, and was impressed with their very strong view that a council for the status of the disabled be established. I am making arrangements to have one of their members included in the Monitoring Committee on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I am giving very serious consideration to the establishment of such a council for the status of the disabled.</P>

      <P>I want the Irish people to vote yes to the Maastricht Treaty on the basis of a calm assessment of their own best interests and not on the basis of fear or greed induced by exaggerations by Government politicians. I do not argue that our people should vote for the Maastricht Treaty because of a proffered bribe of £6 billion. I do not know whether we will get all that money from Europe. At present Britain and Germany are heading for large budget deficits and there may be difficulty raising that money. We already get three or four times as much money from Europe per head of population as the inhabitants of East Germany whose income per head is not much greater than ours. Of course, I hope that we will get this £6 billion but we should not make wild promises about it. Nor do I argue that we should vote for the Maastricht Treaty because our whole world will collapse if we do not. No one can foresee the future with sufficient clarity to say that one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argue that we should vote for the Maastricht Treaty on the basis of the calculated and balanced judgment that, first, a united and inter-dependent Europe will be a more peaceful place than a divided Europe and second, a single European currency will make it easier for a trading nation like Ireland to grow and provide jobs for its people than would otherwise be the case. If Ireland stays out of the single currency Irish interest rates will definitely go up because a great deal of the German money now invested in the Irish gilts market will simply be removed. Third, a strong central European authority is needed to control transboundary pollution, unfair competition between rich and poor countries and exploitation of strength of any kind by big countries at the expense of small ones like Ireland. Fourth, the Maastricht Treaty is only a logical extension of policies Ireland has pursued since 1956 of deliberately opening up its economy to external influences; the Maastricht Treaty is no more than a logical <Col N="338" /> extension of that. Fifth, on balance, we are more likely to get financial aid from Europe to remedy our economic weaknesses if we are, so to speak, full members of the European club rather than pavilion members, as the opponents of Maastricht would have it. Sixth, as full members of a multicultural Europe, our culture will flourish, our horizons will expand and our self-confidence will grow.</P>
    <P>As I said elsewhere, if Ireland were to gain an extra half of 1 per cent of the European market we could solve our unemployment problem. When it is put like that it does not seem an impossible task. The European Single Market of 344 million consumers will be formally inaugurated at the Edinburgh Summit in December of this year. That Single Market, which the Irish people fully support, will not work unless it is underpinned by the further steps proposed in the Maastricht Treaty. Those steps &mdash; a single currency, common economic policies, stronger law enforcement powers for the Commission, new cohesion policies and common defence and security policies &mdash; must be taken if the Single Market is to be robust enough to survive even a modest economic crisis. I ask Members to pause for a moment to think about that.</P>
    <P>How could a Single Market without customs posts, tariffs and subsidies last if individual countries were able, for example, to competitively devalue their currencies, which they will be able to do if the Maastricht Treaty is not approved, print money to pay their bills, which they will be able to do if the Maastricht Treaty is not approved, give unfair subsidies to their local authorities, which they will be able to do if the Maastricht Treaty is not approved, or pursue conflicting defence and security policies? Without the Maastricht Treaty the Single Market would not survive more than a year or two. It does not take much imagination to see that without the Maastricht Treaty the Single Market would quickly revert to a series of competing national economic blocs. The Single Market, the Cohesion Fund and the single European currency are a huge opportunity for Ireland, an <Col N="339" /> opportunity to solve our employment crisis. However, it is only an opportunity; it is not a guarantee. We can fail to grasp that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Government, or at least the Fianna Fáil component of it, have the right mental attitude to Europe or domestic policy-making to be able to grasp that opportunity to the full. I am not talking here about superficial errors or minor incompetencies. I believe that the Fianna Fáil Party have an ingrained attitude to Europe and domestic policy-making which will lead this country up a blind alley. So far as Europe is concerned, the Fianna Fáil Party are simply unable to think in European terms, to place a problem in a European context and solve it in that context. They still think of Europe as somewhere out there, a place where we go to get money, plead for special treatment or complain. Europe is seen as a sort of surrogate colonial power to whom we have handed over part of the responsibility for our lives. In reality, Europe is no such thing: Europe is ourselves.</P>
    <P>I wish to illustrate how this neo-colonial dependency attitude &mdash; I wish to stress that it is an unconscious attitude &mdash; leads the Fianna Fáil Party into very practical day-to-day mistakes. Take the Common Agricultural Policy reform for example. Everyone knows we have to cut surpluses and costs. Everyone knows that Ireland could have more to lose than any other country if this is done in the wrong way. Radical proposals have been put forward by the Commission which will cost Ireland thousands of jobs if they go through. What do our Government do? In the manner of a sensitive colonial, they look for exceptions and exemptions all based on an appeal for poor little Ireland. That is not the way to solve the problem. A different Government would have looked at the problem of the Common Agricultural Policy reform in a European context rather than a narrow Irish context. By changing the context they would have found a solution and, therefore, have the confidence to put forward a genuine alternative, an Irish-European <Col N="340" /> alternative, to the MacSharry plan. In a recent speech I sketched out how Ireland could have forged a political alliance with environmental interests in Europe which would have created a genuine commercial future and not a hand-out for grass-based Irish farming, without exceptions or exemptions of any kind, or looking for sympathy from Europe. However, Fianna Fáil would not come up with that idea, not because they do not want to but because they simply do not think in European terms.</P>
    <P>I wish to cite another example. The way the Taoiseach has tried to sell the Maastricht Treaty to the people again demonstrates Fianna Fáil's chronic inability to see problems in a European context. Instead of selling the Irish people a vision of peace in Europe, extra growth for Europe and thus extra markets for Ireland, he tries to present the Treaty as some sort of massive £6 billion bribe for the Irish people from their European fairy godmother if only they promise to be good and vote the right way on 18 June. The same attitude comes through in regard to European unity and defence. Instead of seeing that it is in Ireland's interest to have some control, through common European defence policies, of the effect of what happens in Europe on our destiny, Fianna Fáil again look for exceptions and exemptions of one kind or another. They want to slow down the process and freeload on other people's efforts.</P>
    <P>The same duality of thought is carried through by Fianna Fáil into domestic policy making. Domestic policy making under the Fianna Fáil Party is not up to the challenge of a European market of 344 million consumers. There is no better illustration of the error of having a party in Government who have no interest in policy and who let the Civil Service do their thinking for them than the Finance Bill, which has been referred to a special committee and which has an intimate effect on how we succeed in the Single Market. The Culliton report is quite blunt about it. It says: &ldquo;In no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make a far reaching <Col N="341" /> and effective reform to support enterprise as in taxation&rdquo;. Yet the printers' ink on those words in the Culliton report was hardly dry when the Government introduced a Finance Bill to do precisely the opposite of what Culliton had recommended. It was a Finance Bill to cut tax concessions for employee ownership and risk investment in manufacturing and, incredibly, to offer a 10 per cent income tax rate to people who leave money of up to £100,000 lying dormant in a bank account and to offer new concessions that never existed before in Irish law on capital gains tax on the sale of development land. Could one imagine a Finance Bill more contrary to the Culliton report than this one? Culliton says that we should reward effort, risk-taking and enterprise. The Finance Bill states that we should reward people who leave money lying in banks and who acquire property and sell it at the right price after somebody else has developed it. The tragic fact is that the Government genuinely do not see any contradiction in this. They believe in leaving the Finance Bill to the civil servants as long as the members of the Cabinet can get on with important matters such as dividing up the lottery funds between the constituencies, which is the real stuff of politics as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty gives us the chance to increase our market share, a chance to create extra jobs. It guarantees us nothing. It simply gives us an opportunity. It will depend on our own decisions as to whether we take that opportunity. That is why I do not believe that a Fianna Fáil led Government is the best one to ensure that Ireland gets full benefit from European Union and the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Government parties should, of course, have dealt with travel and information rights before the Maastricht referendum. They have decided not to, and as they have a majority in the Dáil, we must make the best of that foolish decision, rash and unnecessary though it may be.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Solemn Declaration now strictly binds the present Irish <Col N="342" /> Government to introducing a constitutional amendment to deal with travel and information issues. This is not now a domestic matter, but an international commitment given by the Government to the other member states. The wording of the proposed Protocol which we were prepared to put into constitutional law is already available, as is the Fine Gael alternative. I do not understand, therefore, why the Government cannot publish a constitutional amendment Bill based on one or other of these texts. It would greatly reassure people, if this were done in advance of the Maastricht referendum. The Government have the Dáil majority to pass such a Bill, and there is absolutely no need, other than irresponsibility, to postpone it until November.</P>
    <P>We must come to deal in due time with all the broader issues arising from the Supreme Court judgment in a compassionate and considered way. We do not need a debate in which people take up &ldquo;sides&rdquo; around some artificial legalistic formula. This is an issue on which Dáil Éireann should act, for once, as a genuine legislature. All Members must be allowed to tease out the alternatives in an open, honest and free way, without the constraint imposed by any artificial consensus imposed from any quarter. Dáil Éireann, when that time comes, should be a place for listening as well as for talking. The public should trust their TDs on this issue. They will have a chance to judge them anyway within the next 18 months. In the meantime, Deputies should be trusted on that issue and, as a nation, we should deal with the Maastricht Treaty on its merits unclouded by other concerns.</P>
    <P>I say we should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because the Maastricht Treaty is a stepping stone &mdash; to use the words of Michael Collins &mdash; to something much greater. We should not be afraid to sketch out our long term vision for Europe. My vision is of a Europe with a genuine federal budget, automatic transfers from richer to poorer regions, an elected European Senate on the US model, with equal representation for Ireland and Germany, to protect <Col N="343" /> smaller states, and a democratically accountable European Government elected by the European Parliament which would have democratic accountability for economic policy.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the competences of this new European Government and Parliament distinguished from those of national governments and parliaments in a simple and clear European constitution. Nobody can claim that the Maastricht Treaty is simple or clear. There is a great deal of overlap between European and national responsibilities at the moment and that will continue under Maastricht. Everybody's business tends to become nobody's business.</P>
    <P>When considering proposals to spend taxpayers' money the first question people ask is whether there is a grant from Brussels. That has often become a much more important question than whether it is worth while spending the money anyway. If we had an automatic European financial transfer system similar to the one operating between the German Laander in the Federal Republic, where a block of money was given to the poor state to use as they saw fit rather than on individual schemes, that would not arise. We would spend the money in the best way possible without having to ask whether a grant is available. My main criticism of the Delors II package is that it is much too conservative in its federal vision of the new Europe.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that under the existing structure there will be no clear accountability for economic policy. National governments will not be completely free agents as far as economic policy-making is concerned. National central banks will be part of the European network of central banks, but where will accountability lie for those decisions? If accountability for economic policy-making in Europe is difficult to pin down and if an economic crisis arises, tension could build up uncontrollably. It is accountability of an individual, perhaps unfair in some cases to that individual, that relieves tension in a political system. Economic policy decision-making is now <Col N="344" /> so diffused in Europe that it will be very difficult to say who is responsible. Therefore, if a crisis arises it could be a real crisis.</P>
    <P>If the Maastricht Treaty is rejected, there will be no federal vision at all. We will revert to a Europe of nation states. The European Community will not, of course, disappear. It will continue, much as the Council of Europe has continued over 40 years in a sort of half-life, but the main business will be transacted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Those who reject the Maastricht Treaty because of concern about its defence implications should think about the alternative. It was the Europe of nation states that gave us the Second World War, the First World War, the Franco-Prussian War, the Austro-Prussian War and the Napoleonic Wars.</P>
    <P>Given the modern technologies of war, and Ireland's vulnerable but strategic position in the North Atlantic, does anyone seriously believe that a proclamation of unarmed neutrality would protect us from a war that might break out between the nation states of continental Europe if that were allowed to happen by rejecting Maastricht? One has only to look at conflicting positions that were brewing about Yugoslavia, and at the growth of the xenophobic right-wing vote in Flanders, Germany and France, to see that the raw materials of conflict are still lying around. We could not escape the consequences of that.</P>
    <P>I consider that the best way to defend Ireland from attack is for Irish statesmen to be working at the heart of Europe, within a European union that has the political, economic and defensive strength to keep the peace. The present Government should have had the honesty to say that clearly in the White Paper. The position they have adopted in the White Paper, wherein they say they are willing to delegate the defence interests of Ireland to a body of which we are not even a member &mdash; the Western European Union &mdash; in order to maintain what they call the &ldquo;specific character of Ireland's security and defence policies outside military alliances&rdquo;, is very difficult <Col N="345" /> for anyone to understand. In fact, by preventing a genuine European Union from developing its own defence competence, the Irish Government are artificially prolonging the relevance of NATO, although this is hardly their intention.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty has nothing to do with conscription. It involves &mdash; we should face this now rather than wait until 1996 &mdash; a long term political commitment by member states to co-ordinate their defence policies. Whether states rely on an all-volunteer army to do this, will be a matter for their own sole decision. Indeed, modern defence systems make the whole idea of conscription out of date and irrelevant. Those states which retain it, do so for reasons of social solidarity and political intertia rather than for reasons of defensive necessity.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty affords us an opportunity to move beyond traditional nationalism. The nation state was a necessary stage in the development of stable political structures. However, it has its limitations. It is plain that traditional nationalist formulae have not enabled us for the last 150 years to solve the problem of the relationship between the two communities on this island.</P>
    <P>I speak of constitutional nationalism as well as the other variety &mdash; neither have succeeded in solving that problem once they stayed within those territorial parameters. Traditional Nationalist formulae have prevented us from solving what is inherently a very soluble problem &mdash; that is how we and the Unionist community can get on with each other on this island. The development of European federalism gives us a chance to restate the Irish problem in an entirely different context &mdash; the European context of federalism and of subsidiarity, of shared and overlapping sovereignties rather than unitary sovereignties based on a single territory and thus by changing the context solving the problem. By restating the problem, as Jean Monnet restated the problem of how Europe could get on after the last war, we can solve the problem in Ireland. I believe we should redefine Article 2 and 3 of our Constitution <Col N="346" /> in that European context. It makes no sense that ours is the only Constitution of any member of the Twelve voting on the Maastricht Treaty that contains a territorial claim on territory in Europe that we do not already administer. Let us rethink those Articles fundamentally on the basis of the new European concepts of different peoples, with different cultures sharing the same physical and economic space. If we restate the problem in that context there is no reason why we in this generation cannot solve it.</P>
    <P>At a practical level it has been estimated that enhanced economic integration between North and South on this island could create up to 75,000 extra jobs. The Maastricht Treaty creates the context in which this can be done.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to economics. Opponents of the Maastricht Treaty say that Ireland should first be allowed to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; with other countries before joining the single currency area. The assumption is that continued freedom to devalue our own currency would enable us to catch up more rapidly than we would within a single currency area. This is a mistake. Most small European countries that are not in the European Community now realise that linkage to a big currency is essential to the encouragement of inward investment and the credible control of inflation. I believe that even if we reject Maastricht, we will still have to maintain the fixed Deutsche Mark link for our currency. If that is so, it is much better for us to have some control on the monetary policies underpinning that currency union, through membership of the board of the European Central Bank, rather than be sitting on the outside, accepting what ever interest rate policy has been accepted by the German Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I accept the argument of some opponents to Maastricht that the budget proposed by the European Community is too small to underpin a genuine federal budget. As I said already, I favour an automatic transfer system within a much larger European budget but if we reject the Maastricht Treaty we will never achieve an enlarged European budget if <Col N="347" /> we accept the Maastricht Treaty, there is some chance we will. The best way for Ireland to exercise its political leverage in this area is at the time of enlargement of Community membership. We can veto enlargement if we wish to and that is the stage which we should insist on a genuine federal budgetary system. We should, not, however, reject Maastricht because this is the wrong time to exercise political leverage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few more remarks but I will do so as quickly as possible. If the Chair has to stop me, I will accept this. We should make our position clear before enlargement takes place. We must play our cards intelligently. There are a few aspects of the Maastricht Treaty that are very important to Ireland. The Maastricht Treaty gives real powers to the Community to deal with environmental issues. We cannot deal with the problem caused by Sellafield on our own; however, if we act together with the European Community we could close Sellafield, if that were the right thing to do. It is only by exercising the environmental powers of the Community that we can protect our own environment. Likewise we cannot compete with the Germans in giving State aid to industry, because we have not the money they have. However, if the powers of the Community are strong enough, they can be stopped from giving State aid to their industry and that will give us a level playing pitch on which to compete. The same applies to aid for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are giving a subsidy to Britain at present by educating graduates whom we subsequently send there to work and when our people become unemployed in Britain they come home and are maintained on Irish social welfare. Under the Maastricht Treaty, education is being given assistance for the first time and this will enable a country like Ireland to get some compensation for the subsidisation <Col N="348" /> of richer countries through our graduate emigration. There are a great many very good reasons for voting in favour of Maastricht. Far from restricting the sovereignty of the Irish people, the Maastricht Treaty enhances our sovereignty as it gives us greater control and not less of our own destiny whether in defence, economic, environmental areas. It enables us to be full Europeans.</P>
    <P>Let us stop thinking of Europe as somewhere to go with the begging bowl in hand looking for help. We are European and we are as much entitled to devise policies for the new Europe as is President Jacques Delors. Let us do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with pleasure and enthusiasm that I commend this Bill to the House. The Treaty of Rome, which established the European Community, laid the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe. It defined the internal market as &ldquo;an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured&rdquo;. The Single European Act renewed this commitment to a developing union and the new Treaty, the Treaty on European Union, is a further significant step towards closer European economic, monetary and political integration.</P>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments have long been in favour of the progressive evolution of the European Economic Community into a European Union and the Irish people, in referenda in 1972 and 1987, overwhelmingly endorsed Ireland's accession to the Community and to the Single European Act, the previous major strides towards the eventual goal of European integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our membership of the European Community has brought substantial benefits to this country. Since our accession in 1973, all Governments have ensured that membership has resulted in substantial political, economic and social benefits while, at the same time, influence has been brought to bear on the Community so that the intrinsic values and aspirations of the Irish people could <Col N="349" /> be reflected in the social and foreign policies of the Community.</P>
    <P>Europe has been good to us and, certainly from an economic point of view, the scales are tipped very much in our favour. Membership gives us full and free access to a market of over 300 million people. Irish industry is benefiting from the removal of barriers on trade and business; Irish agriculture receives substantial support from the Common Agricultural Policy and, through the operations of the Structural Fund, major investments have been made in our environmental and business infrastructures.</P>
    <P>By ratifying the Treaty on European Union, it will be possible for this country to continue to enjoy the considerable economic benefits which have accrued from our membership of the European Community to date. As I have said, Irish agriculture has gained considerably from the Common Agricultural Policy and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The support we are getting from the Community Structural Fund is making noticable improvement in our daily lives and making it easier for our industries to compete on the world market. Membership of the Community has also made Ireland an attractive proposition for multinational firms who want access to the Community and to a workforce and infrastructure which is capable, efficient and has the abilities to meet the demands in today's highly competitive market.</P>
    <P>But the new Treaty arrangements now under discussion here do not only mean that the benefits we have received to date will continue. No, they mean much more than that. They offer Ireland substantially extra benefits. For example, there is a greatly strengthened and accelerated commitment to reduce the prosperity gap between the less-well off and the better-off parts of the Community.</P>
    <P>To achieve this, two important new requirements are built into the Treaty on European Union. Firstly, it will now be a binding Treaty requirement that the objective of reducing the gap must be taken into account when all Community <Col N="350" /> policies are being drawn up and acted on. Second, from now on the Commission must report regularly on progress made in closing the gap and it must also make proposals as to how this primary objective is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>A number of practical measures are spelled out in the Treaty to assist us in achieving the objective. A new Cohesion Fund confined to Ireland and three other countries &mdash; Greece, Portugal and Spain &mdash; will be established. The workings of the existing Structural Funds will also be reviewed to see how they meet with the commitment to reduce the prosperity gap while certain areas which have been excluded up to now &mdash; such as new education schemes &mdash; will in future be included. In addition, there will be a reduction in the requirement for countries like Ireland to put up matching funds before qualifying for support thus easing the budgetary pressures while allowing us to make the maximum use of the funds available.</P>
    <P>The advantages which membership of the Community confer on Ireland will continue to be of vital importance to our national wellbeing and to our overall economic and social development. The Treaty creates the basis for a European Union which will promote a new level of prosperity and Ireland will fully share in the benefits, be they economic or social.</P>
    <P>The European Union established by the Maastricht Treaty is based on a three pillar structure which takes account of the stage of development which the Community has now reached. These pillars are: firstly, amendments to the existing Community Treaties; secondly, common foreign and security policy; and thirdly, co-operation in the area of justice and home affairs.</P>
    <P>The creation of a role for the union in the areas of justice and home affairs is a significant development. It is a development for which, as Minister for Justice, I will have special responsibility and therefore I propose to direct my remaining remarks principally to this third pillar of European Union.</P>
    <P>Modern forms of crime do not recognise national borders. Drug trafficking <Col N="351" /> and other types of serious crime are now international in nature and demand a response based on international co-operation between police forces and judicial authorities. It is in the interests of all citizens that these problems be tackled by co-operation at an international level.</P>
    <P>There has been, of course, a good deal of co-operation in the area of justice and home affairs between the member states of the European Community for many years on an intergovernmental basis, outside the framework of the Treaty of Rome. In 1976 Ministers for Justice and the Interior of the member states set up an informal organisation, known as the TREVI group, as a forum for discussion and exchange of information on matters of common interest. They have developed into a comprehensive group who have brought international co-operation on the fight against the more serious types of criminality to the level it has reached today. Expanding from their early concentration on the fight against international terrorism, they now encompass the fight against drug-trafficking and other serious crime as well as police training and the use of equipment and forensic methods.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the TREVI Ministers recognised the need to examine the immigration policies of member states and, with that need in view, decided to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee on immigration. That work has been progressing in tandem with the work of TREVI. One convention has been signed in this sphere, The Dublin Convention on Determining the State Responsible for Examining Applications for Asylum Lodged in one of the member states of the Community. A second convention, on the crossing of the external frontiers of the Community, is almost agreed.</P>
    <P>Through the European Political Co-operation forum, judicial co-operation between the member states has been advanced, particularly, in the areas of civil law, in the areas of child abduction and custody and on simplified procedures for the international recovery of maintenance payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Progress has also been made in matters relating to the criminal law in the European political co-operation forum. For example, to give legal effect to the certain co-operation measures that have been adopted, I will be publishing a Bill shortly to give effect to various instruments of drug-trafficking, confiscation of the proceeds of crime, money laundering and international mutual assistance in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>European co-operation in all these matters has been given an added impetus by the decision to establish a Single Market with the consequent removal of barriers at internal frontiers. Those aspects of the work of the groups concerned with the Single Market is now overseen by a group of national senior officials, the co-ordinators group for the free movement of persons. This group were established by the European Council of the Heads of Government at its meeting in Rhodes in December 1988. The Council was aware that, in the area of the free movement of persons, the achievement of the Community's objectives, especially the area without internal frontiers, is linked to progress in intergovernmental co-operation to combat such matters as terrorism, serious crime, drug trafficking and illegal trafficking of all kinds. The Council decided that this intergovernmental co-operation should be stepped up in order to achieve rapid and concrete results which would enable the Community, for its part, to take the necessary measures to make Europe without internal frontiers a reality. To achieve this end, it was agreed that each member state would appoint a person responsible for the necessary co-ordination in these areas.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinators group meet on a regular basis and have made considerable progress, including the adoption by the European Council in 1989 of the Palma document which sets out a programme of measures which were considered necessary to realising the objective of free movement of persons within Community territory. The elaboration of these measures has been entrusted to the various fora and groups mentioned earlier <Col N="353" /> and the co-ordinators meet regularly to monitor implementation of the different measures.</P>
    <P>That, then, is the background against which much of the detailed work necessary to prepare for a Europe without internal frontiers has been undertaken in recent years.</P>
    <P>Much has already been achieved and Ireland has played an important part in these achievements. In the policing framework, for example, the TREVI meeting of Ministers in Dublin during the Irish Presidency of the Community in 1990, adopted a programme of action which has provided a framework for developing police co-operation. It includes specific measures designed to reinforce and build on existing co-operation in the fight against terrorism, serious crime and illegal immigration.</P>
    <P>The Treaty on European Union recognises the importance which attaches to developing closer co-operation in these areas if the goal of European Union is to be achieved. That is why justice and home affairs will henceforth constitute the third pillar of the new union structures. The provisions which the Treaty contain in this regard will provide a new framework for co-operation within the union on justice and home affairs matters and will largely replace existing arrangements such as TREVI and the <i>ad hoc</i> immigration group. These new arrangements also provide for an enhanced role for the institutions of the Community &mdash; the Council, the Commission and the Parliament &mdash; in developing this co-operation.</P>
    <P>These new Treaty arrangements do not, however, for the most part follow classic Community structures but will instead provide procedures which will be unique to this form of co-operation. This is because member states believe that the primary emphasis at this stage of integration should be intergovernmental co-operation in sensitive areas such as these and that action should largely remain the responsibility of the national administrations.</P>
    <P>The areas identified by the chapter on justice and home affairs as being matters <Col N="354" /> of common interest for the union, but in respect of which these new procedures will apply, include such matters as asylum policy, rules and controls governing the crossing of the external borders of member states, immigration policy, combatting drug addiction and fraud, judicial co-operation in civil and criminal matters, customs co-operation and police co-operation for the purposes of preventing and tackling terrorism, drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime. There is also a special proposal relating to the organisation of a unionwide system of exchanging information within a European police office, known as Europol, but I will say a little more about that later.</P>
    <P>The procedures set out in the chapter for co-operation in these areas envisage the creation of a Council of Ministers and member states consulting each other within the framework of the Council. Ministers will in appropriate cases adopt joint positions or joint actions and may also draw up conventions. Unanimity will be required for this purpose but decisions on implementing measures for the purpose of giving effect to conventions or joint action already decided upon will be taken by majority vote in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The right to make proposals for initiatives of this kind will be shared by member states and the Commission except in regard to measures designed to promote judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation where the right of initiative is to be reserved to member states exclusively. The Commission will otherwise be fully associated with the work of the Council. The European Parliament will also be kept informed of discussions in these areas and will have the right to put questions and make recommendations to the Council. Furthermore, the Presidency will be responsible for consulting the Parliament and ensuring that its views are taken with consideration. The Court of Justice will have a limited interpretative competence in relation to these matters where member states so decide.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made to allow the <Col N="355" /> Council of Ministers, acting unanimously on the initiate of the Commission or a member state, to decide that certain matters now covered by the procedures laid down in the chapter will be dealt with in accordance with classic Community procedures under Article 100C. Article 100C already provides for aspects of visa policy to be dealt with in the Community framework proper. The possibility of other matters being dealt with in the same way attaches only to certain specified immigration matters, the fight against drug addiction and fraud and judicial co-operation in civil matters. This provision reflects the desire on the part of some member states to see these areas of co-operation brought eventually within the Community competence while also recognising that there is not yet unanimous agreement for this at present.</P>
    <P>There are two declarations attached to the Treaty, one concerned with asylum policy and the other concerned with police co-operation and the proposal to establish the European Police Office, Europol, which I referred to earlier. The Asylum Declaration meets the concern of other member states which favoured making asylum policy a Community policy. It notes that member states will examine asylum policy as a matter of priority with a view to harmonising certain aspects before the end of 1992. It also states that the Council, before the end of 1994, will examine the possibility of moving asylum policy into the area of Community competence.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish Europol was taken by the Maastricht Council of Heads of Government last December. It was also agreed then that its initial function would be limited to organising the exchange of information on drugs among the member states. Any extension of Europol's remit will take place in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union and the Declaration on Police Co-operation which will provide the framework for development in the years ahead. In particular a role is foreseen for Europol in the following areas: <Col N="356" /> support for national criminal investigations and security authorities, in particular in the co-ordination of investigations and search operations; creation of data bases; central analysis and assessment of information in order to take stock of the situation and identify investigative approaches; collection and analysis of national prevention programmes for forwarding to member states and for drawing up Europe-wide prevention strategies and measures relating to further training, research, forensic matters and criminal records departments.</P>
    <P>It is clear, of course, that the removal of internal frontiers within the Community will require the introduction of compensatory measures to combat such matters as serious crime and drug trafficking and that it will also require the development of common procedures for control at external borders. As the member states move to dismantle the last barriers between them, and as a Europe without internal frontiers become a reality, there is a corresponding need to ensure that access to the Community and the freedom to move within it are not misused.</P>
    <P>The Government very much welcome the provision the Treaty makes for co-operation in the areas of justice and home affairs. The provisions in the Treaty build on the co-operation which has existed in these areas for many years now and will help to ensure that co-operation in these vital areas is maintained and improved in the years ahead. There is a recognised need to protect against the possibility of international criminals and terrorists seeking to exploit the proposed greater freedom of movement and communication for ends contrary to the rights and freedoms of the citizens of the Community at large. The member states are pledged to co-operate towards this and conscious of their commitment towards individual and collective freedoms, human and civil rights and the role of law and within a context of respect for these basic principles of their democratic societies.</P>
    <P>The Community is a cornerstone of <Col N="357" /> political and economic stability and the Government are satisfied that the wellbeing of the Irish people is dependent on stability and peace in Europe and on the prosperity of the Community. European Union offers us the chance to play a full part in the Europe of the 21st century and a voice that we could never have on our own. Though we rightly cherish our national identity and culture, European Union also gives us the opportunity to enrich our own heritage in the wider European context to contribute to the culture of Europe.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland have already indicated their full commitment to the achievement of a closer European integration by a clear majority when they approved our membership of the Community and which they confirmed in the referendum on the Single European Act. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate should be about the Treaty on European Union. We should be very excited about joining such a bloc. Many larger countries would jump at the opportunity. Such a move would be unanimously approved by their parliaments, and the Governments running those countries would be applauded for joining. That should be the way in Ireland and it would be had it not been for the meddling of the former Taoiseach, his two Cabinet colleagues and other faceless people in forcing a public debate and confusing the minds of the Irish people as to whether we are talking about European Union or public morality in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister for Justice make a very comprehensive report and I applaud him for what he said. I find nothing wrong with it. I agree entirely with what he is recommending and I will be supporting European Union. I will be asking my supporters in County Donegal to vote for European Union.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil will not admit they were wrong in introducing the issue of public morality to a debate about a Treaty that has nothing to do with it but everything to do with what the Minister spoke about. Why could it not have been kept that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Why could we not have had unity among the Irish people in saying we believe in a European Union, we believe in achieving this by economic means and that we believe in all Europe is offering us?</P>
    <P>That would have been the position had it not been for the fact that Deputy Haughey, the former Taoiseach, went to Maastricht and had a Protocol inserted which has confused the issue. The debate is no longer strictly about the merits of European unity and that is unfortunate. Deputy Haughey, as Taoiseach, believed he was doing right, but I question his authority to enter the Protocol. Did he consult his Cabinet? Members of his Cabinet say he did not. Did he inform the two colleagues who were with him, and if he did why did they keep it secret? Why, when he came back from Maastricht to inform the House about what transpired, did he inform the House that there was a Protocol guaranteeing the recognition of Article 40.3.3º of our Constitution? Why was there so much secrecy about it? Did Deputy Haughey consult faceless people about this? There are remours in the House, in the corridors of power, and among the general public that Deputy Haughey responded to requests from certain faceless individuals who are prominent on a platform that is forcing the issue of abortion into a debate where it does not belong.</P>
    <P>I wish to state that the party I was born into, that I have had the honour to represent in this House for more than half of my lifetime, is as anti-abortion as any person preaching on those platforms and who are trying to argue with people like me. They are doing no service whatever to this debate. The future of this country lies in Europe. If we were a small island lying off the United States of America, would anyone question the Government's desire to join the USA as an extra State in that great union? We know the answer to that would be no. We would be jumping at the opportunity. Europe has a population of 350 million people as against 240 million in the United States of America with greater wealth and opportunities. However, there is not unanimity among our people <Col N="359" /> in regard to the Treaty. That is not for economic, defence or social reasons but for one of public morality, which should not be part of the debate.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we are debating this matter in the terms in which we are doing so; we are not doing a service to the parliament, our parties or ourselves. We must face the remote possibility that the Maastricht Treaty will be defeated. Quite a number of people will vote against it although they should vote in favour of it. Who is to blame for this? The blame rests fairly and squarely with the former Taoiseach, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance, who represented this country at Maastricht without consulting their Cabinet or party colleagues or indeed the party in Government with them, the Progressive Democrats. Worse than that, they went to Maastricht to represent the Irish people without consulting the Irish Parliament; no one on this side of the House knew of the Protocol being inserted in the Maastricht Treaty until the Supreme Court case when the matter became relevant. Was it because of political piety that the former Taoiseach acted as he did at Maastricht? What was the reason? It certainly was not about European Union because it has nothing to do with that. It has always been the case &mdash; and it is the curse of this country &mdash; that the ethos of the Fianna Fáil Party has always been to reflect the thinking of the Catholic Church.</P>
    <P>There has been violence in Northern Ireland for the past 22 years, because people there do not want to be called the Irish, which we want them to be called &mdash; or that they think we want them to be called &mdash; and I have come to the conclusion, forced by the pressure of murder and violence in Northern Ireland, that the Fianna Fáil Party are guilty of identifying with what Catholic Ireland responds to. They stay close to that, not because of any great piety on their part &mdash; they are no better or worse than the mortals on this side of the House &mdash; but because it gathers votes. It would have worked except for the fact that the High <Col N="360" /> Court and the Supreme Court gave their judgments in the X case. If that had not happened the Protocol and Maastricht would have been seen by a group of people in this country as a master stroke.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason for having such a Protocol inserted in the Treaty. No one had to reinforce my anti-abortion views and I do not believe that a prop of any description must be used in relation to any persons &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour Party supporters or anybody else. Basically, the Irish people are against abortion and it does not really matter whether they are Catholics or Protestants. The law which prohibits abortion on this island goes back to 1861 &mdash; the Offences Against the Person Act &mdash; introduced in Westminster by a parliament which had very little Irish or Catholic influence. If there is a debate about abortion in Ireland on that law, why is it confined to the Republic? Why is the same argument not being put forward by the pro-life groups in Northern Ireland? Why is there no emotion about these debates in Northern Ireland? Why is all the emotion on this side of the Border? Why all these questions? As far as I am concerned, the answer is that Northern Ireland does not have a written constitution. After the McGee case, which was about contraceptives not being available on this side of the Border, some people may have believed genuinely that someone in the Republic might take the 1861 Act to the Supreme Court, have it declared unconstitutional and that then there would not be any anti-abortion laws in this country. That fear has now proved groundless and the people who believed it &mdash; genuine though they may have been &mdash; were wrong in their assessment and would not listen to reason. The words which were voted on in the referendum in 1983 have now been interpreted by the Supreme Court, that expectant mothers are entitled to an abortion almost up to the point of delivery.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harte was correct initially in indicating his regret that this matter had erroneously been brought into the Bill <Col N="361" /> before the House but in circumstances where he accepts that it is not appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully acknowledge the point you are making. However, a major mistake was made by the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party. It would be to their credit, the credit of the country &mdash; internationally and locally &mdash; if they admitted to the electorate that their judgement was wrong and that the Protocol should not have been inserted. We should all try to ensure that the Maastricht Treaty is passed and then find solutions in relation to the views which we all hold, because there is no threat from any party or individual in regard to introducing abortion. I do not know anybody who is interested in introducing abortion and it is wrong to suggest that that might be the case.</P>
      <P>I was in Glasgow last weekend and I spoke to the wife of a Pakistani gentleman, a Scottish lady who was interested in what was happening in Ireland in relation to the referendum. She told me a story regarding a friend of hers whose daughter became pregnant. She is a young student and her parents were very anxious for her to have an abortion. That young girl elected to come to Ireland to protect herself and her baby because the laws of this country prohibit abortion. This girl has no connection with Ireland but she realised that our laws would protect her and her baby. Yet there are people living in Ireland who profess to know everything about its laws and who do not accept there is protection for girls who, unfortunately, become pregnant and have to decide whether they will continue with their pregnancy or terminate it. We would all want a young girl not to terminate her pregnancy but that decision must be left to her on the basis of a medical opinion and advice from her spiritual directors. It is not my business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy recognised to whom I was referring. Is the Taoiseach saying that £6 billion is available for spending in Ireland? If so, how much will be spent in Donegal? No county has suffered as much as Donegal from the partition of the country. That is beyond dispute. We have stood against cross-Border competition over the past ten to 15 years and we have carried the burden of the break with sterling. We have the highest unemployment and emigration. There has been no sympathy from a succession of Governments who have failed to appreciate our difficulties. Politics apart, economically we would have been far better off in the northern settlement. That is a terrible admission for a Member of a Dublin Parliament who has served for 31 years. People will recognise what I am saying. In that kind of settlement the people of Donegal would have had it in them to make a better contribution and we might not have had the violence of the past 50 or 60 years in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Donegal is calling out for attention and we want to know what way the people of the county will benefit in voting for the Maastricht Treaty. It is not good enough to say Donegal will be assisted; we want to know how this will be done. If I were to isolate one example of the economy of the county, I would refer photographers and journalists to that part of Donegal which lies within five or six miles of the Border and ask them to photograph all the petrol filling stations which lie derelict. Business people scraped together all their cash and borrowed money to modernise these filling stations some ten years ago and then they went broke. Those derelict stations are monuments to the failed economic policies of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All over the world when people talk about political union they know they must start with economic union. When East Germany wanted to join with West Germany the first problem to be resolved was economic and monetary union. When those problems have been dealt with, the political problems of uniting people are small. Some Irish people, <Col N="363" /> particularly the Fianna Fáil Party, were never able to grasp that. We always had to be different. If it was British it was wrong &mdash; that was the acid test. It did not matter whether a policy was economically right or wrong or whether it had merits; if it had the tinge of being British we could have nothing to do with it. It might soil our green Irishness. It might spoil the image of super-Irishness or super-Republicanism. Had we seen the need to unite the people, North and South, we would have realised that the proper way to go about it was by uniting them economically. Everything else would then have fallen into place.</P>
    <P>For that reason alone I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Maastricht Treaty, as every Deputy should be. Unless we unite this country economically we will never unite its people. If we do not unite the people, the murders and the violence which have destroyed society in the North will continue. There can be no such thing as a tolerable level of murder. If governments cannot see that, there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to clarify the position in relation to the public morality debate. If he does so he will defuse a lot of tension and emotion and people who wish to vote for the Treaty will be happier in doing so.</P>

      <P>The new Treaty on European Union marks a further stage in the continuing political process on which this nation embarked when we entered the EC on 1 January 1973. It is well to remember that our entry into the Community was backed in a referendum by 83 per cent of the people. Like the Rome Treaties and the Single European Act, the European Union Treaty is a Treaty to be rejected or ratified as a whole. Ratified I am certain it will be, but as a whole. It was a conscious decision that no state should be able to choose which of the aims of the Union it supports and which it rejects. The European Union Treaty is rightly a package to be accepted or rejected. There is a single unified conception underlying the Treaty and any <Col N="364" /> other approach would be a recipe for complete confusion and the break up of the Community. If each country were allowed to pick what it liked and reject what it did not, there would be a hopeless state of confusion. It is a balanced, negotiated Treaty comprising a whole package. It must be accepted or rejected as such.</P>
      <P>It is also a very pragmatic Treaty which builds on what is possible and is not based on any pre-existing blueprint. It embodies another realistic step forward towards a more unified European Community in the interests of the member states. It is another stage forward in the process that started and was endorsed by the people in 1973. I notice that the same people who were opposed to entry to the Community in 1973 are there today making the obsolete arguments about sovereignty as if the world had never changes from the 19th century in which the idea of sovereignty held sway. We are now in the 20th century. There have been two serious world wars. We have seen the conception of a western European Community designed to prevent wars and bring old antagonists together. That concept has grown and now embraces central Europe. With new interest being shown in eastern and northern Europe we could well have a European Community which by the end of the century will embrace all countries from the Atlantic to the Urals and from the Arctic Sea at Murmansk to the Mediterranean.</P>
      <P>Sovereignty is an idle, sterile concept in itself. What is important in the exercise of sovereignty in the national interest. Our people exercised their sovereignty in ratifying the decision of the Oireachtas to go into Europe on 1 January 1973. The European Union Treaty is a further stage along that road. We had the Single European Act in 1987 and now we have this Treaty. Of course we will have further discussions as Europe takes more steps towards integration in the decade ahead. At all stages the people will be consulted. This is a third consultation with the people on the basis of this third Treaty.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows: (a) the new building being constructed for the Central Statistics Office in Cork is expected to be ready for occupancy in January 1994 and the bulk of the activities of the office will be transferred there after that date; (b) there will be costs and savings involved in the move of the Central Statistics Office to Cork. Savings will accrue from the fact that the fixed tenant purchase terms for the new Cork office will be less than the rents currently being paid by Central Statistics Office in Dublin, which are subject to periodic upward rent reviews and, of course, give no ultimate ownership. It is not yet possible to assess accurately all the costs involved in the move; (c) approximately 400 staff will be transferred to Cork. A small number of additional staff will be required in the Central Statistics Office as a result of the transfer; (d) general service staff in the Central Statistics Office not relocating to Cork and who are excess to its post-decentralisation Dublin requirements will be redeployed to other Government Departments.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation as it stands, a smallholder may qualify for unemployment assistance on the basis of a factual assessment of his means. The calculation of means is done on an income and expenditure basis and represents the gross income from the farm less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income. The legislation provides that in the absence of other means of ascertaining the current income of a person, his income is taken as the income in the preceding year. This is only done after the investigating officer of my Department is satisfied that similar opportunities for income from the holding still apply. If the investigating officer is of the opinion that there has been a change in circumstances and that the income from the smallholding has either increased or decreased, the officer will estimate the expected income in the coming 12 months based on the circumstances in each particular case.</P>
      <P>The unemployment assistance scheme is a social assistance scheme which is designed to provide applicants with an income related to their needs. Any increase in the income of an applicant automatically leads to a corresponding reduction in the amount of assistance.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the operation of the means test as it stands may deter farmers from attempting to improve their incomes. I am, therefore, examining the unemployment assistance scheme for smallholders to identify the way in which it could contribute to enterprise development; the creation of employment opportunities on small farms and, in particular, not act as a disincentive to smallholders to improve their situation. I intend to bring forward proposals in this regard in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I ask the Minister whether <Col N="368" /> he himself accepts that the present system of farmers' dole stifles initiative. What exact steps does the Minister intend to take to allow people to better themselves and to extend their endeavours to other farming related enterprises, something that his Government and Commissioner MacSharry often speak about? Can the Minister give an assurance that when that happens his own social welfare officers will not squash the initiative of those involved and ask them the 1,000 questions that have already frightened so many people? I would like the Minister to give an indication of his intentions because I have heard his announcement on at least five other occasions in the past ten years but nothing has ever happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Former Ministers speak for themselves. In the discussion on recent social welfare legislation the Deputy and other Deputies, particularly Deputies from the west, emphasised the points now being made by the Deputy. I know from my own visits to the parts of the country where smallholders' assistance applies that what the Deputy says is correct. Deputy Connaughton, Deputy O'Toole and others have impressed upon me the disincentive effect of the operation of the means test for smallholders as the system stands. In the past couple of weeks I visited the Deputy's part of the country to see for myself what was happening and I spoke to several people invovled in various activities, such as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> initiative. They also impressed that disincentive effect upon me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Deputy says is absolutely correct. As the system operates at present, when a smallholder increases productivity or adds to the number of cattle or sheep held, a corresponding amount of money is taken directly from the dole payment. There is no incentive <Col N="369" /> for a person to either increase the productivity of a smallholding or go into other areas of activity. I am considering a completely different approach. At present the Department are examining ideas that I myself and others have put forward and they are consulting other sources as well. I am considering either the operation of changed procedures on a pilot basis or doing something even more dramatic. I accept what the Deputy has said and I have been impressed by arguments put forward by him and other Deputies. I know that what they say repeats comments made over several years.</P>
    <P>At the moment, about 12,700 smallholders get smallholders' assistance. I consider that the Government could attempt a quite radical initiative in that regard and should then examine the way that works over a period of time in order to give smallholders the opportunity of improving their lot. I accept that the present system does not encourage enterprise and gives no incentive to people to better their lot.</P>
    <P>Former Minister will have to answer for themselves but whatever system I introduce will be operated by the officials in my Department in a manner laid down by me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a similar tune from the Minister's predecessors. Most small farmers genuinely believe that there will be no change. I advise the Minister, whatever he does, not to start another series of examinations or inquiries. If he has his mind made up to do something along the lines of that which I have spoken about so often in the House he should go and do it because it would certainly be better than the system that now exists.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the House, I am optimistic that my Department's dispute with the Irish Dental Association will soon be ended and that dependent spouses of qualified insured persons will again be treated by all dentists participating in the dental benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>I have not yet met with the Irish Dental Association but discussions at official level with the association have been continuing for some time. The outcome of these discussions is that a formal offer of settlement proposals has been made to the association which I am confident will be accepted by the membership. The settlement proposals will shortly be balloted on by the members and, if accepted, will be implemented from the beginning of July next. Unfortunately, a delay in the ballot has occurred due to the current postal dispute.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the settlement proposals comprise the introduction of a new contract for dentists participating in the scheme and a revised schedule of fees for dental treatment provided under the scheme. The new dental contract is designed to more adequately reflect modern dental practices and includes mechanisms for improved consultation with the dental profession and improved monitoring of standards which will ultimately lead to a better quality of service for the patient. The revised schedule of fees for treatment carried out under the scheme will give participating dentists a fair and economic return for their professional services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> Our approach in seeking a resolution of this long-running dispute has been to provide participating dentists with a modern dental benefit scheme in terms of dental practices and professional fees and, at the same time, to ensure that a high level of basic dental treatment is available to qualified insured persons and their dependent spouses. I am satisfied that the new arrangements effective, hopefully, from next July will meet those objectives.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the reply, but I have heard a similar response on several occasions. It was very pedestrian indeed. Only about two months ago the Minister indicated something similar in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill. It does not seem to have progressed. Is the Minister aware of the frustration and anger about this scheme, particularly among women? They have been conned so often in the past. They never seem to be able to draw on this dental benefit scheme for one reason or another. It will take more than a toothbrush on this occasion to satisfy the people concerned. When we were discussing the Social Welfare Bill we referred to the £25,000 cut-off point and I understood the Minister was to bring in regulations which would give some indication of how blunt an instrument that will be. What has the Minister decided? Can he give an exact date of when all this is to happen? Does the Minister think all dentists will become involved in the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I gave the information in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, the Irish Dental Association had the details of the offer and were arranging to ballot their members on it. They held meetings to brief their members and then balloted them informally. The delay has not been on my side but on the side of the Irish Dental Association. The current reason for the delay is the postal dispute. It was always intended, if the offer was accepted, that it would apply from July 1992. That <Col N="372" /> remains the position. As Deputy Connaughton, and others, are aware the cut-off point of £25,000 was referred to in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill. The regulations will not be implemented until we get the formal result from the Irish Dental Association. With regard to the £25,000 income limit, I recognise that a crude cut-off would discriminate against a single income family as against a double income family. The Deputy can take it that there will be some recognition of that in the regulations. If everything goes according to plan this will operate from July.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 33 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter referred to by the Deputy arises as a consequence of section 30 of the Social Welfare Act, 1992. The effect of the legislative change is to extend to workers who systematically work a pattern <Col N="373" /> of work that includes periods of layoffs, such as week on/week off, fortnight on/fortnight off, the restriction on payment of pay-related benefit that has applied since 1983 to workers three days on/two days off or a similar rota each week.</P>
    <P>The extension of the restriction on entitlement to pay-related benefit is in response to the growth of work practices similar in effect to the systematic three-day week which maximised entitlement to unemployment benefit and which were considered unacceptable, particularly where the arrangements were continued over a long period.</P>
    <P>In recent years, it had become apparent that some industries faced with reduced demand had devised work patterns to maximise the social welfare entitlement of their workers through the imposition of a week on/week off or similar pattern of short-time work. Indeed, there were instances of firms which were already engaged in short-time working switching from a short working week to a week on/week off situation. There were instances of overtime working occurring concurrently with short-time working so as to replace earnings lost during the period of temporary lay-off.</P>
    <P>It was considered that the two patterns of short-time working, that is the short working week and week on/week off working, were for all practical purposes identical and, therefore, the same arrangements in regard to benefit entitlements should apply equally to both. Section 30 of the Social Welfare Act, 1992 seeks to achieve that objective. It provides that workers who systematically work a reduced working pattern such as week on/week off or fortnight on/fortnight off are no longer entitled to pay-related benefit while still employed with the same employer.</P>
    <P>The number of persons claiming unemployment benefit on a systematic short-time basis prior to the introduction of section 30 was approximately 6,500. It is estimated that up to an additional 2,000 claimants will lose their entitlement to pay related benefit. The saving to the <Col N="374" /> Exchequer which will arise in 1992 is estimated to be of the order of £1 million.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate the average weekly loss to those affected by section 30. The maximum weekly entitlement and consequential loss to those affected is £17.40. The maximum loss arises where weekly earnings reach or exceed £220. The loss for those on lower earnings is proportionately less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the havoc his new policy has created in sensitive areas, for instance in Waterford Glass and in Dubarry Shoes Ltd. where because of erratic overseas orders they have no alternative but to let the workforce go? If they do not, they will have redundancies on their hands. For the sake of £1 million the Minister has upset the applecart. This proposal has not been thought out and will create more redundancies. There is a ground-swell of opinion among those industries genuinely involved in overseas marketing that even though workers who paid their PRSI and work two or three days a week, when they need help most they are not entitled to pay related benefit. That is something the Minister will have to examine. Indeed I hope he is aware of what is happening around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says. I spoke about this matter on a number of occasions in the course of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1992. I might reiterate that, since 1983, people on a short working week &mdash; that is three days on, two days off &mdash; were disallowed pay-related benefit and have been in that position since then. But people who worked one week on and one week off, or under similar working arrangements, continue to qualify for pay-related benefit. To all intents and purposes both systems of working are similar. Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill, 1992, people who are working say, one week on/one week off, will be treated the same as people on a short working week since 1983; that is fair and equitable. We estimate that there <Col N="375" /> will be approximately 2,500 people affected this year.</P>
      <P>In fairness to Deputy Connaughton I should say the majority of those workers are in Waterford Crystal. But I am not prepared to accept that whatever may be the difficulties being experienced in Waterford Crystal &mdash; whatever they may have been in the past or will be in the future &mdash; they arise from the change outlined in section 30 of the Social Welfare Bill, 1992. Deputy Brian O'Shea recently raised on the Adjournment the matter of the Waterford Crystal workers when this change came into effect. I gave examples of the earnings of people in Waterford Crystal and said that the maximum loss there can be is £17.40 per week. Whatever may be the difficulties experienced, particularly in the case of Waterford Crystal, where the majority of workers are affected, it does not arise as a result of a change in the legislative provision. I do not, nor will I accept that it has anything to do with the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill, 1992, or decisions taken by me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 5 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>Section 31 of this year's Social Welfare Act increases from 6 weeks to 9 weeks the disqualification period for receipt of unemployment benefit which applies in certain circumstances and provides that the claimant's overall entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reduced by the period of the disqualification. This measure came into effect on 6 April 1992.</P>
      <P>Since 1986 the nine weeks penalty clause has applied in the case of claimants for disability benefit in certain circumstances. For example, the penalty is imposed where the person renders himself incapable of work through his own misconduct or does not make himself available for medical examination when requested.</P>
      <P>The recent legislative change will also affect persons under the age of 55 years who receive a severance payment in excess of a fixed amount. The level of severance payment will be specified in regulations which I will be making shortly following consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>A person intending to claim maternity benefit but who, in the meantime, is made redundant will also be affected by the nine weeks' disallowance subject to the severance payment being in excess of the prescribed amount. Maternity benefit will not be payable in such cases as the person was redundant at the time of the claim. However, the person may be eligible for receipt of unemployment benefit at the termination of the nine weeks' period of disallowance.</P>
      <P>Public service workers who are insured at the modified rate of PRSI are not covered for unemployment benefit and are not, therefore, affected by the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>In view of the uncertainty surrounding the manner in which these decisions will be taken, can the Minister say whether or not the level of earnings will apply to the statutory amount of redundancy payment plus negotiated settlements or additional payments negotiated by trade unions? That is most <Col N="377" /> unclear at present and is holding up and interfering with negotiations pending in quite a number of areas between trade unionists and employers. Furthermore will he say whether the regulations issued on 6 April have been circulated to employment exchanges and their implications fully understood by the public, because I have no knowledge that people are so aware?</P>

      <P>Deputy Bell has posed two separate questions. Regulations are not being made in regard to the amount of severance payment in the case of redundancy to which the provisions of this section will apply. I promised in the course of the debate on the Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1992, to have discussions with the social partners. I will do so shortly and, thereafter, will fix a level above which these new rules will apply. There should not be any confusion at present regarding redundancy settlements, since the particular section of the Social Welfare Bill, 1992, merely refers to a severance payment above an amount to be prescribed; there is no ambiguity about it. For example, we did not enter into the area of statutory, negotiated or voluntary severance payments; the severance payment will be above a prescribed amount, call it what you will &mdash; severance, redundancy or whatever &mdash; but there will be no distinction drawn between them. I undertook at that stage to meet the social partners, which I shall do shortly, and will then fix the regulations, in which the relevant amount will be prescribed, so that the new regulations will apply from that date.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the present disqualification of six weeks is being extended to nine weeks, taking into account the length of time it takes to have an appeal lodged and heard by an appeals officer, effectively that means somebody could wrongfully be deprived of benefit for several months after disqualification takes place.

      <P>I signed a bilateral Social Security Agreement between Ireland and the United States of America in Washington on 14 April 1992.</P>
      <P>I welcome this agreement which will give pensions to people who have worked and paid social security contributions in both Ireland and the United States of America. In the first few years alone some 1,500 people will receive pensions from both Ireland and the United States of America and the number will continue to grow each year after that. This agreement will ensure that our emigrants have the protection of the social welfare system for old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widow's contributory allowance and death grant in Ireland and similar benefits in the United States of America.</P>
      <P>In addition to protecting pension entitlements, the agreement also contains provisions to determine the country to which employment contributions are payable where workers are temporarily seconded to work in Ireland or the United States. These provisions will ensure that double liability for social insurance contributions does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement will shortly be submitted to Dáil Éireann for approval. It is <Col N="379" /> expected that it will come into operation in late 1993, when the constitutional and legal requirements on both sides have been completed.</P>

      <P>The attendant publicity surrounding the announcement of the signing of this unilateral agreement was favourable on the part of many people nationwide who had experienced many problems in this area over many years. I sincerely hope this latest proposal will free up the system. In the case of Irish nationals who may have worked in America for short periods a long time ago &mdash; I am thinking of people who may have worked six, seven or eight years there 15 or 20 years ago &mdash; what will this new agreement mean to them? In the case of people who may have paid into the social security systems in both countries, if it is found that they have over-subscribed, will the Minister say whether it will be possible for them to recoup some of their contributions whenever they are of no use to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the first question posed by Deputy Connaughton, the purpose of this Bilateral Social Security agreement is to cover the people he mentioned earlier, say, people who may have worked in the United States many years ago for four or six years, who would not have built up sufficient entitlements under the United States law in respect of social welfare entitlements there, who would have returned to Ireland and are now working here. This agreement effectively will take into account the social security record of a person, when he or she worked in the United States, including the period for which they worked here; those two contributory periods will be amalgamated, so that they will receive a <i>pro rata</i> pension from the United States or one from here, or a mix of both. The purpose of this agreement, which is quite detailed, is that nobody who may have paid contributions will lose out by having worked in the United States or here. It should considerably benefit the people to whom the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>In regard to this reciprocal arrangement, would the Minister say whether the same penalty clause is provided as applies in the case of EC countries, whereby a person who works in the United Kingdom or any other EC member state, returns here and signing on for unemployment benefit, has to show proof of a minimum of one working stamp on their insurance record here before they can qualify for benefit? Has that penalty been included in this reciprocal agreement?</P>

      <P>In order that people will not be confused about this agreement I should point out that basically it relates to retirements and survivor pensions. The requirement to which the Deputy has referreed has given rise to considerable confusion in the case of people who worked in England and who have returned here. I have heard much about this requirement and it will be examined by my Department. This agreement relates to old age contributory pensions, retirement pensions, widows' pensions, etc. The matter to which the Deputy referred is not addressed in this agreement. This agreement is not similar to the agreement operated within the European Community; this is a social security agreement covering pensions, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> May I ask the Minister if a minimum contribution has to be made under either system? Obviously different systems are operated in Ireland and the United States and there are different retirement ages. Will an average contribution have to be worked out? In other words, how many contributions must one have to get a minimum <i>pro rata</i> pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to get additional information for the Deputy on the exact details. An Irish person in the United States has, effectively, to have worked for ten years before he can get any kind of a pension &mdash; it is referred to there as 40 quarters. I am not claiming to be an expert in this area but many <Col N="381" /> people have not worked for that length of time. Deputy Connaughton referred to a person who has worked for six years. The contributions that person made during those years do not entitle him to receive anything under present United States law. This will have to be taken into account in deciding whether a person should get a <i>pro rata</i> pension in the United States or here, or whether they should be mixed together and paid in one country.</P>
      <P>This agreement will also be of considerable benefit to the few thousand United States pensioners living here. When this agreement comes into effect, they will also become eligible for a range of benefit schemes here &mdash; for example, free travel &mdash; which do not exist in the United States. Another advantage of the agreement is that it is not only Irish people who will benefit; when the agreement comes into effect United States pensioners living here will qualify for a range of other benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House whether the plight of illegal emigrants working in the United States was considered in any great depth during the negotiations on this reciprocal agreement? Can he confirm whether an illegal emigrant who worked in the United States for some years will be able to buy into one of the pension schemes here when he returns in order to compensate him for the years he worked illegally in the United States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not. People who are working illegally in the United States do not come within the social security system and are not covered by this agreement. I take the point the Deputy has made. The problem of illegal emigrants in the United States should resolve itself in time with the issuing of the Morrison visas. As I said, I take the Deputy's point but nothing can be done about this problem because the people to whom he referred are not part of any system. I am afraid these people will not benefit under this agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of anomalies in the treatment of cohabiting couples as compared with married couples under the social welfare system have been removed in recent years, following a Supreme Court judgement in 1989.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the treatment of households of different types within the social welfare system was the subject of the report of a review group who were set up following that judgement. That report has been published and submissions have been invited from interested parties.</P>
      <P>In the light of the views received I will be examining what further changes need to be made in the system. The desirability of consistency as between the tax and social welfare systems in the treatment of households will be among the considerations to be taken on board in that context. The question of changes in the tax system in relation to cohabiting couples is, of course, a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a matter for social welfare investigating officers to decide whether people are cohabiting. This matter will have to be left to their discretion. They have to operate under certain guidelines but it is a matter for them to form an opinion at any particular stage as to whether a couple are cohabiting. I do not think it would be practical to draft regulations or to ask people specific questions. This would not be the appropriate way of dealing with the matter. It is left to the social welfare investigating <Col N="383" /> officer to form an opinion as to whether a couple are cohabiting and this is open to appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sad fact of life that divorce is not recognised in this country. As a result more and more couples are cohabiting. Would the Minister not agree that there is something dishonest in the system operated by successive Governments which deems cohabiting couples to be the spouses of one another for social welfare purposes &mdash; this means their social welfare entitlements will be less &mdash; but not spouses of one another for taxation purposes? It is time the Minister, a self-proclaimed liberal, used his influence in the Cabinet to ensure that we are seen as a modern country with modern legislation and that both our Finance Acts and Social Welfare Acts are interpreted in a fair way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may or may not surprise the Deputy to hear that I agree with what he said. In the social welfare area, for which I am responsible, a cohabiting couple are regarded as a married couple. As Deputies know, this change was more or less forced upon us by the judgment delivered in 1989 in the Hyland case. With regard to taxation, this is a matter for the Minister for Finance. I should point out that the present system is also of concern to me and I should like the income tax laws, as they apply to cohabiting couples, to be changed. It is only fair to say that we will have to await the publication of the White Paper on marital breakdown before any decisions can be made in this area. My views on this aspect of Irish life are well known and I will use my influence to ensure the introduction of a realistic set of laws in relation to marital breakdown. I am afraid I am only one of a large number of people in this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 11, 18, 24, 26 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Changes in recent years in the range of supports for children under the social welfare system have been designed to direct any available resources in the most effective way to assist families in greatest need, while simplifying as far as possible the range of supports available.</P>
      <P>The rates of child dependant allowances payable with social welfare weekly supports have been increased significantly. From July 1992 the minimum allowance will be £12.50 per week. The number of separate child dependant allowances has been reduced from 36 to three.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the additional costs of children over 18 in full time education, particularly for people on long term payments, the age limit of 18 was raised to 21 in these cases, including the long term unemployed. A back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme was introduced and this is of considerable assistance to families dependent on social welfare payments. The rates of the allowance this year will be £35 for each child in primary school and £50 for a child in secondary school. This allowance can be paid up to 21 years if the child is in full-time education and the claimant is getting a pension or other long term social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have been made in the family income supplement scheme which assists low income families at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as child benefit is concerned the higher rate of benefit was extended to the fourth and subsequent children in families. There was a general 5 per cent increase in child benefit rates from October 1990. Inflation since then has been 4.5 per cent. The total amount of social welfare expenditure directed specifically towards children is estimated to be over £500 million annually. Under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social <Col N="386" /> Progress</i> an additional £69 million in 1990 terms will be devoted to child income support over the ten year period of the programme. Increases in child benefit are expensive, in that it is paid in respect of all children. The question of increases in child benefit has to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to how the necessary resources can be made available. To the extent that resources can be provided, the child benefit scheme is an effective way of directing resources to families and avoids the possible disincentives associated with more selective approaches. It is important, therefore, that we look at the whole range of payments in respect of children and try to devise a system which is equitable and efficient in the use of resources. The issues raised by the Deputies will be among those to be borne in mind in devising a system of child income support which directs resources most effectively where they are most needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is the Minister aware that at £12.50 the current minimum social welfare allowance for children is totally inadequate in so far as it fails to meet even the basic calorific requirements of teenage children, as stated in a report by Dr. Lee and Dr. Gibney? Would the Minister, therefore, agree that children aged between 12 years and 18 years place costly dietary demands on their parents? Will the Minister accept that, taking into account the increasing demands by teenagers for pocket money and clothes, we must address in a serious and dedicated way the fact that it is extremely costly to rear children in that age group and that payments do not in any great way assist parents with large families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report prepared by Dr. Lee and Dr. Gibney to which the Deputy referred. It deals with the patterns of food and nutrient intake in a suburb of Dublin with chronically high unemployment. Undoubtedly, what the Deputy has said is correct. This report acknowledges that younger children have lower energy <Col N="387" /> needs and, therefore, it is not as costly to provide for their needs as for those of older children, as anybody with a growing family will appreciate.</P>
      <P>There are now only three levels of child dependant allowance as against 36 some years ago. The lowest level is now £12.50 and the highest is £16.60 &mdash; I am not sure about the latter figure. This matter must also be taken in the context of the other supports provided by the Government in respect of children. We cannot consider the child dependant allowance as part of unemployment benefit. There are also other schemes to be considered, including the child benefit scheme. Most people know that this is one area of social welfare where 99.9 per cent of the money goes to the people to whom it is directed. If we were to increase child benefit we would have to consider all these schemes and other matters which political parties, and politicians, may not be prepared to consider. It would be possible to devote more resources to the child benefit scheme if certain decisions were taken. Child benefit allowance is given to everybody irrespective of income.</P>

      <P>As I said in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, I will consider the whole range of child dependant allowances and other schemes with a view to devising a more efficient way of directing resources to those who most need them, the people on the lower end of the poverty line. They should be receiving the money rather than those earning high incomes.</P>

      <P>As a father of a large family I should declare interest in this matter. I put it to the Minister that as a country we do not deserve the reputation which we claim as being a family orientated country. The benefits and allowances available for children are ludicrous compared to those in other European countries. Would the Minister accept <Col N="388" /> that, from the point of view of a taxpayer in relatively low paid employment, the low rate of child benefit coupled with the fact that this person has no access to a child dependant allowance or child tax allowance results in that person being at a disadvantage by working compared with people on social welfare? There is need for a fundamental review, not just in the Minister's Department but also in regard to tax to ensure that people with families, particularly those on relatively low pay, are given greater encouragement and support in caring for their children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Deputy said. As regards people at work on very low incomes, they can be at a considerable disadvantage compared with people with a large number of children who are not working. That is where the family income supplement comes into play. As has been pointed out, it is possible that everybody who is entitled to benefit under this scheme does not apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that we spend approximately £500 million annually on child income support, which is not an unreasonable figure given the state of the economy and wealth creation here. The Deputy has raised some interesting points. As I said, we should consider the question of child income support as well as that of taxation. As regards the child benefit scheme, I came to the conclusion some years ago that, regardless of whether people are on a high or a low income, the women of the country expect that money for themselves, regardless of whether they live in the plush parts of Dublin or in the poorer parts of County Kildare. I agree that that is recognition for their contribution to the home. If we concentrated on taxing people on higher incomes it would release more resources, but whether that would be acceptable I am not sure. However, I am certain it is not possible to means test the child benefit <Col N="389" /> scheme. I am reviewing this and I will bear in mind the suggestions of Deputies. I recognise that people on very low incomes, and on the basic rate of social welfare, find it very difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, I would be very much in favour of going down that road.</P>

It has been considered by other Governments in the past and Ministers have put forward various ideas. I just put forward one idea and the idea the Deputy has put forward is another way of doing this. It must be remembered, however, that a tax allowance for children is of no benefit to the unemployed person because he cannot avail of tax allowances. I am prepared to consider any ideas put forward by Deputies or other interested groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will recapitulate, with the permission of the Chair, on the allowances for this category. A family on social welfare will not continue to receive child benefit after the child reaches 18 years of age. Has the Minister made any concessions to this category? Our point is that children are remaining at home for a much longer period as a result of the transitional year in school. Will the Minister ensure that parents in receipt of social welfare will continue to receive the child dependant allowance after the child's 18th birthday?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister stood up in this House and said that the only way he can get the money to target children is by taxing child benefit. If the Minister is so concerned about children why did he not increase child benefit in the budget this year? Has the Minister read the pre-budget submission from the Combat Poverty Agency, because they state the payment <Col N="391" /> for children from birth to 11 years should be set at £16 and that the payment for children aged between 12 and 21 should be £20? This is precisely the point I have been arguing for &mdash; graduating payments &mdash; because more financial assistance is required for the older child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I did not say anything about taxing child benefit allowance. What I said in the House today, as I said previously in the Seanad, is that when people ask us to provide more money for particular schemes, we must find some way of raising it. I cannot pull it out of the sky. In response to questions I said this is an area that could be looked at. I became Minister for Social Welfare after the budget and I was not a Minister prior to the budget when the decision was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read that report of the Combat Poverty Agency and the various reports that have made the case for increased payments for older children. However, if we wish to graduate payments, it will cost money, which we must get from somewhere else. If we are going to make graduated payments, do we start from the present basis or do we start at a lower rate for younger children, because I do not think that would be acceptable? There is considerable merit in graduating payments &mdash; this has been discussed on other occasions &mdash; and I do not deny this at all. I could introduce a system of graduated payments by reducing child dependant allowances now but I do not think that would be acceptable to anybody.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the number of young single men and women who have been refused unemployment assistance for each of the past five years due to the fact that their parents were working and thereby were refused benefit on a means test basis; the numbers for the same period who were granted reduced benefit; if he has any plans to review this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the items which is assessed as means for unemployment assistance purposes is the value of free board and lodgings which an applicant may enjoy. This most often arises in the case of applicants living in the family home with their parents. It covers the value of accommodation, meals, support and maintenance as well as generally sharing in the standard of living of the household and facilities which the household enjoys. The assessment achieves a degree of equity as between applicants in different household circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that of single people in receipt of unemployment assistance about a quarter have their payment reduced because of the free board and lodgings assessment. Provision was made in 1991 for a minimum payment of £5 per week where a claimant's only means consist of board and lodgings. It is not possible to say how many applicants do not qualify for unemployment assistance because of the free board and lodgings assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the assessment can result in people not qualifying for payment or getting a low rate of payment, the system does recognise the fact that some people have the benefit of free board and lodgings and to that extent are not in need of assistance in the same way as people who do not. The abolition of the free board and lodgings assessment would have major financial implications. I am <Col N="393" /> examining the question of rationalising means tests generally and in that regard I will be examining the scope for easement of the assessment in these cases, particularly in the case of older applicants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an old, thorny question. This is very frustrating for young people. As the Minister will remember, we discussed this issue during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1992. Is the Minister aware that when young people are refused social welfare benefit on the grounds of the value of free board and lodgings which they enjoy at home, the vast bulk leave home and rent accommodation which is subsidised up to £35 per week by the community welfare officers? Would it not be better if the young people stayed at home and received the basic rate of unemployment assistance, because this would save the State and the Department a substantial amount of money in rent subsidies and at the same time relieve the local authorities of the pressure to house families who can no longer avail of accommodation in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what is happening. When people live at home one of the items assessed as means is the value of board and lodgings but when they leave home they are entitled to full unemployment assistance together with a supplementary allowance to meet the cost of their rent. This costs the State a considerable amount of money. This problem, which I have to admit is increasing, has been brought to our attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Bill, 1992, we have made some provisions to ensure that people do not abuse the system in that regard. I accept the genesis of what the Deputy says because in a great many cases it is costing the State more money than to pay the young person the basic rate of unemployment assistance. It should be recognised that the assessment of benefit takes account of the type of households people live in. If the parents are very well off, the young person is regarded as having a greater benefit and privilege than people living in poorer circumstances. <Col N="394" /> In fact, the assessment of board and lodgings does not come into play if the young person's parents are on unemployment assistance, or low rates of social welfare payments. There are anomalies in the system which are resulting in the problems the Deputy has outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in some cases means test assessments for young people is resulting in payments as low as 50p per week and that some times, in rural areas they have to travel miles on public transport to collect it?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am glad to say the Minister appreciates the difficulty outlined by Deputy Bell with whom I agree 100 per cent on this. A family may appear well off in theory but if the father is in receipt of a high income he is taxed to the hilt. After he meets the various households expenses, his disposable income is limited. In one case an assessment of £39 was made for board and lodging. This form of assessment should be averaged down to, perhaps, £10 per week. A nominal charge should be put on board and lodgings because the present system is grossly unfair to young people who have to mix around with others of their own age group who are employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>As pointed out in the newspaper article referred to, I am aware of the reluctance of some social welfare recipients to take up employment, or even part-time employment, because of the risk of losing their secondary social welfare benefit such as the fuel allowance, butter vouchers, Christmas bonus, medical card and differential rents.</P>
      <P>I am determined, however, to maintain the real value of social welfare benefits while still promoting the incentive to work. In this regard, the family income supplement scheme has proved to be a valuable incentive mechanism for families on low pay by encouraging them to continue in employment.</P>
      <P>The question of disincentives has also been addressed in the context of the area-based partnerships established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Local companies have been established in 12 pilot areas with a history of high unemployment. There are an estimated 25,000 people who are currently long term unemployed in these areas. The companies are responsible for monitoring and evaluating local initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only last week, the Taoiseach announced special measures to improve the position of long term unemployed people in the designated areas. These measures include the payment by my Department, for a period of 12 months, of the allowance equivalent to unemployment payments to a person who is <Col N="397" /> starting a business and whose project has been approved by the local company. The object of this arrangement is to ensure a family income while the new business is getting underway. In addition, the long term unemployed person starting their own business will be able to retain the secondary benefits associated with their social welfare payment for a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>A person who takes up paid employment will also be able to retain their secondary social welfare benefits subject to satisfying an upper income limit which is to be specified by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance. Furthermore, those participating in recognised education, training and employment or work experience programmes will be able to retain their secondary social welfare benefits for the duration of the programme.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, within the context of the area partnerships, these measures will greatly assist in removing what are perceived as strong disincentives to taking up employment. In the longer term, the question of a more coherent and co-ordinated linking of the tax and welfare systems will have to be considered and the issue is now to be looked at by the central review committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in regard to the carrot he is offering to the long term unemployed the reality is that these people are expected to find their own employment, to become self employed and to comply with numerous conditions, not least of which is sanction under one of the 12 pilot projects and that, instead of 25,000 people being taken off the live register, the net result will be that no more than a couple of hundred people will be taken into employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that there are 25,000 people long term unemployed in these areas. I would be delighted to think that 25,000 people would be taken off the live register as a <Col N="398" /> result of the initiative announced last week but, of course, that will not be the case. The 12 pilot areas were designated following consultation with the social partners and resulted from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The twelve areas were chosen because they are areas of long term unemployment. We intend to try the partnership approach in those areas. Many people are afraid to take a risk by going into the employment market or starting their own business because they fear if they do that and earn a few bob they will lose their medical card entitlement and many social welfare benefits. The Taoiseach announced last week that we recognise this fear and that the whole purpose of the pilot projects is to recognise the difficulties people have and see whether the idea will work. I am very hopeful it will work but we will have to wait and see at the end of the period.</P>

      <P>When discussing that particular part of the Social Welfare Act, 1992, I did recognise that difficulty but I have preached long and hard about incentives for people to get out into the employment market. Yes, there is a problem with the section of the Social Welfare Act to which I have referred but it is not part of this question. I do not want to go over that area again but the whole question of disincentives cannot be looked at in isolation. The idea put forward last week involves 12 pilot areas with a history of high unemployment. We will look at the outcome and base our future plans on this.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach should be the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for Social Welfare should be the Taoiseach. We are hearing two contradictory ways of how to get the long term unemployed back to work. Would the Minister not agree that there is absolute inconsistency between what was announced by the Taoiseach, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the ability of people to retain secondary payments if they come off assistance, and the Minister's own Social Welfare Bill where people are being penalised and forced to work in the black economy? Those who heretofore were allowed to sign off for a day or two days in the week and earn a few bob which was not accountable for means testing, will now be subject to a means test which did not exist before. On the other hand, there is this big announcement by the Taoiseach. Does the Minister not see inconsistency there? Finally, how many people does the Minister think will take up full-time self-employment as a result of the projects announced?</P>

The area-based response to long term unemployment is a pilot initiative under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Companies have been set up in these areas and one of the ideas to come forward was that if people were allowed to retain their secondary benefits they might be encouraged to start their own businesses or go back into the employment market if employment was <Col N="400" /> available.

      <P>The rate of old age contributory pension payable to any person is related to the average of contributions paid or credited over his insured lifetime. Where the average is 48 or more, full pension is paid. Reduced pensions are paid for averages below 48, down to a minimum of 20.</P>
      <P>The 1988 Social Welfare Act made provision for the payment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for averages below 20 in the case of certain people who were brought back into compulsory insurance in 1974 when the upper earnings limit for social insurance was abolished. These were people who had a record of insurance after 1974 but failed to qualify for old age contributory pension because their insurance record prior to 1974 was intermittent due to the operation of the limit. The number of people in receipt of these <i>pro rata</i> pensions under this arrangement at the end of March 1992 was 133.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1991 made provision for the payment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for averages below 20 in the case of people who have &ldquo;mixed&rdquo;<Col N="401" /> insurance, that is a mixture of full rate and modified rate insurance and whose average of full rate insurance was inadequate to qualify for a pension. Under regulations introduced in November 1991 a <i>pro rata</i> pension is payable to such people in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age contributory pension purposes. The number of people receiving payment of a mixed insurance pro-rata old age contributory pension at the end of March 1992 was 184.</P>
    <P>Under the EC regulations on social security for migrant workers, <i>pro rata</i> pensions are payable where a person does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of old age contributory pension by virtue of Irish social insurance alone and who has been insured in another member state. Under the regulations the Irish and EC contributions are combined to satisfy the contribution conditions and an Irish <i>pro rata</i> pension is then payable. The number of people in receipt of a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory EC pension at the end of March 1992 was 3,397.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the whole area of conditions for entitlement to pensions is being examined at present by the National Pensions Board in the context of their final report on the future development of pensions. The question of extending further the facility of <i>pro rata</i> pensions will need to be considered in the light of the board's recommendations in this area. I expect to receive the board's report shortly.</P>

      <P>Since there are quite a number of people with an average of between 15 and 20 contributions, will the Minister take into account the contributions those people made prior to 1953? That year is the cut-off point that causes a problem for a number of these people who, if they could take into account contributions made before that, would find their average increased well beyond 20.</P>

      <P>It would be as well to await the report of the National Pensions Board. If there is one Deputy in this <Col N="402" /> House who over a long number of years has made a good case for <i>pro rata</i> pensions, etc., and brought it to the attention not only of myself but of various Ministers, it is Deputy Durkan. The final report from the National Pensions Board should be received shortly. It is possible that they will go down the road on <i>pro-rata</i> pension but let us remember, as I pointed out before, if we had a strict <i>pro rata</i> pension base many people's rate of pension would go down. To get the maximum rate of contributory pension one must have 48 contributions. If the average is only about 20 it is about £5 a week less while the person with 19 gets none at all. We have made some changes over the years. If we operated a strict <i>pro rata</i> basis many people's pensions would come down and I do not think that would be acceptable either. If the <i>pro rata</i> basis had been applied all along I would not see any difficulty with Deputy Durkan's solution. I am afraid I cannot go into that now but I will await the report which I understand I will see soon, and then I will consider it further.</P>
      <P>The matters the Deputy raised in relation to &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; insurance have been alleviated through various Acts. Hopefully this is the last area where there is trouble and we will be able to find a way out of that.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that effectively people on pensions as per the 1953 date of retirement can very often have smaller pensions than those who are on a non-contributory pension who paid nothing into the system?</P>

      <P>There are many anomalies. A person who has worked and has more insurance contributions over the years may not qualify because he does not have an average of 20 and will not get any pension at all, whereas another person who entered into insurance later in life will be able to qualify. Nobody could defend that but it is an area that is very complex and costly and hopefully we will be able to solve it.</P>

      <P>Before the break I emphasised the fact that the Treaty on European Union is a further step in a process which was initiated on 1 January 1973 after an overwhelming 83 per cent vote by our people in favour of it. This is the third such Treaty; the people agreed to the Treaty of Rome in 1972, we entered the Community in 1973 and the Single European Act was agreed to by a majority of the Irish people in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1973 when we entered the Community we made a decision on sharing our sovereignty. That process has started and this is another step in it. It is essential in an inter-dependent world that sovereignty is shared in the manner in which we now share it with 11 other European countries. Central, Northern and Eastern <Col N="445" /> Europe now see the wisdom of the European Community as a pole of economic activity and social development. A number of countries are now seeking to join that Community fully or to be associated with it in some other manner.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years we have become part and parcel of this Community of 350 million people in which the law making body &mdash; or council &mdash; is composed of the representatives of the Twelve member governments. It is in our national interest to maintain full membership of this democratic club; it is not in our national interest to be part-time or second rate club members. We must be full members to make full use of the funds, advice, markets &mdash; and access to those markets &mdash; which results from full membership. Above all, our sovereign right to join in the decision-making of the Community flows from full membership. If we were not in the Community &mdash; or if we were second-class participants which would result from a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote &mdash; we would not be in a decision-making position. We would not be able to make our case within the Councils of the European Community. That is the great strength of full membership and why it is imperative for us, in the national interest, to register a very substantial &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum in order to ensure that we will continue to take our place to the fullest extent possible within the Councils of the European Community and so orientate policies, where necessary, in our direction and to our national advantage. Otherwise we are merely looking in; it is much better to be inside taking part in the action. From 1 January next we hope to have free access to what has been agreed in negotiations, a single market, the largest and strongest consumer market in the world with a prospect of exporting our goods and services without any hindrance in this market which already takes 75 per cent of our exports.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a point which is relevant to our position in relation to jobs. Investment in jobs for the future will occur only on the basis of a stable access to this market. The main selling point that the <Col N="446" /> Industrial Development Authority have in their pursuit of investment is that this country is in a favourable position within a single market to be strengthened by economic, monetary and political union. Within that market we present an attractive location for Japanese, American and other outside investors in this country. It is because of the access to that large market that industries will locate here; they will not do so on the basis of our own home market. Therefore, if we are to make any dent or improvement in relation to jobs in the years ahead it is essential to be inside the Community where we can attract the required investment to avail of our export access to that market and to establish units of industrial or service activities here which can make use of our location within the area of European Union.</P>
    <P>European Union will represent the main attraction for potential investments in the future, using Ireland as a base for operations within the Community. The European Union Treaty has as its central aim economic and monetary union as a logical follow on from the Single Market which will obtain from 1 January next. This economic and monetary union is aimed at a single currency, an important aspect from the point of view of our export transactions and price stability and from the point of view of our exporters and production here. This single currency and price stability is guaranteed by exchange and budgetary policies which will be organised within the economic and monetary union in the framework of a European central banks system.</P>
    <P>Other aspects in the Treaty are important. There is a new section on citizenship of the union, which is not mentioned often. All citizens of member states will be citizens of the union with the right to move freely throughout the whole union territory and will have the right to diplomatic protection from all member states. There are Articles authorising the Community to have common policies on education, professional training, youth culture, public health, protection of consumers, <Col N="447" /> European networks, the environment, research and &mdash; the important new policy for Ireland &mdash; cohesion.</P>
    <P>Thankfully from our point of view, the Treaty must be viewed as one package because it contains provisions for extra Structural and new Cohesion Funds to cater for social requirements, including education and health, as well as commitments already undertaken in regard to roads and telecommunications. In particular, our education system requires much greater funding which we cannot afford in order to interlink with our training programmes, already financed to some extent from the Social Fund. The real issue which should be faced is that huge moneys are needed to put our system of education into top gear. The development of the human resources of our young people to the maximum extent should be our priority policy target and we can only obtain the money required for this purpose from European sources.</P>
    <P>The European Union Treaty also recognises the reality that one cannot separate politics from economics. It proposes a common foreign and security policy within the democratic framework and common citizenship of a new Europe in which the old military barriers of the Cold War have already disappeared. It is important to recognise that our neutral friends in Sweden, Finland, Austria and Switzerland are preparing to join this enlarged Europe. We welcome them as countries with the same commitment to security co-operation and a peaceful Europe as we have.</P>
    <P>As a purposeful people our future lies in greater involvement in Europe. There is certainly no future in puting the clock back and isolating ourselves as a fringe entity, going nowhere in an increasingly interdependent world. While other countries are applying and clambering aboard the train, surely we will not stand on the platform waiting for Godot while the express train of European Union goes off down the tracks. That is not the sort of future we want for our young people. What do we want and where do we want to be as a people? That is the question <Col N="448" /> facing us. Do we want to be part of a family of countries committed to growing inter-dependence in Europe as a whole or do we prefer to exclude ourselves from that process? As a people we want to be heavily involved with neighbouring countries rather than isolated in a peripheral position, making no contribution to the Community and that Community having no contribution to make to us.</P>
    <P>Before we go to the people with the referendum we must state that the basic choice facing them is between involvement and isolation. I am certain the people will choose the path of involvement rather than isolation and thereby show their maturity in making a positive decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great shame that this is really the first opportunity we have had for a detailed discussion of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. There have been reports, debates and statements in the House in the course of last year but this is the first opportunity Members have had to discuss the contents of the Treaty. That says much about the way the Government handle issues of foreign policy in this House, not just this Government but previous ones. I look forward to the day when a Government decide that they know better than the mandarins in Iveagh House and that issues of foreign policy do not have to be surrounded in a cloak of secrecy and reticence lest we might give away any part of our negotiating position before a debate begins. Others in this House would agree with me on this matter. If the Taoiseach is interested in letting in light or opening shutters or any of the other clichés he has used in this House during the past few weeks, this should be one of the areas to which he should give his closest attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not any doubt that the Maastricht Treaty represents an enormous step forward for the European Community. It builds on 35 years of experience with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, which have proved their worth. It builds on the experience of economic policy and in all the common policies under the Treaty of Rome. It also builds <Col N="449" /> on the experience since 1978 when the European monetary system and the associated exchange rate mechanism were put in place. It is worth remembering that when those proposals were first made by the then President of the Commission, Roy Jenkins, he was laughed at for being too visionary. Now we have a serious Treaty before us which provides for economic and monetary union and, eventually, a single currency and it does not look at all improbable. Nobody regards it as laughable. There is some value even today in looking back to 1978 and recognising the contribution made by Roy Jenkins and his colleagues in the Commission. Undoubtedly we would not be having this debate today if that initiative had not been taken then.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty also builds on the experience over many years of the system of European political co-operation, reinforced by the provisions of the Single European Act. I am delighted the Community is moving forward in this direction. It is building on all these things and on the inclusion of cohesion in the Single European Act, a notion put in there as a result of an initiative of the then Irish Government, of which I had the privilege to be a member. The member states have shown some disposition to build constructively and imaginatively on the basis of what has been achieved so far.</P>
    <P>It would be dishonest of me to pretend that I am anything other than disappointed with the content of the Treaty. Like the Rome Treaty and the Single European Act in their day, this Treaty is too conservative and too timid for its time. I regret that member states have failed to grasp the full implications of the value of what has been achieved so far and the real need in Europe and the world for the European Community to play a greater role and act with greater determination in the economic and political fields. I have no doubt that the provisions of this Treaty, good and constructive as they are, fall short of what the member states of the European Community could achieve if we could only get Governments to rise somewhat above <Col N="450" /> eternal and excessive concern with their national interests and to look at what they can achieve together rather than how much they can hinder each other's ambitions. It is a disappointment in that respect, as were the Rome Treaty and the Single European Act in their day. I am afraid that the European Community, like other politics around the world, shows a worrying lack of self-confidence when it comes to taking the next step along the way in what it sets out to achieve.</P>
    <P>Some things have been recognised. It is clear from the provisions on economic and monetary union and on the single currency, and also from our experience with the 1992 programme and the Single Market, that the member states and their Governments have clearly understood how vital it is for the European Community to improve its capacity to compete with the United States and Japan and particularly with South East Asia. That is where a new competition in the world comes from. The people of all the member states need a European Community that can compete and co-operate more effectively with firms and interests in those countries in order to serve its own people better. I welcome the fact that the Maastricht Treaty gives us some of the tools we need to do that. That is something on which we should reflect.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the proposition that a strong European Community that is effective on world markets provides by far the best framework for further growth and development in this country. It is not the full answer, by any means. If I were to be a pessimist, which I do not like being but one is perforce sometimes, I would have to say that there is a consciousness at the back of my mind that we in this country still have in our own hands the ability to throw away the benefits of a strong European Community. We have not been great at using it so far. In many aspects we have made mistakes in the way we have exploited the opportunities offered to us by the European Community, However, I have no doubt that our position is much better inside <Col N="451" /> the Community than it would be outside it.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the European Community should play a primary role in the politics of Europe. In this regard, I speak not just of the European Community but of the wider Europe that includes the countries of central and eastern Europe, the Balkans and even the States of the CIS, which is where much of the real political interest of the next decade will be centred and from where the threats to stability in our part of the world are more likely to come than anywhere else.</P>
    <P>It is curious to reflect that although from time to time we seem to have a very inadequate view of the importance of the Community's potential role in the world, sometimes people outside seem to have a much clearer vision of what Europe can be and of the role it can play in the world. One evening last week I was travelling to Midleton to speak at a meeting about Maastricht. Until now, I have had the opportunity, as has Deputy Lenihan &mdash; which opportunity I shall shortly lose, unfortunately &mdash; of being able to read when in transit. I was reading a Chinese publication reviewing that country's foreign policy. The publication spoke of the European Community as an actor on the world stage of much greater weight than we ever ascribe to it here. Last summer I spent some time in Czechoslovakia and in Hungary, and in the past couple of years I have had the opportunity to make several very good friends in newly emerging parties in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. Almost universally among those groups, I recognise a view of the European Community that is much more respectful and appreciative of the Community's weight in world politics than is commonly found here in Ireland. That is the reason I sometimes feel a little depressed when I consider issues such as the Maastricht Treaty, listen to the kind of debate that has gone on in this country in the past few months about the Treaty and realise how inadequate is our concept of the political role that can be played by the European Community.</P>
    <P>For my taste, the Treaty is not federalist <Col N="452" /> enough. It is certainly not federalist enough in relation to the Community budget, the size of that budget or the distributive mechanisms and the level of redistribution involved in our structures. In that view I find myself in some very strange company. If I may mention names without giving any offence, people such as Emmet O'Connell and Anthony Coughlan have recently appeared on television complaining that they do not like the Maastricht Treaty because it is not federalist enough. I agree with them on that but we come to different conclusions on the head of it. I do not believe that my disappointment at the lack of real federalism in this Treaty is a reason to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It would be perverse to turn our backs on what is undoubtedly progress compared to the present situation because the step being taken is not big enough. It would be perverse to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; because our ambition is that the European Community be more federalist and more redistributive in the future. At the very least, by being part of the progress &mdash; as Deputy Lenihan said a few minutes ago &mdash; we can continue the fight to make sure that the Community evolves further in that direction. By not being part of that, we would lose any argument we ever had.</P>
    <P>On the other side of that reflection, our experience of having written cohesion into the Single European Act has been a substantial expansion in the Structural Fund. Let us remember the very good debate we had at the time. Indeed, Deputy Lenihan might well remember it because he was against the Single European Act when it was first negotiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what Deputy Michael D. Higgins thought at the time but I seem to recall that he was not too complimentary about it, either. The Single European Act provided for the concept of cohesion to be written into a treaty for the first time. At the time the complaint was made that the provision was not worth the paper it was written <Col N="453" /> on because no amount was shown &mdash; no money was guaranteed and no mechanism was set up in the documentation. What happened? The result, of course, was a substantial expansion in the Structural Fund, which Deputy Lenihan is now delighted to boast about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right, quite an achievement has been made. I conclude that the same experience will follow from the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. Cohesion has now been written even further and more firmly into the treaties. Of course the Treaty does not provide any guarantee of the amount of money that will come or any detailed administrative arrangement for distributing that money. The fact of the matter is that once the commitment is made in the Treaty we can be pretty sure that it will be followed up on. That has been the experience with the Single European Act and I believe that the same logic will apply to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this general order of ideas, it is appropriate to warn against the idea of what I would call the second bite at the cherry theory, which is going around at the moment &mdash; that we should vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty for a series of very confused reasons and that we will have the opportunity to hold another referendum on it before the end of the year. There are all kinds of predictions about what would happen as a result of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote, and I shall come back to some of them later on, but I do not think that anybody in this House or outside it could gainsay my statement that if the Maastricht Treaty is not ratified by all 12 member states no other Treaty negotiated in the wake of that non-ratification would be as federalist as is the Maastricht Treaty. And unsatisfactory as the Treaty is in my view, I believe that the dangers of going backwards are much too great to give any credence or support to that second bite of the cherry theory which is gaining a <Col N="454" /> certain spurious acceptance in the country today.</P>
    <P>This Treaty is not federalist enough, either, in relation to its provisions on a common foreign and security policy and on co-operation on justice and home affairs. On those two issues the Treaty provides for an intergovernmental procedure; all decisions will have to be made unanimously by the representatives of 12 governments. It is not the Council of Ministers formally that will decide those things, the provision is for an intergovernmental procedure. Those issues have come to be known as the second and third pillars of European union &mdash; the first pillar being the direct line of decent from the Treaty of Rome through the Single European Act to economic and monetary union; the second pillar being intergovernmental common foreign and security policy; and the third pillar being intergovernmental co-operation in justice and home affairs.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, and I am very happy to admit it and accept it, that the common foreign and security policy provisions represent considerable progress and a considerable addition to what we had known in the system of European political co-operation as developed under the Single European Act. The difference in this case is one of degree rather than one of kind. We have not set up a new kind of foreign policy dimension for the European Community. What is needed is a different kind of approach. There are arguments which could be used to justify that and every argument justifies the step, limited as it is, that has been taken in relation to a common foreign and security policy in this Treaty. I will give only three examples of cases that show clearly the need for a more coherent, unified foreign policy approach by the Community.</P>
    <P>For a period during the Gulf War member states were pulling in different directions. The European Community, for a large part of that period, did not play the kind of role in the international scene that many of its citizens would have wanted it to play in terms of contributing to a solution. Looking at what is happening <Col N="455" /> today in what used to be Yugoslavia, because of different views among the member states, the European Community was slow to get off the ground and make a positive contribution there. I am not saying that the Treaty would get rid of disagreements between member states, and God forbid that it should, but it would give us a mechanism where the Community would work out differences quickly and could more quickly get into the international field in order to have a beneficial effect. The last example I will gvie that shows the need for the Community to have more effective and efficient levers in the foreign policy area, is this very deep question of the reunification of Germany. If we look at the problems there today and want to indentify one single source of economic problem which has its own <i>retentissment</i> or reverberations in relation to the Maastricht Treaty, it was the decision to fix an exchange rate of parity of one Ostmark to one Deutschemark. That was a political decision made, for reasons which we all understand, in the Federal Chancellory in Bonn. It was a decision that would not have been made by a European Community fully involved in that process. It was a decision that could not be influenced by a European Community that did not have the kind of levers in foreign policy that the CFSP provisions here give us. That is an example of why the European Community needs a more cohesive and unified approach to the definition of its interests, its activity in favour of its own interests and its activity in the world in favour of the objectives that have been set out here in the common foreign and security policy. It is blithely ignored by the anti-Maastricht people that the enunciation in this Treaty of the objectives of a common foreign and security policy, if shown to most Irish people without telling them where they came from, would be accepted as objectives that we should pursue in our foreign policy. I will not bore the House by reading them out.</P>

      <P>When one gets involved in something like this it gets rather absorbing. We have suffered from the fact that the Government have failed to get across some very simple messages about what the Maastricht Treaty is about. Its common foreign and security policy objectives are the same as those most Irish people would have. Its objectives in relation to economic and monetary union are also the same as those most Irish people would have. The Treaty provides for certain disciplines and conditions for participation in economic and monetary union. We qualify now because they are less rigid than they are very often represented as being, but we have to make sure that we continue to qualify. There are things we would have to do anyway. We should have the ambition, or if possible the certainty, that we will keep our current deficit below 3 per cent of GNP. We should have the ambition to get our debt-GNP ratio down towards 60 per cent. We should have the ambition of keeping interest rates as close as possible to the three best in the European Community and of keeping our inflation rates close to the three best in the European Community. We will have to do those things anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that it will be easier to achieve those things with the kind of support we will have within a post-Maastricht Europe. There are all kinds of predictions as to what will happen if we do not ratify this, but one thing, as sure as God made little apples, is that if we do not ratify this Treaty the net transfers to this country will be less than they would have been if the Treaty had been ratified. There is no doubt about that. We would find ourselves having to conform to these economic and fiscal disciplines with a lower level of support. That would create clear budgetary and economic problems <Col N="457" /> for us. For people who are worried about economic discipline, the best answer is to have the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>We have a complication in this and that is this infamous Protocol which I can only describe in the words of another Deputy in this House as being &ldquo;grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented&rdquo;. It should never have been there. It has poisoned the debate for no good reason. I do not know if we will hear any explanation as to why it was put in, but I would like Deputies Haughey and Collins to come into this House and tell us how and why this Protocol came to be there. Whose idea was it? What pressure was put on them? Who did they think they were buying off by putting this Protocol into the Treaty? It would answer Deputy Haughey far better to be in here explaining that than to be sitting out there on the couch at the end of the stairs in deep conversation with Senator Hanafin. This House deserves to know why this Protocol was put in. I followed all the legal arguments that have been made about the possible implications of that Protocol and the only conclusion I can come to is that there is no certainty either way about the effect of this Protocol. It has created a doubt in people's minds. When all the legal arguments have been gone through and have been assessed and when we have seen all the latest coruscations of brilliance from the lawyers, there remains the question. &ldquo;Why is this Protocol there?&rdquo; That is a political question which deserves an answer.</P>

      <P>I will conclude on this. This is much more than just a political question. It is an emotional question. It matters at a very deep emotional level to virtually all the women I have spoken to in the last few weeks and, I am glad to say, to a good many of the men as well. Until there is an answer to that question there will be suspicion and unease. I warned the Government against falling for this siren song of having a substantive <Col N="458" /> amendment to replace Article 40.3.3º. I hope they will heed that warning. I do not know whether this famous tail will wag the dog again. They claim to have done it in relation to Deputy Lenihan and Deputy McDaid. They moved only after this side of the House and my party in particular alerted them to the danger. But I am alerting both parties in Government to this danger: do not fall for that request for what is called an amendment on the substantive issue of abortion. It is nothing more and nothing less than a request from the people who got it wrong in 1983, the people who got it wrong in 1991 to be allowed the honour, privilege and freedom of getting it wrong again. We cannot impose that on the women of this country. We certainly cannot impose that on the European Community that is in every respect an innocent victim of that kind of irredentism and obscurantism raising its head again in this debate, being facilitated by the Government that has this insane Protocol in this Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to touch on four aspects of the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; the amendments tabled by Opposition parties including that relating to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution; the new Treaty provisions on culture; the benefits for women of Community membership and particularly, of the Treaty on European Union and, if time permits, the provisions relating to Economic and Monetary Union and Cohesion.</P>
      <P>On Article 40.3.3º, I will confine my remarks to the relevant amendments put forward by a number of Opposition Deputies to the motion before this House. Part 1 (a) of the amendment put forward by Deputy De Rossa and others proposes that the Maastricht Treaty should be renegotiated so as to secure the deletion of Protocol 17 in order to defend the rights of Irish women. The answer to that is quite simple. It is not an option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 6 April has already made it clear that they will not reopen <Col N="459" /> the Maastricht Treaty or its Protocols because to do so could leave the way open to pressures in other member states for other amendments. It was at that Council that Ireland sought agreement to an intergovernmental conference to amend Protocol No. 17. Our partners were unable to agree to convene such a conference at this stage, while ratification is proceeding in the various member states. This is the issue, this is the obstacle &mdash; convening an intergovernmental conference. According to the most authoritative legal opinion at Community level deletion of the Protocol would also involve an intergovernmental conference and would meet with the same fundamental objection. Despite the speculation of some legal commentators there is no other legal procedure available, apart from an Intergovernmental Conference. It might be said: could not one be invented for an unprecedented situation? This fails to face up to the political basis of our partners' objections to any change in the Treaty now, while their ratification procedures are proceeding: even the Solemn Declaration has led to political pressure in at least one member state to reopen other aspects of the Treaty. I repeat &mdash; deletion of the Protocol is not on: it would definitely require an Intergovernmental Conference and our partners definitely will not agree to an Intergovernmental Conference now on any aspect of the Maastricht Treaty. The Democratic Left should stop playing games, face up to the reality of the situation and have the grace to withdraw this totally unrealistic amendment.</P>
    <P>On this aspect, it is wide of the mark for a second reason: deletion of the Protocol is not necessary to defend the rights of Irish women. The Protocol does not take away rights to travel and information under European law which, of course, is applicable in Ireland. All member states have, in the Solemn Declaration, confirmed that this is the proper legal interpretation which the Protocol will have when the Treaty to which it is annexed comes into force. Some commentators have queried the force of this. <Col N="460" /> It can be taken as certain that all member states consulted their top legal advisers before agreeing the Declaration and while the member states are not the ultimate judicial arbiter, the Declaration must, in these circumstances, have tremendous force. In regard to the force of the Solemn Declaration I would point out that the recent second and favourable Opinion of the European Court of Justice on the legality of the EEA agreement pivoted, essentially, on, not a Solemn Declaration, but a mere entry in the minutes.</P>
    <P>Thus, the Labour Party concern about the Protocol rendering Irish women second-class citizens, which appears to relate to the rights to travel and information available under European law, is also totally misplaced. These rights are available now and will continue to be available after ratification of the Maastricht Treaty even with the Protocol in its present form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The remainder of the Democratic Left amendment is equally unrealistic. Deputy De Rossa, who was, until recently, a member of the European Parliament, knows perfectly well that there is no question of renegotiating the Treaty on the various points raised in the amendment. If he and his colleagues wish to underline how isolated they are from the mainstream of European thinking, including on the Left, that is, of course, their privilege.</P>
      <P>The other amendments to the motion have been tabled by Deputies O'Keeffe and Mitchell. In essence, they propose that we should delay the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill pending the initiation or passage of legislation to amend the Constitution to provide for the rights to travel and information. We do not have any problem with the underlying intention of this amendment but we cannot agree to any delay with the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated the Protocol even in its present form, does not <Col N="461" /> take away rights to travel and information under European law. The doubts which have arisen on travel and information do not stem from the Maastricht Treaty but rather from the recent Supreme Court judgements. While recourse to the European Court of Justice very probably, even now, would vindicate the rights in any particular case, it is through action in Ireland in regard to our Constitution and public policy that the availability of these rights can be directly and generally guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The issues arising from the judgements are highly complex, not least because of the difficulty of dealing with the Supreme Court judgements without adversely affecting the equal right to life of the mother. The Government will not be going down any road that does not uphold the equal right to life of the mother. The Government firmly believe that the logical course is to deal with all aspects together. As soon as the Cabinet Committee have completed their work and the Government have concluded their deliberations, the Dáil, the parties and the public will be fully informed of their conclusions. And as indicated in the White Paper, a Referendum will be held in November next, to deal with the travel and information issues which arise and with any other questions which, on completion of the Government's consideration of the issues raised by the Supreme Court decisions, emerge as necessary and feasible to deal with by constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Now is not the time to deal with these complex issues. Our priority must be to deal with the real economic, social and political issues arising in the Maastricht Treaty. And this is what this debate is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Turning to the importance of the cultural dimension within the European Community, there is, in the <Col N="462" /> Maastricht Treaty, as mentioned by the Taoiseach yesterday, a specific article relating to culture. The adoption of Article 128 was a particular objective of the Taoiseach and the Irish Government. Ireland joined with the Commission in drafting the original proposal for the Article. We were active in all the negotiations leading to the final form of the Article. Until now the absence of a clear legal base for action by the European Community in relation to culture had inhibited the scope, quality and quantity of initiatives taken at Community level. I believe it is important to highlight this new competence and to focus public awareness on the great potential offered by this Article to the benefit of our cultural life.</P>
      <P>Regular meetings in Council of EC Ministers for Culture have resulted in a number of important initiatives being introduced, including the now annual European City of Culture event which saw so many celebrations and events in Dublin during its year of nomination in 1991. Another initiative worthy of mention is the institution of the European literary and translation prizes.</P>
      <P>But the lack of a legal basis enabled the less enthusiastic member states to query the role of the Community and to inhibit its development. The inclusion of the new Article will strengthen the hand of those, like Ireland; who support a more active supportive role by the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not that we want the Community to take over responsibility for policy on culture entirely: absolutely not. The Article refers to the Community contributing to the flowering of the cultures &mdash; note the plural &mdash; of the member states, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore. Action by the Community is to aim at encouraging co-operation between member states and, if necessary, supporting and supplementing their action in a specified range of areas. Thus, there is no complete takeover or homogenisation: on the contrary, there is respect for plurality and diversity but also <Col N="463" /> the potential to bring the resources of the Community to bear in support of cultural creation, something of particular importance for the less wealthy member states, where economic and social needs press heavily on public finances.</P>
    <P>In an important paragraph, which Ireland, with some other member states, fought hard to keep in, the Article provides that:</P>
    <P>The Community shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of this Treaty.</P>
    <P>This provides a legal basis for some national support and protection where otherwise the rigours of the internal market or other Community policies might threaten weaker cultures and languages. In a complementary step, an amendment to Article 92 (3) of the Treaty, dealing with State aids, adds to those that are permitted, aid to promote culture and heritage conservation where such aid does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common interest. While this may appear to hedge the permission about with restrictive conditions, the amendment does afford scope and gives a firm legal basis for State aids in support of cultural activity.</P>
    <P>The potential for developing Community action in cultural matters pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty will be among a number of items discussed at the next meeting in Council of Ministers of Culture which takes place on 18 May. The EC Commission has already been preparing guidelines for cultural action in the years 1992-96 as a basis for discussing an expanded cultural programme in the context of the new Treaty.</P>
    <P>Our concern in the forthcoming discussions with our Community partners will be to ensure that increased resources are allocated to important areas in the cultural sector, such as training in conservation, arts administration and in audiovisual technology; the development of the schemes for translation, especially for lesser-used languages; support for our <Col N="464" /> heritage conservation efforts; encouragement of more active interchange between our arts organisations and arts organisations throughout the Community, and, in particular, measures which would stimulate increased funding by the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is important also for me, in my capacity as Minister of State for Women's Affairs, to take this opportunity to refer to the benefits which the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty will bring for Irish women in particular. I believe all sides in this House would agree that Ireland's accession to the European Community in 1973 brought enormous benefits to the Irish economy in general, but to Irish women in particular. This fact has been acknowledged throughout the years by a wide range of women's groups and by the representative body for all such groups, the Council for the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>Ireland's entry to the EC in 1973 coincided with the very first great leap forward in the development of EC social policy &mdash; a social policy which, it should be recorded here, was inspired and spearheaded by Ireland's first Commissioner, iar-Uachtarán na hÉireann Dr. Patrick Hillery. It was as a result of this EC social policy that enlightened legislation such as the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, were passed by the Oireachtas. Subsequently, directives on equal treatment in occupational social security schemes and for those engaged in self-employed occupations were adopted. Moreover, community law has assisted us greatly in developing such concepts as equal pay for work of equal value, indirect discrimination, and positive action. It also shaped our thinking in realising that, having secured equality of opportunity in law by enactments of the Oireachtas, much remained to be done to secure equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve this important qualitative shift in the equality debate, the Community's two medium-term programmes on equal opportunities between women and men, covering the years 1982 to 1985 and 1986 to 1990, played a pivotal role in directing action by member states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> Moreover, these programmes focused attention on the need to shape policies to tackle structural problems such as the effect of new technologies on women's employment; women's unequal access to vocational training; the impact of the achievement of the Single Market on the services sector where female employment is predominant, and the growth of temporary and atypical work.</P>
    <P>All these activities have served to increase the participation of women in the Irish labour force, and to provide them with national machinery &mdash; in our case, the Employment Equality Agency &mdash; whereby women can be assisted in seeking redress against alleged incidences of discrimination against them in the workplace. Since our accession to the Community, for example, the level of women's participation in training has increased every year, and the contributions to our national training programmes from the European Social Fund have been an important catalyst in this regard. This point is clearly illustrated by the fact that, in 1971, only 5 per cent of trainees in Ireland were women. By 1986, the participation rate of women had risen to 34 per cent. By 1990, women represented 41 per cent for all those completing training. These statistics indicated an increasing level of female participation in the labour force as well as the impact of positive action planning by our national training authority, FÁS.</P>
    <P>In discussing the benefits which EC membership in general has brought for Irish women, I should also mention that Irish women have also benefited from a wide range of interventions sponsored by the European Commission in all member states designed to widen women's occupational choices and to facilitate their participation in the labour market. I speak of the Commission-sponsored networks and programmes dealing with vocational training for women; the diversification of vocational choices for women; local employment initiatives; child care; the more effective application of the legal equality provisions in the member states; positive action strategies; the elimination of sexism in our schools <Col N="466" /> and the integration of an equal opportunity dimension into teacher training in the member states; the portrayal of the image of women in the media, and the position of the women of Europe in the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the EC has led to substantial advances in the position of Irish women in our society, advances which had failed to be made domestically despite the presence in the Constitution, since 1937, of the anti-discrimination Article 40.1. Adoption of the Maastricht Treaty will ensure for Irish women that these advances will never be clawed back, regardless of the economic circumstances at a particular time, but rather they can be built upon and greatly strengthened.</P>
    <P>Adoption of the Treaty will enable Ireland to participate fully in the measures to be taken by the Community in the Third Medium-term Community Action Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 1991-1995. This will build upon the substantial advances achieved for the women of Europe in the previous two programmes. The overall objective will be to promote women's full participation in, and to revalue their contributions to economic and social life. The measures proposed have been articulated around three key issues: implementation and development of Community law; the integration of women into the labour market, and improving the status of women in society.</P>
    <P>In assessing the benefits which adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in June will being for Irish women, I should mention that the Treaty's provisions will bring specific improvements in the Community's decision-making machinery to adopt new measures on equal treatment. The change, whereby such measures will be adopted, under the agreement among 11 member states on social policy, by qualified majority voting, will remove some of the stumbling blocks in the way of further progress on equality issues at Community level. Another new provision in that Agreement of Eleven permits affirmative action to make it easier for women to pursue a career or to <Col N="467" /> prevent or compensate for disadvantages in their professional careers.</P>
    <P>To nail another canard, the Protocol on Social Policy agreed by all 12 member states, makes clear that the Court of Justice and all the other institutions can be fully used to apply the Agreement on Social Policy among 11 member states. This is particularly important because the benefit of access by Community citizens to the Court of Justice is nowhere better exemplified than in regard to equality law pursuant to Article 119 of the Rome Treaty and to the general, steadily developing principle of non-discrimination, where the court's jurisprudence has conferred enormous benefits on women in regard to pay, working conditions, equality under social security and so on. From the decision that Article 119 was directly applicable, through the successive Defrenne cases and its rebuffs to indirect discrimination and on to some of the more recent cases relating to Ireland, the court has graphically underlined the benefits for women in Ireland and elsewhere of membership of the Community. Rejection of the Treaty and, with it, of the Proposal on Social Policy and the Agreement of the Eleven, would deny to Irish women the planned reinforcement of the Community's role in promoting gender equality.</P>
    <P>For all the foregoing reasons I believe that a clear message should be sent to Irish women to the effect that the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in June will continue to bring sustained benefits for them. It will continue to improve their position in Irish society and will increase the important contribution which they can make to the economic and social well-being of our society &mdash; a contribution which, hitherto, too many Irish women have been excluded from making. In my capacity as Minister of State for Women's Affairs I have no hesitation in recommending the Maastricht package for full and enthusiastic endorsement by the women of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should now like to turn to the fourth element to which I referred at the outset, economic and monetary union and cohesion. Economic and monetary union and the Single Market will together give a powerful boost to growth and jobs in the Community. European Monetary Union will maximise the benefits of the Single Market through greater integration of European capital markets and the elimination of exchange rate uncertainty, leading to higher levels of investment. The Commission's study, One Market, One Money, suggested that combined with 1992, European Monetary Union could confer a longer-term gain on the Community of up to 15 per cent of its GDP.</P>
      <P>This projected growth represents a major opportunity for Ireland. We have the second highest level of dependence in the Community on international trade for our livelihood, and the Community now takes over three-quarter of our exports. In other words, Ireland depends on trade for its prosperity and we depend very heavily on the Community for our trade. Any initiatives which make for growth in our biggest market can only be good news for Ireland, because they spell opportunity for our exporters. That is what the Single Market and European Monetary Union set out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has of course been suggested that Ireland will fail to qualify for European Monetary Union but that is simply not true. Indeed, the progress we have made in reducing Exchequer borrowing, setting the national debt-GNP ratio firmly <Col N="469" /> on a downward path and containing inflation means that, as of today, we meet the basic requirements of Maastricht. This is not just an assertion on my part. The EC Council of Finance and Economic Ministers recently carried out an examination of Ireland's programme for economic convergence. They concluded by welcoming the fact that Ireland complied with the objective criteria for the move to the third stage of European Monetary Union. We intend that this should remain the position and, as we saw from 1987 to 1990, strong economic growth is quite possible in parallel with financial discipline, especially where the external climate is supportive, as we expect it to be with European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to cohesion. There was always a risk with European Monetary Union that, on its own it could lead to a widening of disparities between member states, but it is worth underlining that we have narrowed the gap, moving from 59 per cent of the Community average in 1973 to 69 per cent now and it should not be overlooked that the Community average income itself grew very substantially over that period. Opponents of the Treaty cite the Governor of the Central Bank's statement in 1988 that, &ldquo;Ireland did not join the European Community to become the Appalachia of Western Europe&rdquo;. Indeed they frequently distort what he said, to imply that in his view, participation in the Community is leading to such a result. They also refer to Professor Lester Thurow of MIT who said in 1989 that, &ldquo;common markets do not ensure even economic development&rdquo;. I could not agree more with these sentiments, so long as they are not distorted.</P>
    <P>It was precisely for these kind of reasons that the Government insisted that the Maastricht Treaty should contain strong commitments on economic and social cohesion, which would help ensure that the benefits of growth under European Monetary Union would be shared among member states. European Monetary Union and cohesion are two sides of the same coin. The one ensures <Col N="470" /> growth, the other makes for balanced growth.</P>
    <P>The Government's efforts to ensure against the risks inherent in European Monetary Union were highly successful. Time limitations prevent me from setting out fully the relevant provisions of the Treaty and the accompanying Protocol on Cohesion. They are, in any case, set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The European Community is above all a success story in a difficult international environment. That is why it has expanded over time to include new members and that is why so many other European countries, whether from the EFTA group or the former Eastern bloc, wish to join. It would be a tragedy if, at a time when the Community is once again on the move and when so many other European countries are poised to join, Ireland were to stand aside. We would then risk becoming the land that Europe forgot. That is not a prospect which I would welcome. Our future lies in Europe. With the Maastricht Treaty, the Community is equipping itself to meet the challenges ahead. We will face those challenges and we must face them together with our Community partners. That calls for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to participate in this debate. I contribute as a Member representing the inner city of Dublin, Dublin Central. I am also glad to speak as spokesman for my party on environmental matters, which will be primary considerations in fashioning my approach to the referendum. However, important as they are, they are not the <Col N="471" /> issues uppermost in my mind. The primary issue by which I will judge the Treaty is, first, the effect on the prospects for jobs here and the related question of the prospects of bringing to an end once and for all emigration as a feature of our economic and social history. I will also fashion my approach to this referendum on what I perceive as the vision of Europe. Finally, I have some very clear views to express on the question of defence.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to cohesion and the Cohesion Fund. Cohesion is the new buzzword of this step towards European Union. For some, cohesion is a code word for the begging bowl and this is one of the prime explanations for our unparalleled unemployment. Emigration has doubled in the past five years. Despite the influx of funds we have been told about by the Taoiseach, and others, in the past 20 years, we still experience this awful problem, not because of EC rules but because we have failed to make the necessary domestic changes to take advantage of the new position. As a result unemployment rates are two and a half times the European average, considerably higher than the next worst country in the Community, Spain. When we combine the unemployment and emigration figures the overall position in relation to people finding jobs at home is more than three times worse than the European average.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I put questions to the Taoiseach on unemployment, including among those over 55 years, and on emigration in the past five years. I knew the figures but I wanted them put on the record. The Government have been avoiding these facts, as have the media and most of us. The first step in approaching a solution to a problem is to correctly identify the scale of the problem. Yesterday the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach told me in this House that, including those over 55 years, the register of unemployment for the month of March of this year was 290,593, or 21.8 per cent of the workforce. As we know, the April figures are <Col N="472" /> 6,700 higher, adding a further 0.6 per cent to the total. Therefore, the April figure represents a total of 22.3 per cent of the workforce on the register of unemployment, including those over 55 years. The Minister of State also told me that net emigration figures for the five years up to 1991 were 136,500 or 10.3 per cent of the workforce. If we add the two figures &mdash; 10.3 and 22.3 per cent &mdash; we get 32.6 per cent, which means that almost one-third of our workforce have failed to get a job at home in the past five years.</P>
    <P>I could make a cheap point and say that this is solely the responsibility of Fianna Fáil who have been in power for those five years. However, the scale of the problem is such that it results not only from failure of the Fianna Fáil led Governments but failure of the system. It is not appreciated that the failure is on such scale that it is a potential earthquake. This underlying bombshell is akin to the feelings of the black population in America which were ignited by a recent court case decision. These unemployment and emigration figures will potentially give rise to a mammoth upheavel that nobody in the media and very few in politics seem to be aware of.</P>
    <P>Anyone who represents an inner city Dublin community can see for himself the widescale unemployment &mdash; and the unemployment figures are as high as 70 or 80 per cent in parts of the city and I am sure this is replicated in other cities. People must be aware of the time bomb that is ticking away in urban areas. My wife is from a rural area in the west which is being rapidly depopulated because of migration and emigration. The unemployment statistics in rural areas are not as high as in the cities for the simple reason that the young people have left and gone abroad, causing enormous social deprivation. The social fabric of society is being refashioned in a most adverse way which is possibily permanent.</P>
    <P>I cite these figures because it is very important for our people to know that many Members are concerned that the Treaty on European Union will be turned <Col N="473" /> into a seminal event to change these grim statistics. People ask if the Maastricht Treaty will make any difference to unemployment. In my opinion the honest answer is no, as it will not change the situation in relation to jobs. All other EC countries have considerably lower levels of unemployment, some are a fraction of ours. I know that demographic factors play a part and can explain some of the difference but they do not explain the whole difference, yet Government and some social analysts, who are far from critical, almost excuse the appalling unemployment figures on the basis that demographic factors about which we can do nothing are at play and that unemployment is a problem about which we can do nothing. Fine Gael utterly reject that philosophy. There are other explanations for our grim unemployment figures. The reasons lie in the tax, social welfare, social insurance and means testing systems. It is virtually impossible to employ people honestly and legitimately in this country today because of what is known in shorthand terms as the &ldquo;tax wedge&rdquo;. A married man with children would be better off on unemployment benefit or assistance than on the average industrial wage. That is not to say that those on unemployment payments are well off, because they are not, they are poor but they are trapped in poverty because of our tax and means testing systems. If they apply for a medical card or higher education grants, they are assessed on gross pay as if it were disposable income. After pay packet deductions, including tax, PRSI, pension and trade union contributions and sometimes a small VHI contribution and what I call post-day packet adjustments &mdash; for instance the variations in differential rents and the lack of a medical card &mdash; a person on the average industrial wage with more than two children would be better off on the dole, even though they would be very badly off on the dole. This is one of the classic poverty traps in this country. I have studied the system in Britain and this is not the way it works in Britain or in any other EC country.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years since this <Col N="474" /> Government came to power the poverty trap has got wider in every single budget. In his two budgets the &ldquo;Maestro&rdquo; Mac-Sharry widened the gap and the present Taoiseach widened the gap further in the two budgets he presented, and the present Minister for Finance in the recent budget widened the gap further again. This is why we have unemployment because the Government do not know the aggregate effect of their policies.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment's policy on differential rent can end up affecting the labour market. People may ask how this is so. A working man is assessed for local authority rent on his gross pay and may pay rent of £25 per week although his net pay is only £140 per week. The man next door in similar family circumstances receives £140 a week on social welfare but pays only £3 a week rent. He is assessed on an income of £140 per week as I am assessed on £220. The same system applies when assessing means for medical cards, higher education grants, civil legal aid, etc. and once you are employed at all you cannot get supplementary welfare assistance. That is the poverty trap from the employee's point of view.</P>
    <P>A married man on the average industrial wage of approximately £230 a week ends up with approximately £145 a week in his pocket no matter how many children he has because he does not get a tax allowance for his children. It costs the employer in excess of £300 to put that £145 into the working man's pocket, even though he is worse off than his unemployed neighbour next door &mdash; because over and above gross pay he pays on average 35 per cent more to cover public liability insurance, employer's PRSI contributions, etc. This is the accepted figure from both the Central Statistics Office and the Eurostat office in Brussels. Employers cannot afford to create jobs at this cost and employees cannot afford to take up jobs at this net wage. There is a big gap which is caused by Government policy. It is no use pretending that only this Government &mdash; although they have worsened the position &mdash; is responsible but successive Governments have <Col N="475" /> brought about these problems by spending hundreds of millions, if not billions, of pounds.</P>
    <P>We must honestly say that the Maastricht Treaty will make no difference to the unemployment problem. What will make a difference is a change in domestic policy, none of which is affected by the Maastricht Treaty. Some of the changes which are necessary could be very well facilitated from funds from the next step towards European Union. I urge the Government to use the Cohesion Fund from Europe to alleviate the poverty traps and allow simple decisions to be taken such as, first, that all means tests would be carried out on take home pay as and from 1 January 1993, the day of European Union. That is what has been done in the United Kingdom since 1984. That would remove a significant element of the poverty trap. A second point would be to give some recognition to children of those employed. Unless we do so we will continue with a significant distortion of the labour market and a significant disadvantage to those in employment. These are two areas in which we could use some of the Cohesion Fund to get the bugs out of our system. These are like road blocks, it is as if trees had fallen across roads thus preventing those roads being used. If those things could be got out of our domestic system the money from the Cohesion Fund could be used with exponential effect on our employment situation. We can all see that much work needs to be done in both the private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>The second part of cohesion is this: if we depend on cohesion as a code word for a begging bowl we will fail. If we see the Cohesion Fund as a means of funding changes in our taxation system, social insurance systems and means testing system and as a means towards reducing dramatically the net cost of employing people while increasing significantly the take home pay of people on the average industrial wage, we will have done much to put right what is wrong in the labour market; we will have done much to sweep away those road blocks which are <Col N="476" /> preventing job creation and which explain the reason why for every one per cent of economic growth as a country we have produced fewer jobs than any other country in the EC.</P>

      <P>The second part of cohesion relates to ourselves. We should cease to think about the begging bowl and think instead about assisting enterprise rather than preventing it by bureaucratic rules and regulations by inducing in people a grant philosophy rather than an enterprise philosophy.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the matter of defence. I have already mentioned in passing environment matters and they will be aided considerably by what is provided for in the Treaty. On the question of defence many people who are arguing against this Treaty are going overboard but they do have a point. Many of those who are promoting the Treaty are underestimating the defence dimension. There is a defence dimension and as far as I am concerned it is welcome. If there is to be a truly European Union, if this is the penultimate step &mdash; as I believe it is &mdash; towards a full and comprehensive union it only makes sense that we should be in a position to defend that union and that as a country we should be fully prepared to participate in that defence. To say otherwise is to mislead people. That is a positive element and we should not be afraid of it. We should see European union as playing a major peace-keeping role in the world in the future and that should be our philosophy. It must be remembered that the vision of Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be urging people to endorse the Treaty on European Union in the forthcoming referendum by voting in large numbers and by voting yes. The Treaty signed at Maastricht represents a critical watershed in the life of our nation. As a people we face a stark choice, to go forward with our partners in the development, in freedom and by consent, of an ever-closer European Union, or to detach ourselves from the historic path down which the 12 member states of the European Community have now decided to go. We want to stay in the first division in Europe. We do not want to face the prospect of relegation. We have played in the first division up to now. It has been tough at times. We have had to be fit; we will have to be fitter the next time to remain in the first division, but we intend to remain in the first division. We see no particular delight or joy in going to a second or lower division in Europe. The European Community provides great stability in a changing Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a strong supporter of European Union for reasons of economic stability, for job prospects for our young people, for better access to markets for our produce and for social and economic development. We are living through a time of unprecedented change. It would have seemed incredible to most observers just a few years ago that by May 1992 the Soviet Union would be no more, that Germany would be reunited and that many of the countries of the former Eastern bloc would be seeking to transform themselves into new republics and to <Col N="478" /> associate with the European Community. This is a very exciting, interesting and challenging time in Europe.</P>
    <P>What does this mean for a member state like Ireland, physically at the edge of the Community, distanced from the tensions felt much more closely by some of our partners? To me it means that we must seek, as the Treaty itself seeks, to move closer together, to find in our union a new strength which we cannot hope for as individual states. The new European Community will grow faster and we want our people to contribute to and participate in that growth. We are good and we are enthusiastic Europeans and we want to go ahead with Europe.</P>
    <P>We now seek the endorsement of the people. Now, of all times, is not the time for Ireland to choose a different route. Such a route would detach us from history itself and could leave us alone, isolated and without direction. The results of this would be incalculable. It would represent a leap into the unknown. We would inevitably pay a price, in terms of influence foregone and opportunities lost. It is true to say that Ireland, through its public representatives and its civil servants in Europe, has had a very considerable influence on the development of Europe in recent years.</P>
    <P>Our peripheral location impedes our economic development in many respects. This is well recognised by the Community. We must not compromise our capacity to reap the substantial benefits which will derive from closer integration and eventual economic and monetary union. We cannot take that road when others, from Scandinavia and from Central and Eastern Europe, have set their sights on membership. In very simple terms, as we know, it has been estimated that the Single Market plus the monetary union can result in a growth in Europe of some 15 per cent. We want to participate in that growth and to have the opportunity to share in the wealth and the development which that will bring and in the jobs which can result from it.</P>
    <P>The Treaty represents an enormous and a positive opportunity for Ireland. We have a contribution to make to the <Col N="479" /> future of Europe. We must be confident. There is no room for self-doubt when facing this major challenge. We should now confidently proceed to the next stage of European integration. The Treaty will secure for the European Union its high standing in the world trading system. Our new Europe will be capable of playing on a level pitch with the other two giants of the developed world, Japan and the United States.</P>
    <P>The benefits which, with effort and hard work, we can expect to gain from the integration process provided for in the Treaty are great indeed. Meeting the conditions for full participation in economic and monetary union will be tough and will involve rigorous financial discipline in the years ahead. There need be no doubts about our readiness for this undertaking. Our record since 1987 in correcting the imbalance in the public finances has few equals elsewhere. The benefits for our trade and industry will be there for all people as, ultimately, will be the reward in jobs.</P>
    <P>The benefits will come from the stable framework within which economic policy will be conducted, stable prices, interest rates, exchange rates, confidence and the weight of the Community internationally. The EC's commitment to narrowing the gap in living standards between the regions of the Community &mdash; the concept known as cohesion &mdash; will also bring benefits particularly to Ireland.</P>
    <P>These factors taken together with a hoped for up-turn in the world economy will serve as a forceful stimulant to economic development, to economic growth and to the increased welfare of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Marine, I am already involved in the business of the European Community and in securing the benefits of membership for the sectors of the economy for which I am responsible and the people whom I serve.</P>
    <P>The Community to date has been about markets and access to those markets. The Single European Act has been a major stimulant to trade and this is as relevant to fish and fish products as it is <Col N="480" /> to other sectors of the Irish economy. Economic and Monetary Union will further underpin the capacity for efficient trade in those products. The Community has also been committed to the development of its less well off and peripheral regions. This commitment has benefited Ireland significantly. The resource transfers have been dedicated to expanding and improving sectors like aquaculture, fishing and fish processing and ensuring a quality product through infrastructural improvements at fishery harbours and commercial harbours.</P>
    <P>We are a maritime nation. It has been a major theme of my negotiations at EC level &mdash; and this will be the case in the development of new programmes and the expression of existing ones under the umbrella of the European Union &mdash; that the main resource is underdeveloped in Ireland. We will be looking to rapid and sustained infrastructural improvements in the years ahead and we will be seeking the broadening of the areas supported by EC funding.</P>
    <P>To date the EC has helped us to develop our marine resources to benefit our coastal communities and provide a future for their children. We have received assistance with our programmes for: aquaculture development &mdash; over £15 million since 1980; fishing fleet construction and modernisation &mdash; over £15 million since 1980. During 1991 Irish fishermen received £1.3 million in aid for modernisation; fish processing plant construction and modernisation. Investment of up to £30 million will be supported over the period 1991-93. During 1991 aid of £3 million was awarded; fisheries and aquaculture research for example for exploratory fishing and new species. Over £1 million in the period 1988 to 1990; large-scale improvements to the marine research infrastructure of the State, for example the fitting out of the Lough Beltra Ireland's marine research vessel under the STRIDE programme, to which I will return shortly; fishery harbour construction and facilities improvements, for example, ice plants and auction halls, to improve fish handling and provide a better end product <Col N="481" /> to the consumer. Investment over £20 million will be supported in the period to end 1993; harbours development and modernisation, more than £30 million received to date: in the last few years major works have been carried out; fishery training where 2,000 young people will receive training in the five years up to 1993; and fishery surveillance and management; aid of over £5 million was received during 1991.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to build in the years ahead on progress to date with the commitment of the European Union to a policy of cohesion.</P>
    <P>The largest sector for which I am responsible is of course the fishing industry. The EC Common Fisheries Policy is being reviewed at present. The cohesion principle enshrined in the Treaty is the main theme of my efforts to secure a better deal for the Irish fishing industry. As I have indicated, we have received Community assistance for vessel modernisation, for exploratory fishing, for a market management system for certain species, for monitoring and surveillance to protect stocks and waters, for processing and marketing initiatives, for training and for ports and facilities. This adds up to a major commitment by the Community to development in the sector. I know that this industry has the potential for further development but we can only achieve that development with the assistance of our European colleagues. It is in Europe's interest that all its regions share equally in the Community's wealth.</P>
    <P>Ireland is an objective one region. On the fishing side, our waters contribute significantly to the EC's fishing stocks. This is an area where we contribute substantially to the Community. I have listened to Deputies on the other side of the House, particularly members of Fine Gael, talking about how we should not go to Europe with the begging bowl. We are not going to Europe with a begging bowl. We are going to Europe as full participants in the European Community where we make a contribution in every possible way. We have a right to avail of the opportunities and to demand that <Col N="482" /> Irish people get a fair crack of the whip in the development of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a right to expect assistance to develop our industry further and I will be insisting on that right. It is something the Community must recognise.</P>
      <P>The Irish aquaculture industry has developed from negligible beginnings over the last decade. Production overall is now over 30,000 tonnes, worth an estimated £38-£40 million to the economy. There are now over 2,500 full-time and part-time jobs in the sector alone. It is interesting to note the numbers of people interested in going into that sector because they have in the coastal regions a tradition of fishing and of being involved with the sea. Most of this employment is located in remote coastal areas with few alternative sources of employment. There have also been indirect jobs created as a result of the development of that sector. Service industries such as feed production and equipment have also grown.</P>
      <P>The continued development of the aquaculture sector is closely related to developments in the fish processing and marketing sector. The growing demand for raw materials by the fish processing sector will underpin growth in the aquaculture sector and will maximise high added value for aquaculture products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Community assistance for the sector from 1980 to date has been around £15 million. Increased investment by the Community is essential to foster and maximise the potential growth in the aquaculture industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have received more than £30 million to improve our harbour infrastructure. Efficient ports are vital to any trading nation but more especially to Ireland given our location and the exceptionally high proportion of our GNP <Col N="483" /> which is traded. Our ports and the people who depend on them for jobs deserve the further opportunities possible under the Cohesion Fund. Some 80 per cent of our trade is shipped through our ports. Ireland's survival depends on rapid and cost effective access to European markets. The development of a sea-bridge to mainland Europe is a first requirement of cohesion and one of our priorities.</P>
    <P>Research is a vital function which underpins many of my decisions as Minister. Research and technological development was first given a formal treaty basis in the Single European Act. We need access to the kind of support the Community's scientific programmes can give us. We have the scientists, we have the talent in our universities and higher level institutes. There is much scientific work to be done to back up our food industry and to exploit the potential of our sea resources. The Treaty will stimulate scientific and technical advances Community wide which the efforts of a single country like ours could never match.</P>
    <P>Under the STRIDE Community Initiative &mdash; that stands for Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe &mdash; a funding package of £10 million from the Commission has been made available for the development of Irish natural resources up to 1993.</P>
    <P>Ireland's Operational Programme under STRIDE which was approved by the Commission last year is a major boost for Irish science and technology. Projects in the four natural resource sectors of marine, environment, forestry and food will be assessed. There will be a large scale upgrading programme for science and technological facilities in these four sectors. This will stimulate development, strengthen our research and development capacity, provide essential research and technological support to our efforts, increase employment and secure existing jobs in the natural resource sector.</P>
    <P>The marine component of the operational programme is the largest measure. It will enable us, at last, to <Col N="484" /> create a coherent, well-equipped marine research and technological development base to underpin development in the marine area. The stimulus which STRIDE is providing for marine and other research and technology is an excellent example of the positive and tangible impact of a Community initiative.</P>
    <P>Finally, I return to my earlier remarks. I urge a massive endorsement of the Treaty by this House and by the people. The Treaty is positive. It represents opportunity. It represents possibly the most fundamental evolutionary increment of human and political progress on the Continent for decades.</P>
    <P>We are good Europeans, we have contributed fully and enthusiastically to the development of the European Community. We have benefited from our involvement, we are confident that we can meet the challenges and avail of the opportunities presented by this Treaty on European unity. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asserted that we are good Europeans. I should like to think that we would respect one of the great European traditions, the intellectual debate by Diaz, and the exploration through dialogue and discussion as to where those ideas might lead so that the future of all humanity can be better served.</P>
      <P>What has been most unEuropean about the Maastricht debate, so far, has been the lack of such an exploration of ideas. The House should be reminded, for those who, in the course of history, will look at it in their deliberations, that this is only the third time in the course of the Maastricht process that this House has, so to speak, debated Maastricht and the two intergovernmental conferences which preceded it. We have been starved of one of the great European traditions, that of open and proper debate with a view to exploring ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party decided that that deficiency in the national debate should be addressed and we requested the international affairs committee of our party to prepare a White Paper, an analysis <Col N="485" /> and a set of conclusions on the Maastricht process. The documents, which went through the administrative council of the Labour Party on 29 May, have now been published and I will be putting a copy in the Library of the House for the benefit of all Members. Within the limitations of the time available to me, I propose to read extracts from that document because it succinctly points out some of our views regarding the process of this debate and our current conclusions on Europe. The conclusions state:</P>
    <P>Certain principles have remained at the core of the Labour Party's policy towards the integration of Europe. In particular these include the necessity of balanced and harmonious economic growth with full employment, regional development based on a real sense of solidarity, social equality and respect for civil rights, maximum democracy in decision making, the strengthening of common institutions in such a way that cultural diversity is respected, and the emergence of a shared commitment to peace, disarmament and the security of all the peoples of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty is, in his own words, a new phase in the process of integration within Europe and is intended to create a European Union with common citizenship. Its provisions must be judged from a Labour standpoint against those principles which the party had advocated now for over two decades in respect of Ireland's membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The conclusions are themselves the result of discussions which were conducted against a background of continuous monitoring of international events, particularly those relating to the European Community and its relations with other European states and international organisations.</P>
    <P>The conclusions are necessarily a series of judgements on the further evolution of the European Community in which various arguments for and <Col N="486" /> against Maastricht had to be balanced, before arriving at a recommendation as to the position the Party should adopt in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    <P>It has to be stressed that there are cogent arguments both ways. But in the end a judgement has to be made on where this country's best interests lie and also how the Labour Party's aspirations can be best advanced. The conclusion is that the Labour Party should support the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that these are not recommendations without any reservations. On the contrary, there are serious defects in the Treaty which need to be rectified in the medium term.</P>
    <P>This document puts forward a number of proposals on which the Labour Party should campaign within Ireland, the EC itself and in the broader context of the wider Europe. This policy would be similar to the position of many other socialist and social democratic parties in the EC, for example that of the SPD in Germany, whose bureau decided on a similar approach last month.</P>
    <P>The accompanying explanatory memorandum outlines the main provisions of the Treaty. It is a complex document because it deals with a wide number of policy areas, creates three parallel systems of integration, proposes various means as to how decisions are to be reached and impacts on sovereignty to a varying extent in the different policy areas covered by its provisions.</P>
    <P>The key point to be emphasised from the explanatory memorandum is that the European Community is to be expanded into a larger entity called the European Union and that this is to be the first real attempt since the Coal and Steel Community was founded in 1954 to create a political union. The Maastricht Treaty does not of itself construct a federal Europe but rather provides the framework in which some form <Col N="487" /> of federation could be built over the coming decades on the basis of further Intergovernmental Conferences.</P>
    <P>The exact nature of that federation remains to be determined. It will require the unanimous assent of all the member states involved but the significance of Maastricht is that it shifts the focus of integration onto the political as well as the economic level. It is this development which makes it different in character from the SEA which was primarily concerned with the creation of a Single Market by 1992.</P>
    <P>The document continues:</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty has been analysed with the following points in mind:</P>
    <P>&mdash;European integration is a process which goes forward in stages</P>
    <P>&mdash;the process has now reached the point where political union is to begin</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Maastricht Treaty provides a framework for moving to further stages should the member states so wish</P>
    <P>&mdash;the next stage may take place in 1996</P>
    <P>&mdash;the goal of political union should be widely understood as the eventual objective of Maastricht</P>
    <P>&mdash;the party's position in the referendum should be based on its attitude towards that goal</P>
    <P>&mdash;the new European Union will be enlarged to include Austria, Sweden and Finland in 1995/96 and possibly also Norway and Switzerland</P>
    <P>&mdash;a further enlargement is anticipated in 2000 with the inclusion of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary</P>
    <P>&mdash;the party should furthermore base its decision on the future role of Ireland within Europe in the light of this enlargement by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> Under the heading, Closed Negotiations the document states:</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, to perface these conclusions by commenting on the manner in which the negotiations were conducted in the two Intergovernmental Conferences (IGCs) leading to the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Initially there was to be only one such conference dealing with Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) since this was regarded as a natural corollary to the Single European Act (SEA) of 1987. The second conference arose out of the collapse of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe which led to the unexpected unification of Germany at a pace few could have forecasted.</P>
    <P>In effect, German unification meant that the GDR was absorbed into the European Community without any changes in the existing Treaties. That development led to Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterand requesting the then Irish Presidency in April 1990 to put European Political Union on the agenda via a parallel Intergovernmental Conference. This was speedily agreed with the objective of containing a united Germany within a strengthened Community.</P>
    <P>As a result, political union appeared on the EC agenda much earlier than anticipated and with little prior preparation on the part of any member state, even though the goal of a political union had been accepted from the outset of the intergration process in the early fifties.</P>
    <P>The two Intergovernmental Conferences were conducted in the traditional manner of international diplomacy, notwithstanding the fact that they were devising a constitutional framework for a European Union. This meant that the negotiations were largely carried out in secret mainly by officials and periodically involving the key Ministers.</P>
    <P>The final shape of the Treaty was <Col N="489" /> determined by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council meeting in Maastricht last December. Many fundamental issues were only resolved at that point, such as the irreversible commitment to European Monetary Union, the wording of an ambition to create a federal Europe and the place of the Social Charter within the new union.</P>
    <P>Some member states had published White Papers outlining their strategy towards the two Intergovernmental Conferences in the months leading up to Maastricht, in most cases with proper parliamentary debates and often with detailed examination in their respective parliamentary committees.</P>
    <P>To some extent these activities offset the secrecy of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations but it cannot be claimed that there was widespread democratic consultation on the aims of political union or the implications of European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>This criticism is particularly relevant in Ireland where there was no White Paper published in advance, no real debate in the Oireachtas and little if any examination in Committee. As a result the electorate was left singularly uninformed of the issues as they unfolded within the Intergovernmental Conferences and have now been presented within a complex package which must be accepted or rejected in total.</P>
    <P>The nature of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations means that there is no scope whatever for amending the articles of the Treaty after it had been voluntarily signed by the various Governments, despite some claims to the contrary. Any particular concerns of a Government are presumed by their partners to have been raised and satisfactorily dealt with during the Conferences. That is the way the Intergovernmental Conferences are intended to work and is normal practice in the negotiation of any international Treaty.</P>
    <P>That being the case, democratic consultation <Col N="490" /> prior to the opening of the Intergovernmental Conferences should have taken place and should have been maintained for their duration. This would have given the electorate an insight into what was being attempted, the strategy objectives of the Irish Government and the reasons why compromises were necessary at various stages.</P>
    <P>A broad consensus could thus have been constructed or at least the electorate would have been better informed when called on to vote in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Labour therefore makes its opening recommendation to the effect that, should there be any future Intergovernmental Conferences, the process should be carried out in an open fashion with the full involvement of the Oireachtas, preferably through a properly serviced European Affairs Committee.</P>
    <P>The failure to establish such a committee twenty years after our entry into the EEC is lamentable and a serious indictment of our democratic process. Likewise the failure to spell out even broad national policy objectives relating to the EC, other than generating the maximum amount of Euromoney, is equally unacceptable. All parties must accept some element of blame.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Labour believes that Ireland should actively campaign for a procedure whereby any future treaties on integration should be democratically endorsed by way of referendum in each member state. In this way, Europe would be constructed by its citizens and not just by officials and those politicians who happen to be in office.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that we involve the people because we are forced to do so by our Constitution and not out of commitment to an open democracy. Denmark is the only member State to do so voluntarily. All member states should adopt this same democratic mechanism in ratifying any future Treaty on European integration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> There are eight conclusions in relation to eight key elements of the Treaty. The first relates to subsidiarity and our conclusion is as follows:</P>
    <P>The very first article of the Treaty states that it marks a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizens. Subsidiarity, as expressed in the Treaty, should be supported as a guiding principle for creating the new Union.</P>
    <P>Our call for a referendum falls into that category.</P>
    <P>The second element of the Treaty refers to citizens' rights and our conclusion is that the Treaty is certainly worthy of support in terms of the rights of European citizens.</P>
    <P>The third component refers to democracy and our conclusion is as follows:</P>
    <P>As the SPD has noted, this question was left as unfinished business at Maastricht and could arise again in the context of the Delors II package, future enlargement or the next Intergovernmental Conference in 1996. In that regard, the Labour Party must devote considerable time and resources to developing its own views on these questions in preparation for any further stage in the integration process, preferably in common with its sister parties.</P>
    <P>On the question of Economic and Monetary Union, which is complex and detailed, we have a short conclusion which is as follows</P>
    <P>The movement towards a common currency and a European Central Bank is probably irreversible, barring events which cannot be forecast at this time. Ireland should benefit more from being a participant in European Monetary Union than from remaining outside. However, the conditions of entry to the final stage will have to be framed so that they do not add to our unemployment problem. The committee <Col N="492" /> recommends that the party should actively campaign for the inclusion of full employment as an explicit Community objective and for the adoption of policies based on State and Community involvement.</P>
    <P>The Government have not at any stage recognised that an unemployment problem might be caused by adherence to the five requirements of EMU membership. A major deficiency in the Treaty is the failure to include full employment as a Community objective.</P>
    <P>On the question of cohesion our conclusion is as follows:</P>
    <P>Two judgements are called for here in arriving at a conclusion. The first is political. The question is whether the European Council will agree to the Commission proposal. Despite current difficulties, especially in Germany, the answer would be yes on the basis of past experience and the existence of a Protocol on cohesion. There are those who will disagree and argue it will be much reduced.</P>
    <P>The jury is still out on that question. Forced to give a personal view, I would have to say that Delors would be very lucky to get the full amount.</P>
    <P>The second question on the conclusions in relation to cohesion is as follows:</P>
    <P>The second question is whether the amounts are sufficient, if they are agreed. The answer is likely to be that they would never be enough given the scale of our combined unemployment and debt problems but undoubtedly would be a valuable contribution to our national investment programme. For that pragmatic reason, the Commission proposals for the Cohesion Fund, but nothing less, should be accepted.</P>
    <P>In that regard, the Commission proposals for the total budget are 1.37 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Social policy is the sixth element on which the document reaches a conclusion. The document reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The Social Charter agreement may give rise to complexity and confusion in legal terms and it is essential that it is reflected in early and determined initiatives on the part of the Council. However, the Social Action Programme, implementing the Social Charter, can now be adopted and applied in full since the delays and obstructions occasioned by the UK attitudes can be ignored by other Member States. In the optimistic belief that this will now happen &mdash; and bearing in mind the statement of the Executive Committee of ETUC that the trade union movement should support the ratification of the Treaty &mdash; the Social Agreement should be supported.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately for the present Minister for Labour and previous Ministers for Labour, they will now have nobody &mdash; meaning the British delegation &mdash; to hide behind in respect of this matter and Ireland's conservative opposition not to the rhetoric of the Social Chater but to the provisions of the social action programme, ably articulated across the street in Kildare House, will now be flushed out into the open.</P>
    <P>There are two other conclusions that I do not have time to read into the record. One concerns the question of development co-operation and the other concerns the issue of common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>On balance, we in this House have to learn from this process. We have not learnt well enough. The Government of which I was a member badly handled the process of negotiation for the Single European Act. I am on record as having said that before, and in July 1991 and November 1991 I urged that today's Government learn from the mistakes that we made, unwittingly or perhaps somewhat arrogantly, at that time. It is tragic to relate that neither the permanent establishment of the Civil Service nor the change of Government since then have adequately learnt the lessons. We are now in a democratic republic in which the Government and the major Opposition <Col N="494" /> parties are calling on the people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to a referendum because of its historic and momentous changes, the biggest changes to the constitutional status of this State since 1972, or perhaps since 1922. We, as a body politic, have probably taught the people more about abortion and gynaecological practice in every other state in the world than we have taught them about the intricacies, the question marks and the doubts that the Maastricht Treaty presents to the Irish people at this time. I say that more in sadness than in anger because the total absence of journalists from the Press Gallery and the lack of political concern in the House seem to reflect that despite the fact that the House is having a substantial debate on the matter &mdash; and I do accept that this is a substantial debate &mdash; the kind of political attention that we would like it to have is being denied us.</P>
    <P>I urge that the Government look for, if they want it, the kind of constructive consensus that is on offer from the Labour Party and is, I believe, on offer from the other two Opposition parties in relation to clarifying the legitimate doubts of women and men in all sectors of our society on the question of the Protocol and its implications. It is unacceptable that on 18 June the people should vote on the ratification of the Treaty without knowing the precise implications of what the Protocol may mean for the right to information and to travel, or what the Government's intentions are.</P>
    <P>I can only say &mdash; and I invite the Tánaiste to refute this, as he has the opportunity &mdash; that the reason the Fianna Fáil Party are refusing to publish their commitment to the right to information and the right to travel is that that party cannot find unanimous substantial agreement on that question. That is the only explanation for the silence in this issue. On that point, I conclude by inviting the Tánaiste to refute that political charge before he reads out his departmental speech so as to eliminate what seems to me to be a reasonable political explanation for an indefensible position.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place I reject the statement made by Deputy Quinn that publication of proposals to deal with the matters to which he referred has not occured because unanimity cannot be reached within the Fianna Fáil Party. The Taoiseach has outlined to the House what our programme is in that regard and he has indicated that as soon as we have the people's approval for the Treaty on European Union we will deal with those other matters, which, by definition and by comment from all European politicians, are domestic matters.</P>
      <P>Labhraím i bhfábhar an Bhille um an Aonú Leasú Déag ar an mBunreacht 1992. The ratification of the Treaty on European Union is the most important issue to be placed before the electorate for a generation. The choice is simple &mdash; whether to progress with our partners in the European Community or to go it alone in a state of limbo at the margin of European affairs. I am certain that on 18 June the electorate will vote decisively to move ahead as a full partner in a new European union. Here in this House, throughout my constituency and in the area of competence of my Departments, I strongly urge the electorate to do so.</P>
      <P>I endorse the remarks made by Deputy Quinn that there is an obligation on all, and particularly on the news media, to ensure that the issues are fully explained and debated. As with Deputy Quinn, I find it rather sad that the news media are absent from the Press Gallery, especially considering that they assume a high moral tone of criticism of Members of this House and point out whether or not Members are present for major debates. I know that the news media have facilities available in other rooms to listen to the debate but their presence at the debate would indicate their interest in this very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its foundation, the European Community has been constantly evolving towards the goal of political and economic union. The Treaty on European Union is the most important milestone so far along that path. The union is, not merely in degree but in kind, completely different from what we have <Col N="496" /> already voted on. The Treaty was arrived at after protracted negotiations during which our Community partners responded generously to our concerns over a wide range of economic issues. As a result, the development of less prosperous members of the Community has been embraced as a central objective in the blueprint for economic and monetary union agreed at Maastricht. Therefore, the referendum presents us with an unprecedented opportunity for long term growth and development.</P>
    <P>In deciding how to vote in the forthcoming referendum, people should consider the extra employment which will be created in Ireland as a result of the economic union agreed at Maastricht. This is a very important matter for all sides in the House. A vote for the Treaty is a vote for job creation. It is estimated that the combined impact of the completion of the Single Market and the Structural Funds could add 7 per cent to 8 per cent to our national income in the next eight years. Economic integration produces economic expansion. A vote for the Treaty is therefore a vote for growth.</P>
    <P>Substantial Community funds, allegedly in the region of £6 billion, are expected to be made available to Ireland. In that regard, I should like to say that if that did not exist at all I would still find it easy to urge the people to vote for this Treaty and this union. I am not saying that there is any danger of the £6 billion not being available; I am sure that it is a reasonable assessment of what will become available despite the economic problems in Germany and elsewhere in the Community. Even if it was not available I am fully convinced that it would be the sacred duty of everybody in this House and in political life here to urge a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote for this Treaty. Even if we were only getting the transfers that we have been getting since 1973 it would still be well worthwhile producing a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote. Furthermore as part of the largest economic bloc in the world, our attractiveness as a location for foreign investors will be greatly enhanced. A <Col N="497" /> vote for the Treaty is therefore a vote for investment.</P>
    <P>The European Community and the Common Agricultural Policy are of vital concern to the farming community. No matter what anybody says, the transfers under the Common Agricultural Policy have revolutionised the living conditions of small farmers particularly. I could go on for a long time on that point because neither the social nor the economic impact of membership of the European Community on the position of small farmers has been fully realised. The farm prices which prevail in the Community are far more favourable than those obtaining in world markets. We all know that. We must ask ourselves if we wish to be at the conference table as full members when agricultural policy is being addressed. The answer is, &ldquo;of course we do&rdquo;. A vote for the Treaty is a vote to retain an effective voice on agriculture at EC level not only for our farmers but also for those in the north-eastern part of the country many of whom have indicated to me that they are glad that we are at the table with the policies we have. These are the relevant facts which people should weigh in their minds on June 18.</P>
    <P>Is í an Ghaeilge croí-lár ár n-oidhreachta agus, ar ndóigh, is cuid thábhachtach í d'oidhreacht na hEorpa freisin. Is í an Ghaeltacht tobar na Gaeilge agus tá sé mar pholasaí againn ní amháin an tobar sin a chaomhnú ach é a fheabhsú freisin. Tá cabhair nach beag faighte againn thar na blianta agus go háirithe ó 1989 i leith chun an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt agus táim cinnte de go méadófar go mór ar an gcabhair sin tar éis dúinn glacadh leis an gConradh seo.</P>
    <P>Tá cóip as Gaeilge den Chonradh agam anseo agus beidh cóip den choimriú den Pháipéar Bán againn agus beidh sé sin á scaipeadh sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Faoin <i>gClár d'Fhorbairt Tionscail</i><i>1989-1993</i> tá breis agus £18 milliún (i.e. 75 faoin gcéad de thimpeall £24 mhilliún) le fáil ag an Stát ón gCiste Réigiúnach de chuid an Chomphobail Eorpaigh le haghaidh fo-chláir speisialta do na limistéir Ghaeltachta arna cur i gcrích ag <Col N="498" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta. Chomh maith leis sin, meastar go mbeidh caiteachas de bhreis ar £15 mhilliún ag an Údarás ar fhoirgnimh thionsclaíocha sa Ghaeltacht agus beidh cúnamh ón gComhphobal ar fáil freisin i leith an chaiteachais sin.</P>
    <P>Tríd an gcabhair seo, tháining meadú comhlán de bheagnach 3,000 post sna comhlachtaí a thug an tÚdarás cabhair dóibh ó thús 1989 go dtí deireadh 1991. Ar ndóigh, bhí poist eile á cailleadh ach, in ainneoin sin, tháinig méadú 10 faoin gcéad ar an bhfostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht sa tréimhse 1989 go 1991.</P>
    <P>Tá foráil sonrach sa Chonradh faoina ndéanfaidh an Comhphobal a chuid gníomhaíochtaí a fhorbairt agus a shaothrú ar mhaithe lena chomhtháthú eacnamaíoch agus sóisialta a neartú. Féachfaidh an Comhphobal go háirithe leis an neamhionannas idir leibhéil fhorbartha na réigiún eagsúil, ar a n-áirítear na limistéir thuithe, a laghdu. Faoin gConradh leagtar síos céimeanna praiticiúla chun an cuspóir seo a bhaint amach: Ciste Nua Comhtháthúcháin; méadú mór ar an gcúnamh atá ar fáil faoi na Cistí Struchtúrtha; agus, mar atá luaite ag an Teachta Quinn, &ldquo;Pacáiste Delors&rdquo; faoin a mbeidh méadú an-suntasach sa chúnamh do cheithre thír ar a n-áirítear an tír seo, an Phortaingéil, an Ghréig agus an Spáinn.</P>
    <P>Is cinnte go gcaithfear an Ghaeltacht a áireamh mar cheann de na réigiúin is lú forbartha agus beidh mise, mar Aire na Gaeltachta, ag déanamh gach dícheall chun a chinntiú go gcuirfear go mór le forbairt tionscail, forbairt shóisialta agus eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that there is a very considerable momentum behind the drive towards European Union. It is, therefore, naive in the extreme to presume that 340 million Europeans will quietly drop the Treaty and all its benefits if Ireland choose to opt out. It has been stated that if we fail to ratify the Treaty, then it will automatically fall in all of the other member states. In the short term, this is true but only in a strict legal sense. It is of no real significance in the longer term. There is every likelihood that a new Treaty, this was mentioned by the Danish Foreign Ministry on the lines of <Col N="499" /> Maastricht, would be ratified by the other eleven members and that Ireland would be left out in the cold. Those who emphasise the fact that we have a legal veto over the actual Treaty document as written are emphasising an irrelevance. The structure of the agreement could be incorporated very rapidly into a new treaty, excluding Ireland. There is a very real danger of being excluded should the Treaty be rejected.</P>
    <P>The Treaty is not an <i>à la carte</i> menu from which we can pick and choose. Regardless of what people might wish there is no scope whatever for renegotiation at this stage. The choice before us now is to accept or reject the Treaty as it stands. The implications of this choice are much too serious to allow debate to be sidetracked into areas which are either peripheral or wholly and entirely irrelevent. Ireland's most vital national interests are at stake.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, all over the country, various groups have been dusting down their hobby horses for a Quixotic charge against the Treaty. Apologies to Don Quixote de la Mancha. Furthermore, these groups accuse the Government of scaremongering for simply placing the plain facts before the people. We reject that charge. It is the simple truth that rejection of the Treaty would have a catastrophic impact on our economic development for years to come. The opponents of the Treaty seem to feel that the Government should understate the benefits of the Treaty and play down the disastrous consequences of the rejection so that the nonsense being presented in favour of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote will look less dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Government have an obligation to place the facts before the people. We are under no obligation to dilute the truth in order to make our opponents case look less absurd. If a balanced presentation of the facts is causing offence in some quarters, so be it.</P>
    <P>Should the referendum fail, the consequences for Ireland &mdash; consequences which cannot be wished away &mdash; will be immediate and greatly <Col N="500" /> damaging. All that we have achieved over nearly 20 years in encouraging a consensus among our partners to pursue the objective of economic cohesion and the development of less prosperous regions would collapse like a house of cards. I have two large factories in my own constituency which sell everything into the Community. We have a disadvantage with transport, but that added to the disadvantage of non membership of the Community would be disastrous for those factories.</P>
    <P>The developments regarding a Common Foreign and Security Policy and the issue of defence seem to have stimulated the paranoid tendencies of some individuals. In fact, Ireland's position is fully acknowledged by the Treaty. The facts are as follows.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Treaty dealing with foreign and security policy are designed to strengthen the ability of EC countries to work together on international issues. The range of issues that can be dealt with is broadened and the idea of joint political and diplomatic action is developed. However, defence issues are specifically excluded from the area of joint action and may be referred to the Western European Union only with the unanimous agreement of the member states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty does not set up a common defence policy. It contains no mutual defence commitments whatever. Conscription cannot be imposed on Ireland through the Treaty and it is pure nonsense to suggest that it can. We had headlines on that too. Headlines are easy if one looks for them. This is where scare-mongering really arises. Ireland's traditional position of remaining outside military alliances is recognised by a specific provision in the Treaty which states that the policy of the European Union in the security area &ldquo;shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I will read into the record Article J.4.4 of the Treaty on European Union, the first part of which refers to Ireland:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States&mdash;</P>
    <P>Some people out of ignorance, careless reading or deliberately, added that this referred only to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation whereas the second part of Article J.4.4 begins with the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.</P>
    <P>Article N.2 reads:</P>
    <P>A conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States shall be convened in 1996 to examine those provisions of this Treaty for which revision is provided, in accordance with the objectives set out in Article A and B.</P>
    <P>The Treaty provides that an Intergovernmental Conference in 1996, referred to in the Article I have just read, may consider the framing of a common defence policy. Once again any agreements in this area must be unanimous. The Maastricht Treaty contains very strong safeguards for Ireland's position. Specifically, by ratifying the Treaty, we do not close off our options in any future negotiations.</P>
    <P>Regarding future developments in this area it is significant that Sweden, Finland and Austria, all neutral countries, are seeking to join the Community. Switzerland is considering making application. I know that Hungary is very anxious to come into the Community as are Czechoslovakia and Poland, who are hoping to gear themselves for entry. Therefore, we can have every confidence that, when issues under the heading of foreign and security policy come to be considered in future, our position will be well understood. Indeed it is likely that several new members with similar views <Col N="502" /> will be parties to any discussions. Any new agreement in this area after 1996 would be preceded by a referendum. Accordingly, any attempt to place this issue on the centre stage of the debate on the Treaty is completely misleading.</P>
    <P>In economic terms, Ireland's general experience as an EC member has been extremely positive notwithstanding the utterances emanating from certain gimcrack economists who seek to demonstrate otherwise. Since joining the Community our trade and exports have expanded and diversified. Large sums of money have been invested in Ireland by the Community. Furthermore, our attractiveness as a location for international investors has been greatly enhanced. As a trading nation, exporting most of our output and importing a great deal of what we consume, we have a lot to gain from economic integration. This Treaty opens up a range of new opportunities. The move towards monetary union is but one example of a measure which will be of practical help to Irish business by eliminating the costs and administration associated with foreign exchange transactions. I remember well when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance that he and I agreed across the floor of the House that the day when the ECU would be the Community monetary unit would be a good one for the economies of the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that our economic performance in the early and mid-eighties was disappointing. It was not the fault of the European Community that the then Irish Government chose to double the national debt in four years. We have serious problems at present in terms of emigration and unemployment. It is patently absurd to contend that we could better face these problems by rejecting the opportunities of Community membership and adopting a position of Albanian-style economic isolation; if one pursues an Albanian economic policy, one gets an Albanian result.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to call for positive support for the Maastricht Treaty as a positive step forward which will bring real benefits to this country and to the <Col N="503" /> Community as a whole. People should not support the Treaty solely because there is no alternative. Furthermore, the benefits of the Community are not confined in any way to the economic sphere. I have not time to go into the detail but it is an important aspect which should be discussed and debated. As a people we have grown as a result of our partnership with Europe. For many years Ireland remained an isolated country, away from the mainstream of world affairs. Through our membership of the European Community we have gone out in the world and found our place in it. We have gained in stature and self-esteem. We have found the courage and confidence to stand as equals with other countries. Our sense of identity and national pride have been enhanced. By becoming aware of other countries we have also become more aware also of what is unique about ourselves. Dá Eorpaí sin is ea is Gaelaí sin. By becoming involved in joint decision-making we have an enhanced sense of national sovereignty, indeed, an extension of sovereignty when we take decisions affecting the Acropolis in Athens as well as the Rock of Cashel.</P>
    <P>We have now a younger generation who see themselves as a part of a multinational European Community. I am certain that they, in particular, will embrace the Treaty and the principles on which it is founded as a reflection of their beliefs and values.</P>
    <P>I have complete confidence in the commonsense of the Irish electorate. I am certain that on June 18 there will be an overwhelming endorsement of the Treaty on European Union, agus molaim sin dóibh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Maastricht Treaty has got off to a bad start. That bad start did not commence when Senator Hanafin raised the Supreme Court decision at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. The bad start goes back to the commencement of the negotiations leading up to the Maastricht Treaty, to the manner in which the Intergovernmental <Col N="504" /> Conferences were conducted in virtual secrecy, to the beginning of a process which kept the public in the dark until the very last minute.</P>
      <P>The people ask what is Maastricht because they simply do not know. The people should have known what Maastricht is about but the whole approach to the conduct of European affairs in this country is confined to a Euro-élite, speaking a Euro language, which has the effect of keeping the public in the dark. We have had only the most restrictive form of debate on European affairs in this House. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, its terms of reference and upgrading are long overdue and still have not taken place. Indeed, in the Government proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that committee is to be merged in a larger foreign affairs committee. I welcome the establishment of a foreign affairs committee. But, with the deepening of the European process, I would have expected that at the very least we would have had a special committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas dealing with European affairs.</P>
      <P>The Government did not publish any policy position in the lead-up to the Intergovernmental Conferences. Therefore, we never knew what was the policy of this country going into those negotiations. The Intergovernmental Conferences themselves were conducted with little or no accountability to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty was presented to us in December as a <i>fait accompli</i> and contained the infamous Protocol 17 which had never been sought publicly, debated publicly or, prior to the recent controversy, never explained publicly. The White Paper was not published until a couple of months ago. Now we have circumstances prevailing in which the Government and many supporters of this Treaty attempt to shove it through the referendum, without critical examination, attempting to mobilise blind, national consensus that the Treaty is <i>de facto</i> a good thing because our betters <Col N="505" /> say it is and therefore our citizens should not ask too many questions about the small print.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested to us that if we vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; we will in some way be squeezed out of Europe or left behind, that if women vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; there could be a renewal of third party injunctions in relation to their right to travel and that, if we vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; we would be faced with a catastrophic economic outlook.</P>
    <P>In his contribution here yesterday the Taoiseach added a further unfortunate twist to all of this when he substituted crude political attack for reasoned argument. He suggested in a hustings-style speech that those who opposed the Treaty were no more than a marginalised array of malcontents. The Tánaiste added his contribution to that today when he suggested that any economist who questions the prevailing economic consensus about Maastricht is a gimcrack economist.</P>
    <P>This is no way for the Taoiseach or Tánaiste of this country to open the Maastricht debate. Surely the Prime Minister of this country can make a better and more reasoned case for the Maastricht Treaty than to rely on clumsy threats and blunt political attack. I have just been appointed campaign director for my party for this referendum. I appeal to the Taoiseach to conduct this referendum campaign on the basis of reasoned argument and informed comment. The more he and other people who support the Treaty resort to political attack on opponents of the Treaty, the more they rely on dire warnings, the more they undermine the case for Maastricht. They should stick to the content of the Treaty rather than to their antipathy to some of the opponents of it.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach, albeit grudgingly, acknowledged that those of us who are opposing the Treaty are doing a service to democracy by presenting the downside of the Treaty, highlighting its deficiencies and forcing a real debate on the central contents of the Treaty. He concluded by inviting &ldquo;all parties to give a clear signal that Ireland is determined to remain in the centre of future European <Col N="506" /> development&rdquo;. I wish to respond by stating clearly that my party, the Democratic Left, have no hesitation in giving such a clear signal. We are committed to the idea of European Union. We have a vision of a Europe which is democratic, where decision-making is accessible and decision-makers accountable to the citizens of Europe; a Europe of common citizens where Bosnian or Basque, Ulster or Ukranian, Irish or Italian; a Europe which is fair to all its citizens and which ensures that the economic benefits of European union are as effective in Mayo as they are in Munich. We want a Europe whose foreign and security policy is based on the principles of peace rather than on the muscle of a new power. As Deputy De Rossa said yesterday, our decision to call for a no vote in this referendum was not taken lightly but only after a detailed study of the Treaty which exposed to us serious deficiencies in it and which are acknowledged by many of the supporters of the Treaty. If we are to be consistent and regard these deficiencies as serious then the only logical thing to do is to ask the people to vote against the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Much has been made so far in the Treaty debate about two issues &mdash; the implications for Irish neutrality of the common foreign and security policy and the intended defence policy in 1996 and the diminished rights for Irish women in the new Europe. These issues are certainly central to our opposition to the Treaty. The Treaty rightly provides for common European citizenship but I cannot vote for a Treaty which relegates Irish women to citizenship rights which are less than those enjoyed by Irish men and less than those enjoyed by women and men in the rest of Europe. In his contribution earlier, Deputy Lenihan warned that if we reject this Treaty the European train will carry on and we will be left standing on the platform. My worry is that if we accept this Treaty Irish women will not even get past the ticket collector.</P>
    <P>The main argument for the Treaty rests on the warning of dire economic consequences if we reject it. I wish to challenge the assumptions in relation to <Col N="507" /> the economic benefits of this Treaty. First, I should like to deal with the question of the Structural Funds. On Monday last the <i>Irish Press</i> ran the following prominent headline, &ldquo;Ireland may not get its £6 billion Euro Windfall&rdquo;. The story cited objections by the British Government to the substantial increase in Community funding which is promised following the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty. It would now appear almost certain that a final decision on the amount of money to be provided to peripheral regions of the EC such as Ireland will not be known or agreed until after the referendum on 18 June. It is likely to occur during the term of the British Presidency of the Council, and they have already signalled their lack of sympathy for the type of increase the Government are seeking.</P>
    <P>The receipt of extra Community funds is being cited by the Government as one of the main reasons there must be a yes vote. We are also being told by the Government that anything other than a yes vote will place these funds in extreme jeopardy, lead to Ireland being pushed into the second lane and result in our EC partners forging ahead without us. There is something clearly wrong here. Nowhere in the Treaty is the amount of money to be made available to peripheral regions spelled out precisely. If the Government could not obtain cast iron guarantees on funding when the Treaty was being negotiated, how do they hope to obtain the type of funding required after the Treaty has been voted on?</P>
    <P>If the promised £6 billion is not obtained this country faces even more serious problems than might have been expected following European Union. Already the Minister for Foreign Affairs seems to be conceding the loss of some moneys. He is quoted as stating that the figure will be close to £6 billion, whatever assurances that is supposed to offer us. If we compare the likely amount on offer with the failure of the moneys under the existing Structural Funds to tackle the problems of unemployment and lower living standards here than the Community <Col N="508" /> average, than any reduction in the promised amount will mean that the Irish economy will, in real terms, receive no more cash inflows over the next five years than it has over the past five years.</P>
    <P>We will suffer in new ways. Because of the process of the Single Market we will suffer an increasing loss in revenue from VAT and excise duties. The completion of the Single Market will place additional strains on what remains of Irish manufacturing industry. In short, the Irish economy will become part of a huge 350 million member open market without any realistic compensation for the fact that Ireland is a peripheral region in that market.</P>
    <P>Even beyond the budget allocation to Ireland under European Union the question of how that money is spent is perhaps even more important. The crisis facing Irish farming, the high levels, of poverty of huge numbers of Irish farms and the failure of the Irish food processing sector to establish any meaningful new niche in the European market all testify to the failure of the Common Agricultural Policy and other funding measures to assist this vital sector of the Irish economy. The persistent rise in unemployment and the continuation of Irish living standards at below 70 per cent of the EC average shows that the current Structural Funds are similarly failing to assist the citizens of this country, whatever number of road by-passes are built or whatever small number of people are reaping the benefits of £3 billion in these funds.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's plan to ensure that whatever amount of money we receive under the new Treaty will produce jobs and better living standards in Ireland? The European Community's forecasters predict that unemployment is going to rise in the year ahead. Indeed the underlying assumption in the Delors II package of 2.5 per cent growth per year means that the Community's post-Maastricht five year draft economic programme does not plan to reduce unemployment below existing levels. How does the Taoiseach reconcile these forecasts with the argument that the Maastricht <Col N="509" /> Treaty in its existing form is vital to economic development? Is he simply dusting off the promises made during the referendum on the Single European Act of 1987 when the establishment consensus told us that the Single European Act with its increased Structural Funds offered a short cut to growth, expansion and prosperity. The only difference now seems to be that today's promises are on an even grander scale, the threats if we vote no are even greater and the likely disappointment when the promises fail to materialise are even more shattering for the Irish economy, jobs and society.</P>
    <P>This points to the vital necessity of creating a Community industrial policy which will divert funding for job creation and industrial development to the regions of the Community. Unless there is a positive discrimination in favour of Ireland and other disadvantaged periperhal areas then the Single Market will serve to increase disparities and not solve them. I am aware also that many regional and community groups are increasingly concerned at the way EC moneys are being spent. There is now an emerging demand from a number of such groups that Ireland be broken up into further regions and that these regions be allowed direct access to EC moneys. People in different parts of the country, be it Dublin, the west, the midlands or wherever, no longer trust the Government's handling of EC moneys.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will no doubt recall that when the initial submissions for the Structural Funds were being drawn up much play was made of the new regions within the country announced by the Government. These regions and the consultation process which was also launched turned out to be little short of pure fiction. It appears that the Government would like to treat the Structural Funds as a kind of super lottery, where people and local communities have no say or input into how the moneys are spent. This must be remedied if whatever new funds obtained are to be used to seriously tackle the economic and unemployment crisis facing this country.</P>
    <P>Second, I would like to raise the <Col N="510" /> assumption contained in the White Paper and repeated here yesterday concerning economic and monetary union. The White Paper states that economic and monetary union will lead to these policies having a more beneficial effect on growth and employment than the sum of the policies of individual member states in isolation. I do not doubt that that is the case, but the real question is how is that increased overall wealth and prosperity in the Community as a whole to be distributed, particularly to the poorer areas of the Community?</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough that difficulty is acknowledged in the White Paper which states that there is the possibility that in European Monetary Union the more prosperous regions of the Community could benefit disproportionately from the fruits of integration. There is also, of course, the danger that these regions might gain even further benefits at the expense of less developed regions. It goes on to state that all of this can be redressed by the provisions in Chapter 5 and it refers to the provisions for economic and social cohesion. It seems that these provisions, first, are largely aspirational and, second, in so far as they have any real meaning are dependent on the Structural Funds, about which I have spoken, and the Cohesion Funds which will be confined to environmental and transport issues.</P>
    <P>The real question that arises here is why some permanent mechanism is not built into the Treaty to provide for the peripheral regions and to ensure that economic cohesion is achieved. Why, for example, in the area of industrial policy &mdash; we are now setting up an Oireachtas committee on unemployment &mdash; are the only references to industrial policy confined to competition? Arguably, what the Treaty provides for is not an industrial policy but a competition policy. The citizens are entitled to wonder why, for example, in the area of fishing there is a requirement that an Irish fisherman must comply with certain quotas, can only catch certain species and operate within certain limits and why, for example, Irish farmers have to operate within certain <Col N="511" /> limits and comply with certain quotas for milk, and so on, while these same rules do not apply in the area of investment. In the case of economic and monetary union, which it is believed will lead to increased prosperity overall in the Community, there is no provision for the dispersal of that in the form of employment creation and investment in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that he has only one minute left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the one minute that I have left I want to raise the issue of the budgetary targets that have to be met in order to qualify this country for entry into the third stage of the process. The Taoiseach yesterday dealt with this matter in a very glib manner. The best he could do was suggest that if we do not vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the Treaty we will end up with even more hair-shirt budgets than we have had heretofore. I do not think he or anybody else in this debate has adequately answered how this country will meet the borrowing and budgetary requirements necessary to qualify us for the final stage of the process. Will it involve cutting public expenditure or will it involve widespread privatisation of publicly owned companies? What are the measures by which the Government intend to achieve those budgetary targets? The public are entitled to that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the argument that is being made that if we do not agree to the Treaty we will be left behind raises a fundamental concern about the concept of European Union. We are only one of two countries holding a referendum &mdash; we are talking about common European citizenship &mdash; where the citizens will have a say in whether they favour common European citizenship and all that goes with that. Out of 300 million people, eight million will have a direct say in this process. I have to ask, are we being told that the kind of European Union to which we are committing ourselves is such that if the citizens of one of the smallest <Col N="512" /> member states of that Community have reservations about the content of the Treaty and decide to genuinely express those reservations in a referendum, the bigger players in the Community will simply leave us behind? That raises a very serious concern and one that needs to be addressed by those who support the Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty opens a new chapter in the social, economic and environmental development of Europe and of Ireland. Ireland's interests are inextricably linked with the future of Europe: not simply the Europe of the Community, but the wider European economic area and a Europe which also has an opening to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. Ireland has already established an important place and role in Europe; our contribution is recognised and our interests will best be served by participating fully in its further development.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty affects my areas of responsibility in a number of ways, and I propose now to elaborate on these. I will deal in turn with the implications in terms of electoral arrangements, with the leading role of the EC in advancing environment policies and with the substantial and continuing EC support on which Ireland depends in developing infrastructural programmes for roads, water and sanitary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my principal ministerial duties in terms of facilitating the referendum on Maastricht is to promote the Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1992, which is a short technical Bill. Its purpose is to prescribe a statement in relation to the subject matter of the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992. The proposed statement is set out, in Irish and in English, in the appendix to section 1 of the Bill. It sets out in straightforward, neutral terms the subject of the referendum. As in previous referenda, the prescribed statement will be printed on the polling cards sent to all electors and will also be printed on posters displayed in, and in the precincts of, all polling stations. A <Col N="513" /> copy of the statement will be sent to each postal voter and to every elector whose name is on the special voters list.</P>
    <P>Presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out the prescribed statement to them where necessary and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposal and then marking the ballot paper in accordance with the voters' answers. These arrangements are identical with those made in relation to previous referenda on Bills to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The information arrangements provided for in this Bill are additional to the permanent provisions of the referendum law under which copies of Bills to amend the Constitution are made available in post offices for inspection free of charge and for sale at a price not exceeding 2p.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that in the case of any future referendum a statement for the information of voters may be prescribed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. This means that the Referendum (Amendment) Bill when passed will become part of permanent referendum law and will obviate the need for special legislation for each referendum in the future. However, the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to debate and approve each statement which would be drafted by the Attorney General in consultation with the Department of the Environment and the Department sponsoring the relevant Constitution Amendment Bill.</P>
    <P>The new Treaty arrangements contain provisions pertaining to voting rights for citizens of the new union. The Treaty provides that every citizen of the union residing in a member state of which he or she is not a national will be entitled to vote and stand for election in that member state. We already grant the right to vote at European elections to nationals of every member state resident here. However, under our existing law the right to stand for election to the European Parliament is confined to Irish citizens. An amendment to European electoral law will therefore be required to grant nationals of other member states resident <Col N="514" /> here the right to stand for election to the European Parliament if they so wish.</P>
    <P>The Treaty also provides that every citizen of a member state resident in another member state will be entitled to vote and stand at local elections in the member state in which he resides. This has no new implications for our electoral law. As the House is aware, every person of voting age normally resident in the country, irrespective of nationality, has been entitled to vote at local elections here since 1963 and has been entitled to stand for election to a local authority here since 1974. There are over 19,000 electors on the current register of electors who are nationals of other member states.</P>
    <P>The new voting provision will allow Irish nationals resident in other member states to vote and stand at local elections in the member states in which they reside. Irish nationals resident in Britain already enjoy these rights. Our citizens resident in Belgium and the Netherlands also have the right to vote at European elections but have no right to vote or stand for election in other member states. We heartily welcome the opening up of democratic electoral rights provided for in the Treaty. In a very special and practical way it underlines the essential unity of Community citizenship.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Community has provided many important benefits for Ireland, not least a chance to participate in and influence the development of the Community's progressive environmental policies. I would like to describe briefly the evolution of the Community's environment policy and to relate this to the important new Treaty provisions on the environment.</P>
    <P>Since 1973 successive EC environmental action programmes have given rise to a complex body of environmental legislation in which common standards for environmental protection have been formulated. The Community's First Environmental Action Programme, adopted in 1973, was concerned principally with the need to remedy the many serious environmental problems which then existed in the Community, mainly in its industrial heartland. The Second <Col N="515" /> Environmental Action Programme essentially updated and extended the first. However, by 1983, when the Third Environment Action Programme came to be adopted, a major evolution had taken place in the approach to environmental protection policy. The preventive approach, that is, an approach requiring economic and social developments to be undertaken in such a way as to avoid the creation of environmental problems, had become central.</P>
    <P>By 1987, when the Community adopted the Fourth Environmental Action Programme and amended the Treaty in the Single European Act, it was no longer in doubt that environmental protection was an essential component of Community policy in general and that environmental considerations were to be integral to all economic decision making. The programme extended to the end of 1992 and was concerned with establishing strict standards for environmental protection to give practical expression to the preventive approach. The activities outlined in the programme have resulted in the emergence of a body of standards applying to air and water quality, waste control, chemicals, conservation and noise and these are continually updated or expanded to take account of new developments &mdash; for example, in the biotechnology area.</P>
    <P>The fourth programme will expire at the end of this year and will be replaced by the Fifth Environmental Action Programme which will soon be concluded. This will represent a further evolution of the Community environment policy &mdash; this time towards sustainable development. It has been drafted in the context of the Maastricht Treaty and the activities which it proposes will be subject to the Treaty's improved decision making processes.</P>
    <P>The current basic principles and objectives of the Community's environment policy were laid down in the Single European Act in 1987. That Act inserted a dedicated environment chapter into the existing Treaty establishing a clear Community competence in this area and <Col N="516" /> affirming the central role of environmental protection in all of the Community's policies. The basic provisions were that action by the Community relating to the environment shall aim: to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment; to contribute towards protecting human health; and to ensure a prudent and rational utilization of natural resources.</P>
    <P>The action proposed is based on the principles that preventive measures must be taken, that environmental damage must be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay. These guiding policies of the Community on the environment have also been fully integrated into Irish environment policies and are contributing to the protection of the shared European environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played a major role in the further development of the Community's stance on the environment. During the Irish Presidency, the European Council, in Dublin in June 1990 adopted a major declaration on the environment. This was the first time that EC Heads of State and Government had addressed environmental issues in a comprehensive way and made a policy statement on them.</P>
    <P>The declaration elaborates Community policy on a wide range of global issues. It commits the Community to a leading role in seeking solutions to the major environmental challenges facing the world. At the Community level the declaration emphasises the need to build environmental considerations into policy making in all sectors, particularly in the light of completion of the internal market. It stresses the need for accelerated decisions on environmental legislation and in so doing was the direct forerunner of the new Treaty provisions on the environment.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty expressly incorporates the objective of sustainable growth which respects the environment. It entrenches environment policy among the competences of the Community and updates existing Treaty provisions in this regard. Environment policy under Maastricht is to aim at a high level of protection, to be integrated into the <Col N="517" /> definition and implementation of other Community policies and to ensure that the Community contributes to promoting measures at the international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems.</P>
    <P>As foreshadowed in the Dublin Declaration, the Maastricht Treaty contains improved decision making arrangements on environment issues. From now on decisions on environment proposals, with a small number of exceptions, will be taken by qualified majority vote of the Council and will be subject to the co-operation procedure with the European Parliament &mdash; a departure in the environment area where up to now unanimous decision was the norm. I am satisfied that the new arrangements will not only achieve the more rapid adoption of Community legislation as sought in the Dublin Declaration but will involve the European Parliament more closely in the negotiation of important environmental decisions.</P>
    <P>A significant change introduced by the new Treaty, and one which also involves the European Parliament directly in environmental decision making, is that adoption of environment action programmes will henceforth be by co-decision with Parliament. The new co-decision procedure will give Parliament and the Council equal weight in planning overall Community environment policy and adoption of the programme will depend on both sides jointly agreeing its contents.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that environment is one of the few areas of the new Treaty in which it was possible to agree that this new procedure should be adopted. It represents a direct input by elected representatives into decision making in an area of high public interest. Again, this is a development which was prefigured in the Dublin Declaration, which stressed that protection of the environment is a responsibility to be shared by Governments and citizens. The declaration proposes wider dissemination of information on the environment so as to have a more informed public and guarantees that the objective of Community action on the <Col N="518" /> environment will be to provide every citizen with a clean and healthy environment. As the declaration makes clear, problems cannot be solved without concerted action. In each country everyone &mdash; Government, public authorities, private undertakings, individuals and groups &mdash; must be fully involved.</P>
    <P>The driving force behind the proposed Fifth Environmental Action Programme is the concept of sustainable development. The achievement of sustainable development is now recognised internationally as the key to dealing with worldwide environmental problems and in particular with the difficulties of the developing world. A major UN Conference on Environment and Development &mdash; UNCED &mdash; will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in a few weeks from now. Heads of State and Government, including the Taoiseach, will attend to endorse the principles and actions needed to promote sustainable development on a global basis. UNCED is an opportunity of historic importance and Deputies will know that a special debate on it has been scheduled for later this week.</P>
    <P>The draft action programme, concentrates in particular on sectors which have the greatest environmental impact throughout the Community, such as industry, energy, transport, agriculture and tourism. Compared with many other member states, Ireland has decided natural advantages in dealing with these particular issues. Our environment is of a high quality, our industry is relatively modern and clean and our economy is based on activities in which a high premium is placed on a &ldquo;green&rdquo; image and clean processes. In our main industries, such as agriculture and tourism, environmental considerations have always been appreciated.</P>
    <P>I now come to a most important effect of the Maastricht Treaty for environmental protection in Ireland. The existing Treaty arrangements demand strict Community standards. These are justified and must be implemented, but the guiding principle up to now was that consequential investment to be made in the <Col N="519" /> member state had to come from national resources.</P>
    <P>The new Treaty acknowledges, in the improved provisions relating to the Structural Funds, that the union can only succeed if the capacities of those member states on the periphery, such as Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece, are developed to their full potential. It also acknowledges, in revised Article 130s and in the special Protocol establishing a new Cohesion Fund, that environmental measures to implement community policy on the environment which involve disproportionate costs for the public authorities concerned can rank for assistance from a new Cohesion Fund. The fund, which is to be set up before the end of 1993, is a very significant addition to the existing range of Structural Funds and is one from which Ireland will benefit. It will provide financial contributions towards projects in the environment area and for the development of trans-European networks in the area of transport infrastructure. Of special importance in the light of current budgetary constraints are the provisions that the funds will now be operated with greater flexibility so as to avoid excessive demands on the budgets of the less prosperous member states.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion Fund proposed implicity acknowledges that Community environmental policy is heavily influenced by the pollution problems of the more developed regions. Community wide action can be relatively higher in cost and lower in benefit for less developed countries such as Ireland. There will now be a means of bridging the gap between what is desirable from a Community perspective and what is affordable in the least developed regions. This fund is the first significant EC fund dedicated to the implementation of EC policy on the environment, and we will exploit it to the fullest extent possible to achieve the targets we set out in the environment action programme.</P>
    <P>The objectives of Community policy on the environment have been well reflected in the water and sanitary <Col N="520" /> services programme, which both develops and protects water resources and has a direct impact on public health. It is a programme which is fundamentally important to the economic life of the country, servicing industry, tourism and other forms of development. It affects the majority of the population, who depend on public water supplies and sewerage systems for the most basic amenities of life.</P>
    <P>The Irish programme is geared to provide economic and domestic services within a framework of relevant Community legislation. All water supplies are provided to meet the stringent quality requirements of the EC drinking water Directive. All major sewerage schemes must advance our ability to comply with the new urban waste water treatment Directive which comes into force in June 1993. The funding objectives for this decade, set out in the environment action programme at £930 million, underline the cost to Ireland of meeting Community environmental requirements in these two areas alone. As the Government have acknowledged in the environment action programme, we need support from the Community to achieve these ambitious targets.</P>
    <P>Water and sanitary services are currently benefiting from Structural Funds under three programmes, the operational programme for water, sanitary and other local services 1989-93; a programme concentrating on coastal sewage treatment under the Community environmental initiative ENVIREG; and environmental protection measures within the Community initiative INTERREG for the development of Border areas. In all, net Community aid of some £124 million is being provided through these programmes.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also benefit from the new Treaty in respect of transport infrastructure which plays a crucial part in ensuring the success of other sectors of economic activity. Major transport investment is required which will enable the Irish economy exploit to the full the opportunity of the Single Market, thereby helping it tackle and solve the major <Col N="521" /> structural problem of unemployment; offset the competitive disadvantages of Ireland's peripherality, particularly in the context of the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1993; integrate as far as possible the Irish transport system into the European network, with particular emphasis on improving the internal transport network, so as not to put Irish transport users in other member states, and access transport from Ireland to the rest of the Community.</P>
    <P>Roads, for which my Department are responsible, are, as in Europe generally, the most significiant mode of overland transport. Road freight traffic is an even higher percentage of total export freight traffic. The general dominance in Europe of road traffic in overload transport reflects people's preference for car travel. The preference for the transport of goods by lorry is a product of the quality and ease of service of road transport and the flexibility and speed of door to door carriage and its price competitiveness. In our own case, these factors are compounded by our relatively short average journey lengths which make rail and transfer from road to rail generally uneconomic.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the Treaty which has not received a great deal of attention, but which is very welcome, is the proposal to establish a Committee of the Regions. The establishment of this new consultative forum, which will be modelled on the existing Economic and Social Committee, will represent an important departure in the institutional development of the Community.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Committee of the Regions will give the representatives of the regions throughout the Community a direct voice in the consideration of legislation which affects their interests. There will be a formal obligation to consult the committee on draft legislation in a number of important areas of Community policy. It will be modelled on the existing Economic and Social Committee and will be consulted on draft legislation in areas such as education, culture, public health, trans-European networks and economic and <Col N="522" /> social cohesion. Moreover, the committee will have a right to submit opinions on its own initiative where it considers that specific regional interests are involved.</P>
    <P>Ireland will have a total of nine members on the new committee. The composition of Ireland's representatives on the committee will be a matter for decision by the Government in due course. I think Deputies will agree that this is a significant development in the increasing democratisation of the Community and one which allows valuable participation by public representatives in important policy making areas.</P>
    <P>In the areas for which I am responsible, the European Community has been a leading force in the development of advanced and progressive policies. Where Ireland is concerned, the EC has not just been in the business of defining policies and setting guidelines for member states to follow. It has actively put in place support structures for the less developed countries such as Ireland and provided much of the financial means whereby these policies are being realised.</P>
    <P>That EC support role is being emphasised and intensified in the new Maastricht arrangements. I am confident that the people of Ireland will once more firmly endorse Ireland's role and future within the wider EC opportunities which are now open to us.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned the question of Maastricht and the future of this country in Europe is a core value for the Fine Gael Party. The future of the country is dependent on being part of a federal Europe. There is no future for a country that represents 1 per cent of the population of the Community unless we are part of a wider Europe. We all know we are more dependent on exports than Japan and we are aware of <Col N="523" /> the penetration of their cars, televisions and radios. The EC has removed our dependence on Britain as an export economy and has substituted Europe. How much greater our difficulties would be, given the British recession, if we did not have access to Europe.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to make relates to transport policy. It is absolutely vital that we overcome our biggest single disadvantage in terms of our peripheral location from the market by reducing transport costs. Without the help of European aid, the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds, it will not be possible to develop our airports, seaports, roads and infrastructure to the necessary level. I hope that with thes7e new funds we can set out a new transport policy that will give public transport a new priority. We did not spend one penny of the last financial tranche on inter-city rail. We do not have an integrated public transport system in Dublin. I hope that one of the major opportunities arising out of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to Maastricht will be light rail for Dublin and a revitalised service in other areas.</P>

      <Col N="524" /> In his response to Deputy Fennell's Bill, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, indicated his intention to introduce appropriate legislation. He said that he would be putting forward ideas for discussion on these and many other areas in a Green Paper. He outlined various intentions in the Green Paper and stated:</P>
    <P>What I have outlined demonstrates my intention and that of the Government to undertake the most comprehensive review of psychiatric services and we wish to ensure that all interested parties and individuals are given the fullest opportunity to contribute to this review.</P>

      <P>I am happy to be interrupted if it will clarify a point for Deputy Fennell. The Minister went on to state that he and the Government are determined on this issue. He said that he knew the task would not be easy and that many conflicting views as to the correct approach would have to be teased out to the greatest possible extent. He said that the bottom line was that if we would succeed in doing this we would, at the end of the day, have a more effective, caring and acceptable mental health service which would be of benefit not only to patients, who are our primary concern, but also to all those who work in providing the service and to society as a whole. That would be everyone's intention, including Deputy Fennell's. The Minister is giving a firm commitment to introduce the necessary legislation and to involve all interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me briefly revert back to 1981. In 1981 legislation was rushed through the House and the experience now is that it cannot be properly implemented. If we <Col N="525" /> are to introduce new mental health legislation we should ensure that it is as comprehensive and as wide-ranging as possible and conforms with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations principle on the care of mentally ill patients.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell's Bill has certain merits but focuses too much on the wrong issues. There is an implication that most mentally ill patients are wrongfully deprived of their liberty and badly treated by the psychiatric services. I cannot agree with this. First, 90 per cent of all psychiatric patients are admitted to the service on a voluntary basis and 10 per cent involuntarily. In every case there are good clinical reasons for admission and professional supporting evidence for such admissions.</P>
    <P>There have been great changes in our psychiatric services. Those working in this very difficult and sensitive area are extremely committed individuals and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in the delivery of the psychiatric services. As chairman of the Eastern Health Board I have had the opportunity to meet those people and to visit many of the premises where services are provided. It is no exaggeration to say that many changes have taken place in this area particularly since the adoption of the document Planning for the Future.</P>
    <P>Previously services for people with a mental illness were provided in large institutions and not only the patients but the buildings were ostracised by the community proper. There have been many radical changes since then. Services are now orientated towards community care catchment areas and sector headquarters, providing a network of newly defined services. Years ago these asylums catered for large numbers of people from all walks of life. Some were inappropriately placed in such asylums. Some were placed there by relatives who were happy to leave them in these asylums. The records show that some lived in asylums for anything up to 60 years with few if any visits from family or friends. I am <Col N="526" /> glad to say that that does not happen today. Today there is a huge network of services to accommodate the now defined illnesses with a specialised approach and counselling services which encompass long stay care, crisis intervention, day places in hospitals, training workshops, day centres, hospital accommodation and community residences providing varying degrees of support and proper integration of patients into the community.</P>
    <P>Formerly, patients were referred to as inmates. That this is no longer the case shows the change in attitude to people with mental illness by those who are providing the service. Walls have come down and doors have been opened. There is no doubt that there have been changes. Side by side with that is the question of monitoring and evaluating and a stage has been reached where we must assess the situation.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note that the Minister in his speech when referring to the document Planning for the Future said that eight years after the publication of the document it was necessary to take stock of the situation, to evaluate what has been achieved and to consider how we will move forward. He also referred to the Green Paper he intends to introduce. During the past eight years we have seen great changes, development and progress in relation to the provision of services and, as the Minister indicated, it is about time to take stock. I do not wish to pre-empt what might emerge from revision or taking stock but we will never revert to the old days of asylums or institutionalised settings. We will see a further development of a comprehensive, more integrated and community oriented caring service for those suffering from mental illness.</P>
    <P>The Bill really addresses only two issues, medical certification for temporary reception orders and the establishment of mental health review bodies. Any new legislation must go a great deal further. I already covered the changing trends in psychiatric services, particularly since the introduction of Planning for the Future, and we must now introduce the necessary legislation which will cover the <Col N="527" /> providers of services and the patients as well as many other proposed developments and the changing trends in the psychiatric services. Unfortunately, for that reason, like the Minister and Government speakers so far, I cannot support the Bill. I welcome it in so far as it gives people an opportunity to bring to the fore matters of concern in relation to mental health and the service at present being provided. It is an opportunity to review and assess the situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to introduce a Green Paper on this and &mdash; which is very important &mdash; to involve all the people working in the service on a day to day basis. We will have to continue to closely monitor the area of mental health because I have received complaints which greatly concerned me. A constituent of mine received inappropriate and an unacceptable level of care by a private concern offering psychiatric treatment in the city of Dublin. I will focus on this point very briefly. A young gentleman went to his GP who decided he needed long stay care in a psychiatric hospital. He was admitted to a private psychiatric hospital; after five days the administrator in the hospital &mdash; not one of the medical team &mdash; was informed that the individual's VHI would not cover his stay there. When he was admitted he was told that his stay would be in the region of 21 days and that during that period he would receive therapy to address his illness. However, after the fifth day, when the administrator was aware that VHI would not cover his stay in the private hospital his bags were packed, his bed was changed and he was advised to leave the hospital. This individual could have had suicidal tendencies and we should ensure that no private hospital can treat a patient, particularly in the area of psychiatric and mental illness, in this manner. I brought this matter to the attention of the Minister's predecessor and authorities in various capacities but little or nothing has been done to date. I ask the Minister to bear this problem in mind when he introduces his Green Paper because a huge number <Col N="528" /> of people use private hospitals and there is a problem in relation to VHI which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change which Planning for the Future has brought about, particularly in relation to the whole area of stigma which used to be attached to mental illness. That is changing and is being assisted by the manner in which Planning for the Future services are being provided. We should continue to go down that road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is welcome in so far as it creates an awareness of the need for legislation in regard to mental health. It attempts to focus on the rights of persons involuntarily admitted and detained in psychiatric hospitals. Highlighting issues of this kind in relation to mental health is always welcome. The Bill contains provisions which will be included in the Minister's proposed legislation in regard to mental health. In so far as it generates a mood of urgency which is not required in the case of the Minister &mdash; the debate is welcome and I am sure he will deal in his reply with the introduction of a Green Paper, a White Paper and legislation of a more comprehensive kind which will cover a broad range of issues not included in Deputy Fennell's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a reference in the debate to the extent to which our existing legal procedures conform with this country's obligation under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the United Nations Covenant in the same area. It was suggested by Members of the Opposition that the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, did not conform to the European Convention or the UN Covenant. I repudiate that; in relation to the European Convention, case laws developed and as a result of those laws which were before the European Court through the seventies and eighties, new judgements have elucidated the obligation to provide a review of every order detaining a patient in a psychiatric hospital, to provide an automatic review of people who are detained on a long term basis in psychiatric <Col N="529" /> hospitals, to inform detained persons of their rights and to provide legal representation for detained patients. All these matters must be dealt with in a Green Paper and subsequent legislation and the volume of case law makes it important for the Minister to do this.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister highlighted the importance of introducing a patients' charter for those cared for in our psychiatric hospitals. The central position of a patient in all aspects of the organisation and delivery of health care is required. I understand that the patients' charter is at an advanced stage of preparation and is designed to ensure that all hospital patients are treated with the respect they deserve. That is a very important development which the Minister has seized on as being essential.</P>
    <P>The standard of nursing care is high and the introduction of the patient's charter will ensure equally high standards in dealing with patients in a professional and courteous manner, respecting their privacy.</P>
    <P>The charter will be based upon the following principles: the right of access to services in accordance with need; the right to considerate and respectful care; the right to privacy; the right to information; the right to confidentially of all medical records; the right to refuse to participate in research projects; the right to respect for religious and philosophical beliefs; and the right to make a complaint. That is all very important. We have already moved in the direction of reform. The report Planning for the Future, published in 1984, was the first real acknowledgement of the need for reform. The Minister's Green and White Papers and legislation will put the coping stone on the reforms envisaged in that report. The thrust of the recommendations of the report was clear. It recommended a service which was comprehensive, community oriented, sector based and integrated with other health services. The core recommendation related to sectorisation &mdash; the provision of a comprehensive psychiatric service for a population of known size resident within a clearly defined district. There <Col N="530" /> would be a multi-disciplinary team of health professionals comprising nurses, psychologists and social workers. Planning for the Future outlined in detail the goals to be achieved to improve our psychiatric service.</P>
    <P>We need a statutory framework to effect these changes. The fundamental shift in the delivery of our psychiatric services from institutions to community oriented services must be underpinned by appropriate legislation to facilitate full implementation of the recommendations. We are agreed on all sides that the 1945 Act does not provide a satisfactory legal basis to promote and put in place suitable facilities designed to provide modern methods of care for the mentally ill. Fresh legislation to take account of this caring philosophy will encourage a change in attitudes among those members of the public who may find if difficult to understand why people whose condition once made it necessary for them to be shut away are now considered fit to be in society. An extreme view might be held by a few that there are enough problems in the streets without adding to them. Some families with mentally ill members may fear that the decrease in the number of mental hospitals could mean the transfer back to them of the full burden of care and support without the clear and full endorsement by Government of alternative and improved care facilities for the mentally ill through the enactment of legislation to reflect the current direction in the delivery of psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the dominant thrust of the Bill before us is to safeguard the rights of detained persons in our psychiatric hospitals. This issue undoubtedly needs to be addressed and deserves to figure prominently in the new mental treatment legislation to be introduced by the Minister. Notwithstanding the importance of this matter, new legislation will also need to embrace the full range of issues reflecting the recent transformation in the delivery of our psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the Minister for Health approved on 15 April 1992 <Col N="531" /> the Government's decision to publish a Green Paper on the development of services for the mentally ill and new mental treatment legislation. The clear purpose of new legislation is to provide a framework for the development of the psychiatric services and to meet our commitments under international law in respect of patients detained in our psychiatric hospitals. Publication of the Green Paper will allow all interested parties to engage in full and open discussion on options put forward to adequately protect the rights of detained persons and measures designed to develop the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to avoid a repetition of the failed attempt to bring into operation new mental treatment legislation which occurred following the enactment of the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981. They are also conscious of the need to achieve broad consensus on safeguarding the rights of detained patients and future development of the psychiatric services. In relation to the former, it is important to ensure that proposed legislation will fully comply with this country's obligations under the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights under the auspices of the United Nations. While the provisions of the proposed Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill, 1992, mark an improvement in the rights of detained patients, they would not in fact completely satisfy this country's international obligations under international law. It is clear therefore that the approach agreed by Government to introduce new mental health legislation offers the most practical and open method to ensure our psychiatric services are developed to meet the needs of the mentally ill into the next century.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Fennell's Bill is excellent in so far as it goes, and the Deputy is to be commended on the work put into it, it can be subsumed in the comprehensive legislation envisaged by the Minister after full public debate following <Col N="532" /> the production of the Green and White Papers. The Minister has already given sufficient evidence of an urgent approach to medical and health problems to warrant the support of this House in his endeavours to introduce this comprehensive legislation which will embrace and subsume the points embodied in Deputy Fennell's Bill.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Fennell on focusing the attention of the House on an issue of very real importance. I know the amount of work she put into this legislation. She and the Fine Gael Party are to be highly commended.</P>
      <P>This Bill has shone a light into a dark area. The notion that we could possibly be incarcerated against our will in a mental institution and deemed by society not to be in control of our faculties probably constitutes our worst secret nightmare. Unfortunately, that nightmare is a reality for some individuals. Our history in relation to mental hospitals is not a glorious one. We have often used these very large Victorian buildings dotted around the landscape as convenient places to put away people who cause social embarrassment. For much of the early part of this century and into modern times people such as unmarried mothers or prostitutes were deemed not to be in control of their mental faculties, such was the social nature of their great sin, and they were put away from society, often for years on end, expected to live out their lives in isolation and deemed not to be full citizens. For many years these mental institutions were a convenient refuge for those individuals in our society whom we did not want to recognise. Our history in relation to those people, who in many instances had literally nowhere to go, is not a glorious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> We have made some progress since that time. Those dark days have been left behind but we have a long way to go still in providing a legislative framework within which to operate in particular our mental institutions. It is interesting to note that one can find in the Oireachtas Library annual reports on, for example, the prison system or places of detention. Also available are the current reports on the Probation and Welfare Service and the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. One simply has to ask for them. Ireland has a reasonable record of openness with regard to those whose rights have been taken away because of their criminal activity but we have a much less acceptable record when it comes to openness and concern for those whose liberty has been taken away for health reasons or for alleged health reasons.</P>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, created the post of Inspector of Mental Hospitals. The inspector's powers under that Act are wide ranging and include the visiting of all mental institutions and the examination of patients. Under the legislation the inspector may inquire into the propriety of receptions and discharges relating to mental hospitals and can inquire into any form of restraint, coercion or treatment. He may inspect any part of an institution. Section 238 of the Act states:</P>
    <P>Where the Inspector of Mental Hospitals visits any mental institution, he shall give special attention to the state of mind of any patient detained therein the propriety of whose detention he doubts or has been requested by the patient himself or any other person to examine, and if he becomes of the opinion that the propriety of the detention requires further consideration, he shall indicate such opinion in any register of patients kept in the institution.</P>
    <P>That power is further developed in section 239, which states that when the inspector forms the opinion that the propriety of such detention requires further consideration he shall report that matter to the Minister. The power applies to <Col N="534" /> both private and public institutions. Section 247 of the Act requires the inspector each year to furnish a report to the Minister on the administration of the law relating to mental institutions and the care, welfare and treatment of persons of unsound mind. Under section 247 (2) it is provided that every such report be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a copy be sent to the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>In theory, we should have a clear understanding and overview of what is happening in mental hospitals because even the inadequate 1945 Act provides that that information be available to the Minister and those in authority. What is the present position?</P>
    <P>I understand that the most recent published report of the inspector covered the years 1977 to 1979. I know that the former Minister for Health Deputy O'Rourke, promised in January of this year that the reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the years 1988 and 1989 would be amalgamated and presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future. In January 1992 the reports for 1988 and 1989 were still being prepared. Minister O'Rourke also stated in January that the inspector was preparing the 1990 report on his inspections, which she hoped would also be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future. That is a completely inadequate and unacceptable position. It is an indicator of the regard we have and the importance we place on the proper monitoring of our mental institutions that reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals are not compiled and published within a reasonable period of time. That is in stark contrast to monitoring of people committed to our prisons for criminal offences, who seem to get a better deal, which is most inappropriate.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly considerable disquiet here about a number of cases that have recently come to light. Those cases of suffering and hardship require immediate attention; they require action by the Oireachtas. I listened with alarm as Government speakers indicated their support for the theory, thrust and intent <Col N="535" /> of the Bill but they were unwilling to support it because it was not comprehensive. That is a very poor and unacceptable response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Our greatest responsibility is to the most vulnerable in our society. A hallmark of recent cases has been the domination of women, in particular by their husbands. In a society that is gradually moving towards equality &mdash; or so we thought &mdash; from the evidence presented, there seems to be a greater reliance placed on the word of a man over that of a woman. That is horrendous when what is at stake is the basic rights of liberty.</P>
      <P>The notion that this Bill should not be supported because it is not comprehensive defies logic and reason. If the Minister accepts the thrust of the Bill, he should vote for it and allow his colleagues, who, I think, are minded to vote for it, to do the same. The Bill might not be comprehensive, and nobody suggests it is, but it addressed an issue of great concern to the people of this country and it could well dovetail into the more comprehensive legislation the Minister intends to bring before the House in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting &mdash; and I do not consider that anybody who supports the Bill does &mdash; that a huge number of people are incarcerated against their will who are of sound of mind, as if a squad was out on the streets to take people into mental institutions. That is not so. It is not correct that a significant number of people are detained in mental institutions against their will. The reality is that if a single such case exists it is of such horror that it has to be addressed. If under our procedures that can happen &mdash; as evidenced by the cases that come to light in recent months &mdash; those procedures must be changed. They should be changed immediately, and the way to do so is to accept this very welcome Bill, which is very good in so far as it goes. The issue is of such fundamental importance that <Col N="536" /> the scale of the problem does not matter &mdash; one case of incarceration on an involuntary basis of somebody who should not be in a mental institution is one case too many and the procedures that allow that to happen must be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised &mdash; a promise he reiterated last week &mdash; he would publish a Green Paper on the whole issue. That was very welcome, but there has also been a promise from the Government benches of a Green Paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We shall test the Minister. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. There was a promise of a Green Paper on education. That was promised by three Ministers but we have yet to see it, although the most recent development was a leaking of its text. I will give the Minister the benefit of the doubt &mdash; I believe him to be a man of his word &mdash; but he must act quickly on this issue. I hope my trust will be well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report Planning for the Future there is focus on community based psychiatric care. In this regard I wish to issue a warning. A similar policy decision was made in the United Kingdom in recent years when it was decided that large institutionalised care was not the right decision to follow and that community care should be evolved on a small, localised basis. Most progressive people say that that is the right prescription for a caring society. But what happened in Britain? The large institutions were closed down and patients were virtually turfed out on to the streets. Many of those patients ended up in bed and breakfast accommodation and roaming the street during the day. That is an appalling situation. It was an appalling situation because the institutions were closed down and corresponding resources were not placed in the community to deal with the issue. We must get the right sequence of events. The community provision must be put in place before we start closing institutions. I trust that the Minister will accept that and that we will not repeat <Col N="537" /> the dreadful experiences in the UK in this matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses one clear problem in the procedures that govern admission and monitoring of patients to mental institutions here. It does not purport to be a comprehensive solution to all the problems of the psychiatric services or the medical institutions. It purports to address one real problem that nobody in this House suggests does not exist. I appeal to the Minister to accept it as a welcome interim measure. The Minister should not vote it down because he thinks he can do better in a holistic way. The Minister should accept the good measures in it now. For that reason my colleagues and I will support the Bill. I hope that when the time comes the Minister will be gracious enough also to accept it as a worthwhile, positive and welcome step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for sharing his time with me. I am glad that Deputy Fennell brought this Bill to the House. It was the former Deputy Noel Browne who said many years ago that there are no votes in mental illness. All around us we can see the evidence of the truth of this in our psychiatric services. The 1945 Act which governs mental treatment is totally defective and it does not provide properly for patients' rights. It actively creates a stigma surrounding psychiatric care which is most unhelpful if we want to see a modern service develop to intervene in a timely way in crises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuts in this area have been more severe then in any other area of the health services. Since this Government took office there has been a staggering 22 per cent cut in real terms in resources for the psychiatric services. This is more than three times the cut in any other area of the health services. Conditions in many of our psychiatric institutions bear testimony to this. Some wards have been widely described as warehouses rather than places where people can get dignified care. It is very disappointing that the Minister will not accept that this Bill is a badly needed step in the direction of <Col N="538" /> reforming the 1945 Act. The Minister should accept this rather than wait for a series of Green Papers followed by consultation and then the publication of the Bill followed by a lengthy debate here.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be aware that the Department of Health, if they have been doing anything since 1981, should have been consulting on the way to tackle this and they should be well prepared to deal with this point in our mental health legislation. The Minister should not say that we need more consultation on something with which he agrees in principle, with which the officials agree and with which the House agrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1945 Act is far too narrow. It deals with institutionalisation but not with the much wider issue of care and treatment. Institutionalisation is only a tiny part of psychiatric care nowadays and most people can be treated successfully as out-patients. Sadly, this 1945 Act creates the impression that psychiatric care is about putting people away. It gives the perception that if people go for psychiatric help they will lose control over the sort of treatment they get. The ECT was always the great scare. It creates the perception that people might be committed even though they may have voluntarily presented themselves. I know of many cases in which patients who did not wish <Col N="539" /> to comply with the prescribed treatment were subsequently committed.</P>
    <P>The procedures here are highly unsatisfactory. There is concern about the fact that there may be only one doctor but a much deeper concern is that very often not enough thought is put into the acceptance of a patient. There is not a rigid procedure whereby the certifying doctor should set out his reasons for taking the view that a person is dangerous to himself or to the community and whereby that information would be made available to the patient so that he could challenge it. There should be an obligation on the psychiatric consultants in the hospital to have fully examined the patient within 24 hours and within another stated period there should be an obligation on the head of the unit to have made a similar examination.</P>
    <P>These procedures are badly needed. A judge cannot deprive a person of his freedom without giving him a right to a defence or an appeal and without the right to know why he is being imprisoned, but in the 1945 Act we are denying people these rights. This Act perpetuates the terrible bad image of seeking psychiatric help. There has been an alarming growth in suicides among the 20 to 30 age group and it is worrying that it has been suggested at international level that many of them should have received psychiatric treatment. They are plainly not presenting themselves and part of the reason for that is the extremely bad image of our psychiatric services. It is time we eliminated fear of the psychiatric services. This Bill is a very important first step in that direction.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Howlin, I am concerned by the reports of conditions in our psychiatric hospitals. There is acute overcrowding in admission units. I have heard descriptions of patients coming into wards catering for perhaps up to 40 people. These are people in acute crisis. To throw people like that into an overcrowded ward is not putting them into a setting in which they can receive proper care. We need to give priority to the admission units so that people in crisis, <Col N="540" /> needing psychiatric services for the first time, will have their cases dealt with in reasonable privacy and with access to the sort of therapy they should be getting. That is not what is happening at the moment. It is not right that people should be crowded into wards, perhaps meeting patients who are old timers and getting terrible disturbing acounts of what they will face. That sort of situation is very damaging to the service and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>While I commend this Minister for his decision to publish for the first time in 13 years the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, he must recognise the enormity of the scandal that these reports have not been published to date and that as I understand it, they have effectively been suppressed within his Department.</P>

      <P>If the Minister did not bring in orders to implement the new set of regulations to provide protection for and assurance to the public about conditions, then he had a moral obligation to continue to operate what was there before. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand it the only channel through which a patient who felt aggrieved about his conditions could make a complaint was to this Inspector of Mental Hospitals; that was the main channel for a person to have his or her view heard. The Department were actively suppressing that channel getting the light of day, not letting people hear investigations of complaints being lodged.</P>

He must also give us an assurance that we will not be furnished with a report that may be, say, three years out of date when it comes from the printers, a report that might tell us about the conditions in, say, 1989, when what we are all concerned about are the conditions obtaining in 1992. The Minister has an obligation to carry out investigations whenever there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that conditions are not what we would like them to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing the Chair constantly, but the Minister is offering to intervene.</P>
      <P>I think his Department sabotaged what was an important channel of complaint. While the Minister has put that to rights, we want up to date information. We want information to hand on what are the conditions prevailing at present in the black spots. We do not want a report three years out of date, when the Minister would be in a position to stand up and say &ldquo;Ah well, of course, that unit is now closed&rdquo;. That would be no good to us. We want to know where are the present black spots and what is being done about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, all of us in this House are alarmed at the growing rate of suicides in this country. We are committed under the WHO &ldquo;Health For All Targets&rdquo; to reduce our suicide rates by 25 per cent in the period 1985 to the year 2000, whereas in contast we have had a 150 per cent increase in suicides in the past decade. It is not good enough for Ministers to wring their hands and contend that that is just the nature of the world in which we live today. If we are <Col N="542" /> serious about tackling this problem we must go out into the community and provide the type of support services necessary for people at risk. That means educating the community to recognise warning signals and, even more important, giving family doctors the back-up they need to identify and successfully manage patients who may be at risk within the community.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, at present many general practitioners find it extremely difficult to gain access to the advice of psychiatric services. That should be rectified; psychiatric advice should be readily available to general practitioners so that they can manage their patients in the community, where they should be managed. Let us face up to it, most psychiatric illness has to do with social, economic and family conditions in which people find themselves, such as bad housing, unemployment, family difficulties. Those problems must be revolved within the community in which they live. Psychiatric illness is more acutely linked to socio-economic deprivation than any other illness. The ratio of admissions is five or six times to one across the social classes. The ratio for widows is much higher than in the case of people with support in their home.</P>
    <P>All of this is evidence that very often psychiatric care has to do with managing crises in their homes. We must revert to circumstances in which the front line, the general practitioners, and most importantly, the community psychiatric nurses are there to provide that service. I am very worried about rumours and reports I hear that there is a progressive dismantling of the community psychiatric nursing service &mdash; the nurse who would be dedicated exclusively to providing that support service in the community. I have heard that their position has been downgraded, that more and more ordinary hospital nurses undertake this task on a temporary basis rather than having community psychiatric nurses dedicated on a long term basis to providing this service. That is crucial, because very many of the high risk patients are those who just after <Col N="543" /> discharge from hospital need access to that vital support.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also tackle the scandal of suicides in our prisons. As I understand it, there is a waiting list for access to the Central Mental Hospital. The result of that is there are known high risk suicidal cases in cells in our prisons who cannot hope to receive the care and supervision they need. This issue must be tackled as a priority. The Prison Officers Association rightly raised this matter last week. There are facilities lying idle that could be brought into use. The Minister has an obligation to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I have strayed somewhat from the Bill, because it is seldom we are afforded an opportunity to talk about psychiatric services. I would like to warmly endorse the case Deputy Fennell put forward so well last week. It is vital that we give people access to proper information about the reasons they were committed. It is vital that we give them access to a proper system of review of cases when they feel they have been wrongly committed. It is important that people who are admitted voluntarily should not in some way slip into compulsory committal without having the option of demanding a review and their entitlements and to have their views about care taken into account. Consent is an absolute pillar of medical treatment; the patient's consent must be there. That must be enshrined as a basic principle in our Mental Treatment Acts.</P>
    <P>I warmly support Deputy Fennell on her introduction of this Bill. I would ask the Minister to have a change of heart. I realise, as does Deputy Fennell, that this is not the answer to reform of the Mental Treatment Act. But it is the answer to a particular problem which would give people greater confidence in what is happening in our psychiatric institutions. That much would be under the Minister's belt within weeks, would be a nick in the post and worthwhile. We would all welcome his further proposals.</P>

      <P>Since its establishment some 25 years ago the Mental Health Association of Ireland have played a major role in educating public opinion about mental illness, especially in latter years creating a more informed, tolerant general public attitude towards psychiatric illness. The success of caring for people with psychiatric illnesses in our community is to a large degree dependent on an informed public awareness of the overall position so that their deep rooted fears and misunderstandings can be allayed. For that reason the Mental Health Association of Ireland, all of us in the medical profession and the many people who deal with the psychiatrically ill are indebted to Deputy Fennell for having introduced this Bill at this time enabling us to deal with what might be described, and was by the Minister, as the most outdated legislation on our Statute Book at present.</P>
      <P>In recent days I listened to some of the most horrendous stories; thankfully, they appeared to be few. Indeed I am grateful at not having come across any in my area. Nonetheless, as other Members have said, it is regrettable that any should exist. Every effort must be undertaken to close the loopholes in the 1945 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great progress has been made in this field through the development of new drugs and a growing awareness of the issue among members of the community. A better community care system has been responsible for the gradual shift from a custodial regime of care to a more positive rehabilitation regime. Many patients <Col N="545" /> have been placed in community care which, as we all know, is in line with the recommendations made by the review body in their document entitled Planning for the Future. We have implemented this recommendation to the best of our ability over the past number of years. The review body also recommend that large institutionalised hospitals should be dismantled. Despite what the Deputies opposite have said, we are continuing to act on that recommendation. The need for community care was advocated throughout the eighties. When Deputy O'Hanlon was Minister for Health he recommended the placing of more and more people in the community and tried to get the necessary resources to ensure that they would be looked after properly.</P>
    <P>While I applaud Deputy Fennell on her Bill, I have to be critical of Deputy Bruton and my professional colleague, Deputy Lee, who criticised the Minister for the remarks he made. The Minister is a very honest man who is trying his utmost to improve conditions in this area. He was appalled at some of the statements made in the 1989 inspector's report on mental hospitals. He said that some of the conditions in hospitals were disquieting and that this was probably due to a lack of resources. These were all very honest statements, particularly the latter one.</P>
    <P>Like most members of the Opposition, Deputy Lee suggested that the more money put into this area the better the conditions would be. Unfortunately, the solution is not as simple as that. Ireland is a small and relatively poor country and the provision of extra resources is always a problem for us. It is cynical in the extreme for Opposition Deputies to demand large amounts of money for just about everything. All parties have been guilty of this attitude in the past. While I am sure we would find enough things on which to spend an extra £100 million it would not gurantee that all our problems would be solved. I hope the Government and the Minister will establish the priorities in the health area and do their best to ensure that they get value for money. After all, the Constitution <Col N="546" /> charges us with responsibility for looking after all the children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>I think there is a consensus that this area of medicine has been somewhat neglected. However, we need to ensure that we get value for money. I believe the Minister has a great feeling for this area of medicine. If there is to be discrimination in favour of any area of medicine, I ask the Minister to look favourably at this one. As Deputy O'Donoghue said last night, extra funding will be needed if the recommendations contained in the report Planning for the Future are to be properly implemented. I am sure the Minister is interested in ensuring that this is done. The Minister is a man of integrity and high standards, and I am sure he will see to it that as many of those recommendations as possible are implemented and that value for money is obtained.</P>
    <P>This is an issue which needed to be discussed and I compliment Deputy Fennell on her initiative in bringing this Bill forward. Even though Deputy Howlin will probably criticise me for not voting in favour of it tonight, I have to say I read Deputy Fennell's Bill, and also the 1981 Bill. The Deputy has been accused at times of delving into the 1981 Bill but that is not the way it appears to me. While I would not go so far as to say they are flawed, I do not think either Bill could be implemented. In view of its importance, we needed to have a proper discussion on this area of medicine. Deputy Fennell can take credit for affording us that opportunity. I am not making excuses for not voting in favour of the Bill: I have problems with certain sections of it and I believe this issue deserves a much wider discussion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell has proposed the setting up of a review body or tribunal for assessing people who are already in psychiatric institutions. I have difficulty in understanding how such a tribunal or review body would work in a health board area. She referred to the members of the review body. I have difficulty in accepting her proposals in this regard as I believe a review body should include a psychiatrist, a lawyer, a lay person and <Col N="547" /> various other people. However, I believe there would be tussles between the psychiatrist and the hospital who have kept the patient in for so long and the review body &mdash; they would pull one another apart; there would be a clash of interests. I presume the tribunal or review body would meet as often as required. They would have to gather all the facts, examine the history of the case and visit general practitioners. In some cases patients might have to wait for one or two months before the tribunal issued their report. I believe the members of my profession are capable of dealing with patients who are already in hospital, even though some of them may have been institutionalised unfairly or against their will. While I appreciate the Deputy's proposal in this area I do not think it could be implemented.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell said she wanted to ensure that there would be more rigorous certification. I would agree with that proposal. However, it is debatable whether this could be achieved if there are only two doctors involved. While it could be achieved in large urban areas it could give rise to difficulties in rural areas. Some patients who come into the psychiatric hospital in my area have not seen their own doctor.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the large number of involuntary admissions. It is true to say that there are more involuntary admissions in Ireland than in most other countries. We have been blaming husbands, wives and other relatives for this. However, I have to say that doctors are not blameless in this regard. Doctors may be responsibile for a large percentage of involuntary admissions because for a long time they have not even been implementing the provisions of the flawed 1945 Act.</P>
    <P>To go back to the last point I made, who should be certified? In my opinion a person should be certified only where there is clear evidence of a psychotic condition such as schizophrenia, manic depression, severe paranoia and so on. In England, alcohol and drug abuse are major problems in terms of psychiatric <Col N="548" /> illness. People with an alcohol or drug problem should not be certified except in severe cases of psychotic addiction to drugs and, perhaps, in cases of the DTs and alcoholism. I have seen young wives who have been battered by their husbands and then use the psychiatric hospital as a refuge. The Garda will not charge these people because they have a psychiatric background.</P>
    <P>There is much in this Bill that could be discussed and there are many areas in which we are all at fault. I compliment the Deputy for bringing forward this very vital legislation, but I would perfer to wait for the Green Paper. Unfortunately, therefore, I will be voting against the Bill tonight. I will share the remainder of my time with Deputy Davern.</P>

      <P>This matter deserves a much wider debate than is allowed for at present. Since I came into this House in 1969 there has been a total change in attitude to psychiatric illness. While that change has been slow it has been tremendous over the last couple of years. If we are going to adopt legislation in this area we need a much wider debate than that allowed for in this Bill. I would say to members of the Opposition that there is a slight element of hypocrisy in their thinking. During the time of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, from 1983 to 1987, the mental health reports were never published. Deputy Fennell was Minister during that period.</P>

      <P>I was making the accusation more against the Chair than against Deputy Fennell. There is a deeply held view in Ireland on mental health and in view of the changes that have taken place in the last number of years a review is necessary. This matter must be considered in a broad way rather than on specific issues. I would impress upon the Minister the need to consider section 21 of the Mental Health Act whereby a psychiatric nurse, on the basis of a complaint by a patient, may be suspended without pay. In my brief period as Minister, I removed the suggestion without pay element from the Vocational Education Act, 1944. In this case the measure should also be removed. The fact that a person is suspended without pay automatically means they are assumed to be guilty.</P>
      <P>The life of one man in my town has been destroyed by an accusation made against him, which everybody believed. The man who made the accusation was mentally ill and withdrew the allegation afterwards, but that was no good to the person involved. Everybody believed the allegations against him because the authority suspended him without pay for three months ending an inquiry. This is an area that needs to be addressed immediately so that confidence can be restored to psychiatric nurses who have done tremendous work over the years. These people are susceptible to allegations, and too many false allegations have been made against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned the rejection of suicides. For too many years in this country we did not recognise suicide for various reasons, religious, insurance and so on. Suddenly the suicide figure seems to be very high. I am extremely <Col N="550" /> alarmed at the number of suicides among young people. We cannot legislate for a reduction in the number of suicides but we can consider the problems involved and the causes, many of which are totally unexplainable, of this horrendous act, carried out in some case by people who are reasonably happy.</P>
    <P>This is not a Bill that should be dealt with in two or three nights. It is as important as the Companies Act which took several years to be put through the House. The attitude to mental health has changed tremendously in the last 20 years, with people now being allowed to go for walks outside the hospitals and in some cases they are allowed home. The legislation in this area dates back years and if we are to legislate for the year 2000 we should discuss the matter fully in a calm way with no time pressure.</P>

      <P>I rise to respond to this debate with a heavy heart. First, I thank all the speakers who contributed over the two weeks. It was quite an extraordinary, interesting, stimulating and, for me, very informative debate. A record number of Deputies contributed to the debate &mdash; I counted 16 excluding the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Flood. They were Deputies Browne, Ferris, Moynihan, Barnes, Fitzpatrick, Roche, O'Hanlon, Lee, O'Donoghue, McCartan, Callely, Lenihan, Howlin, McDaid, Davern and my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton. I thank these people sincerely for their keenness to contribute to the debate and the role they played in widening the content of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank the other people who helped in the presentation of this Bill. A number of lawyers who were interested in this legislation helped me enormously over the months. I thank the FLAC Trinity students who have a great interest in and commitment to research in this area. I thank the members of WIP, the newly formed organisation for Wrongly Institutionalised People, who take a constructive and reasonable approach to seeking legislative change. I would like to thank Irish Women's Aid and the Council for the Status of Women <Col N="551" /> who have come out publicly in support of this Bill; the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Women's Political Association. I also thank the drafting section in the House who were of enormous help to me.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to listen to the contributions and the kind comments and to the congratulations extended to me for bringing forward the Bill. It showed an understanding and an appreciation for the work involved in producing a Private Member's Bill with only the resources of one's Dáil office. Many speakers said they appreciated the opportunity to discuss mental health issues. Tonight again we heard that a long time has passed since this matter was properly debated. I agree that this was a good feature of Private Member's time, but I did not set out merely to provide a vehicle for a debate on mental health. I set out seriously to produce a Bill that would be accepted and enacted into law. My aim was to fill the legislative vacuum in the mental health area. I know this Bill is not perfect and that it is flawed but there will be flaws when somebody puts together a Bill without the resources and back-up of the Department. The Bill is not cast in tablets of marble and I accept that it needs amending. I do not have any great maternal feeling about this Bill and I would have liked it to be amended but I know that is not possible. There my goodwill ends.</P>
    <P>The Government's and the Minister for Health's approach to this legislation is not only regrettable, it is downright sick. It would be hard to find a subject on which there has been such political neglect over the years while at the same time such a cause of public concern and desire for legislative action.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing tonight in the rejection of the Bill by Government is once more pointing up the irrelevancy of this Chamber to people's lives. How can the action of Government Deputies who are going to walk through the &ldquo;no&rdquo; lobby tonight not contribute to an even greater public cynicism of their work as politicians? It is particularly sad in view of the <Col N="552" /> excellent and reflective speeches made by Government Deputies, who showed a high degree of understanding on the matter, who expressed great concern and the desire to see changes made. I accept their sincerity and I thank them, but concern and compassion are poor currency in a fight to establish civil rights and basic freedom, which is what this Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>What is happening here tonight emphatically makes a nonsense of the proposals for Dáil reform we heard about last weekend. We are seeing a Minister failing to act like a Minister, failing to take the initiative and the power that is at his disposal, in order to change draconian measures in our mental health system and refusing to bring in an appeal or a review system, the urgency of which is well documented.</P>
    <P>I, like many others, very positively welcomed the appointment of Dr. John O'Connell as Minister for Health and in approaching this legislation I had every reason to believe that this commitment to the subject would leave him no option but to break the stranglehold of the traditional departmental response to Private Members' Bills and lead him to accept this Bill and amend it in whatever way necessary in special committee.</P>
    <P>My expectations I have to say were well founded given the views expressed by Dr. John O'Connell during a similar debate in this House in November, 1980, when discussing the Second Stage of the Health (Mental Services) Bill, 1980. I now quote from column 712 of the Official Report of 19 November 1980:</P>
    <P>We have had a very bad attitude towards mental illness through the years. Patients' rights have been flouted. Patients have been committed to hospital by people, under the direction of doctors, and they have never got out again. People have ended their days in such hospitals simply because the person who originally signed them in was not available and but for that fact they would have been discharged.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Dr. John O'Connell, then an Opposition Deputy, <Col N="553" /> said as reported at column 714 of the Official Report of the same date:</P>
    <P>All this Bill will do is give certain rights to the mentally ill. Despite what has been said I do not think the provisions requiring two doctors to certify a patient for admission will cause much inconvenience. Already this is a requirement for private patients and all we are doing is extending it to public patients. This will give more rights to patients. The number of patients admitted by one doctor only is an indictment not only of the State but the medical profession. The attendance of two doctors is a vital safeguard which must not be allowed to be sidetracked.</P>
    <P>The provision of a review body is another safeguard for mental patients.</P>
    <P>...The existence of such a body will ensure that people will not be detained for life in mental hospitals, and the composition of the review body would therefore be considered with great care.</P>
    <P>These are commendable views which I know were very sincerely meant in 1980. The question I am concerned about is, has the powerful mantle of Minister now knocked that sincerity and commitment into the margins in the interest of departmental expediency? If the detention provisions of the 1945 Act were wrong in 1980, which they were, and the Minister and Minister of State and every other speaker in this debate agree that they are wrong now and that there is an urgent need for an appeal system and for a review body, why are they voting the measures down tonight? The case should be resolved now, not next year or the year after or when there has been a Green Paper or a White Paper.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a broader debate about services and conditions for people in mental hospitals, but I do not accept that these should be linked to the issues of civil liberty, which are so much in question. Services and conditions in mental hospitals require funding &mdash; planned budgeting, it is cruel to marry them to rights as the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Minister and <Col N="554" /> Minister of State have said regarding the limited nature of this Bill, I suggest that because of its limited nature and its deliberate focus on the detention provision, it must be easier to accept than broad based legislation which might deal with the wider issues in the mental health area.</P>
    <P>I was impressed with the number of sound proposals and the amount of clear thinking that has come through in this debate. In my opinion if these were channelled into an all-party select committee, and working on the consensus that already exists, a composite Bill would be forthcoming in a very short space of time.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret that there has been no meeting of minds on this issue tonight. The contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, requires a special response. Because there is a degree of uncertainty about the intention of section 3, I will repeat what it aims to achieve. In the opinion of most people there should not be any difference between the approach to public patients or private patients in the medical certification. I am aware that the third stage of the reception includes the signature of the medical officer of the psychiatric hospital, it is at the second stage, I believe, two medical practitioners should sign in all cases. This concurs with the views expressed by Dr. O'Connell in 1980 and brings us to a further point in the Minister of State's speech. On the question of who makes the decision in other countries to detain a person the Minister made the following interesting points:</P>
    <P>The decision to detain a person in a psychiatric hospital (in European countries) is either a function for the courts or each medical decision is subject to review by an independent administrative body. The European Convention obliges that where a court is not involved in the decision to detain, that there should be a review of each order by a Judicial or Review Body.</P>
    <P>This is precisely what is needed and what we should have here. It makes the Government's rejection of this Bill quite untenable. <Col N="555" /> There is further food for thought in the Minister of State's speech when he talks about the composition of the review procedure. These proposals could be discussed and if we can come up with more ideal procedures, they could be inserted on Committee Stage. Similarly, the Minister's view on the thinking behind the arguments in providing information for detained persons is well worth considering and shows a degree of research and examination.</P>
    <P>The most revealing aspects of the speech concern the civil proceedings in which we discover that section 259 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, which puts a time limit of six months on proceedings, was repealed by the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Act, 1954. This was news to me and I know it will be news to a number of doctors, lawyers and legal researchers interested in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is more ambivalent on section 260 of the 1945 Act. This worries me. It requires that a person who has been detained seek the permission of the High Court before taking proceedings. The High Court must be satisfied that the person against whom the proceedings are taken acted in bad faith or without reasonable care. This is a much more difficult test than applies to any other proceedings for medical negligence. The intention is very clearly stated in the speech too &mdash; this provision was there to protect staff involved in the care of psychiatric patients from civil suits in the courts which might arise from the mental instability of the patient. This section, in effect, has given total immunity to all involved over the years and removes the important safeguard of an individual's right to have access to the courts in the event of wrongful detention. In the event that the Minister is not aware of the facts, let me assure him that there are cases of wrongful detention in the legal pipeline and one case is imminent.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in proceedings under the 1945 Act some judges have been concerned about the weakness of our current laws, although they are bound by them. I suggest this is another area in which it <Col N="556" /> will be perceived that as legislators we are reneging on our obligations and leaving it to the law courts to dictate how and where legislative change is necessary. If and when the honourable judges hearing future cases under the 1945 Act decide to point the finger at politicians over this disgracefully neglected area, I hope they will realise that the Government parties alone are solely responsible in this case. After tonight's vote let us hear no more about open government because it can only be seen as a rhetorical figment in the Taoiseach's imagination.</P>
    <P>I genuinely approached this debate in an effort to get all-party support. I am very happy and grateful that I got all-party support on this side of the House. I did not want it in any triumphalist way but because I recognise the grim situation of the people who need the measures I am proposing. I know them personally as I have dealt with them this year, last year and a number of years ago. I am particularly surprised at both the lack of contribution to this debate and the lack of response to my letter seeking support from the Progressive Democrats. I and many others can only presume that they are unconcerned and not interested in the rights of people wrongly committed to mental hospitals. How can the Progressive Democrat Deputies, so expressly concerned and so vocal on other liberal issues, walk through the &ldquo;no&rdquo; lobby on this issue? Their hearts obviously do not bleed for the constituency who look to this Bill for recourse to justice and I say: &ldquo;shame on them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By his decision tonight the Minister for Health will fundamentally undermine public confidence in his ability to take decisive action &mdash; to break with tradition and do the right thing. Nothing he will do, I would suggest to him, equates with producing substantial legislation &mdash; not opening or closing conferences, meeting delegations, producing Green Papers, setting up committees or, indeed, distributing toothbrushes, as one of his predecessors did.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, will be judged by the number <Col N="557" /> and substance of the Bills he produces. Tonight he will have pushed one very important Bill into oblivion and will have compounded the image in this country of mental illness as related to men in white coats, forced medication, no accountability, no access to legal action and a suspension of human rights for those unfortunate enough to become victims of the 1945 Act.</P>
    <P>It is the function and obligation of legislators to provide clear legal guidelines to those working in the psychiatric services and firm safeguards to users of the service against malpractice.</P>
    <P>This debate is ending on the same barren note on which it began: we have an outdated, 50-year-old Act; we have no immediate possibility of amending that Act; we have no appeal procedure for <Col N="558" /> those wrongfully committed; we have great difficulty in obtaining information for those people; we have no official reports &mdash; required by law &mdash; on conditions in mental hospitals. In short our mental health as a health service is on hold. No one, it seems, is in charge. Should someone turn out the light?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of Maastricht and the future of Ireland in the European Union is an absolute core value for myself and for the Fine Gael Party. I see absolutely no alternative to a federal Europe for this country. I see it as absolutely vital to the economic and social interests of this country that we develop a new Europe. In my own area of responsibility, that of transport, it is particularly vital that we embrace Maastricht wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>We have about 90,000 jobs because we are a part of the European Community, in other words, mobile, international industrial development. One of the key disincentives of coming to Ireland is its peripheral location, its distance from the centre of the golden triangle of Europe, and the way that manifests itself most is in transport costs. It is well known that Irish transport costs are twice the European average. In some product sectors, particularly with low value goods, they can be up to four times higher. Unless the Cohesion Funds are made available, unless there is a substantial increase in the Structural Fund there is no way we can catch up with the type of infrastructure that is necessary to develop our airports, sea ports or roads to a satisfactory level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, there are public transport issues which have not been addressed heretofore and which need to be addressed in the context of Maastricht, namely, the question of a light rail system for Dublin, because we have one of the most congested motoring capitals in Europe and the problem is getting much worse. It has been acknowledged by environmental and transport experts that the solution is an electric tramway system of light rail which will cost a minimum of £400 million for the greater Dublin area. The Government should seek to <Col N="562" /> implement a blueprint with the help of the Cohesion Fund, which is exclusively for transport and environmental projects. It is regrettable that not 1p of the £3 billion provided for 1989 to 1993 was or will be spent on intercity rail when all over Europe there is development of high speed rail. The biggest impediment to this country is that when the Eurorail system is in place there will be a three hour schedule for freight from any point on the Continent. This will mean an even greater disadvantage for us. Therefore, I call on the Government to follow up Dr. Tony Ryan's suggestion of the feasibility of an air bridge providing a daily, continuous air freight service, initially from Shannon to Luxembourg, to overcome the peripheral disadvantage, particularly for high value goods. It is absolutely vital for the transport of our goods, bearing in mind that we are more dependent on exports than Japan. When, as I said many times, one considers their production of radios, television sets and cars and their penetration throughout the world, one can see how important exports are to us.</P>
    <P>The criteria needed for Ireland to meet the single European currency were mentioned. People put forward the scare tactic of hairshirt budgets. The fact is that 6 per cent of Gross National Product is now coming as a direct transfer of net resources from the Community to Ireland. If this was removed by our becoming a pavilion member rather than a full member of the European club, it would have an enormously negative effect on our budgetary situation. A single currency is vital to our economy; not only will it stimulate growth and help small businesses, the simple fact is that, if you had £100 and travelled to the 12 member states, without spending any money but merely by converting it you would be left with £26. That clearly illustrates the cost to exports, business and tourism of different currencies. The discipline that goes with a single currency and a single European Central Bank would be a positive force in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>If we endorse Maastricht wholeheartedly we will have a huge opportunity <Col N="563" /> at the time of enlargement. Only today the British Prime Minister said that they consider the future not to be a federal Europe but an enlarged Europe involving the Nordic states of Sweden, Norway, Finland and possibly Switzerland. We must say no to that on the basis that we must have a clear federal budget made up of about 8 per cent of the budgets of individual member states. In the United States 12 per cent of the budgets of each state goes towards the central federal budget. In the European Community only 1.2 per cent of total national resources in each country goes towards the federal budget &mdash; in other words, the Community's budget is a pittance and needs to be increased so that there would be automatic transfers to the poorer countries. It should be a condition of enlargement that we should exercise that veto in relation to a federal budget. If we do not endorse Maastricht we will not be at the card game to play any cards.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the new proposals in the Maastricht Treaty in relation to education. This year over 22,000 pupils will avail of the benefits of the European Social Fund in relation to our education system. This should be extended to the vocational and technical pupil area.</P>
    <P>In relation to Sellafield and other matters, unless there is a transboundary approach to pollution through strong European central authorities we will not be able to tackle the problems on the basis of single nation states. Therefore I visualise in a very positive way a future of a European state, a union of states, in which there will be European citizenship, which will commence under the process of Maastricht and which will flourish. It is incredible that the Government should have agreed to a Protocol which would not give Irish people automatic rights to travel. I want a situation whereby people can move, live and work in any part of the Community and have all the rights of citizenship. There is no alternative to Maastricht. We cannot become the 51st state of the United States. There is no Eastern bloc to join. This is the only option available to us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> Red herrings have been drawn over foreign and security policy. As I clearly understand it where there is joint action between now and 1996 it must involve unanimity &mdash; in other words, any member state can put up its hand when it comes to serious matters and say that it disagrees.</P>
    <P>Our neutrality is redundant because of the end of the East-West Cold War, but we can easily accommodate, and be a positive force in, the new Europe. This is a truncated debate, but the issue of Maastricht goes way beyond party politics. We are a small, young, peripheral state with enormous potential and if we reject Maastricht we will become simply an isolationist, abandoned offshore island. That prospect is so bleak that we must vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on 18 June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wish to express my gratitude to Deputy Yates for giving me time to speak on this issue. In doing so I also want to join in the appeal to the electorate, and in particular to my own constituents, to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the coming referendum because the alternative is too serious even to consider.</P>
      <P>We joined a European Community from which we certainly gained immensely. If you consider the fact that we invest £1 and get back £6, it is obvious that from an economic point of view we cannot turn our back on it. We depend on Europe for our markets and exports; it is very difficult to see where we could export if we were in an outside trading group. I do not think that Europe is fascinated by Ireland or that if we voted to reject Maastricht, which I presume will not happen, the rest of the EC countries would beg us to remain as full members. What can they gain from us, apart from our culture, young people and perhaps our food exports? Indeed, they might be glad to see our food exports disappearing as it would knock a small amount off the mountain of butter, etc. We should not delude ourselves that things would go on as before and that we would not lose anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent a few days in Brussels over <Col N="565" /> Easter. I found it tiring but very educational in the attitude of the different speakers. I discovered that there are countries which have not been completely taken over by Maastricht. At the same time it is very important that they remain in the Community. Germany, which dominated Europe and helped in many ways by providing so much money, now has a problem of its own as a result of a united Germany and the cost to the former West Germany in particular. They may be somewhat worried about increasing the 1.2 per cent. President Mitterand is having his own battles in France. We in Ireland have become side-tracked in relation to a Protocol which perhaps should never have been included. The rest of Europe may be looking with a more serious eye at the whole concept of the Maastricht Treaty. It would be suicidal to do other than vote yes. Industry will come to Ireland only if we are in the European Community. What industry would want to set up here without direct access to EC markets? Portugal has gained immensely from its inclusion in the Community and we should ensure that nothing happens to keep us out.</P>
    <P>If countries such as Austria, Sweden, Finland and even Switzerland are anxious to join with the new Europe, should we not be sensible enough to stay there? These are neutral countries. We are part of Europe. In the long run, is neutrality another word for cowardice? What exactly will we be neutral on if the crunch comes? If we were attacked by a flock of swallows or sparrows we would nearly have to appeal to Europe for help. We have to pull our weight. We cannot &ldquo;take&rdquo; all the time. Conscription has been made a major issue but it cannot arise. It will be 1996 before we vote on any common defence policy. It is unfortunate that so many red herrings are being dragged before us. I would have no qualms about taking a stand on defending Europe, but it is very hard to see who the attacker would be. Following the collapse of Russia and the eastern European states, is there a danger of anyone being attacked? The difficulty may be that we <Col N="566" /> will have to come to their defence and assist them in their economic recovery. Many of these eastern European countries have potential but they are so backward that it will take them too long to recover. Let us hope democracy does not suffer there as a result of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>There have been many discussions outside this Chamber about the Protocol and claims that a vote against the Maastricht Treaty is a vote against abortion. One thing I learned in Brussels is that they do not give a tuppeny curse whether we have abortion in Ireland. They see it as a problem we have to deal with ourselves and they have no particular interest. It is a pity this question is linked up with the Treaty, which is not concerned with anything like abortion.</P>
    <P>In March I asked the Minister if he would advise the people in charge of running the referendum to make an effort to get suitable unemployed people to man the polling stations. In the case of a general election a Taoiseach might misread the opinion polls and rush to the country. In such circumstances it might be easier to call on the old hands. A referendum which is planned for so long gives ample time to organise presiding officers who do not take a day off from a well paid job. This may be a parochial point and non-European but I hope the Minister for the Environment will bear it in mind.</P>
    <P>We have gained immensely from the European Social Fund. Many students would not have received third level education were it not for these moneys. All the roadworks have resulted from funds accruing from Community membership.</P>
    <P>The protection of the environment is of major benefit to Europe and to us. Anyone who says that what happens in Europe is of no significance is living in a dream world. We must remember Chernobyl and its results. It is important to lay down standards for the protection of the environment. It is also necessary to protect the ozone layer. What can Ireland do on its own? We must be a member of a team which has the power, the knowledge and the finance to take effective action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> We will become citizens of Europe and have voting rights. This is important because so many of our young people will be working in foreign countries. They will be able to vote in European and local elections. A common currency will also be important. It should all lead to one big, harmonious country called Europe of which we are part. We should stay there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There has never been a time in the recent history of the European Community when so many fundamental economic, monetary, social and political issues have been decided within such a short period. It is natural to expect that this very important debate will provide Members with an opportunity to range over the EC scene in all its aspects and in particular to range from the Single European Act to Maastricht and beyond to see if we can match our ambitions. The ambitions are enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union and they can and will become a reality when we enter the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The European Union Treaty signed in Maastricht on 7 February last by me on behalf of the people of this country is probably the most significant development since the Community was established in 1957. The Treaty has established a new European Union of 12 member states which will have a common foreign and security policy, unified economic and monetary systems, a single market and Community competence in a greatly increased number of important areas. It is without doubt a major step along the road towards European Union. Perhaps a greater step might have been achieved and if it were &mdash; as we were hoping it would &mdash; we would have welcomed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This European Union Treaty is the result of over two years of detailed preparation and negotiation. There has been a period of enormous change across the continent of Europe with the collapse of Communist regimes in central and eastern Europe opening the way to German unification. The European Union Treaty is a testament to the <Col N="568" /> strength of purpose and stability of the European Community. In such a turbulent time of historic change it was not only able to play a major part in reacting to the immediate political and economic circumstances arising but at the same time was able to put in place an ambitious blueprint for a prosperous and peaceful Europe to which we all aspire.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been a strong advocate of the evolution of the European Community into a European Union. We have certainly benefited from the closer integration which has taken place since we joined the EC in 1973. Certainly membership of the Community has helped to sustain Irish agriculture and has opened up one of the richest markets in the world to our trade.</P>
    <P>As has been said already by contributors to this debate, two-thirds of our industrial exports now go to Community countries. Certainly membership of the European Community has resulted in significant and substantial contributions towards the development of Irish industry and the development of a whole range of infrastructural facilities. It is a fact that being a member state of the Community has enabled Ireland to play an effective role, to have an influential voice in world affairs and to present Irish views internationally much more effectively than would have been possible outside the European Community.</P>
    <P>Against that background we approach the European Monetary Union and European Political Union negotiations with a very positive and very committed attitude. The reward has been a good outcome across a wide range of complex and sensitive issues. In particular, the outcome has been very satisfactory in the main issues of specific concern to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the solid support for the Treaty on European Union that has come from political parties here in the House, from the trade unions, from the farming organisations and from business. I sincerely hope that my confidence in the forthcoming referendum, in which I believe the Treaty will receive the full endorsement of the Irish people, is proved to be well directed. I think that I <Col N="569" /> am entitled to have that confidence for the reasons I have given.</P>
    <P>The Treaty provides a good package as far as Ireland is concerned. One must have regard to the fact that European Union had to be agreed to by the government representatives attending the Inter-governmental Conference. The successful implementation of the Treaty's ambitious aspirations now needs to be pursued vigorously. Such implementation is a crucial element of the Government's efforts to achieve further social and economic progress. The further development of the Community and, in particular, the continued development of Ireland within the Community are at a crucial stage.</P>
    <P>As well as the Maastricht Treaty, other significant developments are crowding in on an already very busy and complex European Community agenda. The internal market is on the brink of creation and is due to be completed by the end of the year, the agreement between the European Community and EFTA, the European Economic Area, has just become a reality and the further enlargement of the Community must also be regarded as imminent. All of those changes present possibilities and opportunities as well as threats. All of us, particularly Irish business and economic interests, must keep ourselves fully informed of developments and must be in a position to influence them and to take advantage of the opportunities.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months much attention &mdash; naturally, I suppose &mdash; has been focused on the Maastricht Treaty and one might be forgiven for not remembering that 1992 and the internal market are upon us. However, work has been continuing to ensure that none of those, whether they be politicians, businessmen or consumers, within the Community or outside it, who view the Single Market as an irreversible process will be disappointed. The programme, designed to eliminate specific obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people within the Community, will be in place by 31 December 1992, and that deadline is now only six months away. <Col N="570" /> Agreement has been reached on more than 80 per cent of the internal market programme of 282 measures. Areas of business in which major progress has been made include technical harmonisation and standards, the opening up of public procurement in transport, merger control, insurance and the liberalisation of capital movements. With little more than six months left before the 1992 deadline, the Community needs to be aware that there is very little time left to finally adopt the remaining White Paper measures and to implement them along with the measures already in place. The Community clearly has a major task ahead of it if the remaining measures are to be agreed to in time but I am confident that the commitment and the political will are there to achieve that.</P>
    <P>The formation of the European Economic Area, the new relationship between member states of the European Community and the EFTA member states, now adds considerably to the market place and to the size of sale. With 380 million people and comprising 19 countries, the EEA will represent the world's largest internal market. This new trading bloc will offer increased opportunities to the business community and a greater choice in goods to the consumer. Ireland's trade links with the EFTA countries have been significant and it is hoped that the creation of the EEA will deepen and strengthen those links. The EEA allows free movement of goods, services, capital and people throughout the Community and EFTA states and will have beneficial effects for our overall trade with those countries involved.</P>
    <P>Ireland's geographical location on the periphery of Europe has given cause for concern in the context of the changes currently taking place both inside and outside the Community. One step towards meeting those fears has been the creation of the Cohesion Fund for the less developed EC countries, which include Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Community is increasingly being seen as the main focus for development by all of Europe and its neighbouring countries, particularly those in the east. <Col N="571" /> The agreement reached at Maastricht has paved the way for the Community to address enlargement, to consider seriously not only the applications for accession that have already been submitted but also the probability that many other countries will wish for much closer association. Undoubtedly, the question of enlargement will now move close to the top of the political agenda in the Community. It will be necessary to agree to the political guidelines for the strategy to be followed in enlargement negotiations. I take the view that the Community should be very open in its attitude to new accessions but that extreme care must be taken to ensure that the issue of enlargement does not cause blocking or dilution of the efforts towards the new European Union envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the Community is playing its part in assisting those countries in central and eastern Europe that are in the process of changing from centrally planned economies to economies based on free market principles. It is vital that the process of change is effected by the introduction of competitive market forces and underpinned by active competition policies that will safeguard the new market structures.</P>
    <P>All of those inter-related developments &mdash; the Single Market, the European Economic Area and the enlargement of the Community &mdash; will significantly affect the immediate post-Maastricht era in the Community. As I have already said, the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty rapidly and substantially is crucial for the Community and is particularly crucial for Ireland. I suggest that any delay will create instability in Community life, with a multiplier effect for the future and negative impact externally.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the Commission package of proposals submitted recently. I believe that discussion on the proposals in the Delors II package will be very important from Ireland's point of view. We were successful at Maastricht in having our concerns dealt with favourably <Col N="572" /> in the Treaty. We must now ensure that these concerns are adequately dealt with in the implementation of the Delors package. I am glad that cohesion and competition are the dominant themes of the Commission's proposals. The strengthening of the Treaty provisions on economic and social cohesion was a major aspect of the negotiations and a key priority for us. The provisions of the new Treaty's charter on cohesion ensure that this dimension has a considerably reinforced role in the evolution of the Community policies. It is particularly important that the review process provided for in the Treaty will ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the adoption of measures designed to achieve the cohesion goal.</P>
    <P>We were very insistent at Maastricht in company with other peripheral member states that there must be an additional commitment to concrete measures in the short and the medium term. These commitments are provided for in the creation of the Cohesion Fund. The fund will provide finance in the important areas of environment and transport infrastructure and will operate in addition to the Structural Funds. Flexibility in the operation of the fund particularly with regard to projects eligible for assistance will be very significant as far as this country is concerned. The Commission in its proposals for action, laid considerable emphasis on the need to continue to concentrate Structural Funds on regions where development is lagging behind, while stressing that procedure and privileges can and must be made to increase the effectiveness of structural policies. These are general sentiments that I wholeheartedly agree with. It is true that a streamlining of the decision-making procedures would add considerably to the effectiveness and impact of the policies.</P>
    <P>Ireland has done exceptionally well from the additional EC resources provided so far for development purposes under the Structural Funds. Arising from that, the Community Support Framework agreed with the Commission provided the basis for some £9 billion of development <Col N="573" /> expenditure over the five-year period to the end of 1993. The Commission's proposals for the period 1993 to 1997 envisaged a doubling of the resources available for the least prosperous regions of the Community including Ireland. This will be made up of a two-thirds increase in Structural Funds assistance together with additional finance from the new Cohesion Fund. We look forward to seeing these new proposals developed in discussion with the Commission. I am sure we will point out that the emphasis in respect of additional finance should be on the Structural Funds, which have a proven track record, and that the Cohesion Fund should be treated as an additional and separate element. We can certainly draw on our experience of the operation of the 1989 to 1993 Structural Funds programme and we can look to maximise the impact of EC funds in overcoming our structural weaknesses.</P>
    <P>The significant moves towards Economic and Monetary Union must be warmly welcomed by us and particularly by the Irish business community. It is to be expected that the completion of European Monetary Union will in due course provide exchange rate certainty within the Community. In the past, widely fluctuating rates of exchange have significantly damaged the growth prospects of Irish business and have contributed to a trading environment which has been hostile and uncertain. This will change under European Monetary Union. The achievement of European Monetary Union will eliminate the currency transaction costs for Irish firms as well as those throughout the Community. The gains will be greater for small, open economies such as ours and substantial savings will arise from the elimination of currency hedging costs for inter-European trade.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in monetary policy, under European Monetary Union for the new European Central Bank, when established, will be to achieve price stability. This will lead to lower inflation rates than might otherwise be the case, and benefit Irish consumers. Rigorous controls <Col N="574" /> in budget deficits will be necessary and European Monetary Union membership will further promote the sound economic policies which we have seen carried through by Government over the past four or five years. Ireland's attractiveness for overseas development and investment will also be enhanced by European Monetary Union as the currency risk on investment is removed.</P>
    <P>The main danger for Ireland arising from European Monetary Union is the likelihood that the whole process of integration now under way will strengthen the tendency towards the concentration of investment in the more central, richer areas of the Community. We need not be passive onlookers in relation to this process. Provided we maintain a disciplined approach to income increases and public expenditure, as we did in recent years, our relative competitiveness will continue to improve and provide a powerful counter-attraction to any centralising forces within the Community.</P>
    <P>There has undoubtedly never been a time in the history of the Community when so many changes have been taking place. Europe is being reshaped. There is a number of key elements that will dominate the European Community's agenda now more than they ever did up to now. They will have a direct and long term impact on every one of us. I mention European Political Union, Economic and Monetary Union, the completion of the internal market, reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Structural Funds, flanking EC policies, the question of enlargement and eastern and central Europe, EC budget reform, our external obligations to the Third World and our obligations to reinforce or support stability in developing political democracies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Treaty is a major step on the road to European Union &mdash; an ideal I hold dear and have always supported. However it is important to state my concerns about this Treaty. The Treaty document runs to 250 pages but the debate outside this House has focused too much on the four lines of the Irish <Col N="575" /> Protocol. I believe in the right to travel and to information.</P>
      <P>Much of the Treaty deals with finance and market competitiveness. Many Members who have spoken so far have dealt with these matters. However, the issues of agricultural structures and the fabric of rural society must be an important concern of this House. If there is any further erosion of the financial underpinning, or of the morale of the rural communities, then the European Union will have a hollow base. The work of the western Bishops has surely made this apparent to all. I have confidence that Ireland will rise to the challenge. This however will happen only if we face the problems honestly.</P>
      <P>There are other issues. I am the Youth Affairs spokesperson in this House for Fine Gael/the European Peoples Party/the European Christian Democratic Movement. Last weekend I had an opportunity of listening to nearly 100 young people gathered together from the four corners of the island. For three days, under the banner of World University Service, they formed a model European parliament. In that forum they discussed eight broadly based resolutions covering the environment, human rights, poverty and the role of women. There were common concerns shared equally by those from this State and from Northern Ireland and from both communities within Northern Ireland which certainly opened up new vistas for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Treaty through its social provisions is committed to human resource development in order to deepen and strengthen solidarity and social and economic cohesion between peoples while respecting their cultures and traditions. Part II on page 11 ties this to the idea of a high level of employment and social protection and a consequent raising of standards of living and quality of life. Surely rural development programmes must be embraced within this comprehensive ideal? Article 198 envisages a Committee of the Regions, with nine seats for Ireland. This body is of great importance to Ireland, particularly when <Col N="576" /> linked to the concept of trans-European networks which will consider critical regional issues such as the impact of transport policy on islands and on landlocked and peripheral regions. What plans do the Taoiseach and his Government have for appropriate representation from regional and local bodies which will ensure either membership of or a significant input into this committee from rural communities, in particular from young people and women? I shall refer to this later. I pose the same question about the composition of the nine member Economic and Social Committee, under Article 194, and the mechanism for having an input into the workings of this committee.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comprehensive mandate now being given to the European Ombudsman under Article 138e. I hope this will give young people, and people of slender means, the opportunity of redressing the effects of maladministration. This leads to the question: how will people gain access to the European Ombudsman? It is important that that be clarified. It appears as though the European Ombudsman has a more comprehensive brief than his Irish counterpart. Has the Taoiseach any proposals to extend the remit of the Irish Ombudsman? For example, has he proposals to co-ordinate the work and procedures of both Ombudsmen? Obviously, there will be an overlap between their respective functions and roles.</P>
    <P>An issue of considerable concern to young Irish people and their parents is the full recognition of their certificates and diplomas and evidence of other education and training qualifications. Articles 123, 125 and 126 touch on these issues. I applaud the aspiration in Article 123, dealing with the European Social Fund, which aspires &ldquo;to render the employment of workers easier and to increase their geographical and occupational mobility within the Community, and to facilitate their adaptation to industrial changes and to changes in production systems, in particular through vocational training and re-training.&rdquo; In <Col N="577" /> the light of statements made both inside and outside this House, the most recent at the annual congress of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland in Tralee a few weeks ago, one must ask how do the Ministers for Education and Labour square this ideal with the proposal to remove European Social Fund maintenance grants from RTC students. There appears to be an obvious contradiction between what is included in the Maastricht Treaty and the policy the Government have pursued in recent times in relation to grants for RTC students. There is a serious conflict between the Treaty objective and stated Government intentions which should be addressed by the Taoiseach and the Government in replying to this debate. For example, this could well constitute one of the first cases for the European Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, emigration is the scourge of rural Ireland. I have visited the young Irish diaspora in Britain on a number of occasions. However, it must be acknowledged that citizenship of the European Union is a step forward. Young people also have concerns about those who come here from Eastern Europe and the Third World, particularly those seeking education and training. We must remember that human resource development is a global issue. A uniform format for visas for those coming to the European Community and the aspiration for reciprocity of arrangements with other blocs should facilitate missionaries and development workers in general but particularly in the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, those to which we hear most reference these days.</P>
    <P>Many people, and particularly the young, care about this. Recently, in their generosity students of Tralee RTC refurbished a land-rover for a farm and leprosarium in the Anglican Diocese of Dodoma in Tanzania, thereby demonstrating their care in this area. Indeed, from my recent discussions with young people I found they were enormously interested in the overall question of Third World aid to an extent greater than is generally understood. I am glad there <Col N="578" /> is an Article in the Maastricht Treaty reaffirming Community commitment to its policy on Third World aid which is enormously important to young people.</P>
    <P>I am pleased also to note the commitment to the development of tourism. Kerry is the premier tourist region of Ireland. Kerry County Council, in particular the county manager, his team and the Tralee Task Force, have concentrated on this industry as a focal point for regional economic development. While I am happy to note it is included in the Treaty, I regret that the tourism industry has not featured more prominently in it. I would link with tourism the more comprehensive and welcome treatment of the protection of the environment in Articles 130r, 130s and 130t.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provisions for the promotion of research and technological development. In this respect I commend the foresight of the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, when as Minister for Education she incorporated much of the thinking in this Treaty in the Regional Colleges Bill issued last year. My only regret is that, two Ministers later, the provisions of the Bill have not yet been enacted. It would be my hope that we would put the geographically dispersed framework for research and development in these colleges into effect as quickly as possible. In this respect I would ask the Ministers for Education and Finance to expeditiously allocate RTCs a permanent industrial liaison officer at head of department level. I think this is vital. It is important that we utilise fully the potential of our RTCs in that they offer enormous potential for the development of regional policy, very much in line with the thinking in the Maastricht Treaty in relation to regional policy. Therefore we should make every effort to facilitate them having a head start on the benefits that will accrue from the Maastricht Treaty. These appointments should be made quickly so that the research and development schemes under the auspices of the European Community can have a more lasting effect.</P>
    <P>This Treaty raises more issues than previous Community Treaties. My party <Col N="579" /> and our partners, the European People's Party, are committed to a just and caring society in Ireland and in the EC. This Treaty provides us with the necessary framework. If we recognise the difficulties, face them honestly and keep our vision bright, Ireland will flourish. Indeed, it could go either way; but I am optimistic it will go the right way so that by the end of the century we will be able to say that Ireland was right to have said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Europe on 18 June 1992.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to refer to youth issues. In the post-1992 era it will be essential that young people be more proficient in continental languages. To this end emergency programmes should be launched with the assistance of the Department of Education, FÁS and so on. If our young people are not proficient in continental languages I predict we shall lose many of the advantages and opportunities awaiting us in other European countries. Certainly we should have a much more positive policy and approach to the teaching of European languages not alone in our post primary schools but in our primary schools. Despite the fact that we have given this aspiration lip service over the past 20 years since first joining Europe, we have made only marginal progress in this area. With the passing of the Maastricht Treaty one of the primary aims of our education system should be to promote the use of continental languages as much as possible in our primary and post primary schools.</P>
    <P>Practical co-operation in social security matters should speed up payment procedures. There has been a breakdown in communications, especially in regard to social welfare matters between England and Ireland. In some cases applicants have to wait months for clearance from the English social security department before they can receive their entitlements. The Maastricht Treaty should lead to better co-operation and speed up the payment procedures not only between Ireland and England but between Ireland and the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>Young people are very concerned about our future defence policy. Many <Col N="580" /> Members do not listen to young people. My eyes were opened in this regard when I sat in on the World University Service meeting in Tralee last weekend. Our defence policy and our neutrality are of major concern to young people. Questions in regard to our future defence policy such as compulsory conscription and mandatory military service need to be cleared up immediately. I accept that these issues will be addressed in 1996 but they need to be cleared up now for the population, especially our young people. I do not see why this cannot be done now.</P>
    <P>Many young people are worried that Third World countries may be neglected under the new European Union. Ireland has had a very bad record in the amount of funding it has allocated to Third World countries over the past five years. If it were not for the funding provided by voluntary agencies to Third World projects our contribution to Third World aid would be very small indeed. We need to have a clear policy on Third World development. I welcome the enforcement and affirmation of the Community's commitment to the Third World in the new Article in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The EC needs to boost training policy with a view to fostering, building and developing the talent which exists among young people. Some of this latent talent which is ready to be expressed is being hampered by education and by training policies. We need a more imaginative approach to FÁS schemes and other training schemes, including the special leaving certificate course for under achievers. There needs to be proper assessment and evaluation of these courses. While FÁS courses have produced good results they could be better and give more value for money. I believe that post-Maastricht there will be more scrutiny by Europe of the way we spend money. While FÁS schemes are most welcome &mdash; the trainees do much work in the community &mdash; we need more evaluation and assessment of the benefits which accrue from them.</P>
    <P>We need a national youth policy. National youth policies across Europe <Col N="581" /> should form the basis for EC policies. We have no youth policy at present. Our only policy in this area is to allocate national lottery funding to various youth organisations. It is up to these organisations to spend the money in the way they see fit without any evaluation or assessment. Some time ago I introduced a Bill which proposed the setting up of a national youth advisory committee. That Bill, which would have been a start in this area, should have been taken on board by the Government. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was involved in commissioning the 1980 O'Sullivan report which outlined the direction we should be going in regard to youth policy. This was followed by the Costello report which stressed the need for a youth policy. However, we have not acted on those reports. It is more vital than ever for us to formulate a coherent national youth policy.</P>
    <P>Young people, and youth organisations, should be consulted, as a right, regarding EC decisions. All member states should allocate at least one seat on regional committees to young people. It is very important for young people to be involved in the making of decisions which affect their future in Europe; they will create the Europe of tomorrow. There should be a European committee of national youth organisations which would ensure that young people are well informed on EC matters. There should also be more liaison between the EC and youth organisations so as to ensure that young people are informed about what is happening in Europe. I am sure Members are aware of the amazing ignorance among people in the Community about Maastricht.</P>
    <P>Last year the National Youth Council of Ireland carried out a survey on young people's attitudes to Europe and their knowledge of what is happening there. The results of this survey were frightening. Young people have very little knowledge of what is happening in Europe. They are concerned about broader issues such as neutrality but they have no great insight into the workings of the European Community. There <Col N="582" /> should be more liaison between youth organisations, educational institutions and Europe and as much information as possible on Europe should be disseminated.</P>
    <P>Between 1989 and 1993 more than 20,000 people will have participated in FÁS programmes. It is estimated that more than 22,000 Irish students attending regional technical colleges and third level vocational education committee colleges benefit directly from EC grants. We are major beneficiaries of European funding. Maastricht will improve our position within Europe. All of us have to regard Maastricht as a major challenge; we have to recognise the opportunities which exist in Europe for us. As previous speakers said, we should not be looking at what we can take from Europe; rather we should be looking at the great opportunities which exist there for us. I look forward to campaigning for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in this referendum and the acceptance of the Treaty by the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is late in the night perhaps what we say will not dominate the headlines in tomorrow's newspapers. It is also late in the day to address how we can best exploit the opportunities which will exist for us in the new European Union. Nevertheless, I wish to point out the realities facing us following the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June &mdash; a new liberalised European Union, a common currency and a liberalised world trading environment which will overtake if not subsume the internal market of the European Community if it does not have the necessary internal dynamic. It is time we made our efforts relevant and effective to Europe and the world in which we will live over the next 20 or 30 years. As Deputy Deenihan said, we need to make our efforts relevant to young people who are looking to us to point the way out of the current difficulties and to develop new opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will begin by recounting an experience I had shortly before the termination of my position as Minister for Agriculture and Food. I attended the Enuga trade <Col N="583" /> fair in Cologne, the great food fair of Germany, perhaps of Europe. A German buyer for the most exclusive supermarket outlets in Berlin appealed to me to ensure that our meat product would be made available on the Berlin market. I would make it very clear that the German market is the most exclusive and profitable market in the meat trade in Europe. An extra 20 per cent could be added to the value of the product in Berlin because of consistent policies of the German Government over the years. This buyer from the most exclusive chain of supermarkets could not get the Irish meat product because the highest market price could not compete with the intervention support systems into which we were putting our beef, a system that required no guarantee in terms of standards or consumer preference and that sometimes brought abuse on the part of producer and processor. This underlines the fact that the market, as Deputy Deenihan had said, is the best guarantee of our exploiting to our advantage future opportunities in terms of quality and efficiency, whereas supports and fund transfers can sometimes bring out the worst in the Irish character.</P>
    <P>I hope that as we address this issue, we will consider it on the basis that we do not negative the importance of fund transfers, which, in terms of the Common Agricultural Policy, is in the order of £1 billion per annum. That is very small by comparison with what we could achieve if we took a vigorous approach to all the market outlets, not just in the indigenous sector, be it beef, dairy or otherwise. We need to co-ordinate and maximise all the opportunities through the various agencies available to us because the existing system will not last in any event. If we never adopted a Treaty on European Union, the GATT would not allow these systems to last. Waste and sometimes fraud &mdash; which is not exclusive to this country &mdash; would not allow these systems to last. What would demand that new opportunities would arise is consumer insistence on quality and consistency. We have that capacity, and I am speaking <Col N="584" /> purely about the agri-food sector. It is time, as I have reminded the sectors over a long period, that we vigorously, confidently and enthusiastically ensure that we take that approach.</P>
    <P>I am happy to acknowledge, after almost five years in that area, that in the dairy sector generally there was a proper, vigorous and confident response based on standards, efficiency and market analysis. In the pigmeat sector, when we introduced a programme of rationalisation, stringent measures were put in place by us to ensure that only the highest standards would be acceptable at every stage &mdash; slaughtering, processing and product development &mdash; and we have now broken through in markets that were closed to us for generations. I wish I could say the same about the beef industry generally. We have been engaging in commodity trading for a long time, and I do not want to anticipate the consequences of anything that may be on the way at the moment. There is only one guarantee, that is the guarantee of quality. If that guarantee is not provided, we will lose as a nation. However, I am confident that with this new thrust we will win.</P>
    <P>What we must do is gear ourselves on all fronts to exploit our advantages, which are real and significant. This debate should focus to a much greater extent on how to achieve that, to underline the inadequacies of current structures &mdash; I propose to indicate some of them &mdash; and to mobilise our agencies and resources to create new opportunities in this new European Union, this liberalised union of free trade and free movement of people and of currency, where money will become simply a message to be transmitted and location distant from the centre will not be of such major consequences as it would have been hitherto.</P>
    <P>From now on we should follow the Dutch example &mdash; I will pick two extremes from my own experience in Europe over a considerable time. In 1962 I first joined the European movement and I have been a Council member ever since. Having served in five different Ministries, <Col N="585" /> Energy, Education and social policy, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, and taking into account my period in office as Commissioner, I have some knowledge and awareness of the European scene, which is why I felt obliged to put matters on the record this evening as a basis for further discussion. I would commend the Dutch example at every level by contrast with the British example. The Dutch know how to succeed in Europe whereas the British impose barriers between themselves and success. The signals given to the British enterprise sector by their political leaders, most notably the former Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, by always taking a negative, hostile, demanding, aggressive attitude to Europe have done untold damage to the British enterprise sector. A country that had a capacity in technology, international trading and financial services, which could have dominated the European market, failed to grasp that opportunity because the message being given was a negative if not a hostile one.</P>
    <P>The Dutch, on the other hand, saw the opportunity. They did not talk about transfers of money or say that the amount they put in must be balanced by the amount they receive. They realised that in a trading environment if they relied on quality and guarantee of delivery on time and on customer satisfaction, they would win, and they certainly have won. If we consider the benefit that Holland has enjoyed from the European Community by comparison with ourselves, they have not got the transfer of funds under Structural Funds or Common Agricultural Policy supports but they have got much more economically from the European Community than we have. I cannot ignore the fact that they were closer to the centre, but we cannot constantly rely on the fact that because we are not close to the centre, and we obviously have extra transport costs, that justifies our failure to explore and exploit new opportunities, particularly in the area of services, on which I will dwell briefly.</P>
    <P>In this area we will at least have one certainty. I have suggested recently that <Col N="586" /> we should not present any special figure, be it £6 billion or whatever, by way of Structural Funds between now and 1996. It is demanding too much of any Minister for Foreign Affairs to request that he &ldquo;come back with £6 billion or else&rdquo;. The world of negotiation is not quite as easy as that. While I know that the Minister and the Government will make every effort in this regard, we should consider the question of a common currency. How well equipped are we to not only compete and expand opportunity under the new common currency? Fund management and trust funds have become a feature of the financial world. Money is so mobile that those who know how to advise, invest or move money at a given moment will become key figures in this new European Union. Which State agency is equipped at present to deal with this very sophisticated and complex element in attracting funds, as distinct from commodities or investment for product to this country? I do not yield to many in my respect for the IDA, but the staff of the IDA or CTT are neither trained, qualified nor equipped to maximise the opportunity that is now available and will be available in much greater measure when the common currency union that will follow this Treaty is in place. It is past time that we geared ourselves to this. This brings me to my main point.</P>
    <P>Existing structures may have served past and, some might say, current needs but can we now afford to have the IDA, CTT, Bord Fáilte, SFADCo and the Department of Foreign Affairs operating independently without having a priority direction? This is not a criticism of the present administration, far from it. The opportunity is there for this administration to take up new opportunities. Our diplomatic effort should have one priority, as have the German, French, American, Dutch and Danish diplomatic services, that is the external advancement of the national interest. It is not an academic thing or a matter of theory which gives their foreign policy real relevance, it is a matter of very vigorous national interest. We now have the <Col N="587" /> opportunity of gearing our diplomatic service to be the lead element of all State agencies that have operated in different areas in different times in each of the European countries.</P>
    <P>In each European capital we need to create one presence, &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo;, with a common purpose of availing and exploiting the opportunities that are available in the new era, and not yesterday. In that context, it was never more appropriate that we should review the role of and recruitment to our diplomatic service. I suggest this as a practical priority at this time. I yield to no one in my respect for what our career diplomats have achieved for our country, equally I would be blindfolding myself if I said the standard was uniformly good. However, there is no uniformity, the standard may be very good but sometimes it does not measure up to the same high level of achievement. The diplomats themselves recognise that they should be geared to specialising in the new opportunities that will arise in the internal union and that will follow from the liberalised trade environment that will be an inevitable consequence of the GATT. What is happening in Europe is absolutely in harmony with what is happening in the greater world outside. As an open trading economy we need to be ready to avail of these opportunities. If that means recruiting new people, with special competences in this new environment, to any of our services, be they Foreign Affairs, the IDA or CTT, let us do so. That would enhance the capacity and quality of our services at a time when they will have a very vital role to play in our future.</P>
    <P>In that context, perhaps it is time the Department of Foreign Affairs should come under the umbrella of the Committee on Top Level Appointments in the Civil Service just as every other Department does. I do not quite understand why a particular Department should not be subject to this committee. I see that distinguished lady, whom I had the privilege of appointing as chairperson of the Commission on Taxation some ten or 12 years ago &mdash; and it is significant that <Col N="588" /> many of the recommendations that she and the commission made then are now being followed through &mdash; has been appointed chairperson of the TLAC. We should examine whether there are reasons why a particular Department should be excluded from the terms of excellence required for top level appointments. I am not suggesting the Department of Foreign Affairs staff are not excellent. Indeed, we are privileged to have some of the most excellent and committed ambassadors but they should have the back-up of relevant practical experience.</P>
    <P>Now we will be talking more in terms of the movement of people, funds and services rather than of the movement of products. For that reason I wish to refer in passing to the Culliton report. The terms of reference of the Culliton report &mdash; and I do not criticise Culliton for this &mdash; were somewhat confined and narrow. It was almost as if the issues could be solved by addressing the problem solely and exclusively in Ireland. I do not think that can be the case in an economy such as ours which is so dependent on the international trading environment and on our capacity to explore it. I would not have excluded them from making any recommendations in regard to our external export promotion efforts, our marketing efforts, our external diplomatic efforts, or the external promotion of our tourism, which should also be linked to an integrated approach to the common effort we must make in the European Union. When a German, Dutch, Italian or Spaniard looks at Ireland he sees a composite picture and we must now set about marketing that picture at every possible opportunity and not distinguishing one product from another.</P>

      <P>One of the advantages of the financial services sector is that nowadays you do not have to be physically at the centre, as you did before, to play an active and vigorous <Col N="589" /> role in the market. One can now be anywhere, provided one has the technological capacity and knowledge. One can transfer money from any part of the world by way of electronic signal. We need to address this immediately as a direct consequence of the Treaty on European Union. We must be better than and not just equal to others. We can develop the banking sector if we have the technology. We can make this country a centre like Luxembourg, Brussels or wherever. There is no law that says that what has been done in those countries cannot be done here. I agree with Deputy Deenihan that certain things have to be done to advance that cause, and nobody appreciates that more than I do.</P>
      <P>On the question of acquiring linguistic facilities let me say that the fact that we are already bilingual &mdash; mar a bhí mé féin roimh dul don Mhór-roinn &mdash; is a great advantage &mdash; in terms of modern languages, as I know from my own experience. I hope we put this to good effect.</P>
      <P>There is a very tough and difficult task ahead but it is very challenging. If we want to get the proper response from the Irish people we should tell them, and this has been said in this House already tonight, this is the opportunity and the challenge and not that this is going to be passed on to us. I am glad to say that I have got through my speech without mentioning that other word at this point. When we come to address that issue, I hope it will not have clouded this issue of European Union. I had hoped it would never have clouded that issue. When we come to address it I will have views to express, views based on the experience of other countries and a conviction from what has happened in those other countries. But tonight I say míle buíochas and I am very confident that if we approach this matter in a positive and vigorous way we will have a positive result.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party maintain at this point in time that the Irish people have no choice but to ratify the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June. This view is based on the reality that Ireland has been part of the European process for the last 20 years and that it is too late to back out or to rethink our membership. However, we must look back over the history of our 20 year membership of the European Community, which has not been an entirely happy one. The Labour Party maintained at that time that we would have been better off in 1972 staying outside the Community. That point was argued long and hard at the time and the Irish people made their decision. However, 20 years on we find that 21 per cent of our population is unemployed and that we are in the dubious first rank of nations of the European Community so far as unemployment is concerned. It has not done much for us in that regard. I am aware of a recession worldwide at present; but that recession affects all countries, not just Ireland. As far as some 300,000 would be workers in this country are concerned, the great promises held out about European funds in 1972 and what they would do for us have fallen flat and they feel betrayed. There is a feeling of <i>déjá vu</i> with the promises now being made and the talks about the Cohesion Fund and the Maastricht Treaty. Cohesion, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, was promised to us at that time also. Twenty years have already gone by in which cohesion could have been achieved if it was going to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to remember too that the Europe of today presents a very different picture from that of 1972, in particular the position of Germany presents a very different position today from that which obtained in 1972. We have to recognise the fact &mdash; and we would be very foolish if we did not &mdash; that a united Germany is a very different proposition from the old West Germany. It has a tremendous task to integrate itself. The tendency there, which is already evident, will be for the Germans &mdash; to a large extent the paymasters of Europe &mdash; to look inwards and to concentrate their resources on the <Col N="591" /> united Germany rather than dispensing largesse to the same degree as they did in the past to the less well off regions of Europe. We had better wake up to that fact and recognise that things will be different in this new scenario of a united Germany.</P>
    <P>We would also be well advised to look at political developments not just in Germany but in most of the countries of western Europe, virtually all the countries that are members of the EC. I refer here to the frightening increase in the support for Fascist and extreme right wing parties that is becoming evident in Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and so on. Some of the votes that have been achieved by Fascist parties in parts of Belgium, for example, are frightening and we should be cautious not to lock ourselves in even more tightly through the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>In campaigning for a yes vote, as the Labour Party will be doing, we will not be campaigning for an uncritical endorsement of the Treaty. We believe that after Maastricht this country will face huge challenges, and for the Government to state otherwise is false. We hope the Government will take seriously the many sincere reservations expressed by Irish citizens with regard to the ratification of this Treaty. We also hope the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition Government will learn from past errors and will now introduce a proper system for consultation and debate with Members of the Oireachtas on decisions being taken and which they propose to take from time to time in relation to Europe.</P>
    <P>Before the Intergovernmental Conference last December the Labour Party asked the Government to consult with the Oireachtas on the critical negotiations which were then taking place, but unfortunately that demand fell on deaf ears. If the Government had not been so arrogant in their approach to Europe they might now find themselves in a more coherent and plausible position. Unfortunately, the begging bowl mentality of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive <Col N="592" /> Democrat Coalition Government in relation to Europe must stop now and they must be aware of the vital issues at stake.</P>
    <P>The big danger arising from the proposals at Maastricht and the adoption of this Treaty lies partly in the economic field, but there is also a very serious psychological element. There is a feeling abroad that if we adopt the Maastricht Treaty the Cohesion Funds, with all the figures bandied about, will take care of everything, that some process will evolve where the EC will take care of us and that everything will come out right. There is a feeling that the appalling problems of unemployment and emigration and our failure to achieve the objects of cohesion will be resolved in some mystical fashion by the adoption of this Treaty. But it will not come right in the end if we simply sit back and continue the way we have been going in the past; clearly it will become much more difficult. If we sit back in our seats here in Dáil Éireann and say we will create the atmosphere for employment creation, that we will improve the infrastructure, manipulate the taxation system, provide better communications and roads and expect jobs to evolve &mdash; jobs which our people so desperately need &mdash; that will not happen. All those things have been done in the past; they have all been tinkered with. Our roads may not be up to the autostrada in the centre of Europe, but they are not all that bad. The reason jobs are not forthcoming is not due to inadequate roads, to an inadequate taxation system or to an inadequate communications system &mdash; all of these are not bad but they warrant appreciable improvement. I doubt that any would-be entrepreneur, either indigenous or foreign, contemplating setting up an industry and providing employment in this country would be put off because the roads or the telecommunications system are not up to standard. There is much more to it than that. We are treading on very dangerous ground if we allow ourselves to be lulled into a psychological feeling that by adopting the Maastricht Treaty these things will follow.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words regarding the issue of travel and information. It is regrettable that on this issue the Government have treated Irish women with appalling arrogance and contempt. The Government have not taken seriously the justifiable concerns of Irish women but have used the issue of travel and information, which are basic democratic rights, in a carrot and stick manner to the women of Ireland. The Taoiseach has been given ample opportunity to clarify the issue of women's rights that is inextricably bound up with the Maastricht Protocol. Unfortunately, instead of clarifying the issues in a way that women are entitled to expect, he has promised on a number of occasions and, further, threatened that the promised referendum on the right to travel and information for women may or may not cover other issues. When will the Taoiseach realise, once and for all, that women in Ireland are entitled to the same rights as women in any other European state? The Government, in failing to address the issue of travel and information as they apply to the rights of women in Ireland prior to the Maastricht Treaty will be doing a grave disservice to Irish women and men.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Taylor for giving me some of his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Green Party/ Comhaontas Glass I wish to state that I am opposed to this Bill. The Government are trying to convince the people that there is nothing controversial in this Treaty and that the benefits are so obvious that we would be mad to oppose it. Let me deal first with the alleged economic advantages in the Maastricht Treaty. I would remind the House that when Ireland joined the EC unemployment stood at 65,000. It has now reached 280,000. Surely this cannot be <Col N="594" /> purely a coincidence, as the Government maintain.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the mythical £6 billion of EC funds which, as the Taoiseach said, is on offer. How real is that? It is significant that the referendum is being held prior to the Lisbon meeting in July when important decisions will be made in regard to the disbursement of these funds. The Taoiseach gives the impression that these funds are some kind of bonus to Ireland. In fact they represent compensation for the loss of our independent decision-making and the loss of jobs which seems inevitable. It amounts to one massive handout to keep Ireland quiet.</P>
    <P>The dependence of our economy on multinationals is notorious and represents a very unstable base. This week, for example, we have the threat of the loss of 400 jobs in Apple computers in Cork. It is said that the Labour Party who are supposed to represent what is left of our workers and, generally, the poor and disadvantaged, have surrendered to the Right. Their only policy is one of pleading with multinational companies to supply work to their supporters. I note some of the major trade unions have come out in favour of Maastricht. They certainly show touching faith in the ability of multinationals to protect the jobs of their members. Will they ever learn?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael support for Maastricht was, of course, expected. They have always had a low opinion of our ability to manage our own affairs. A united states of Europe, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, is clearly their objective, and this is what we are heading for if this referendum is passed. Another aspect of economics is the huge cuts which will be necessary in public expenditure to bring the national debt GNP ratio to the 60 per cent required by our EC partners.</P>
    <P>Let me now deal with defence and security issues. The Treaty spells out the end of what is left of Irish neutrality and is expressly linked with NATO. By Article J of the Treaty common foreign and security policy is established. The Taoiseach is incorrect in suggesting that <Col N="595" /> the Irish people will have the constitutional entitlement to have a further referendum in 1997 on security and defence matters. By this Treaty the EPU is given competence in these areas. Any further developments will be considered to be within the competence of the stated objectives of the original common security policy.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil yesterday the Taoiseach attempted to drive a wedge between the Irish Green Party and the other European Greens by his claim that they were in support of the Maastricht Treaty. It is ridiculous for him to claim that the Green group in the European Parliament called on the Parliament and national parliaments to ratify the Maastricht Treaty when the opposite is the case and they voted against it last month.</P>
    <P>Another matter the Taoiseach spoke about was how positive the EC had been on women's rights. I agree with those who highlight one of the major problems of the EC, that it is male centred and has been geared towards the interests of the most powerful who are mostly men. I hope Irish women will not be taken in by the Taoiseach's plámás. Danish women are certainly not happy with the Treaty and with the EC in general because they see their achievements being undermined and Danish standards in women's issues being lowered as a result of EC membership. It is all very well having equal pay it is of little benefit if there are no jobs. If the Treaty is ratified we will have increased unemployment, poverty and emigration and, as usual, it will be the women who will bear the brunt.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is the effect of the European Patent Convention. The European Patent Office has already granted a patent on a live animal, the `cancer' mouse. The patent is for any non-human animal. Although it is claimed that animal life maybe turned into commercial property, human life remains sacred. However, many people may not be aware that patents on human genes have already been granted by the EPO to research institutes in Australia <Col N="596" /> and Japan. Huxley's &ldquo;Brave New World&rdquo; is not far away.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech yesterday was a prime example of the distorted and manipulative propaganda that the citizens of this country have been exposed to over the past five weeks. It was inaccurate and shamefully evasive and misrepresentative. As such it is a sell out of Irish neutrality and independence for the benefit of the rich and powerful at the expense of the poor, the unemployed and the planet. The Taoiseach has failed to admit that this Bill will ensure that this is our last referendum on European matters. He is far from the truth when he claims the amendment is simple, straightforward and limited. It is not, and it is dishonest of him to say so.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach lists those supporting the Treaty without listing their vested interests in so doing and, at the same time, fails to mention the opponents like the United Farmers Association which represents small farmers. Many environmental groups have grave reservations about the Treaty, including Greenpeace Ireland and Earthwatch who are most concerned with environmental and neutrality issues. Greenpeace Denmark have already come out against it. It is apparent that the people who constitute what Desmond Fennell called &ldquo;the State class&rdquo; who might also be called the Euro bullies, to use John Water's phrase, are in the process of selling our heritage a mere 70 years after we achieved our independence.</P>
    <P>The public are being completely hoodwinked. They already know that the bulk of the politicians cannot be trusted but in addition their union representatives, business leaders and the media have all been bought out. On previous occasions we have sounded warnings about this kind of development, particularly in 1987 and the Single European Act, but this pales into insignificance compared with this monstrous proposal. The amendment is constructed so as to give a blank cheque to the EC. My fellow Deputies have been circulated with an excellent analysis of the proposed amendment by <Col N="597" /> a champion of this nation, Mr. Tony Coughlan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Minister for Energy I am pleased that the Maastricht Treaty sees the establishment of a single energy market as an important objective of European Union and that the Community will contribute to the development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport, communications and energy infrastructure. Special importance is also attached to the need to link island and landlocked peripheral regions with the central areas of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of this overall Single Market energy strategy, I favour the creation of <Col N="598" /> greater competition within the electricity industry. The building of the gas interconnector, which is scheduled for completion next year, will also play a vital role in creating the internal energy market and will help to guarantee supplies to our island community. The gas interconnector and the EC legislation will provide access to European gas grids for gas imports to Ireland and will enable Irish gas to be exported to the Community via Britain in the event of further gas finds here.</P>

      <P>The deep sea section of Dublin Port has been closed for some time and all indications are that it will remain closed indefinitely if urgent action is not taken by the Minister &mdash; or by someone on his behalf &mdash; very quickly. The position is that 220 workers from the port have been made redundant and the livelihood of many others has been jeopardised. The longer this situation is let drag on the more difficult it will be to get the port reopened and up and running.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin needs its deep sea port; it is in the traditions of Dublin that the port should operate and provide a service for the business community of Dublin and its hinterland who need it very badly. The trade unions and the dock workers also need it. There is also a serious danger that if the position is allowed to drag on indefinitely EC grant aid for the port could be put in jeopardy. There is a danger that if the matter is not regarded as top priority by the Minister, other arrangements for imports and exports will be made by business people in the Dublin area and the important need for Dublin Port will be dissipated which <Col N="599" /> means that, if at a future date a decision was made to reopen the port, it might be too late. Time is of the essence.</P>
    <P>I understand that there may be some suggestion of selling the interest of the Dublin Port and Docks Board or Dublin Cargo Handling, whichever is interested in the course of the liquidation, to some other stevedoring company. I emphasise that that is not a solution to the problem because, one way or the other, arrangements will have to be made with the unions and the workers to hammer out an acceptable working agreement. That must be possible in this day and age if reason prevails on both sides.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to recognise in this House the urgency of the matter and that time is passing. It is up to him to send in a senior official from his Department &mdash; or a person who would be acceptable as a mediator to both sides &mdash; to discuss the issues involved with a view to securing the reopening of the deep sea section of Dublin Port. A very substantial amount of public money &mdash; about £10 million &mdash; has been invested in the port since 1982 and the Labour Party do not want to see that money dissipated in private hands who will decimate the rights of workers and trade unionists to earn their living as they have done from time immemorial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 220 families anxiously awaiting the outcome of this dispute. They are hoping that the Minister will intervene at this late stage. The men who lost their jobs have a long tradition of service to Dublin Port, despite the smears against them. For generations their families depended on the port as their only means of livelihood. It is essential, for future peace in the port, that a negotiated settlement is reached between these men and the port board before the new stevedores take over in a few weeks' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very serious conflict could arise if any attempt is made by divisive tactics to try to turn worker against worker, which would result in taking on a greatly reduced workforce. That attempt is doomed to failure; the men and their <Col N="600" /> unions will not allow it to succeed. I sincerely hope that the continued delay in the payment of the men's statutory redundancies is not another deliberate tactic to make them weak and vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to stand back from this dispute. He should act now and bring the two sides together to reach an agreed solution. Unless that is done now, there is little likelihood of any lasting peace in the port.</P>

      <P>The Deputies must appreciate that the matter is in the hands of the liquidator appointed by the High Court at present. Deputy Gregory said that he hoped I would intervene even at this late stage. I intervened and got the parties back to the Labour Relations Commission but, unfortunately, to no avail. My intervention was not of any benefit at that stage. I am, naturally, still concerned about the situation. I should like the Deputies to be clear in that regard. The current closure of the deep sea sector of Dublin Port is regrettable. I am anxious that that sector of the port be back in operation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, the closure of the deep sea sector was inevitable following the appointment by the High Court of a liquidator on 6 April last to wind up the operations of Dublin Cargo Handling Ltd. &mdash; DCH &mdash; a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dublin Port and Docks Board. I will set out briefly the background and the events which led up to the closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board's functions as laid down by the Harbours Act, 1946, are the care, management and superintendence of the port of Dublin including stevedoring arrangements for the deep sea sector of the port. Commercial seaports must provide a fast, efficient, competitive and reliable service. A viable and cost-efficient port service at Dublin Port is absolutely essential for its future and for the future economic development of its industrial hinterland in Dublin. It is also crucial for the competitiveness <Col N="601" /> of the industrial, agricultural and service industries which use Dublin Port for freight, both inwards and outwards.</P>
    <P>In the deep sea sector of the port, DCH incurred losses totalling almost £18 million in the period 1982 to 1991. I am advised by Dublin Port and Docks Board that the elimination of restrictive and outdated working practices and the introduction of normal industrial working conditions are essential to the provision of a quality cost-effective service for port users and for the future viability of the deep sea sector of the port.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port and Docks Board considered all the options available to them in reaching their decision to proceed with the liquidation of DCH. It is a matter of regret to me that lengthy talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission prior to 6 April last failed to yield an agreement on a labour rationalisation programme and new working practices and that the dock labour force did not avail of the opportunity to ballot on the deal which was on offer.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port is a major source of employment. It employs over 500 people directly and over 5,000 people who are employed in the port area in port-related business. A substantial number of people are employed outside the port in business directly related to the port and its activities, such as freight arrangements, haulage and service industries, container manufacturing, storage and leasing. Exports through the port generate a large number of jobs.</P>
    <P>I am advised by Dublin Port and Docks Board that negotiations are at an advanced stage with a number of interested parties to license a number of private stevedoring companies for the operation of cargo and freight handling in the deep sea sector of the port. It is the intention of the Dublin Port and Docks Board that this sector, which accounts for over one quarter of the freight throughput at the port, will become fully operational as quickly as possible. The <Col N="602" /> board anticipate that the service will recommence towards the end of this month following the approval by the board of appropriate licence arrangements.</P>
    <P>I understand the concern of Deputies. I, too, am concerned and will do anything within my power.</P>

I want to acknowledge the marvellous work being done in St. Felim's, the health board hospital, by the nursing staff. But for their care and attention the position would be much worse. That nursing home is full at all times and there is a waiting list of 80 patients at any time. Health board officials will say this is not true, but I challenge them that I have made my own inquiries in the hospital and have received many representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three private nursing homes in the county at Virginia, Bailieboro and Belturbet. They have an average of about 20 patients and they do marvellous work. These nursing homes too are full. If there is no need for them, as the health board say, why are all the beds taken? The cost of staying in one of these nursing homes <Col N="603" /> ranges from £165 to £185 per week. That is a reasonable charge when compared with the average around the country. These are commercial enterprises. People are turning to these nursing homes in desperation.</P>
    <P>I want means testing of cases made to the health board for assistance. I do not want an open ended scheme. There are elderly people who would like the facility of a private nursing home, but some people must seek State care when everything else has failed. I reject the notion that the younger generation do not care for the elderly. It is not true. There never has been a better commitment to the elderly. There are cases, however, where a point is reached when there is nothing to do but turn to an institution. Failing the health board institution, they turn to the private nursing home.</P>
    <P>An elderly patient in receipt of old age pension of about £55 per week may have no other income. The pension income is made available to the nursing home but there is a shortfall of perhaps £115 a week. In-laws are rallying around who are often in poor circumstances themselves. The person who is expected to make up the balance may also be an old aged pensioner. Fear and worry set in and a bad case is made critical.</P>
    <P>There are no nursing homes in Cavan to which subventions are payable. I would ask the Minister to pay a subvention on an individual basis where a case is made for help. I am not asking that the whole balance be made up. The relatives are asking for some help, a subvention of perhaps £40 or £50 a week which could be added to the pension income of the patient, thus reducing the shortfall. The relatives would be prepared to meet the remaining outlay. We are talking about people who have given much to this country and who should have dignity and comfort in their old age.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the case of an elderly old aged pensioner who has no other <Col N="604" /> income and no immediate family. That person is being kept in a nursing home in Cavan for the cost of the old age pension alone. That is not economical and the nursing home are not expected to do it. St. Felim's Hospital cannot take that patient. There is nowhere else for him to go and the nursing home will not turn him out on the road. Surely the Department of Health should make a subvention available. The nursing home is prepared to meet a portion of the cost if the Minister will make a contribution of £45 or £50. If a place were available in the hospital the cost would range between £200 and £300 per week.</P>
    <P>I have been making this case consistently in letters to the health board and by way of resolution at meetings of Cavan County Council. I do not seem to be making any progress. I am grateful for the opportunity of raising the matter tonight and I assure the Minister that the facts are as I have stated. I hope the Minister will indicate an improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much impressed by Deputy Boylan's impassioned plea and I recognise his sincerity in this matter.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board make arrangements for residential care for patients for whom such care is necessary either by placing them in health board geriatric homes or hospitals or in subvented nursing homes. The North-Eastern Health Board paid a total of £275,000 in subvention to nursing homes for patients in the North-Eastern Health Board region in 1991.</P>
      <P>Some private nursing homes throughout the country are approved to receive subvention payments under section 54 of the 1970 Health Act. However, no new nursing homes have been approved for subvention since 1980 and less than 30 per cent of private nursing homes throughout the country are in receipt of subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it is assessed by the North-Eastern Health Board that nursing home care is necessary for certain dependent persons, <Col N="605" /> these are placed in subvented nursing homes in the North-Eastern Health Board region or in subvented beds in nursing homes outside the North-Eastern Health Board region. The drafting of regulations to provide for a new method of subventing patients in nursing homes under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Discussions are already taking place with the chief executive officers of the health boards and when these are complete we will begin discussions on draft regulations with nursing home interests and groups representing the elderly. When the subvention and other regulations which are required to bring the Nursing Homes Act into effect have been finalised, the Act can be commenced. It is my intention to bring the Act into effect as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Nursing homes are only one option for providing residential care for the elderly and the nursing home situation in Cavan has to be placed in the context of the overall provision of beds and services for the elderly by the North-Eastern Health Board. In Cavan alone the health board provides 254 long stay geriatric beds in St. Felim's geriatric home and 40 places in the health board welfare home. In addition there are six respite beds for the elderly which were used by 75 patients in 1991 and there are 170 acute beds in Cavan General Hospital, many of which are used by patients over 65 years of age. There is a very high ratio of elderly patients in that area.</P>
    <P>In practice the North-Eastern Health Board treat the counties of Cavan and Monaghan as a common catchment area for health services. In addition to the health board beds provided in Cavan, there are an additional 393 health board beds available for the elderly in Monaghan, consisting of the geriatric home in Castleblayney containing 204 beds, which is a lot; 40 welfare beds and 149 beds in Monaghan General Hospital, which are mostly occupied by the elderly.</P>
    <P>The situation of private nursing homes <Col N="606" /> in Cavan should be placed in the context of the overall provision of care for the elderly by the North-Eastern Health Board, particularly in the Cavan/ Monaghan area. As my Department have said, it is not true in this context to say that there is a crisis.</P>
    <P>I shall reconsider the points made by the Deputy, but as regards the overall care of the elderly in Cavan, the North-Eastern Health Board established a steering group to consider the needs of the elderly arising from the recommendations contained in the report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i> That group has now reported. Plans have been made for the provision under the following categories of sufficient places in line with norms set out in the document: assessment beds, rehabilitation beds, day hospital beds, extended nursing care beds, welfare home beds and beds for the severely mentally infirm. It is intended that the assessment beds will be provided by the utilisation of existing unopened beds at Cavan General Hospital, with the rehabilitation unit located as near as possible.</P>
    <P>The major recommendation of the steering group is the relocation of the present heavy dependency/extended care beds from the old St. Felim's Hospital to the now disused St. Joseph's Hospital, Lisdarn, which will be redesigned and refurbished. That will be done. These plans are a priority of the North-Eastern Health Board and will be implemented as soon as finances permit.</P>
    <P>With the additional budget funding provided for the elderly in 1990 and 1991 the North-Eastern Health Board were able to do the following in the Cavan area: provide improved home care services by the employment of extra nurses, home helps and so on and the provision of a range of home care equipment; develop and equip a unit for respite care at the Dr. Jack Sullivan Welfare Home in Cavan; develop facilities at St. Felim's Hospital to cater for demential patients.</P>
    <P>I recognise the points made by Deputy <Col N="607" /> Boylan and I shall ask my Department to again examine the position. If the Deputy could give me more information I should be delighted to discuss it with him and determine ways in which we could make further progress. I thank the Deputy for bringing the matter to my attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment debate an issue which, I am advised, is now of extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>A huge crisis confronts agricultural show societies in Ireland. Everybody in the House would realise that since the previous century cattle shows have been a feature of the Irish rural landscape and in many areas they are indeed the principal farmer related event of the year. There is now a real doubt as to whether these shows will be able to take place at all unless the Minister is prepared to agree to a special bovine TB testing arrangement for cattle being exhibited at shows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the problem concerns the dispute with the veterinary profession about bovine TB testing. As a consequence of the dispute there was no formal round of testing last year. I am advised that while some testing did take place it involved a small percentage of the herds in the country. In normal circumstances an animal being exhibited at a show would have been tested as part of the herd test in the previous year and an individual test would be sufficient to clear the animal to be brought to the show in question. Because there was virtually no herd testing last year, an individual private test will not under the present system suffice and an exhibitor would have to test his entire herd before one of those animals would be released for exhibition purposes. Most exhibitors, whose herds in some instances run into some hundreds of animals, will not do this and as a consequence animals are not <Col N="608" /> being entered for the shows. Exhibitors are not prepared to test perhaps a couple of hundred animals to release just one animal for entry in a local show.</P>
    <P>The problem is only now coming to light because the cycle of shows is only just beginning. For example, the show in my own town, the Bandon show, is held on Ascension Thursday at the end of the month and entries for the show close early next week. Normally about 200 cattle would be entered for that show but entries to date number about half a dozen. I understand that the Midleton show, which is also being held in May, has a similar problem. Undoubtedly, the same difficulty will surface for all of the other shows throughout the country as the year goes on. I am told that the normal time of the year during which agricultural shows are being run is from the end of May until October, when the last show in the country is held in Ballinasloe. There are more than 100 show societies in the country. At most of them cattle are exhibited and all of these are now at risk because of the problems arising from the bovine TB testing dispute, which has not yet been resolved.</P>
    <P>As I understand it &mdash; and I have spoken about the issue to several veterinarians today &mdash; the solution to the problem would be for the Minister to authorise the private testing of animals to be exhibited at shows on the basis that a clear test would allow the issue of a special permit for exhibition only. Of course, that permit would not apply for normal sale or transfer to other herds; it would apply to exhibition only. I am told that unless the Minister for Agriculture and Food is prepared to recognise the extent of the crisis and accede to my plea on behalf of the show societies by way of the proposal outlined, or something similar, the outlook for all show societies for the current year will be very bleak indeed. It is no use for the Minister to tell me that the end of the dispute with veterinarians is in sight; I have been told by veterinarians today that there is still some <Col N="609" /> way to go. In any event that would not solve the problem as associated difficulties would present themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister, who is a countryman like myself, will recognise the extent of the problem, will recognise the huge contribution that agricultural shows have made to agriculture over the years in relation to the raising of standards and so on, and will ensure that the problem is met head on and that shows may continue this year as heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy O'Keeffe's concern in raising this matter. I agree fully with his views in relation to the importance of agricultural shows.</P>
      <P>The testing requirement in regard to the movement and/or sale of animals is specified in national and EC legislation. It is a sensible mechanism to avoid the spread of disease and to protect herdowners buying in animals as well as owners who exhibit their animals at shows.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of exhibition at agricultural shows and sales animals must be from herds which have had a clear herd test in the last 12 months. There is no difficulty in arranging the necessary annual herd test where a herdowner requires to exhibit animals. The herdowner should contact his or her veterinarian, who would normally be in a position to carry out the test within a fortnight. Where a herd test has been carried out within the previous 12 months and the herd is clear, the herdowners can in the usual way have individual animals tested to comply with the requirement for a clear pre-movement test within two calendar months of the date of show or sale. Where a herdowner wishes to exhibit in Northern Ireland, the animals must have passed a 30 day pre-movement export test and a 30 day brucellosis pre-movement test and be from a herd certified as free from leukosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the relations with the <Col N="610" /> veterinary profession, discussions are ongoing with the Irish Veterinary Union and the other interests in regard to a new four year programme for TB eradication. The discussions do not have any impact on exhibiting at shows.</P>
    <P>The arrangements have been in operation for a number of years. In my view they are reasonable and workable and do not cause any disruption to shows. Therefore I do not consider that movement by special permit from herds which have not had a full herd test within the previous 12 months is justified.</P>
    <P>Agricultural shows and sales are a very important shop window for our livestock industry. The Deputy acknowledged that in his opening comments. Breeders or exporters can view first hand the quality conformation of our highest quality cattle. The animals in question are invariably pedigree animals with a high commercial value. It is only sensible that every precaution should be taken to protect the disease status of these animals. The arrangements in place strike a fair balance between disease consideration and ensuring that herdowners can move their animals.</P>
    <P>To summarise very briefly, I do not think that the difficulties outlined by Deputy O'Keeffe in his seriously presented comments do exist. I am sure that the Deputy would agree with me that because of the high quality and high value of the livestock exhibited at agricultural shows we need to take more than normal precautions to ensure that the animals on exhibition are not infected by any weakness in the disease eradication scheme resulting from some animals coming into the arena that might in fact be carriers of bovine tuberculosis. We have a national responsibility, particularly in relation to the quality and the value of the livestock in question, to ensure that the livestock exhibited are not in any way infected by animals coming from a herd in which there might perhaps have been in the intervening period a breakdown in health status.</P>

      <P>The position at present is that the vast majority of social welfare clients are receiving their payment with little or no delay.</P>
      <P>As I told this House on Wednesday last in response to a Private Notice Question in the matter, pensioners and other persons paid at post offices have not been affected by the disruption of postal services. I am glad to say that this situation continues to obtain.</P>
      <P>However, the position of some clients who receive payment cheques through the post has required special attention. This category includes recipients of disability benefit, injury benefit, disablement benefit, maternity benefit and death grants. Postal deliveries of cheques are being made throughout the country with minimal delays. In the case of clients residing in the Dublin 1 and Dublin 2 postal districts my Department is operating a special cheque-collection centre for claimants in Oisin House, Pearse Street, Dublin 2. Clients in these districts who are due a cheque payment can collect it or can authorise someone to do so on their behalf. Notice of this arrangement has been advertised in the national newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of recipients of unemployment <Col N="404" /> payments have not been affected. Special arrangements had to be made for some of those who are paid at post offices and also for those paid by cheque, but in the main delay in making payment has not been a problem.</P>
    <P>Despite these special measures and the efforts of my Department's staff who have shown great commitment to ensuring that payments are made, it is inevitable that the current disruption to postal services will give rise to some cases of delay. To enable clients who do not receive their cheque when due to report the matter without cost, a special FREE-FONE Line has been opened by my Department. The number is 1 800 222 777 and the service is available on each working day from 9.15 a.m. to 5 p.m.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to point out there is no change in the position that the public should not post any letters or documents to any of my Department's Offices in Dublin until further notice. Claim forms, medical certificates, pension books or both documents should be handed in at any of the Department's local offices in Dublin or at the public office in Oisin House (Pearse Street), Gandon House (Amiens Street) or Phibsboro Tower.</P>

If an applicant appeals against a decision to the independent appeals office she/he is facilitated in every way to ensure that she/he is clear as to the issues involved in making the appeal.</P>
    <P>As part of the strategy for increasing the availability of information on social welfare my Department is participating in the Aertel TV information service. Homes with the Teletext facility can now access social welfare information during normal broadcasting hours. Those without the Teletext facility can receive social welfare information on Network 2 between 10.45 and 11.30 a.m. This means that social welfare information is being broadcast into 94 per cent of homes throughout the country and people receive accurate information in an environment in which they can most easily absorb it.</P>
    <P>Unlike other social welfare payments supplementary welfare allowance payments, apart from basic weekly payments, are made on a discretionary basis. In exercising discretion community welfare officers operate under guidelines issued by my Department. I am revising these guidelines and I intend to publish them. Work on the revision is well under way and the guidelines on rent and mortgage <Col N="408" /> supplements will be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>Also, it has been the practice since 1988 for the Minister for Social Welfare to hold a pre-budget forum for the major interest groups of social welfare clients. These occasions, which take place around November each year, provide an important opportunity for a frank exchange of views between the Minister and his officials on the one hand and the representatives of the various client groups on the other. They have proved very helpful in the lead up to the preparation of the annual budget and they will be continued.</P>
    <P>My policy is to extend where possible the types of improvements I have mentioned. My Department has recently established a new regional management structure. Under this a new localised service is being created. This is designed to bring the Department closer to its clients. An important part of the localisation strategy is the provision of information to individuals and improved links with voluntary organisations at local level. The principle under-pinning these developments is a very real desire to ensure that the Department is as accessible and as responsive as possible to the needs of its clients.</P>

      <P>There were no provisions in the 1992 budget to disqualify people from widow's pension. Provision was made in the 1992 Social Welfare Act for an income limit for entitlement to deserted wife's benefit, the amount of the new limits to be prescribed in regulations. These regulations are currently being drafted in my Department. The limit will be set at around £12,000 per annum and <Col N="409" /> it is intended that it will operate on a tapered basis. It will apply only to new claimants and thus will not disqualify current claimants.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 60 people per annum will fail to qualify for deserted wife's benefit because of the income limit. These will generally be people who are in employment and earning in excess of average earnings. The introduction of the earnings limit is intended to direct scarce resources towards people in greatest need.</P>

      <P>Previous year details of earnings provide a reference or starting point for the assessment of means for small-holders and other self-employed persons. I would like to stress the emphasis on starting point and it is a misconception to believe that this is the end of the process.</P>

      <P>It is also open to any claimant to apply for a review of the means assessed against them if at any point their circumstances have seriously deteriorated. If still dissatisfied with an assessment, it is open to a claimant to appeal to the Social Welfare appeal office.</P>
      <P>Methods of assessment are kept under review by my Department.

      <P>The Deputy's question refers to a form which issues to clients who have won their appeals against disallowance of disability benefit and who are due to a sizeable amount of arrears of benefit.</P>
      <P>In all cases involving arrears, it is the practice to inquire of the local Health board and social welfare offices to determine if the client has been paid by them for the period in question. Where it transpires that the client has been paid in the interim then the amount of such payment is deducted from the arrears and the balance is paid to the client.</P>
      <P>Where it appears that no payment has been made, and where the amount of arrears is substantial (£600 or more), then further inquiries are made in that this form is sent to clients asking them how they maintained themselves in the interim.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this inquiry is to ensure that the client did not claim another social welfare or health board payment in his or her own right or was not claimed as a dependant on a claim made by another client, e.g. a spouse. This prevents overpayments in cases where such information may come to light after the arrears have issued. The form is also sent in cases where information has come to hand that the client may have been engaged in work during the period in question.</P>
      <P>The question of means does not arise in the case of disability benefit as it is not a means tested payment. The Deputy can be assured that in circumstances such as this the Department is only interested in obtaining information which is relevant to the client's claim and which will assist in prompt and correct payment.</P>
      <P>However, it is accepted that the form in question may fail to make the exact nature of the inquiry clear and steps have now been taken by my Department to rectify this.</P>

      <Quest> his views on the case of an old age pensioner aged over 80 in need of full-time care but who is being cared for by her daughter, and who is claiming unemployment assistance in order to get over the problem that, (a) the mother does not qualify for a free electricity allowance and other such allowance and (b) the daughter herself does not qualify for any assistance with the cost of caring.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy has not given me the details of the particular case he has in mind, I can only outline the situation that applies generally in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>A person who is providing full-time care for a pensioner cannot be regarded as being available for and genuinely seeking work. In the circumstances described the pensioner's daughter would not be eligible for receipt of unemployment assistance. However, she is very likely to be entitled to a carer's allowance instead.</P>
      <P>The weekly rate of carer's allowance is £50 per week maximum rising to £53 per week from the end of July next. This is the same as the short term rate of Unemployment Assistance and £5 per week less than the long term rate. This difference will be £4.20 per week after the increase in rates from end of July next.</P>
      <P>I have already announced that I intend to review all the various non-contributory social welfare schemes. As part of this process, I will be reviewing the carer's allowance scheme to see how assistance might be directed more effectively at the needs of carers in the community. I will be consulting with my colleague, the Minister for Health, in regard to appropriate provision for carers generally. However, any significant improvements to the carer's allowance scheme would have cost implications which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the free electricity allowance the fact that the pensioner is residing with a recipient of unemployment assistance does not automatically <Col N="413" /> disqualify her for receipt of free electricity allowance. In October 1990 the scope of this free electricity acheme was extended. In most cases the extension ensures that pensioners over 80 years of age may retain their entitlement to this allowance even if they are no longer living alone. The pensioner may also be eligible for certain of the other free scheme entitlements &mdash; particularly free TV licence and a weekly fuel allowance during the winter.</P>
    <P>I would be pleased to investigate the circumstances of the particular case which the Deputy has in mind if he lets me have more details.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works bear overall responsibility for ensuring that all Government buildings are properly maintained. This includes the cleaning and repair of stonework. To this end the Commissioners regularly inspect all State buildings under their control and set maintenance priorities.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners are aware that the facades of a number of the State-owned buildings on Kildare Street require attention and propose appropriate action.</P>
      <P>Work will commence this year on major repairs to the facade of Agriculture House and on the cleaning of the stonework on the Department of Industry and Commerce building.</P>
      <P>Provision has also been made this year for some cleaning and exploratory work to the exterior of the National Museum and a start is to be made this year on the cleaning, and repair of the Kildare Street facade of Leinster House.</P>

      <P>Ireland has a double taxation agreement with Germany. This agreement, in common with Ireland's other double taxation agreements, has no provision dealing directly with the taxation of students employed in either country during the course of their summer holidays.</P>
      <P>The question of whether or not a student is entitled to claim a refund of tax paid in Germany is a matter for the individual to take up with the German tax authorities.</P>
      <P>A student working in Germany for the summer would be liable to tax in Germany, subject to the provisions of domestic German legislation, and also in Ireland in accordance with Irish tax legislation under which an Irish resident is subject to taxation on all income from whatever source arising. The provisions of the Ireland/Germany double taxation agreement come into play in these circumstances and in the assessment to Irish tax of the income earned by a person in Germany, a credit would be available for any tax paid on that income there.</P>
      <P>I understand that special arrangements exist under German domestic regulations under which students of foreign educational establishments do not have to pay tax in Germany if certain conditions are met. These are: (i) the employment must be training related, i.e. it must relate to the student's course of study; (ii) the student's stay in Germany must not exceed 183 days in a calendar year; and (iii) the monthly salary must not exceed DM1,000.</P>
      <P>If the limit of DM1,000 is exceeded, then the entire salary is subject to tax. If a student considers that he/she meets the above requirements then an application should be made to the appropriate German tax authority.</P>

      <P>The EC/EFTA Treaty, which is scheduled to come into force on 1 January 1993, effectively brings the EFTA countries into the Community's Single Internal Market. This will add to the economic growth already expected to be generated in the Community by completion of the Internal Market and Ireland will be in a position to benefit from this increased economic activity.</P>
      <P>In addition, the EC/EFTA Treaty makes specific provision for a financial mechanism to provide assistance to promote development and structural adjustment in the Island of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and the Objective I regions of Spain. Financial aid will be provided in the form of direct grants and in the form of interest rebates on loans.</P>
      <P>The total amount of grants provided will be ECU 500 million to be committed over the period 1993 to 1997. The total amount of loans which will be eligible for interest rebates over the period 1993 &mdash; 1997 will be ECU 1.5 billion. Priority will be given to projects which place particular emphasis on the environment, on transport including infrastructure, education and training. Discussion has not yet taken place on the shareout of this assistance between the eligible countries.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the startling statistic, which was published by the National Campaign for the Homeless, which suggests that there are at least 800 young homeless people in Ireland and also that counties Cork, Limerick and Dublin are some of the worst black-spots.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the policy document of the National Campaign for the Homeless which contains a reference of 800 homeless persons. There are two points that should be noted about this figure. The first is that it relates to people up to the age of 30 years and not just those under 18 years. The second is that it appears to include children and young persons living in hostels and in foster care who are being maintained at the expense of the State and who, therefore, could hardly be regarded as homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary responsibility of the health boards in this area is in respect of <Col N="431" /> children and youny persons up to 18 years of age. My colleague, Deputy Chris Flood, as Minister of State at my Department has initiated a wide ranging package of developments with a view to effecting substantial improvements in the availability of services and accommodation for the young homeless.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that considerable progress has been made. Over 40 additional places for the young homeless are being provided in Dublin; 12 of these are already available and I expect the balance to be in place shortly. New services are also being developed in Cork, Athlone, Limerick, Galway and Sligo which will provide about 30 extra places.</P>
    <P>Amongst the important new developments in the Eastern Health Board area are:</P>
    <P>A new emergency hostel providing ten places for homeless girls is now in place at Sherrard House, Dublin 1;</P>
    <P>A new therapeutic unit for eight difficult adolescents (boys and girls) operated by the Eastern Health Board near Naas, Co. Kildare will open shortly;</P>
    <P>A new residential unit for ten boys to be operated by the Los Angeles Society is due to open in Dalkey in June 1992;</P>
    <P>The hostel for homeless boys run by the Catholic Social Service Conference has been re-located from Percy Place to newly refurbished accommodation at Eccles Street resulting in an increase from ten to 12 in the number of places;</P>
    <P>A new after-care service for up to four boys leaving that hostel has been established at Lennox Street.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Eastern Health Board are taking a number of other initiatives, including:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of an &ldquo;after hours&rdquo; social work service to deal exclusively with the young homeless;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a &ldquo;Carers for Young People Scheme&rdquo; to provide family care for <Col N="432" /> adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings;</P>
    <P>&mdash;developing other short term accommodation such as digs, sheltered flats and semi-independent living accommodation.</P>
    <P>The problem of youth homelessness is not, of course, confined to Dublin. Discussions have been held with the Chief Executive Officers of the other health boards concerning appropriate measures to assist the young homeless in their areas. The aim is to ensure, as far as possible, that each health board is self-sufficient in residential places. This is fully in keeping with the Child Care Act and the new obligations it imposes on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children. Progress is being made on a number of fronts:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new hostel for homeless youth is being established in Athlone by a voluntary group in association with the Midland Health Board;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new residential service for 8-10 adolescent boys is being developed near Limerick by the Mid-Western Health Board;</P>
    <P>&mdash;additional places have been provided at Stranorlar, Co. Donegal for children and adolescents with behavioural problems;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new hostel for homeless youngsters is being developed in Sligo by a voluntary body with support from the North-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the building of a new residential unit for teenage boys in Cork city is now completed and will open shortly. A specialised foster care programme for difficult children is also being developed by the Southern Health Board;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new hostel for homeless girls is being developed in Galway by the Western Health Board in association with a local voluntary group.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy can see from the information which I have given him this problem <Col N="433" /> is being targeted by the Government for particular attention. The need for further facilities to deal with this problem is being urgently examined by the health boards in consultation with the relevant voluntary agencies in the context of the additional £2 million for child care set aside in the budget.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the provision of day care facilities for children. The responsibility of the health boards for the support of day care services for children relates primarily to those services which cater mainly for families under stress, for example, single parent families or families where parents are ill or unable to cope or children in other disadvantaged circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately £1.5 million was allocated by the health boards to bodies providing day care services for pre-school children in 1991. This does not represent the total expenditure on day care services as a number of the health boards also made block grants to voluntary bodies to provide family resource services which include a day care element. It is not, <Col N="434" /> however, possible to give separate figures for the day care element.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the provision of child care services for working parents, which affects the achievement of real equality in the labour market, will be pursued during the period of the programme. The development of such services, which is a shared responsibility, will continue to be encouraged by the Government which has set up a working group under the auspices of the Minister for Labour and incorporating representatives of ICTU and FIE to identify possible areas of development.</P>

      <P>The prospects for Irish people wishing to emigrate to the United States were greatly improved by the passage of the US Immigration Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>This Act provides for a substantial increase in the global number of immigrant visas issued annually by the US authorities, including increases in the allocations for various categories of workers. Most importantly from an Irish perspective, the Act provides for 40,000 special diversity-transition or &ldquo;Morrison&rdquo; visas to be granted annually to citizens of countries found to be disadvantaged under the terms of earlier US immigration legislation. Of these, a minimum of 40% (16,000) will be granted to Irish citizens for each of the three years ending September 1994. From October 1994, the &ldquo;Morrison&rdquo; visa will be replaced by a second type of visa, of which 55,000 will be made available on an annual basis to citizens of the same disadvantged countries.</P>
      <P>In view of the very positive provisions of the 1990 Act, the question of making representations to the US authorities does not arise at this stage.</P>

      <P>In the context of the discussion, on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which are currently ongoing at European Community level, the Portuguese Presidency has put forward a compromise paper recently which suggests that in future eligibility for both the suckler cow premium and the male beef premium should be limited. During the course of the Common Agricultural Policy reform debate, several countries have expressed concern at the possibility of a larger influx of new entrants coming into beef production directly as a result of the impact of the reforms on other commodity sectors. There is a danger that such a development would give rise to further surplus beef production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the revised proposals attempt to address the need to control new entrants to the beef sector, they are far from finalised. My overall approach to Common Agricultural Policy reform is to seek to <Col N="439" /> devise a regime that underpins producer income while providing a sound basis on which the industry can develop.</P>

      <P>He applied for premium on 34 animals under the 1990 special beef premium scheme. As he did not maintain three of these animals for two months from the date of application as required and sold 20 others without submitting their identity cards to my Department for checking, punching and stamping he could only be paid premium at 80 per cent on the remaining 11 animals.</P>

      <P>A total of 2,335 applications for old age non-contributory pension and 1,458 applications for old age contributory pension were rejected in 1991. These rejections represent 20 per cent and 21 per cent respectively of the total number of applications received for each scheme that year.</P>
      <P>Most rejections for old age non-contributory pension were because applicants had means above the statutory limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for rejection in old age contributory pension cases was because applicants had less than the minimum <Col N="441" /> yearly average of 20 paid or credited social insurance contributions.</P>

      <P>There are currently over 1.4 million persons who benefit from the social welfare system on a weekly basis. This figure includes claimants themselves and their adult and child dependants. This amounts to 40 per cent of the total population. In addition, there are 1.1 million children in receipt of child benefit and this represents virtually all children in the relevant age group in the State.</P>
      <P>Not all recipients of social welfare payments are solely dependent on this source of income. Persons in receipt of social insurance payments who are in employment may have other income such as employers sick-pay and persons such as contributory pensioners would often have another source of income from a private or occupational pension.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if a person (details supplied) in Dublin 1 whose sole income is £58.20 per week deserted wife's allowance is entitled to any assistance or supplementary welfare to assist mortgage repayments of £25 per week.</Quest>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement can be paid towards rent or mortgage interest payments where the payment exceeds £3.50 per week. As a general rule supplements are calculated so as to leave the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, with an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate <Col N="442" /> to the person's family size, less £3.50.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the Dublin area, that the person in question applied for a mortgage supplement in 1990. While the person in question qualified for a supplement she decided not to take up the supplement because of the low rate payable in her case.</P>
      <P>The board has advised that in recent weeks the person in question again raised the question of her entitlement to a mortgage supplement with her local community welfare officer who requested the person to furnish details of current mortgage repayments. The health board will re-examine the applicant's entitlement on receipt of this information.</P>
