      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am bringing this matter forward is the indefinite nature of the decision made by the High Court yesterday in relation to United Meat Packers.  I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the failure of <Col N="1002" /> the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which allows for the appointment of an examiner by the High Court to run a company which has encountered financial difficulties and the necessity to further amend the Act so that the examiner can carry out his functions as was intended when the 1990 Act was passed by the Oireachtas.  It is clear from yesterday's decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions in regard to No. 8 and No. 5.  I should say, Sir, that the Fine Gael Party have no objection to No. 5 being taken without debate. However, we object most strenuously to the proposal that No. 8 be taken without debate.  Item No. 8 extends the present sitting times of the Dáil.  For the past three years the Government have been promising that the Dáil will be reformed but we have now reached the situation where virtually no significant legislation goes through the House having been <Col N="1004" /> debated properly.  Large chunks of major Bills are passed without examination of individual amendments.  The House is not performing its constitutional duty in regard to the consideration of Estimates and it is not possible to question individual items in Estimates.  Indeed, when the Estimates come before the House most of the money has already been spent.  We need to debate the way in which the House is working and if we were to allow a discussion on No. 8 such a debate would take place here in the House.  Therefore we object to the proposal that No. 8 be taken without debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy some latitude.  I take it that the proposal that No. 5 shall be decided without debate is satisfactory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1012" /> Amendment No. 15 seeks to apply the provisions of Part II of the Bill, relating to the admissibility of documentary evidence, to civil proceedings.

The Bill deals solely with the law of evidence in criminal proceedings and to seek to amend the law relating to civil proceedings is beyond the scope of the Bill. That is in accordance with precedent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (3), line 18, after &ldquo;districts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, save that no such day or days as fixed shall be later than six months from the enactment of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a proposal to address what has become almost an everyday feature of legislation coming before the Oireachtas.  It is a feature which negates the whole function and operation of the Oireachtas in its work.  I refer to the provision that following the passage of legislation it shall be brought into operation as part of the law only on such dates as the Minister for Justice shall, by order, decide.  Because of the way business is ordered, motions in regard to such ministerial orders will never be discussed in this House and we will not be entitled to do other than raise questions from time to time with the Minister regarding the coming into operation of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice heralded the introduction of this legislation through the Government Information Services or through his own press office and also in the House as representing an immediate and positive response to ongoing and developing issues in the general area of child sexual abuse and the manner in which such cases might be dealt with by the courts.  The legislation was to be a signal that this Government were taking definite and precise steps to deal with the problem.  I inquired further as to the particular issues which were exercising the Minister's mind, enabling him to make these vaunted statements.  One issue he cited was the case in Waterford <Col N="1013" /> involving the dismissal of charges against a father accused of having had unlawful incestuous relations with a child of his family and his acquittal on direction simply because the mother had not been available to give testimony in court as to parentage.  The other issue was the developing case then before the Supreme Court involving the 14-year old victim of rape who was seeking to have a termination of her pregnancy in England.  We were told that these were the two basic reasons for the bringing forward of this legislation, which was to be processed rapidly and put into law.</P>
    <P>We welcomed at least the speed with which the Minister intended to proceed. However, the first statement of the Minister's legislative intent contained in the Bill is that it is not to come into play until he shall decide.  We must place that against the record of other Ministers in regard to important legislation.  The Child Care Act was passed by both Houses over two years ago but only one section of more than 100 contained in the Act has been brought into law.  That legislation was dealt with at considerable length by this House, not just within this Chamber but in a special committee which served for months.  The original legislation was circulated in 1986 and was the subject of very detailed debate before coming to fruition.  It contained a provision similar to that in this legislation whereby various sections of the Act will be brought into law as and when the Minister decides.  Because of the record of this Government in using this feature to render this House irrelevant, I object to its inclusion.</P>
    <P>I am proposing in my amendment that the Government should have a period to put in place the nuts and bolts to react logistically to the legislation when passed.  Clearly the Government cannot put in place all the technical arrangements in anticipation that the House will agree or that the Government will survive long enough to see it through.  Governments should have a reasonable period of time when law is passed to arrange for its implementation.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to support in this <Col N="1014" /> House this open-ended mandate of Government that reduces the entire process to a joke, as evidenced in the related and directly involved area of child care generally.  The same applied to other legislation from the Department of Justice. The legislation relating to video recordings and the incitement to hatred legislation initially come to mind in this regard.  It is not a proper legislative process to involve the Houses of the Oireachtas in debate on and to seek approval for legislation that will be left on the departmental shelf with nothing constructive being done.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I propose that the legislation be implemented in six months. If the Minister says that six months is not sufficient I would concede to Deputy Shatter's proposition of 12 months, as outlined in amendment No. 3.  I would even agree to a longer period provided an emphatic and clear date is laid down for implementation of the legislation. However, I will not leave an open-ended proviso in the hands of the Minister or the Government.  The six months proposed in my amendment is reasonable. We are talking about putting in place in a few locations technology that is now so sophisticated and easy to handle that it would take a matter of weeks rather than months to install.  For example, technology was installed in this Chamber in a short time.  In three to four months the technicians put in place not only the cameras and microphones but all the other paraphernalia needed.  In addition, they installed the entire broadcasting unit at a separate location.  Anyone who has visited the House will be impressed by the range of technology that was installed in a matter of months.  In this legislation we are proposing a more modest operation in select locations involving the installation of video transmission and television monitoring facilities.  This does not require an open-ended mandate from the Government and we will not agree to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House unduly on this matter because we have much ground to cover.  I agree with <Col N="1015" /> the sentiments expressed by Deputy McCartan.  It is wrong of us to constantly pass legislation in this House which has no &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date.  Legislation that Government portray as being urgent, having passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas, does not become operative. A recent example is legislation that I regard as extremely important, which addresses areas relevant to this Bill, that is the Forensic Evidence Act which was passed in December 1990 but which is still not operational.  In that case an order is required to bring the legislation into force.</P>
      <P>A number of aspects of this legislation are extremely urgent.  The Minister is asking the House to pass the legislation but not to bring it into force.  That is not good enough from a Government who have succeeded in having an unseemly number of Bills passed by this House which they have not brought into force. The Child Care Act passed in June 1991 is another example.  No one in this House knows when most of the provisions in that Act will become operational, despite the fact that our laws in the area of child care are based on antiquated legislation passed in 1908 and do not adequately address the problems of child sexual abuse and child physical abuse or the obligations of health boards to protect the welfare of children.  The 1991 Act addressed those issues but it is still not part of our law.  As legislators we should not pretend to the Irish people that we are tackling issues by passing legislation which the Government leave to gather dust on departmental shelves and do not make operational.</P>
      <P>It may be a matter of debate as to whether the Government should be given six months, nine months or 12 months in which to bring this Bill into force.  The reason I propose 12 months is that the Bill provides for the televising of evidence, and the initial steps in this regard would be taken in respect of cases heard in the Four Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it from information the Minister kindly made available to me, it is envisaged that in a case involving <Col N="1016" /> rape or sexual assault a child would give evidence in front of a television camera in Aras Uí Dháiligh and that evidence would be relayed to the Four Courts.  If the Minister decides to put the necessary facilities in place over the summer months it would be reasonable to expect that he would have time, before providing the equipment in other courthouses throughout the country, to see how the system is working and to correct any technical or other difficulties that might arise with the procedure.  There is no reason why, during the long legal vacation, the work could not be completed before the commencement of the new legal term in October next.  By Christmas, the Government should have a clear view as to how the system is working. By proposing a period of 12 months from the passing of the Act it would allow for similar technology to be installed in courts in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says he would favour a period of 18 months I would not raise a great objection provided he gives an undertaking that this facility will be provided before next October in the Four Courts.  We could then provide for the transferring of trials from other parts of the country to Dublin, if necessary, to limit the stress caused to a young person giving evidence in a case in which sexual assault or rape is alleged.  However, I would be very anxious to ensure that this would not delay the installation of the facility in the rest of the country for an extended period.  To allow some months to see whether the system is working is reasonable but it would not be possible in the long term to expect young people to travel from Limerick, Cork, Waterford and elsewhere to Dublin for trials of this nature because that would add to the burden that may be experienced.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to seriously consider the amendment tabled by me on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  There is no difference between what Deputy McCartan is saying in principle and what I am saying.  We are both anxious what with the passing of this Bill, the House can assure the general public that all parts <Col N="1017" /> of it will become fully operational within a specified period of time.  If the Minister says he would like to give consideration between now and Report Stage to the period required for the bringing into force of this Bill I would be willing not to proceed with the Fine Gael amendment. Hopefully, the Minister will come back on Report Stage with a timescale that he may consider feasible to resolve this difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in supporting the thrust of the amendments of Deputy McCartan and Deputy Shatter. The principle involved here is a serious one.  It is one that has crept into our legislative practice over the years to all too great an extent.  In effect, it gives a Minister a veto over legislation passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas meets in two Chambers, debates legislation at length and decides on what is advisable, yet the Minister feels he must retain a veto over it for an indefinite period.  The law does not come into force until the Minister decides on his own motion that it is appropriate to bring it into effect.  It is completely unacceptable that an open-ended veto should be given to the executive branch of Government to put aside legislation adopted by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Deputies McCartan and Shatter referred to legislation that had been adopted by the House six months, one year and two years ago but still had not been brought into force.  I should like to refer to a more notable example, the legislation adopted by the House more than 25 years ago altering the legal responsibility of local authorities and amending the public authorities protection legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearly 30 years since it was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to believe that the Oireachtas adopted a measure changing the law regarding the liability of public authorities in a very important respect, leaving it only for the Minister's order to bring it into effect and for nearly <Col N="1018" /> 30 years the Minister, and a succession of Ministers, have ignored the will of the Oireachtas by persistently refusing to make the order bringing it into play.  That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>From time to time it happens that legislation passed by the House cannot be put into effect immediately.  At times certain procedures have to be followed, orders prepared and technical arrangements made before legislation can be brought into play and there may be a fixed period before the implementation of the legislation. Of course, there is no logical reason that the commencement period should not be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>However, so far as Part III and section 28 are concerned, the provisions which require the Minister's imprimatur to be brought into operation, there is no reason that it should be necessary to allow any period of delay.  All Part III and section 28 do is introduce an enabling provision. They do not state that evidence to be given henceforth must be relayed through a television link.  It is provided that evidence may be given that way by leave of the court.  There is no reason to delay the introduction of the legislation on that account.  Obviously, if a court is told that the technical television arrangements and video recording facilities are not available or in place the court will not give that leave.  Where is the necessity for the Minister to take unto himself the idea of delaying the introduction of that measure?  Section 12 (1) states:</P>
      <P>In any criminal proceedings, unless the court sees good reason to the contrary, a person other than the accused may give evidence, whether from within or outside the State,</P>
      <P>The word used is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The position is the same in section 28 (1), which states:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to section 12 (1), in any criminal proceedings a person other than the accused who is outside the State may, with the leave of the court, give evidence through a live television link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the problem in adopting the Bill without any time delay, having regard to <Col N="1019" /> the fact that the measure in question is only an optional enabling provision that cannot be operational until the court is told that the facility is available?  Why does the Minister have to give to himself a delaying measure?  I do not consider that six months, 12 months or any other period of delay is necessary.  There seems to be no good reason that the legislation should not come into operation immediately on enactment of the Bill.  That would put pressure on the Department of Justice to ensure that the necessary facilities are brought into play speedily so that the intent of the Oireachtas, if it adopts the legislation, may be enforced quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Various points have been made in the debate.  First I wish to put on the record my absolute repudiation of Deputy McCartan's assertion that the Government were using this kind of device in a general way to make the House irrelevant.  That is not in accordance with the facts.  Provisions enabling legislation to be brought into operation on such day or days as the Minister may order did not begin with this Government but have been a general feature of legislation since the foundation of the State. I do not consider that the Government are particularly remiss in this regard when compared to any other Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the child care legislation and Deputy Shatter to forensic evidence legislation.  I have no personal knowledge of the difficulties, whether operational, financial or otherwise, that have delayed the making of the relevant orders under the child care legislation.  I do not claim to make an argument for or against the delays that have occurred, I am not responsible for that legislation.  However, I am responsible for this legislation and I give the House a categoric assurance that the implementation of this legislation will proceed with all speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments tabled by Deputies Shatter and McCartan concern section <Col N="1020" /> 1 (3), which provides that Part III and section 28 shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed by order of the Minister.  I point out that the order of the Minister is necessary to bring into operation only those two provisions.  The other provisions come into operation automatically within three months of its passage.</P>
    <P>There is a very good reason for the delay in this instance.  While I recognise the aim of both Deputies in putting down their amendments, which is to put pressure on the Government &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; to bring this legislation into operation as quickly as possible, that is also my aim and must be the aim of every other Deputy.  The fact is, however, that Part III cannot come into operation until the relevant facilities have been provided to enable evidence to be given by live television link.  The present position is that funds for that purpose have been provided from the Estimates, tenders have been issued and demonstrations of various systems will take place during the Easter recess so that members of the Judiciary and other interested parties have the opportunity to see what is on offer.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Shatter rightly said, I wrote to him outlining the way in which I envisaged Part III would operate.  To my recollection, I also wrote to Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can recall I received a reply from Deputy Shatter requesting certain things, which I passed on to the Minister with a recommendation that his requests be acceded to.  I cannot recall exactly the contents of Deputy Shatter's letter; I think they had something to do with viewing the equipment. I might point out that the demonstrations which will take place over the Easter recess will be open to members of the Judiciary and other interested parties, which I imagine would include Deputy Shatter.  Perhaps I can take this opportunity to offer him an invitation to the viewing of the equipment.  I will <Col N="1021" /> request my Department to inform Deputies Shatter and McCartan when the equipment is being demonstrated.</P>
      <P>Personally I can see no reason whatever why it should not be possible to have a system installed in three courtrooms in the Four Courts complex and a witness room fitted out in Aras Uí Dhálaigh before the Michaelmas law term begins in October next.  It is also the view and expectation of those concerned in procuring the equipment that, when that equipment is available in the Four Courts, it will be possible to transfer proceedings from elsewhere in the country to the Four Courts; that is provided for in section 16.</P>
      <P>To revert to the amendments, there should be no problem about having Part III of the Bill operational within six months.  Even if the legislation were to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of this month &mdash; of course that applies with even greater force to the 12 months period mentioned by Deputy Shatter &mdash; the problem is that the equipment must be in place before the provisions of Part III of the Bill can be implemented.  It is my aim to have this done as soon as possible so that the machinery will be in motion already. Unfortunately, we live in uncertain times.  There is a very slight possibility &mdash; there is always an element of risk involved in anything &mdash; that something entirely unforeseen could occur which would delay the installation of the equipment.</P>
      <P>Were we to accept the amendments in the names of Deputies Shatter and McCartan and such an entirely unforeseen contingency occurred, we would be placed in the very invidious position that Part III of the Bill would be in operation but the equipment necessary for that implementation would not be available. To coin a phrase, that is the appalling vista we are endeavouring to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understood him correctly Deputy Taylor made the point that there is no obligation on the court to allow a person avail of those facilities.  I must reject whatever argument he makes on that premise because Part III provides that if <Col N="1022" /> a court decides it is appropriate that those facilities should be available, then it must allow a person who requests such facilities avail of them.  Therefore, if the six months or 12 months period had been accepted by the Government and inserted in the legislation, when that period had elapsed, if for some reason the relevant equipment was not in place, an accused, a witness or the prosecution could request these facilities to be made available.  In such circumstances if the court could not make them available &mdash; for the very technical reason that the facilities did not exist &mdash; and the judge considered they should be made available, that it was an appropriate case for the use of the provisions of Part III, obviously Deputies Shatter, Taylor and McCartan, all three of whom are lawyers, would know what would be the inevitable result.</P>
    <P>I have given my personal commitment to having the provisions of this Bill implemented at the earliest possible date. Tenders have gone out; the money has been provided; viewing will take place over the Easter period; therefore, the machinery is rolling.  I can foresee no reason at all why this equipment will not have been installed in Aras Uí Dhálaigh in time for the beginning of the Michaelmas law term.  Form that point of view I cannot accept the amendments but I can assure the House that the objective of those amendments will be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and acknowledge that he wrote to me outlining in detail the facilities intended to be installed. Obviously those details were not specific in terms of time and detail of tenders but the basic operation of the scheme was outlined in his correspondence with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubly appreciate that, particularly since it is the first time in my years in this House that any Minister or Minister of State has written to me in response to an issue I had raised on Second Stage debate.  Indeed it is the first time ever a Minister or Minister of State has taken up a point I made on Second Stage and commented thereon in anticipation of Committee Stage.  I will take up the offer <Col N="1023" /> of the Minister's invitation to view the equipment because that would be very informative.  Hopefully that can take place in the period between Committee and Report Stages, so that whatever practical knowledge we may glean from such viewing will help to inform us for our debate on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Having said that, nonetheless I am firm in the principle and purpose of the amendment I pursue.  Equally I am appreciative of what the Minister of State has said in regard to the practical steps that have been taken.  It settles one issue, that there is no argument being advanced here about the technical complexities of what the legislation seeks to provide.  We live in an age of advanced technology. The equipment is there; it is a matter of getting the tenders in, the supplier in place and the job rolling.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has quite correctly spoken about the unforeseen contingency. I must say that there are many beasts stalking the landscape beyond this House that could well present us with any number of unforeseen contingencies.  For example, I am mindful that in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, there was a provision enabling the Minister for Justice to introduce technology in Garda stations for the purposes of video recording interviews with suspects.  There is no technological difficulty involved there.  Given all of the moneys spent on other telecommunications networks within the realm of the Garda Síochána, there could not be a problem in regard to funds.  But what has happened is that an unforeseen contingency beast has raised its head, in short, the Garda Síochána do not want video recordings.  Therefore, a provision of law placed on the Statute Book in 1984 has lain dormant ever since.  An excellent report of Judge Martin deals with the whole question of interviewing of suspects in which he recommended that video recordings constituted the only practical means of so doing.  He advanced the case, illustrating that it is a system which would protect not only a suspect or suspects, but the Garda themselves. <Col N="1024" /> Yet that provision is there but has not been acted on or implemented.</P>
    <P>The same Martin report deals with another very important concept, that is of a higher court of review, tribunal or body of review of cases where it is agreed by the Attorney General &mdash; in Judge Martin's recommendation &mdash; that the courts and court systems have not dealt with the justice of the issue of the particular case.  That proposal has lain dormant as well because the judges in the courts have taken umbrage at the idea of establishing a higher tier that might not necessarily, in all cases, involve members of the Judiciary, or indeed involve them at all.  They contend that is going nowhere as far as they are concerned, that the Martin report &mdash; which we were told by the then Minister for Justice would be acted on as a matter of urgency &mdash; has been shelved.  Therefore, the unforeseen contingency about which the Minister of State spoke has arisen.</P>
    <P>I can foresee many contingencies arising in regard to the implementation of the provisions of this Bill if this House does not lay down a very clear proposition that this is the law we want and that we want it implemented by a set date, take it or leave it.  I am sorry if I appear to be unduly pointing the finger in the direction of this Government but they are the only Government with whom I have dealt since I became a Member of this House in 1987.  From my experience of addressing remarks on legislation here I see an increasing tendency to use this formula of passing law and deferring the date of its implementation.  I would challenge the Minister on this.  This may not have been an idea thought of exclusively or initiated by Fianna Fáil since 1987 but certainly it is being used ever more frequently than heretofore in the passage of legislation.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem is that it is tending to undermine the primacy of the Oireachtas as the legislative body in this community.  It is particularly invidious that after the Houses of the Oireachtas have passed legislation the opportunity is then open to vested interests, conservative irredentists who oppose any <Col N="1025" /> reform, change or progress, to appear out of the unforeseen contingency landscape and raise issues and problems with the Minister.  It is a formula which begs and invites that kind of scenario.  The amendment put down by Deputy Shatter and I would strengthen the Minister's hand when dealing with unforeseen contingencies and enable him to say to people who want to be obstructive or perhaps constructive on occasion: &ldquo;I have a deadline to meet and we are all constrained by it because that is the deadline laid down by the supreme authority of the Oireachtas for the operation of this legislation; the Oireachtas has set a reasonable deadline and I am prepared to deal with you but we must move on&rdquo;. This is why the Minister should reflect again on what we are proposing in this amendment.  This is why I am adamant that I am not going to lend my hand to a formula which could potentially set the most important and practical provisions of this legislation at nought.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully that the Minister and his Department have taken very active and constructive steps in this area and that they are committed to putting the legislation in place.  I understand the Minister has set the Michaelmas term, October, for the operation of the legislation. I wish to point out to the Minister that he is also setting a target which the people who want to exert authority by saying: &ldquo;We will run the course the way we want to run it.  We will run the Bar profession the way we want to run it or we will run the Law Society the way we want to run it&rdquo; will have to shoot for or avoid.  This is what I am worried about.</P>
    <P>The proposition I am advancing on behalf of the Democratic Left will strengthen the Minister's hand, if it needs to be strengthened, and will help him to deal unequivocally with unforeseen contingencies when they emerge.  I do not anticipate this legislation going completely off the rails because, as the Minister said in his Second Stage speech, this is good, constructive and innovative legislation.  The Garda Síochána in the journal from which I quoted regard this legislation as a milestone in the development <Col N="1026" /> of evidentiary laws in this country. This legislation deserves the support of everyone.  However, as I said, problems may be raised by the sectional and vested interests in some of the most conservative professions.  The way to get over this is by accepting the deadline proposed by us, which must be met because the Oireachtas says so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Minister for his response in regard to the points made about equipment. In response to a letter from him I wrote to the Minister suggesting that Members of this House who have an interest in the matter, and members of the Judiciary who have to work the new system, should be given the opportunity of viewing what is proposed and making observations on it prior to the legislative process being completed.  I welcome the fact that we will have the opportunity during the Easter recess to see a trial run of what is being proposed and reflect on it in the context of our dealing with this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister seemed to say that the equipment would be up and running in Dublin within the six month period and, in effect, by next autumn.  However, he did not say that this would be the case in other districts.  This section does not deal only with the Dublin district; it deals with other districts also.  As I understand the section, the Minister can make orders to apply the provisions in Part III to certain parts of the country that will not apply to other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that this provision will be in operation in Dublin and nowhere else.  That would be wrong. I was going to raise the example given by Deputy McCartan in regard to the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, under which technical equipment was to be provided in Garda stations for the recording of interviews.  This has not happened.  Some tremendous new Garda stations have been built in recent years in various parts of the country.  Since I was appointed Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice I have visited some of these stations.  However, this equipment has not been built into <Col N="1027" /> these stations.  One would have expected that it would have made economic sense to have built in the facilities in the newer Garda stations at the time they were being wired, etc.  However, this has not been done.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea of providing for unforeseen contingencies.  If legislation to provide for new procedures is passed by the Oireachtas there should not be unforeseen contingencies which could prevent its implementation.  I am prepared to take the view that the Minister may require a further period beyond six months to provide the facilities in other parts of the country.  If the Minister is saying that all he requires in reality is six months and that this will allow the facilities to be established not just in Dublin but in all the other districts for which it is envisaged, then I have no difficulty in supporting Deputy McCartan's proposal.  I simply do not like the idea of legislation leaving this House with no time limit on it.</P>
    <P>One of the points people like Deputy McCartan, Deputy Taylor and I have to bear in mind is that one of the unforeseen contingencies in political life is that a Minister who promises to do something on a Committee Stage debate of a Bill in the Dáil may not hold that position at the time the Bill is enacted and passed through the Oireachtas, to implement that promise.  I wish the Minister well in his post and I have no doubt he intends to be there for a considerable period of time.  However, I do not know what unforeseen political contingencies may arise within the Minister's party over which none of us on this side of the House has any control and which may mean that someone with a lesser commitment might at some stage after this Bill is passed into law come into the Minister's post. Indeed, the Minister may be the recipient of an early promotion to the full Cabinet and someone who has not participated in this process may replace him.  Therefore, it is important that we build the &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date into the legislation.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Minister's reply that it is his intention to implement the <Col N="1028" /> legislation fairly rapidly, I had hoped that instead of Deputy McCartan and I having to formally put our proposal and divide the House that at the very least the Minister would have agreed to consider this issue between now and Report Stage with a view to ascertaining whether there is a feasible and realistic date to which he could agree which would give us an assurance that the provisions in Part III will not simply apply in Dublin but will be extended, within a reasonable time, to other parts of the country where they are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  With regard to unforeseen contingencies, I am talking only about unforeseen contingencies in relation to the installation of the equipment. The coming into operation of the provisions in Part III is contingent on the equipment being provided and put into operation, and nothing else.  Deputy McCartan referred to the Law Society and the Bar Council.  If the Deputy is seeking to suggest &mdash; I am sorry if I am misinterpreting what he said &mdash; that those two august bodies can in some way delay the implementation of the provisions in Part III I should point out that it is certainly the intention of the Government to ensure that they will not be allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Law Society and the Bar Council, Deputy McCartan will be aware that the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill is before the House which, I hope, will further regulate the Incorporated Law Society.  The Bar Council, as Deputies are aware, have voluntarily agreed to regulate themselves.  One of my constituents recently approached me with a complaint about a member of the Bar and I advised him of the new disciplinary voluntary procedure which the Bar Council have taken on themselves to operate.  I told him to report back to me with the result of whatever investigation will take place.  I will be very interested to see how effective the procedure is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difficulty in relation to a starting date for Part III of the legislation because it is contingent on the provision <Col N="1029" /> of technical equipment.  We have provided the money, started the procedure for installing that equipment and we are arranging viewing, etc., over the Easter recess with a specific deadline in mind.  I do not think the Deputy sought in any way to question or doubt our bona fides in that regard.  I made the point that the Department have provided the money and it would be very unusual, to say the least, for the money not to be spent before the end of the year.  Deputy McCartan said he would accept a deadline of 12 or 18 months if a specific period was mentioned in the section.  That would be a very long deadline for legislation which is so urgently required and it is my intention &mdash; and that of the Government &mdash; to do far better than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter mentioned the availability of those facilities in other parts of the country.  Section 16 provides that where a request is made in relation to a trial being heard in some other part of the country it can be transferred to Dublin so that the people concerned can avail of the equipment.  Rome was not built in a day and it is intended to extend these facilities to all parts of the country.  At present all rape trials, to which this legislation is more relevant than to other cases, take place in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I understand the point Deputy Shatter made regarding the burden on people who have to travel from rural areas to the alien atmosphere of Dublin to give evidence.  It is our intention to ensure that that situation will pertain for as short a time as possible and I have already spoken to the Minister for Finance in this regard.  I asked him to ensure that the necessary finance would be made available next year to extend those facilities to other parts of the country &mdash; and to the whole country &mdash; as soon as possible. The Department have a deadline of early next year in relation to having the equipment installed and operating for courts in the south and west.  Part III of the legislation is contingent on the equipment being put into operation, the legislation can only come into operation when the equipment is installed and working. I want to avoid cases where a prosecution <Col N="1030" /> might fail because of the fact that we put in a deadline and, for some unknown reason, the equipment was not installed in time.  Of course, I will consider the points made by Deputies McCartan and Shatter although I cannot promise them anything.  I will examine particularly the arguments made in relation to the general principle of not having legislation which comes into operation by way of order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very fair in his reply and, clearly, has a very strong commitment to the legislation and what is involved.  I appreciate the extent to which he sought to reassure us in the House.  Nonetheless, there are difficulties, as Deputy Shatter indicated. Who knows from whom the legislation will emanate in future?  Will the Minister indicate whether his Department or officials have received any representations from the representative bodies to which I referred &mdash; or from any quarter, including the unions &mdash; indicating reservations about the principles or the workability of the legislation?  I have not received any representations from the wider public indicating reservations, if anything the reaction has been positive.  It is important to say that, lest at the eleventh hour unforeseen problems emerge.  On Report Stage will the Minister be prepared to table an amendment which names a specified date?  He suggested the first day of the Michaelmas term instead of a month by month basis which I advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan asked whether we had received representations from interested bodies in relation to their reservations regarding the effectiveness or workability of this legislation.  I am informed that we have not received any such representations.  Obviously all those representative bodies feel the same as Deputy McCartan.  They concur with his opinion that there should not be any difficulty in working the legislation.  Deputy McCartan also asked if we were prepared to insert a date on Report Stage, the question raised by the amendment.  As I already indicated to the House, I am <Col N="1031" /> prepared to consider the arguments made here today.  The points were well made, I will take them on board and consider them.  However, I have to bear in mind the very real difficulty that the implementation of Part III is contingent on the provision and operation of this equipment.</P>
      <P>I cannot say whether an amendment will be tabled on Report Stage but I will certainly consider the points made and discuss them with the draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his helpful and courteous response.  In the light of the response it is not my intention to press the amendment.  We will wait to see what happens on Report Stage.  In the context of the issue which Deputy McCartan raised, I am somewhat surprised that there has been no response to this Bill from people who have expertise in the area which the Bill addresses, practising lawyers and academics, which is regrettable.  As we tease out the Bill it will become apparent that there are various difficulties in relation to aspects of it.  Normally you can rely on some of the professional bodies to lobby Members of this House if their vested interests are affected and one would have expected a response to this technical and difficult Bill.  The Bill is well intended but, like any other Bill, it can be improved as we go through the legislative process.  Technical amendments are required and indeed the Minister has foreseen that amendments will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly would have expected those who practise in the criminal law area at the Bar and within the solicitors' profession to look at this Bill and to come back to the Department and to Members of this House in a constructive way to tease out some of the aspects which we will spend the rest of the day discussing.  The worst of all worlds would be to pass a Bill which because of a lack of technical examination by those who have to operate it outside the House, creates difficulties rather than resolving them. <Col N="1032" /> Deputy McCartan's query was worth while.  I suspect the reason that no one has come back to us on the Bill is not that everyone is hugely happy with the technicalities &mdash; although a great deal of the Bill is very welcome &mdash; but that nobody outside this House has got around to examining it in any detail.  That is not a criticism of the Minister or any Member of this House but it is regrettable that such an important Bill has not been fully examined.  Deputies have been wined and dined and have received a plethora of representations from the Law Society on the probate and conveyancing work being given to the banks under the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1991.</P>
    <P>I find it odd that the criminal law committee of the Law Society have not taken the time to examine this Bill.  Perhaps they will do that before Report Stage and that what we do in this House today will stimulate them to do that.  I am not suggesting that any individual group have any particular responsibility to do this in the context of the legislative process because that responsibility rests on the shoulders of Members of this House but I am taking the opportunity to point out that it is unusual that a Bill as important as this is apparently being universally ignored in its technical drafting and presentation. That does not mean that we should not try to improve the Bill as we proceed to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, for the same reasons that Deputy Shatter has outlined. Because the Minister has shown such positive intentions with regard to the legislation and its early implementation I am happy to withdraw my amendment. On Report Stage we will have the opportunity to review further the progress in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In defence of those wider interests outside this House, let me say that many of them have had the opportunity to contribute fully to the debate and the development of this legislation through <Col N="1033" /> the Law Reform Commission.  The Law Reform Commission had a great input into the principles, guidelines and concepts of the Bill as they convened a number of very important consultative conferences at which a very wide range of bodies and individuals attended &mdash; and the register lists the solicitors, barristers, social workers, gay and lesbian groups who contributed.  I hope that practice will continue under the incoming president.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (4), line 19, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than Part III (except sections 14, 15 (1) (b) and 17) and section 28)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to modify section 1 (4) which provides that the provisions of the Bill will not apply to criminal proceedings in stitutions before these provisions come into operation.  The object of the subsection is to ensure that an accused person could not be said to be prejudiced by any of the changes being made in the law of evidence after proceedings had been commenced against him and before the trial commenced. That is not to say that any of the proposed changes are prejudicial to the accused, having regard to the various safeguards that have been provided to ensure fairness in the trial procedures.  However, it seems to me on reconsideration that that approach is perhaps too cautious and that there is no justification for not applying the provisions of Part III to any existing proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions allow evidence to be given through a live television link by witnesses who are under 17 years or mentally handicapped.  I can see no reason that the benefit of this procedure should not be available to vulnerable witnesses immediately the video equipment has been installed, and I can see no possibility where it could give rise to any unfairness in so far as the accused is concerned. There are two exceptions to what I have <Col N="1034" /> said.  The first relates to the provision in section 15 (1) (b) allowing the admission in evidence of a video recording of an out-of-court interview with the alleged victim in a child abuse case.  The second exception is in section 17 which aims at avoiding the necessity for young or mentally handicapped witnesses to identify the accused again in court if they have identified him already during the investigation as being the offender.  In both these cases it is better not to disturb the present procedures and for those reasons I commend the amendment.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, an argument could be made that the provisions of Part III may shift the balance against the accused more than other provisions in the legislation which we are not putting into effect in the same way.  However, let me say the reason for moving this amendment is our concern for the victims and the witnesses.  We want the victims and witnesses to avail of these facilities at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points I wish to raise with the Minister &mdash; I think the answer is obvious but I wish to ensure that is the case &mdash; is that the procedures under the Bill will apply to crimes committed prior to the enactment of the Bill but in respect of which proceedings have not been instituted as well as to cases where the proceedings may have commenced but the trial has not taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Bill, as originally envisaged and as stated by the Law Reform Commission, which we all agree with in principle, is to try to take the pressure off the victim, for example in cases of alleged rape or sexual assault. However, we have to be careful to ensure that we do not do anything that may jeopardise the prosecution being successful. I agree in principle with what the Minister is proposing and I have no difficulty with the substance of the amendment, subject to certain amendments which I believe are necessary in Part III and which we will come to later. I would be concerned to ensure that if we accept this amendment it will not result in a trial taking place in which the new <Col N="1035" /> procedures are applied to proceedings instituted prior to the enactment of the Bill, where the accused is found guilty but on appeal, the Supreme Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the verdict of guilty on the technical legal basis that once proceedings have been instituted the Oireachtas cannot intervene by the enactment of legislation which affects either the substance of the issue on which the person had to face trial or the procedures applicable.</P>
    <P>Many Members will be familiar with the Sinn Féin funds case.  Following the institution of litigation many years ago the Oireachtas attempted to enact laws which directly changed the legal position and which in a sense sought to determine the matter at issue in the Sinn Féin funds case.  The Supreme Court held that that was unconstitutional and that the Oireachtas could not interpose a new legal situation in respect of proceedings that had already been instituted, because it was a derogation of the principle of the separation of powers built into the Constitution and that we could not interfere with the independence of the Judiciary in the judicial process.  That is a layman's paraphrasing of the consequences of the Sinn Féin funds case.</P>
    <P>My only question on this amendment is what constitutional advice the Minister has received on it, because if someone is found guilty, who should properly be found guilty, I do not see anyone wishing to see that person having their conviction set aside on a technicality.  We must provide as much protection to the victims as we can and not do anything that jeopardises the possibility of a conviction being properly obtained and sustained in the event of an appeal taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I should like to say I have no difficulty with the amendment and I support it.  I understand the concerns expressed by the Minister and Deputy Shatter in attempting to ensure we do not trespass into the general principle of not making our criminal law retroactive.  My understanding is that the provisions here deal with the way in <Col N="1036" /> which evidence can be presented as properly obtained.  It does not deal with changing the basic rule with regard to the nature of the offence, after the offence is alleged to have been committed, or it does not deal with the way in which a penalty can be imposed subsequent to a charge being laid and a conviction sought.  Because it deals with the procedures and technical ways in which evidence can be presented and the need to address the fundamental problem of ensuring that the victims' interests are respected in the legislation it is important that these provisions be brought in as a signal from us that this House is in earnest in addressing the intent of ensuring a better and more comfortable regime for witnesses when they are brought before the courts to give testimony.  Later in the debate I will be tabling an amendment to say that in general these principles and these ideas should not be confined simply to sexual offence cases.  I cannot see why, if the principle is good in practice in regard to a certain area of the criminal law, it should not be applicable to all areas of criminal law where witnesses can have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or, indeed, civil law, as Deputy Taylor said, and I agree with that.  The sooner we take away the aura and mystique of intimidation &mdash; which has been talked about for so long &mdash; which has been the experience of witnesses coming into our courts, and begin to address the needs of witnesses coming forward to give a truthful account of facts within their knowledge, the better.  For that reason I hope when the Minister comes to deal with the latter portion he will follow the principle, of which he is laying the seeds in this amendment, to its logical conclusion.  I hope he will avail of the opportunity, to provide that in time this principle will be applicable in all cases for witnesses coming before the courts, that witnesses are coming to a friendly, supportive venue where their cause can be heard in an accommodating atmosphere and that we end the attitude <Col N="1037" /> of saying they must be brought in in fear and trepidation into a hostile atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy enough with the Minister's amendment.  It is sufficiently reasonable and appropriate.  I do not think there need be any concern about challenging the Supreme Court or the High Court because the Bill is dealing purely with matters of evidence, changing the rules of evidence, broadening the admissibility of certain categories of evidence and procedures and so on.  The actual nature of the offence or the peril of an accused person is in no way affected by anything in the Bill.  I am not clear why the Minister has made an exception to sections 14, 15 (1) (b) and 17 and section 28.  They deal also with evidential matters but the Minister has apparently drawn a distinction between those sections and the rest of Part III.  I am curious to know how and why that arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their support for this amendment in the name of the Minister.  The point raised by Deputy Shatter has been discussed with the Attorney General who has cleared the amendment, nevertheless I can see the point he is raising.  What we are seeking to do by means of this amendment can be distinguished from the Sinn Féin funds case.  Nevertheless, I am glad Deputy Shatter raised the point as it gives me the opportunity to say because we are sensitive to potential constitutional difficulties, however remote they may be, we have decided to exclude section 15 (1) (b) and section 17.  My own personal understanding is that if we had included section 15 (1) (b) and section 17 we would still have no difficulties from a constitutional point of view.  Because the remote possibility of that happening was raised we have decided to exclude it to ensure that this legislation is invulnerable to constitutional challenge.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> In page 3, subsection (4), lines 20 and 21, after &ldquo;concerned.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The institution of proceedings shall be deemed to have occurred when a charge is laid or a summons is returned to court duly served in accordance with the law.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am moving this amendment because I want to take the opportunity to address the question that this legislation will change very fundamentally the requirements of proof needed in a criminal prosecution. In particular, I am mindful of the proviso in section 27 dealing with corroboration.  This Bill proposes to abolish the necessity that unsworn statements of a child must be accompanied by corroboration on the one hand and the sworn testimony of a child on the other and that a jury need not necessarily be warned of any difficulties about proceeding to a conviction on that testimony alone.  There are a large number of cases in existence that have been investigated by the Garda Síochána and which have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and he has recommended no prosectution.  I am aware the Director of Public Prosecutions office do not give reasons why no prosecution is taken.  Parents and people concerned who make the complaint, along with the young child, have gleaned that the difficulty has rested full square on this necessity for corroboration. One can argue with them as to what corroboration means.  That problem is now gone.  Corroboration is no longer a necessary prerequisite in the laying of a charge or the issuing of a summons for prosecution.  Once this legislation is passed section 27 takes effect.</P>
    <P>Consequently I want a clear message to go out from the Minister and this House today that once this legislation is in place it will be open to the Garda Síochána to reopen the file or files of particular cases they have been investigating and may have closed either on their own motion or on a direction from the Director of Public Prosecutions because of the difficulty with regard to corroboration. There cannot be any difficulty, where <Col N="1039" /> there is no injustice to be done by the lapse of time, or difficulties arising for other related issues that the Garda Síochána can now reinvestigate.  Complaints and statements which have come from harassed children of the appalling circumstances surrounding sexual interference, assault or rape can now be acted upon by the Garda Síochána in responsible circumstances.  That is an important message that must go out from this House.  There is no issue of retrospection in this regard.  This question will not affect the nature of the crime and does not interfere with the ultimate penalty that an accused can potentially be put at peril; it is simply redefining the necessary evidence to be produced in order to warrant the prosecution being launched and the necessary evidence to be acted upon by a jury in bringing in a conviction. The basic fundamental ingredients of the crime will remain the same so that there can be no difficulty.  I am saying that in the context of realising that the courts can in many instances have regard to the lapse of time that has occurred from the time the original allegations were made and the time the Garda have acted.</P>
    <P>It is almost an indelible and everyday feature of crimes of this kind that it can take a victim years to find the courage, the capacity or the emotional strength to admit let alone describe the horrible things which occurred at the hands of a parent, neighbour or so-called friend. Therefore, time is not a problem in dealing with offences of this kind.  That is the reason I want it made absolutely clear that when the Minister of State says that the Bill will not apply in cases where criminal proceedings have been instituted the institution of criminal proceedings does not involve the preliminary investigation carried out by the Garda Síochána in the course of their duties in response to a complaint.</P>
    <P>The reason I advance this amendment is that I want a clear message to be given that the Bill will not apply in cases where a charge has been laid, a summons has been issued and proceedings have been instituted.  I want it stated positively that <Col N="1040" /> the procedings, in the context of this legislation, do not include the preliminary investigation carried out by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>A former Minister and Minister of State met families who advanced the cause on behalf of their beleaguered child or children &mdash; this matter is dealt with in section 27 &mdash; that victims had encountered difficulties unfairly in relation to the rule relating to corroboration.  Given that this rule is now being removed it is important that in appropriate cases &mdash; I accept that, ultimately, it will be a matter for the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide &mdash; the parents who heretofore were told that no prosecution or charge could be laid due to the absence of corroboration, which is necessary, should be permitted to go back to the gardaí who carried out the investigation into the original complaint to ask them to reopen the file.  The essential message that should go to the parents of the unfortunate victims of crimes of this kind is that there is a possibility that their cases will be looked at afresh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that there is such a possibility because, as Deputies are aware, the provisions and procedures set out in this legislation can apply even where a crime had been committed before the commencement of this legislation if proceedings are instituted subsequent to this.  The Deputy's amendment seeks to define precisely the moment when criminal proceedings are deemed to be instituted for the purposes of section 1 (4) so that the provisions of the Bill will not be applied to them if they have been instituted before the relevant provisions come into operation.  The amendment defines that moment as the point when a charge is laid or a summons has been duly served and returned to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection, as it stands, does not attempt to define the moment when proceedings are deemed to be commenced but I have been advised that the moment when criminal proceedings are deemed to be instituted would be interpreted as the moment when the criminal process is <Col N="1041" /> set in motion, that is, when a warrant is issued for someone's arrest or a summons is issued or a person is arrested without a warrant provided he is subsequently charged.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan's device is valid. Even if the courts have interpreted &ldquo;the institution of criminal proceedings&rdquo; to mean something one can deem in legislation that it means something else for the purposes of the legislation.  The reason I have been advised that the courts will interpret the subsection, as it stands, in the way I have outlined is that meaning would be more favourable to an accused.</P>
    <P>I should point out to Deputy McCartan that the subsection concerned is a purely transitional provision.  The differences between the times specified in the amendment and those applicable according to the ordinary interpretation, as to when criminal proceedings are deemed to be instituted, are not substantial.  If we leave the subsection as it stands that interpretation, which I believe is the ordinary interpretation, would be more favourable to an accused and more in accordance with the principle of the subsection, which is, that in fairness an accused should not have the criminal procedure significantly changed after that procedure has begun whether or not that has been brought to his notice.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy McCartan.  Not only will the legislation change the ground rules in relation to corroboration it will also change the ground rules in relation to the way evidence may be given by certain people.  It is possible that the Garda Síochána, who have closed the file in a certain case and know the people who will give evidence, may take a different view in relation to the way that evidence might come across when the new procedures are put into operation.  It is a matter of choice as to whether we want to go along with this but, as I said, we want to be as fair as possible to an accused and wish to avoid the possibility that alleged victims will come forward although this is more apparent than real.  I will consider the points made by Deputy McCartan and <Col N="1042" /> discuss them with my officials between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  He has reminded me of the judicial interpretation of what is meant by the words &ldquo;when proceedings are initiated&rdquo;.  I accept what I have proposed would not be as favourable to an accused as the established proposition; in other words, currently proceedings are considered to be commenced when a warrant is issued, even though no charge may be laid, or when a summons is applied for even though it may not be served.</P>
      <P>When I practised in the courts the Garda Síochána, in a genuine attempt to intercede or deflate a highly charged and emotional atmosphere in relation to a case which involved a member of the immediate family or a neighbour, often laid a charge against an accused to start not only the criminal process rolling but other processes also involving social workers, the health boards, the probation and welfare service attached to the court and others.  They did so in the hope that it would progress to a trial, while recognising equally that in the interim period, once they submitted the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, he may direct, given the absence of corroboration, that there was not a strong prospect of a prosecution and that the charge should be withdrawn. In many instances, one may find, even though charges have been laid and a person has been placed on remand for a number of weeks, and perhaps months, by the District Court, that the charges are struck out and there is no prosecution due to the absence of corroboration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment does not address that scenario, but it is something the Minister might consider when he is reviewing this issue.  There is more to this proposition than mere transition, of merely accommodating the change-over from one set of rules to the next.  There is a vast number of cases in which parents have brought a child to the Garda station where the Garda have taken a statement in harrowing circumstances from the child and, with the medical evidence from <Col N="1043" /> the sexual assault unit of the Rotunda or elsewhere, submitted the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, but because there was no independent fact corroborating the statement of the victim as to the involvement of the suspect the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that there be no prosecution.</P>
    <P>What I am addressing here is the scenario where it is medically established beyond doubt that the child has been sexually interfered with &mdash; and it does not take a lot of investigation to establish that &mdash; and where there is also a clear account from the young person, boy or girl, as to who the perpetrator was.  Parents cannot understand why such a case could not be presented to a court up to this.  Many of them have gone away in anguish wondering what is this animal called corroboration.  Now it is gone and I have no doubt that many of those cases will present themselves back at the doorstep of our Garda Síochána for reinvestigation, and many of them will be cases in which charges were laid but struck out on the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions or on the decision of a senior Garda officer.  Those situations should be considered to see whether we can, on Report Stage, provide for such cases to be reinstituted on the basis that originally there was no prospect of a trial because of the corroboration rule.  That equally applied to cases where summonses were laid and withdrawn by the prosecution.  That must be investigated and I welcome the Minister's undertaking to do that.</P>
    <P>A second issue arises here.  We must ensure that the Garda Síochána understand the legislation and its import.  I was very alarmed recently when a Deputy in my own party, the Democratic Left, told me that he had been approached by the superintendent in his locality who was furious because the Garda Síochána could no longer detain persons for offences relating to malicious damage under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  I was curious that the superintendent should have this misunderstanding because during the debate <Col N="1044" /> on the Criminal Damages Bill I had moved an amendment to provide, as the Law Reform Commission recommended, that malicious damages charges would no longer be scheduled offences under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  This would have taken away from the Garda the power to detain young people for 48 hours for petty crime, something never envisaged by the original legislation.  That amendment was defeated and therefore malicious damage is still a scheduled offence.  A couple of days later I read an editorial in one of the Garda review magazines complaining that the Garda had lost this power of detention and that the Minister had not told them anything about it.  To this day I do not understand what happened that the Garda could not read a basic piece of legislation.  Some tell me that it is because their legal research department at head office has been closed and this is obviously taking its toll.  I do not know why the superintendent could not have got on to head office or to the Minister's office to ask for an explanation of what had been done, because it would have been a huge advancement in the malicious damages law generally.  There was a massive breakdown there.  I do not understand how it arose.  I have no doubt it has now been resolved.  I use that as an illustration because I do not want to see the same difficulty emerging in regard to the provision in this Bill.  I do not want to see people, whose previous cases were not prosecuted because there was no corroboration, being told by the Garda that the Act shall not apply to criminal proceedings instituted before the commencement of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already had representations from a family who, having read the Bill and brought a case back to the Garda Síochána, were told that the Act would be of no benefit to them, good, bad or indifferent, as it could not be applied retrospectively; this has already happened in a case where no case had ever been brought.  That is why I borrow from the illustration of the Criminal Damages Bill.  I want to ensure that clear indicators are given to the Garda Síochána of the <Col N="1045" /> import of this section.  Perhaps the Minister would circulate this section of our debate from the Dáil record to the Garda Síochána to inform them of the importance of this provision and, more important, the provisions of section 27 that from now on corroboration is no longer a standard of evidence required and that cases that were not brought to the stage of instituting proceedings can be reinvestigated where appropriate.  That must be clearly set out so that no sloppy or lazy Garda response can be given to the parents of any victim that they cannot reinvestigate the case because of this provision.  The Minister might consider drafting a memorandum to be circulated to the Garda Síochána setting out clearly exactly what is intended so that there is no ambiguity about this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's positive response.  I am happy that the point has been well taken by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at which criminal proceedings are instituted is something that warrants definition.  In civil law there is not much doubt about when a proceeding is instituted; it is when the summons is stamped or sealed in the High Court.  In criminal proceedings it is not quite as clear as that.  There is possibly an argument for saying that criminal proceedings are instituted when the prosecution makes up its mind that it will bring a proceeding.  For example, as I understand it, that is the point at which a potential accused person must be given a warning that he is not obliged to make a statement etc., even though no warrant or summons or anything of that nature may yet have been issued.  There are some doubts there.  It requires a great deal of care and there should be some definition included as to what is meant by the expression &ldquo;institution of criminal proceedings&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be happy with Deputy McCartan's amendment for a number of reasons.  I hear him saying he is not very happy with it himself.  Certainly so far as a summons is concerned, the commencement date would not be the point <Col N="1046" /> when it was before the court duly served but, at best, when it was issued, to give one instance of it.  Deputy McCartan was positing the scenario of a person who had been arrested, charged and remanded on a number of occasions and then, because there was no corroborating evidence had the charges against him struck out.  I would not be happy if that person could be rearrested on the passing of this Bill. That would be entirely wrong and might be unconstitutional.  It is not the Minister's intention that such a person should have to go through that process again because of the evidential changes introduced in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The broad intent of this section not to apply to criminal proceedings instituted before the commencement of this Act is valid but we should make clear exactly what we mean by that.  I suggest that what is critical is the point at which the prosecution decides to prosecute.  The curtain should come down at that point. Anything before that should not be reopened and anything beyond that should be caught by this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor makes the point that the institution of criminal proceedings needs to be defined.  The Deputy is unhappy with the definition suggested by Deputy McCartan.  Deputy McCartan is using the device of deeming, for the purposes of the legislation, that proceedings shall have been commenced from a certain time.  That is a valid point but I am not necessarily agreeing with the amendment.  Deputy Taylor feels that when the prosecutor makes up his mind to prosecute, the proceedings have been instituted but it would not be possible to ascertain as a matter of certainty the precise point when the official in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions made up his mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <P>I take the Deputy's point. I thought he had been suggesting that it was when a Garda had made up his mind. It would be acceptable to make the time of the warning an acceptable point. Deputy McCartan suggested that a memo on the meaning of this section should be circulated to Garda stations throughout the country.  I will ask my Department to consider the feasibility of that.  The fact of preliminary investigative work having taken place will not prevent the legislation applying.  This section applies only when proceedings have been instituted but that precise point has not been defined in the Bill and Deputy Taylor makes the point that it should.  I accept there may be a case for greater certainty.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that I will consider the points made by Deputy McCartan. Deputy McCartan suggested there are cases in which summonses are issued and are subsequently withdrawn.  I would have thought that in most cases when a summons is issued the procedure will inevitably proceed to the point that Deputy McCartan seeks to define, namely where proceedings commence.  I will have to look at how often summonses are issued and subsequently withdrawn. This seems to be a rather unusual procedure. I will consider the point made between now and Report Stage.</P>

I welcome the Minister's review of this matter for Report Stage and I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I tabled this amendment because it was suggested by the Law Reform Commission and I do not know why the Minister did not include it.  If the Minister has a good reason for not including it, I will listen to it.  The report on receiving of stolen property by the Law Reform Commission indicated that for the purposes of this section computer means any device for storing and processing information.

      <P>The amendment seeks to define the term &ldquo;computer&rdquo; in the context in which it occurs here.  The term occurred in the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo;. I am reluctant to tie down the term &ldquo;computer&rdquo; by defining it.  It has been the practice in other enactments, for instance the Data Protection Act, 1988 and the Criminal Damage Act, of last year not to define that term.  In those debates the view was taken that it would be undesirable to attempt any definition of the term computer because any definition was likely to be rendered inappropriate by technological advances. The suggested definition in the amendment does not add materially to the interpretation of the issue.  The word is used only once in the section in the context of the admissibility of documents which include a reproduction by means of a computer or other means.  For those reasons it is not appropriate to tie down this term to a definition.  The definitions suggested in the amendment will not help us to any significant extent.</P>

      <P>I have no firm views on this matter.  The Minister's response reminds me of a comment I made earlier on Second Stage on the quality of the contribution made by his senior Minister to Second Stage debate.  It would be helpful in Second Stage debates, where the Law Reform Commission make specific recommendations, if the Minister would explore some of those matters for us.  In this case, the Minister's Second Stage speech was simply an editing of the explanatory memorandum.  It gave no indication as to the thinking behind certain decisions.</P>
      <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission does not deal at any great length with the need for a definition of &ldquo;computer&rdquo;. I suppose a court can rely on a dictionary for a definition of a commonsense term in understanding legislation. However, the commission devised a specific wording and I should like to explore why they did so and whether we should have a specific definition in the interests of clarity.  This legislation has been heralded by those in the field as a cornerstone development in evidentiary laws.  It will be specifically geared to accommodate technology in the area of computers, videos and so on.  We must be clear about the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There seems to be an emphasis in the approach of the Law Reform Commission on clarifying each term as we meet it.  As there is no existing definition in the criminal law as to what constitutes a computer, I am concerned to see an advocate defending a person on a criminal charge objecting to the admissibility of certain documentation because it came from a word processor.</P>

      <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended a definition for the term &ldquo;computer&rdquo; but they did not go into great detail regarding the necessity for it Like the Government, the Law Reform Commission do not have a monopoly of wisdom.  It was felt that other legislation such as the Data Protection Act, 1988, and last year's Criminal Damage Act should not tie down the term &ldquo;computer&rdquo; by way of definition because such an approach might be too narrow in view of the possibility of technological advance. The concerns expressed by Deputy McCartan are well covered.  On reading the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo; I wonder whether it is necessary to include the term &ldquo;computer&rdquo; at all.  A document includes a reproduction in permanent legible form by a computer or other means.  It seems that &ldquo;other means&rdquo; covers all methods by which documents can be reproduced in permanent, legible form.</P>

      <P>Once it is included, it has specific importance and perhaps it deserves specific definition.  I do not disagree with the Minister's approach.  The whole emphasis of this legislation is on addressing the technological development of computers.  It is better to keep the reference rather than leave it out.  It is good to develop our definitional body of law on the basis of inclusion rather than exclusion.  The ethos of the legislation is to bring us forward to deal with the computerisation of records.  I should prefer definitions which include rather than exclude concepts.  I was prompted to table this amendment because the Law Reform Commission said we should include these definitions.</P>

    <P>The Law Reform Commission include in their report reference to a document in writing, whether produced by a computer or otherwise.  The Minister has transported part of that wording into subsection (2).  Because we are dealing with legislation specifically addressing the new technological environment and bringing our laws belatedly up to date, the Law Reform Commission's construction, if for not other reason than elegance, is better because it gives proper emphasis to the place of computerisation.</P>
    <P>The most often used laws of evidence are contained in Acts dating from the last century.  The dates 1884 and 1896 remind me of more important legislation in this area.  At that time all documents were produced in writing by hand.  Since then we have had typewritten documents.  We are now moving into legislation dealing specifically with computers.  I believe the construction of words used by the Law Reform Commission is preferable.  For that reason I advance this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about documents which are being made admissible by this legislation.  The term &ldquo;document&rdquo; is defined in an inclusive definition.  A document can be anything but it includes a reproduction in permanent legible form, by a computer or other means&mdash; including enlarging&mdash;of information in non-legible form.  This amendment seeks to redraft that definition in a way which would state that a document includes, in addition to a document in writing, a document produced by computer or otherwise.  The word &ldquo;document&rdquo; is sufficiently wide to include a document in writing.  The vast majority of documents will be in writing.  In his amendment, the Deputy seeks to admit in evidence a document in writing whether produced by a computer or otherwise.  Documents produced by a computer are covered in the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo;, that is a reproduction in permanent legible form, by a computer or other means, of information <Col N="1052" /> in non-legible form.  I take Deputy McCartan's point and that of the Law Reform Commission.  However, I do not believe that the amendment would be an addition to the section.  The point propounded by Deputy McCartan is already covered and what the Law Reform Commission want to achieve has been achieved already by the present drafting.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied with the word &ldquo;reproduction&rdquo; as opposed to the word &ldquo;production&rdquo; in subsection (1) (ii)? The Law Reform Commission, in their report, deal with this matter.  The traditional understanding of a document is something produced in writing.  A computer can produce a document by typescript or teleprinting.  I am concerned that subsection (2) as drafted deals with copies only.  The problem arises with provisions referring to copies or reproductions being available where the original documents cannot be located. The Law Reform Commission believe that a document can be produced in its original form not only in writing but also in computer printing.

      <P>I take the points made by Deputy McCartan that we include in the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>any disc, tape, sound track or other device in which sounds or other data (not being visual images) are embodied so as to be capable, (with or without the aid of some other equipment) of being reproduced therefrom, and (iv) any film, including microfilm, negative, tape or other device in which one or more visual images are embodied so as to be capable (as aforesaid) of being reproduced therefrom.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the Law Reform Commission, who do not insist that it is a matter of drafting &mdash; we follow exactly what they say &mdash; were consulted about the definition in this legislation and they were happier with the drafting in the legislation than with their own original drafting.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy McCartan proposes to add two further categories of articles to the list of those to be included in the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo;. As the Deputy knows, the term &ldquo;document&rdquo; in the Bill as it stands includes maps, plans, graphs, photographs, etc., and a reproduction in permanent legible form, by whatever means, of information in non-legible form.  The articles included in Deputy McCartan's amendment are articles which embody either sounds, for example, audio tapes, or visual images, for instance films or video tapes.  The existing definition covers the information in the articles mentioned.  The definition includes &ldquo;a reproduction in permanent legible form, by a computer or other means (including enlarging), of information in non-legible form&rdquo;.  For example, whatever is on an audio tape can be reproduced in transcript form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information in non-legible form is defined in the legislation as including information on microfilm, microfiche, magnetic tape or disc.  Of course, these are only examples, The definition is much wider, covering information reproduced from all the articles mentioned in the amendment.  The Bill is concerned only <Col N="1055" /> with documents that are in permanent legible form, whether they were originally compiled in that form or are reproductions of non-legible material.  Most of what Deputy McCartan is seeking to achieve is covered in the section.  As I have said, audio tapes, conversations on tape and so on can be reproduced, by the means stated in the legislation, in permanent legible form.  I take the point &mdash; before Deputy McCartan makes it &mdash; that a video film cannot be reproduced in permanent legible form.  I think the intention of the parliamentary draftsman is that as we are now allowing the admissability of certain documents and items that were not previously admissible we should confine that substantial extension of the law of evidence to documents that are or can be reproduced in permanent legible form.</P>

      <P>I might well be 100 per cent satisfied if the Minister agreed to include at the end of the definition of information in non-ligible form the words &ldquo;or other device&rdquo;.  The definition would then read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Information in non-legible form&rdquo; includes information on microfilm, microfiche, magnetic tape or disk or other device;</P>
      <P>The issue would then be covered entirely, As the Minister himself said technological information is advancing on a daily basis and there are changes in definition.  That seems to be the only wording not covered by the Law Reform Commission, who talk about any disk, tape, sound track, etc, or other device.  I consider that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;or other device&rdquo; in the definition would make everyone happy.  Would the Minister consider that for Report Stage?</P>

      <P>I shall certainly consider it, in deference to the points made by Deputy McCartan.  However, I would point out that the definition of information in non-legible form includes information on microfilm, microfiche, magnetic tape or disk.  That is not an <Col N="1056" /> exclusive definition.  To provide that the definition includes certain things then by the process of logic it can also include other things.  The definition can include information on any other device, which is what Deputy McCartan seeks to achieve in the amendment.  It might be better to include those words in the definition and I have no strong objection to doing that.  I shall consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 17, to delete &ldquo;excluding an attempt to commit any such offence&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;including any attempt, conspiracy or accessory to commit any such offence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment addresses the definition &ldquo;sexual offence&rdquo;.  I have no doubt that the Minister will eloquently explain his reasons for the provision &ldquo;excluding an attempt to commit any such offence&rdquo;.  In my rush to the Chamber this morning I left behind my copy of the criminal law rape amendment legislation that the House has dealt with.  I am absolutely certain, from memory, that any definition of a sexual offence in that legislation includes attempts to commit any such cognatable offence.  I do not know the reason for making this extraordinary provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significance is that when it comes to the operation of Part III, enabling the <Col N="1057" /> taking of evidence in criminal cases of a certain kind by television and other revolutionary devices designed to help make life easier for the victim and witness, the term &ldquo;sexual offence&rdquo; will have an unnecessarily restrictive definition.</P>
    <P>An attempt to commit a rape or a buggery can be as traumatic, harrowing and horrible for the victim as the actual full act.  I do not need to go into gruesome detail about the definition heretofore, under which prosecutions had to establish that penetration had taken place, and the attempts to establish how far the penile piece had progressed, for example, and whether one was dealing with the actual act itself or the attempt to commit the act.  There can often be little or no difference between the two and, as I have said, an attempt to commit some of those offences can be as harrowing and horrible as the actual act itself.  For that reason, the definition as drafted is unnecessarily restrictive.</P>
    <P>I have proposed that the words &ldquo;excluding an attempt to commit any such offence&rdquo; should be deleted and the words &ldquo;including any attempt, conspiracy or accessory to commit any such offence&rdquo; should be substituted in the definition.  My amendment would not include only an attempt to commit those offences.  I am saying that when the victims of people who conspire with others to set about those offences or people who are accessories &mdash; those who hold the coat, hold the victim down or in any way assist in the crime &mdash; come to give evidence against them in court that can be done in the circumstances provided in Part III.</P>
    <P>It may well be that there is an extraordinary good or clever drafting reason for framing the clause in the way it is and I await the Minister's response with curiosity.  I would be amazed if he purposely wanted to exclude all of those offences and I have no doubt that I have missed something in the provision and that the measures provided in Part III will apply to all attempts to commit offences as well as the substantive offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled amendment No. 10 merely to tease out the position.  I suspect that the amendment is not needed but I want to clarify the issue with the Minister.  I think that the definition of &ldquo;sexual offence&rdquo; in section 2 (1) in the context of section 11 (c) in Part III would cover the worries of both Deputy McCartan and myself about the definition. There are two different drafting approaches that could be taken when dealing with this issue.  There could have been a more extended definition of &ldquo;sexual offence&rdquo; in the definition section, which would include the various items in section 11 (c), or the definition could be dealt with in a somewhat more prolix and difficult way in the context of section 11 (c).  Unless I am misreading the Bill, it would appear that section 11 (c) addresses the issue but I was concerned about it and wanted confirmation of that, which is my reason for tabling an amendment to delete &ldquo;excluding&rdquo; an attempt to commit any such offence and to substitute the word &ldquo;including&rdquo;.  I do not intend to delay the House any longer on the matter as I wish to give the Minister an opportunity to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to allay the Deputies' fears in this regard.  Both amendments relate to the definition of &ldquo;sexual offence&rdquo;, which excludes an attempt to commit such an offence, and seek to restore the inclusion of such attempts.  That is very proper and it is something I completely agree with. However, the exclusion of attempts to commit those offences from the definition was made for purely drafting reasons, as Deputy Shatter anticipated. That is because some of the sections mentioned in the definition make it an offence to attempt to commit the relevant sexual offences whereas others do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To overcome this difficulty, without over-elaborate drafting, the draftsman, has excluded attempts from the definition here but has brought them back in the two sections in which there is reference to &ldquo;sexual offence&rdquo;, sections 11 and 21 (1) (b).  In both sections reference is made not only to attempts to commit a sexual <Col N="1059" /> offence but also to conspiring to commit, or of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or inciting the commission of those offences.  Therefore, the objective of both amendments is being achieved in the Bill as drafted.  Perhaps one reason Deputies may have misunderstood the position is that the explanatory memorandum should have made that clear but apparently did not for which I apologise to the House.  I take it that Deputies are happy that what they want to achieve is in fact included in the Bill as drafted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `statement' includes any oral or written utterance whether or not it is intended to be assertive and any conduct which is intended to be assertive;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must refer to the report of the Law Reform Commission in that I am including in my amendment a definition of &ldquo;statement&rdquo; they proposed in their recommendations on the concept of a &ldquo;statement&rdquo; as including any oral or written utterance whether or not it is intended to be assertive and any conduct which is intended to be assertive.  The amendment is self-explanatory in its wording and is based on a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission. They dealt with this matter exhaustively, in deference to their work, and I contend their ideas should be taken on board if for no other reason than simply to establish in some way the reasons the Minister believes his proposal <Col N="1060" /> would work better or why a recommendation of theirs need not necessarily be included in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The term Deputy McCartan seeks to define, namely &ldquo;statement&rdquo; occurs in several sections; sections 6 (4), 26 (2) and 28 (3) all refer to a person making a false statement whereas section 9 (c) refers to a person having made an inconsistent statement.  If Deputies will look at the context within which the term &ldquo;statement&rdquo; occurs, that is making a false statement, having made an inconsistent statement, it becomes fairly clear that, in the particular context, these can be assertive statements only.  However, I would make the point that the term &ldquo;statement&rdquo; appears also in section 15 (4) which provides that the reference in sections 15 (1) (b) to a statement made by a young, alleged victim of child abuse in the video recording of an interview includes &ldquo;any representation of fact, whether in words or otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it will be clear from that provision that both assertive and nonassertive representations of fact are covered if one looks at the wording, the surrounding circumstances and the context within which it appears.  I believe it is not necessary to define &ldquo;statement&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill since it occurs in two contexts, in the context of the sections and subsection to which I referred in the first part of my reply, where it seems clear that assertive statements only are covered and second, in section 15, where it is clear from the wording that both assertive and nonassertive statements are covered.</P>
      <P>From that point of view perhaps there is no need to define the actual term &ldquo;statement&rdquo; but if Deputy McCartan has anything more to say I am willing to listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply has been helpful and informative. However, clearly the context within which the Law Reform Commission dealt with this matter &mdash; perhaps I should have confined the application of my amendment specifically to section 15 &mdash; is <Col N="1061" /> deserving of more thought.  It is, I think, the first time in any of our criminal legislation we have endeavoured to define the concept of a &ldquo;statement&rdquo; as something other than a written document or oral statement taken from a person, catering for circumstances in which the physical response or reaction of a witness can be borrowed and used.  It is particularly important in the context of televising or video recording of interviews when it might be possible to suspect that while there was an oral answer also given, that does not come through from the transmission when a person might simply have given an indication, assertive or otherwise, on a video transmission of a response; when it could be possible that that could be defined or deemed to amount to a &ldquo;statement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is something requiring to be addressed specifically in the Bill by way of a positive definition.  Again, the Law Reform Commission spoke about a definition that is inclusive rather than exclusive, allowing for expansion.  In short I contend this is a new departure in criminal evidence, one which, while falling within the concept of the original purport of the legislation, in its own way is remarkably significant in that, in a criminal prosecution, we are giving the courts the right to attach evidential significance to the gestures or reactions, other than the oral response, of a witness when asked a question or when positing themselves on a television transmission in response to a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording in the Bill, as pointed out by the Minister, particularly in the context of the provisions of section 15, and the giving of evidence as constituting a reference to something said or otherwise obtained, warrants greater explanation. The <i>sui generis</i> principle of interpretation is one in respect of which a defence lawyer would argue that &ldquo;or otherwise obtained&rdquo; means that it must be linked in some way to the oral definition, something that is said or otherwise obtained.  It may be linked into that and, therefore, have a much more restrictive definition than the Minister originally intended.  For that reason the recommendation <Col N="1062" /> of the Law Reform Commission should be examined more closely because of its innovatory concept.  There is a clear division between seeking to define &ldquo;statement&rdquo; and what the Law Reform Commission suggest should be included in that definition, that it does not require something to be said or written, that it can be signalled or indicated by a person's physical reaction.  That is very significant and should be specifically provided for in the Bill particularly since we are talking about young witnesses endeavouring to relate an extremely traumatic event; indeed in the context of video recordings, on occasion, we allow the transmission of an interview between a victim and trained personnel when an anatomical doll is used.  All of this is very significant and requires a firm, clear legislative statement.  The proposition of the Law Reform Commission, which is an inclusive one, is very useful and helpful in this regard.  I ask the Minister to consider it afresh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the amendment in Deputy McCartan's name would be more valid were we talking about the scheme envisaged by the Law Reform Commission, to some extent, based on the United Kingdom legislation in that the scheme advocated by the Commission spoke of statements contained in a document relating to documentary evidence whereas, in this Bill, we use the terminology &ldquo;information contained in a document&rdquo; as including any non-assertive statements and documents.  Therefore, the term &ldquo;statement&rdquo; appears in the Bill only within the two contexts I have mentioned.  It appears to be clear what types of statements we are speaking about.</P>

      <P>The calculation of &ldquo;official&rdquo; estimates of county incomes would, however, have to be more soundly based.

      <Quest>his views on whether there is a danger that the fundamental issues of European Union relating to the major benefit to Ireland from our EC membership will be unclear to the general electorate due to the preoccupation with the Irish protocol; and if he will outline his plans to inform the public before a referendum on the Treaty is held.</Quest>

      <P>A referendum on the Treaty on European Union will be held as a necessary step in Ireland's ratification process.  Prior to the holding of a referendum, there will, of course, be a referendum campaign and the Government will explain the Treaty on European Union fully and comprehensively.  As part of their contribution to the debate, it is the Government's intention to publish a White Paper on the Treaty in the near future.  The White Paper will set out the detailed provisions of the Treaty, the implications for Ireland, and the reasons the Treaty on European Union will be of major benefit to Ireland and to the process of European integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people will be asked in this referendum to make a fundamental <Col N="1068" /> choice.  The issue will be clear to them. Do we wish to participate in the process of European integration to which we committed ourselves in 1972 and move forward together with our partners towards greater cohesion and prosperity, or do we wish to opt out of this process and isolate ourselves by our own choice? I have no doubt that when all the facts and arguments are presented and debated the Irish people will be fully aware of where their interests lie and will approve the referendum by an overwhelming majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  However, will he agree that the shambles in relation to the Maastricht Treaty has arisen as a direct result of the ineptitude of the Government and, indeed, the Minister's ineptitude at EC level to get the Ministers to agree an addendum to the protocol?  Is he aware, in view of the announcement which the Government made at lunch-time, that this Treaty is now likely to be voted against by a wide variety of people?  This applies particularly to women who are afraid they will not be allowed to travel. If the Treaty is adopted with the present protocol, is the Minister aware that women will not be allowed to receive information or have the right to appeal to the European Court?  What specific action will his Government take before the Maastricht Treaty referendum to ensure that people who wish to vote for it will be able to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's vehemence.  I would have thought that, in an approach to Maastricht, we would have continued on the path to consensus.  I am not in the business of allocating blame in relation to ineptitude but in the Government's approach, particularly on the wording of the addendum to the protocol, consensus was sought.  An announcment has already been made in relation to Maastricht and consensus will also be sought.  The Deputy must bear in mind that, from any point of view, the question of disentangling the Supreme Court decision on <Col N="1069" /> abortion on the one hand and Maastricht on the other is fundamental.  They are two very important issues and the Government see an all-party approach as fundamental to the future of Maastricht.</P>

      <P>This matter is of vital and fundamental interest to the people of this country.  Will the Minister tell the House what will become of the Treaty if it is not adopted by this country because of the confusion and misinformation which has been put out by the Government?  Can it be adopted by the other 11 countries? What, for example, will happen to the membership applications for countries such as Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway?  Where will the EC stand at that stage if this country is misled into voting against the Treaty by the Government?</P>

As I said, we seek to disentangle the two issues and I would have thought that the direction of the Deputy's question would not seek that achievement.  It is unfortunate that the Deputy is adopting such an attitude.  The Government are seeking to deal with Maastricht on its own, separate and apart from the protocol abortion issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 5 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The provisions on Common Foreign and Security Policy contained in Title V of the Maastricht Treaty are designed to strengthen the role of the European Union on foreign and security issues and enhance its capacity to participate in international affairs.</P>
      <P>The Title describes the objectives of the common foreign and security policy; it strengthens the procedures for &ldquo;systematic co-operation&rdquo; between the member states on international issues; it develops the concept of &ldquo;joint action&rdquo; by the European Union; it defines the scope of the activities of the union in the security field; and it establises the institutional procedures for the CFSP.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific articles mentioned by the Deputy, Article J3 of the Treaty deals with the procedures to be followed in deciding on joint action by the union on international questions.  The European Council will set out the general guidelines and the Council of Foreign Ministers will decide on the scope, objectives and duration of the joint action.  It should be noted that issues with defence implications are specifically excluded from the scope of joint action which will embrace diplomatic political and economic means.  An example of the kinds of issues that will be covered by joint action are the Community's attempts to resolve the Yugoslav crisis, which involve the establishment of a peace conference, negotiated ceasefires, and a monitor mission to oversee the ceasefires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article J4 deals with security matters. It defines the scope of the CFSP as including <Col N="1072" /> all questions related to security.  It makes clear the respective roles of the European Union and of the Western European Union on security and defence issues, and it provides for another intergovernmental conference in 1996 to consider the eventual framing of a common defence policy.  It also ensures that the specific character of Ireland's security and defence policies will not be prejudiced by decisions and actions of the union.  The question of the relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union has not been discussed in the Council of Ministers since the Maastricht European Council.</P>
    <P>Article J5 provides for representation by the union in international organisations and at international conferences. The Presidency will present the union's position at such meetings and speak on behalf of the union.  This of course, does not take from the right of member states to be represented in international organisations and conferences and to speak on questions arising.  This article also provides for the first time that member states which are members of the UN Security Council will concert and keep the other member states fully informed on issues before the Council.  The permanent members, France and the UK, will ensure the defence of the positions and interests of the union in the Security Council.</P>
    <P>Article J8 contains certain institutional provisions.  It provides that the European Council will define the principles and general guidelines for the CFSP, and that the Council of Foreign Ministers will take the decisions for defining and implementing the CFSP.  It provides for the general rule that the Council will act unanimously on CFSP questions.  And it gives to the Commission the same rights as member states to refer questions and make proposals to the Council.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the European Community Treaty to which the Deputy refers provides for the institutions of the Economic Community &mdash; that is the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors.  Although there is no <Col N="1073" /> direct relationship between this article and the separate provisions on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Council and the Commission and the Parliament all have specific responsibilities under the Common Foreign Policy Title which they exercise in accordance with that Title.  The Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors are not given specific roles in relation to the CFSP.</P>
    <P>I believe the European Union will have an important role to play in promoting world peace.  Indeed among the specific objectives contained in the new Treaty are the preservation of peace, the promotion of international co-operation, the development of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.  The Twelve have already been active in these areas as our initiatives on such questions as Yugoslavia and the Middle East, and at the UN on arms control show.  I believe that the new mechanisms of the CFSP together with the great changes in recent years in international life provide an unprecedented opportunity to achieve many of the goals that Ireland has sought in international affairs.  We will be pursuing these actively with our partners under the common foreign and security policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as unanimity is concerned the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; so the Deputy is correct.

    <P>Our present estimated expenditure on ODA in 1992 will amount to about 0.17 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The revised Programme for Government of October 1991 commits the Government to a planned programme of increases in Ireland's Official Development Assistance, 1992-94, so as to achieve a higher ODA-GNP contribution by the end of that period.  In addition we <Col N="1076" /> have a longstanding commitment to the UN target for expenditure on Official Development Assistance of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Clearly we are still well short of the UN target and I am anxious that we should make steady progress towards improving our performance.  The public have been very generous with their voluntary contributions to organisations helping in the Third World, and I believe that the Government should also be as generous as they can.</P>
    <P>The Government are very concerned about the serious situation in the Horn of Africa.  The problems caused by the drought in southern Africa are also very worrying.  It has been decided to make an immediate allocation of £300,000 from the disaster relief fund to help these two regions.</P>
    <P>The Government decision of December 1990 abolishing the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation with effect from the end of 1991 also provided for the establishment of an informal committee to advise on development aid policy.  I am at present considering how best to give effect to this aspect of the Government decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister for his reply and compliment him on his personal commitment in this area?  The Minister said the revised Programme for Government commits the Government to a planned programme of increases in Ireland's official development assistance from 1992-94.  Is he now going to fulfil that commitment by increasing the budget during 1992 by perhaps bringing in a Supplementary Estimate?  Official development aid has been reducing since 1986 and now stands at the lowest percentage rate of GNP in any of the European OECD countries.  I know the Minister would not like to preside over that record, but is he prepared to make more money available from his own budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The budgetary provisions in the Estimates have already been completed for 1992 and it really <Col N="1077" /> would be a matter for me to go to Cabinet with the Deputy's suggestion.  I certainly have no objection to doing that.  Like Members in this House, I believe it is unfortunate that the percentage of aid in terms of GNP has been reducing.</P>
      <P>It would be one of my main achievements as Minister for Foreign Affairs if I could ensure that was increased either this year or next year.  To be absolutely frank, however, I do not think it can be increased this year.</P>

      <P>While recognising the valuable role played by UN peace-keeping forces in various situations of conflict around the world, the Government are not persuaded that the deployment of a UN peace-keeping force in Northern Ireland would be a practical proposition in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the level of communal strife in Northern Ireland and the success of the UN peace-keeping force in Yugoslavia, would the Minister not consider that this question should be put to the Secretariat of the Anglo-Irish tier after the British election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the matter into perspective.  The Deputy's idea is not a particularly bad one, but the deployment of a United Nations force in Northern Ireland would, of course, require, first, the agreement of the United Nations, including that of the United Kingdom as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Second, the situation in Northern Ireland would call for a clear and well defined role for such a force which could not be expected either to impose a solution from outside or to act as an internal police force.  The Government believe that progress in relation to Northern Ireland can best be achieved through pursuing the process of political dialogue, to which all the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland are committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the use of UN peace-keeping forces in the North, and perhaps the withdrawal of British forces, would remove the suggestion that British forces very often favour the Unionist majority in that area?  Given the number of deaths which have occurred in the North of Ireland in the past 23 years, would he not consider that this proposal should be put to the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I share the Deputy's view in relation to the carnage in Northern Ireland.  Like him and his colleagues I condemn unreservedly the path of violence towards the achievement of political aims.  The Government consider the best road to progress in Northern Ireland is through the process of political dialogue including, we would hope, new political structures which can be agreed by all.  It will be a matter for the participants in that dialogue to agree on how any such structures should be supported or guaranteed.  This could obviously involve outside agencies such as the United Nations &mdash; as the Deputy mentioned &mdash; or the EC.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I would not wish to anticipate the outcome of such discussions at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the path to peace in the North of Ireland through democratic means and through dialogue is taking a very long time, 23 years, in which almost 4,000 people have been lowered into their graves?  Does he not think, given the tremendous success that has been achieved in Yugoslavia, the introduction of this peace-keeping force might indeed be welcomed by the British Government if put to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the United Nations approach in Yugoslavia appears to be reaching a successful conclusion and that there will be peace there sooner rather than later.  I share Deputy McGahon's sense of frustration and anger at the persistence and the futility of violence in Northern Ireland, but we need to strengthen our efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability.  My own belief is that the best way to achieve these objectives would be through the working structures of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and through imaginative and determined efforts to reach agreement in the round table talks process.  All I would ask is that the Deputy allow the Anglo-Irish Agreement to proceed apace, to give it an opportunity to continue to work after the British general election.  I do not wish to rule out or diminish the Deputy's suggestion in relation to the United Nations, but I would see that as being a long way down the road.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 18, 26, 29, 30, 32, 39, 40, 46, 51, 55, 58 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the commitment given in the Review of the Working of the Anglo-Irish Conference of 24 May 1989, considerable progress has been made in extending and deepening cross-Border economic co-operation.  For the purpose of advancing this process, it was agreed that Ministers with specialist responsibilities in the relevant sectoral areas would be invited to participate from time to time in meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following areas for co-operation have so far been discussed at meetings of <Col N="1082" /> the Conference, with the participation in each case of the responsible Ministers, North and South: Tourism and Transport (July 1990); Energy (October 1990); Environment (January 1991); Health (April 1991); Agriculture (September 1991); Education (October 1991); and North-South trade and the implications of the Single European Market for the island of Ireland (March 1992).</P>
    <P>These discussions have led to significantly enhanced co-operation in many areas.  In tourism, for instance, a programme including joint marketing projects and the sharing of customer services is being implemented jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourism Board.  In transport the most recent Conference registered progress on the proposal to upgrade the Dublin-Belfast rail link and both Governments hope to make an announcement on the matter in the near future.  In respect of energy, the discussions covered gas and electricity interconnection, and the March Conference noted with satisfaction the decision of British Gas to join with an Bord Gáis in a pipeline which will link Scotland with both parts of Ireland.  In the environment area views were exchanged on hazardous waste disposal, road improvements, and the management of water resources.  There were wide-ranging discussions in both the health and education fields.  As regards agriculture, a steering committee on cross-Border rural development has been established to carry forward North-South co-operation.  The most recent Conference, which I attended on 6 March, had a very useful discussion of North-South trade and the implications of the Single European Market for the island of Ireland.  We reviewed joint initiatives to expand North-South trade and promote economic co-operation, particularly in research, technology and innovation and the opening up of public sector markets. We agreed arrangments for officials to undertake further work to encourage cross-Border trade and economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Ireland and Northern Ireland Programme under INTERREG, the EC Programme <Col N="1083" /> for Border areas throughout the Community, is a further helpful initiative in promoting North-South economic co-operation in the five areas covered: tourism, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, human resource development, environmental protection and regional development.</P>
    <P>In addition to the work being carried out by the Governments or official agencies, I should like to note also the important contributions to North-South co-operation made by a number of independent agencies, notably the excellent work being done by the International Fund for Ireland, the joint North-South initiative of the CII/CBI (Confederation of Irish Industry/Confederation of British Industry [Northern Ireland]), and the work of a number of other professional and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the widening of the remit of the Anglo-Irish Conference in relation to economic and social issues and I intend to explore ways in which this area of the Conference's work can be expanded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and for the progress that has been made in forging links between North and South.  May I ask the Minister if there have been any discussions on the case being made for Northern Ireland from an economic point of view at EC level by a joint approach being made by both North and South? We have heard at times that the Northern Ireland part of this country suffers from the lack of Structural Funds.  I wonder whether an arrangement of that kind was discussed at any of the economic meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly a joint approach has and will continue to be discussed because it is in the interests of the totality of relationships on the one hand and in the interests of the whole island of Ireland on the other.  The Deputy's approach is not unreasonable and it will continue to be processed and monitored.</P>

Would he agree in relation to one body &mdash; the International Fund for Ireland &mdash; that after a slow start this body with moneys from America, the European Community, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and a number of other areas, have been doing very good work and their efforts ought to be encouraged?  I hope he will bring my remarks and other remarks to the attention of the Governments and agencies involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response was comprehensive and it is clear that there is co-operation at the top level, but is he aware that the findings of the surveys carried out, for example by the CII and chambers of commerce, suggest that if there was proper co-operation in the industrial sector on both parts of the island between 72,000 and 75,000 jobs could be created over a few years on the island as a whole?  Would he agree that while it is wonderful there is co-operation <Col N="1085" /> at the top tier we have difficulty with attitudes at the lower levels, in the industrial sector?  Unless the two Governments adopt a pro-active approach to try to change attitudes and make industrialists and business people see that it would be to their advantage to become involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While it has been acknowledged that I have given a comprehensive reply to the questions tabled by 12 Deputies I take the Deputy's point. He has referred to the lower levels, that is, the industrial structure.  The Government will do all they can to heighten awareness in relation to the opportunities that exist for organisations and companies both North and South.  For example, a north-west study has been carried out and the recommendations made from that study have been examined by the relevant Government Departments with a view to implementing them, where possible, through existing or new programmes.  As the Deputy said, there is scope to incorporate the study proposals in EC funded programmes, in particular INTERREG.  In other cases the most appropriate vehicle for follow-up action is the International Fund for Ireland to which Deputy Currie referred.  Therefore progress may be reported in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>While the Department have not kept a tally of the exact number of representations, I can confirm that considerable concern was expressed in other countries about the implications of the High Court injunction referred to by the Deputy.  Apart from extensive coverage in the international media, the Department and many of our missions abroad received representations on the matter and the issue was raised in parliament in countries such as the Netherlands and Australia and in the European Parliament.  The general tenor of the representations, abroad as in Ireland, was one of concern about the position of the victim and her family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The original publicity given to this case in a number of parliaments was based on misinformation and a misunderstanding of the relevance of the Supreme Court judgment.  The Government, through our embassies, have sought to counter what the Deputy described as bad publicity for the country and have been successful in doing so but, as I said, the reaction abroad is important and the Government take careful account of expressions of concern.  I have no doubt that the Government's immediate and sympathetic response to the situation the family found themselves in and the position taken by all the political parties to find a common approach in relation to the consequences of the Supreme Court judgment will be well understood and respected in other countries.</P>

      <P>The questions of security and defence were among the most difficult in the negotiations leading to the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty. The issues involved were outlined to the Dáil by the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs in several statements and debates in the House last year.  During the negotiations Ireland was called on to respond to various texts and proposals put forward by other member states.  Of course, the Government put forward <Col N="1088" /> their own ideas and drafts to meet Ireland's particular concerns.  One of these concerned the need to protect the specific character of Ireland's security and defence policies.</P>
      <P>In the weeks before the Maastricht European Council several member states came forward with new proposals which would have strengthened the draft treaty's provisions on security and defence in ways that were unacceptable to the Government.  The Government therefore thought it right to make clear their position in furtherance of the objective I have just mentioned.  This included an expressed preference for formulations contained in earlier drafts of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht European Council took up these issues and devoted some considerable time to them.  The outcome was a new text which is contained in Title V of the Maastricht Treaty.  In the event the Government's main objectives were achieved.  First, the Treaty upholds the distinction between security and defence drawn by Ireland in the negotiations. Security issues will be matters for the European Union.  Where these have defence implications a role for the Western European Union may arise.  Second, although the Treaty provides for a relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union they remain two separate organisations, established under separate treaties, and with separate responsibilities.  Third, the Treaty contains a clear statement that the policy of the union will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policies of certain member states.  This will ensure that the specific character of Ireland's security and defence policies outside the military alliances will not be prejudiced by actions or decisions of the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This outcome is entirely satisfactory to the Government and we have expressed no reservations on it.  The Government are satisfied that the outcome on the common foreign and security policy will protect Ireland's interest and will enable Ireland to play a full and valuable role in the development of the union's policies on all international issues.  For this reason <Col N="1089" /> and for the many broader considerations which will be set out in the White Paper, the Government will recommend acceptance of the Treaty in the forthcoming referendum.</P>

      <P>In thanking the Minister for his reply may I point out that the EC Presidency immediately prior to th Maastricht Summit circulated a document outlining the various objections of the various member states to aspects of the draft treaty at that stage and that the wording that the Irish Government appeared to be opposing, or certainly to have reservations about, on my reading of the current Treaty, was carried through into the new Treaty, specifically &ldquo;The Union shall respect the obligations upon certain member states under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with that policy&rdquo;.  The reference to the Western European Union being an integral part of the development of the European Union was also objected to by the Irish Government and is carried forward in the new Treaty.  Would the Minister not accept that at the very least there is a blurring of roles and responsibilities between the Western European Union, NATO and the European Union which it is sought to create and it is this blurring that is causing some concern in certain sections of Irish opinion as to the consequences of what is currently in the Treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Deputy's point.  Certainly the questions raised by him have caused some concern in the minds of people but there is no foundation whatever for those concerns. The key point in any negotiation is whether one achieves one's objectives, and we achieved ours.  The Treaty contains an explicit provision which will ensure that the common foreign and security policy will not prejudice the specific character of Ireland's security and defence policies.  Our traditional position outside military alliances is thus recognised and protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the reference to NATO, I must address that.  Eleven of our partners <Col N="1090" /> are members of NATO.  The reference to NATO in the Treaty is designed to cover their concerns.  What is important from Ireland's point of view is that balancing reference in the Treaty to the specific character of Ireland's security and defence policy.  Under this provision Ireland's position outside military alliances is clearly recognised.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of European Union.  When I was questioned before on this matter I addressed that issue.  For the record, the Western European Union is not an integral part of the European Union established by the Maastricht Treaty.  The European Union and the Western European Union remain two separate organisations established under separate treaties with separate though overlapping membership and with separate responsibilities.  Therefore I do not think the concerns are well founded, while appreciating that they were expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The extreme difficulties we have in regard to these matters arise primarily because of the lack of debate to date in relation to them and to some extent from the delay in publishing the Government White Paper on these issues.</P>
      <P>Let me draw the Minister's attention to the platform of the Western European Union which was adopted on 27 October 1987 which related to security interests where the members of the Western European Union made it clear that they sought to incorporate themselves into any European union which would emerge after that date and, indeed, confirmed their own commitment to maintaining a nuclear capacity in relation to defence of what they described at that time as Western Europe and the need also to defend the NATO alliance and the relationship with the United States.  We appear &mdash; and I will put it no stronger than that at this point &mdash; to be taking on board a theory of defence of a European Community based on a nuclear capacity which we have not yet had an opportunity to debate or to decide on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the Deputy.  It is important that the Maastricht Treaty debate now be addressed having regard to the Government statement earlier in the day.  It is important for the Deputy to read the words of the Treaty and this comes back to the point that really the debate has not yet been opened out.  The words themselves speak of the Western European Union as an integral part of the development of the European Union.  The Deputy will be aware that the Maastricht Treaty provides for a review of the common foreign and security policy in 1996, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy.  These future negotiations will need to take into account the situation at the time, including the possible enlargement of the Community and the progress that has been made, for example, within the CSCE in developing a co-operative approach to European security.  The outcome of any future negotiation would, as in the case of the recent intergovernmental conference, require unanimous agreement among the member states.</P>

      <P>I have indicated already to the political parties in this House that I will make available to them a full briefing and that process has begun.  I am not certain how many Deputies took up the offer, or whether the discussions have already taken place, but they are still on the table.  I would like to assure the House that if they feel these briefing sessions are not detailed enough, as distinct from giving an overall view of the Treaty, we can return to that and give whatever additional briefings are necessary.  I agree with the Deputy that a freefone line should be considered.  It is a matter that will be considered and will get my close attention.  As to providing a force of people to go around the country, my belief is that the political parties themselves, taking account of their own positions on Maastricht, will no doubt propagandise the Treaty in the most suitable light to achieve the end sought by the majority in this House, namely, the passage of the Maastricht Treaty.  Therefore, I am not certain that that idea is a runner.</P>

It is something for the future and not something that comes up in this Trreaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I addressed myself to in my response to Deputy De Rossa.  Of course, I agree that those people who would seek to confuse the issue and misinterpret the Treaty would suggest that Ireland would have a commitment to a common defence policy. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Deputy is correct.  The Treaty states as she says it does and we cannot put it any further.  One either accepts what it says or one does not accept it and tries to misinterpret it.</P>

As the Deputy is no doubt aware Ireland has been invited to take one of three positions in relation to Western European Union &mdash; to join, to stay outside or to become an observer.  Taking into account the fact that Ireland has already been an observer in the Western European Union in the context of Yugoslavia, to achieve what the Deputy has mentioned, it might be wise to seriously consider observer status within the Western European Union.</P>

      <P>It states that to be credible and effective, deterrence and defence must continue to be based on an adequate mix of nuclear and conventional forces, only the nuclear element of which can confront an aggressor with an unacceptable risk.  It is important to be conscious of the fact that there are concerns about that kind of commitment within the Western European Union of which we are now, at least on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, observers.  Does the Minister intend, through the process of negotiation in relation to Western European Union and any future developments, to ensure that that kind of <Col N="1095" /> commitment to nuclear deterrents will be eliminated from the Western European Union platform of defence tactics and strategy?</P>

      <Quest>if the Government consider that the present structure of the Security Council of the United Nations is satisfactory, particularly with regard to the permanent members which include three European States and which do not contain any Third World countries or states from the southern hemisphere; if he intends to bring forward any proposals for reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Cold War recedes into history, a new chapter has opened in the evolution of the United Nations.  The momentous changes in the international policital climate in recent years have transformed and revitalised the organisation, and in the process greatly enhanced the stature and role of the Security Council.  There has been an impressive renewal of confidence in the United Nations, as evidenced by the additional responsibilities conferred on the organisation by the member states and a significant increase in the number of member states, from 159 two years ago to 175 today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These developments have given rise to discussion on the desirability of revising the Charter so as to enable the United Nations to meet more effectively the challenges confronting the international <Col N="1096" /> community.  The suggestion has been made that the membership of the Security Council should be expanded by increasing both the permanent and nonpermanent seats to make it more representative and to allow for wider participation in its decision-making process.</P>
    <P>The Charter has proven itself to be a durable and flexible instrument.  It is worth nothing that the decisions of the Security Council over the past two years or so, which have greatly strengthened the organisation's capacity to maintain international peace and security, were all taken within the framework of the existing Charter.</P>
    <P>No organisational structures, of course, are immutable and a periodic review of the existing structures of the United Nations to ensure that it works as effectively as possible would be a useful undertaking.</P>
    <P>Any proposal to restructure the Security Council would however require an amendment of the Charter.  Any such amendment would require the support of two-thirds of the member states, including all five of the existing permanent members of the Security Council.  The reality is that the required degree of support for amending the Charter in that way has not yet emerged.</P>
    <P>A further important development to which I would draw attention was the meeting of the Security Council which took place for the first time ever at Head of State or Government level on 31 January this year.  The Council members decided on that occasion to invite the Secretary-General to submit his analysis and recommendations on ways of strengthening the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy, for peacemaking and peacekeeping.  Ireland and our EC partners intend to make a substantive contribution to the Secretary-General's report, which is to be available by 1 July.  It would be prudent to await that report before taking any decision on whether to bring forward proposals for reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The current position with regard to the Security Council <Col N="1097" /> is that there are only representatives on it from the northern hemisphere.  Three out of five on the Security Council are NATO members, three are European members and there are none from South America.  Will the Minister agree that there is a serious imbalance therefore with regard to how the Security Council might address crises that will arise and that, given the change in the political situation in the world, the likelihood is that the crises will arise in the future in the southern hemisphere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is saying that the Security Council does not represent the international community as a whole and does not fairly reflect the new realities.  It is not unreasonable to point out that existing institutional arrangements provide for representation on the Security Council from each of the five geographical regions into which the UN is for electoral purposes divided, namely Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Western Europe.  That has for long been the case, with the ten nonpermanent seats rotating on a two year cycle within each region.  Any proposal to alter the existing allocation of seats, so as to increase the number of permanent members would require amendment of the Charter.  It is unlikely that the necessary support for that exists at present.</P>

      <Quest>if, following the conclusion of the Salvadoran Peace Accord, the Government have any plans to assist in social and economic reconstruction in that country; if he will urge countries which previously provided generous military aid to the Salvadoran armed forces to divert the finance to humanitarian aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland, together with other members of the international community, welcomed the signing of the peace accord between the Salvadoran Government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.  These agreements represent a major and positive advance in a situation of armed conflict which has lasted for 12 years and resulted in the death of at least 80,000 people.</P>
      <P>Linked to the peace agreements is an extensive reconstruction programme for El Salvador aimed at addressing vital social objectives such as the reintegration of veterans into civilian life, the rehabilitation of displaced persons and repatriated refugees, the introduction of land reform, and improvements in the health and education systems.  The Salvadoran Government have appealed to the international community for assistance in the implementation of this programme.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with partners in the Community, is contributing to the social and economic reconstruction of El Salvador within the framework of the political and economic co-operation procedure which operates between the European Community and the countries of Central America.  Within this context the community has made provision for a contribution of 50 million ECUs to the reconstruction of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, under Ireland's Co-Financing <Col N="1100" /> Scheme with non-Governmental Organisations a grant of £30,000 was paid to Trócaire in 1991 for a community development programme in Segundo Montes, El Salvador.  Further applications for financial assistance for El Salvador under the 1992 scheme have been received and will be considered shortly.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the peace accords the army in El Salvador is to be scaled down.  In keeping with these accords the Government in El Salvador plan to reduce the army to half its present strength over the next 24 months.  This will involve the gradual demobilisation of large numbers of military personnel and their retraining for reintegration into the civilian community.  The focus is thus on assistance of a type which can help in the realisation of this and other aspects of the reconstruction programme.  I would hope that the international community will contribute as much as possible in this regard thus helping to consolidate peace in El Salvador and in the Central American region as a whole.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and the commitment made to humanitarian aid to El Salvador through the EC and the support for the Trócaire project.  Have any representations been made to the United States, for instance, which has over many years supplied vast amounts of aid in a military form to El Salvador, as to whether it intends to comply with its commitment that once the ceasefire is signed approximately $28 million will be given in humanitarian aid?  Is the Minister concerned that there are proposals by the United States to allocate $35 million this year for military aid to El Salvador and a further $40 million in 1993, given that the commitment in the ceasefire is to demilitarise El Salvador?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very reasonable question.  The total package for El Salvador before the US Congress is for $286 million, $246 million of which is for economic reconstruction.  The remaining $40 million is for subsistence aid for the <Col N="1101" /> El Salvadoran Army such as food, clothing and medicine.  The focus in El Salvador is now on aid of a type that can assist in the realisation of the reconstruction programme.  I would hope that all members of the international community would contribute as much as possible in this regard in order to consolidate peace in the region.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very serious question regarding military aid.  It is my understanding that US military aid of a non-subsistence nature for 1991-92 was amended following the signing of the peace accords and that the aid for which the approval of Congress is now being sought is primarily for subsistence supplies such as food and clothing.  The peace accord and the reconstruction programme offer an historic opportunity to bring peace and reconciliation to the people of El Salvador.  The focus is now on aid of the type which can assist in the implementation of the accords and the programme. I would hope that all members of the international community would provide assistance.  The Deputy has raised a serious issue and I have addressed the matter as best I can.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following: <Col N="1156" />&ldquo;`statement' includes any oral or written utterance whether or not it is intended to be assertive and any conduct which is intended to be assertive;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that the term &ldquo;statement&rdquo; appears in two contexts in the legislation and in each context it is obvious whether the statement is intended to be assertive or nonassertive. I said that Deputy McCartan may have in mind the UK legislation and the Law Reform Commission report, both of which refer to statements contained in documents.  There is no terminology such as &ldquo;statements contained in documents&rdquo; in this legislation.  Instead of the terminology &ldquo;statements contained in documents&rdquo; we have substituted the terminology &ldquo;information contained in documents&rdquo;, and from that point of view Deputy McCartan's amendment is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an item on which I will seek to divide the House, but there is need for a more expansive definition in the context of what the Law Reform Commission have proposed and in view of the entirely innovatory concept being introduced here.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about is enabling a person to make a response, by gesture, either directly in a court or by transmission on television.  That is very important, particularly in the context of traumatic prosecutions, as is the case with sexual offences.  The Law Reform Commission have advanced specific wording, which I have sought to include by way of amendment, to expand the definition of the word &ldquo;statement&rdquo;.  For the purposes of the legislation this can also apply in the context of sections 6, 26, 28 and 29, but it will be specifically of value in the context of section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister places emphasis on the concept of information emanating from a statement.  I do not know whether that gets to the nub of the problem.  Statement, by definition, be it through common sense, dictionary or parsing of <Col N="1157" /> the word, is delivered in writing or by word of mouth.  We propose to expand that concept to meet with circumstances that can arise in the context of the nature of the proceedings and the way in which the proceedings will be conducted by including a gesture, a signal or a physical reaction as being capable of being interpreted as a &ldquo;statement&rdquo;.  In the context of penal legislation where exactitude is required and inevitably copious argument and counter-argument will be put forward about what was intended in the legislation, it is essential that there be a very succinct definition of the concept of &ldquo;statement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that paragraph (iv) adequately addresses the issue which is innovatory, almost revolutionary in some respects, and is new in concept in criminal law.  Since criminal law demands clarity I would ask the Minister to reflect again on the proposal of the Law Reform Commission. My amendment would not take from the purpose of the legislation or from what the Minister is seeking to do. It would add an element of clarity where perhaps, as the Minister has said, it is not necessary.  If it is not necessary, it will cause no harm and if it is necessary, it should be accepted.  I suggest that before Report Stage the Minister consider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amount of good sense in the proposal put forward by Deputy McCartan, in that if videos are viewed in the context of a distressed child who has been subjected to a sexual assault, not merely what is said during the course of an interview but obviously the general appearance of the young person concerned will be viewed.  It would be serious if in presenting the video in a legal argument it was suggested that a jury should be able to hear the sound but should not be able to see the gestures or the reactions and, therefore, should not be able to draw conclusions from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are dangers in this proposal also. Deputy McCartan referred earlier to the fact that anatomical dolls may be used in some interviews that take place in this <Col N="1158" /> regard.  I have tabled an amendment to deal with that issue and I do not want to pre-empt what I am going to say on that amendment.  However, the manner in which anatomical dolls have been used in Great Britain and elsewhere as part of an interviewing technique to determine whether or not a young person has been sexually abused has given rise to substantial public controversy and concern. Great concern has been expressed that a child, by simply handling what is known as an anatomically correct doll in a particular way, can indicate whether they have been subjected to some form of abuse.  On Second Stage I said that if either of my two children, or indeed any other child I know, was given a naked anatomical doll with all parts in place I would not like to bet too much money as to which part of the doll would be grabbed to lift it up and play with it, and I would not like anyone to reach a conclusion on that basis.</P>
    <P>To take the other side of Deputy McCartan's case on his matter, I would be concerned that a jury, untrained in dealing with these areas, might draw entirely incorrect conclusions from the manner in which a child briefly played with an anatomically correct doll.  If an interview is video-recorded and is displayed to a jury in a criminal trial, there are two components to be considered. The jury should see what takes place and hear the response or statements made but they should not be expected to draw conclusions from gestures of play from which they are not qualified to draw conclusions. The only people who could properly give some guidance to a jury as to conclusions to be drawn would be qualified child psychiatrists or child psychologists, whose word should not be a final but who, if they had a degree of professional training in these areas, would be able to indicate what conclusions could be drawn from what was observed by everybody, and what were and what were not reasonable conclusions. I am merely raising that issue now and intend to go into it in substantially more detail later on.  I raise the issue to point out that just as people may <Col N="1159" /> draw conclusions from gestures and play in the context of the appalling offences we are talking about, sexual offences and particularly those against children, there is a possibility that people who do not have specialised training could draw very wrong and dangerous conclusions from observing certain events.  There are two sides to the coin and there are worries in this area.  Those concerns will be teased out in more detail in the debate on Part III.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McCartan's amendment, I suggest to the Minister &mdash; if it is not taking too great a liberty to make this suggestion in that it seems to be what Deputy McCartan himself is saying &mdash; that he might perhaps give consideration to the statements that have been made about the amendment.  Issues of direct relevance to this amendment can be further teased out in the debate on Part III and perhaps we will also return to the matter on Report Stage, when we all may have thought further on the definition and its implications.  The provision should be considered not merely in isolation as a definition within a definition section of the Bill but also in the overall context of its implications, particularly in relation to Part III as framed at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that Deputy Shatter has tabled amendment No. 40, relating to the video-recording of interviews in which anatomical dolls were used as an aid by the interviewer, and that will be dealt with in some detail when we come to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understood Deputy Shatter correctly, part of what he said made a case against acceptance of Deputy McCartan's amendment.  Deputy McCartan's amendment seeks to include the definition of &ldquo;statement&rdquo;, including any oral or written utterance whether or not it is intended to be assertive and any conduct which is intended to be assertive.  Section 15 (4) defines the term &ldquo;statement&rdquo; as including any representation of fact, whether in words or otherwise.  It seems <Col N="1160" /> to me that that definition would include non-assertive statements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point. It is possible that the definition does not include conduct.  Whether or not conduct should be admissible is a matter of debate.  From what Deputy Shatter said, I take it that he would not feel happy if conduct were admissible in particular circumstances.  Perhaps conduct could be admissible to some extent.  I shall bear in mind what Deputy McCartan has said and I shall consider the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (3), line 25, before &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;criminal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is purely a drafting amendment.  The amendment inserts the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; in section 2 (3).  As presently drafted, section 2 (3) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where in any proceedings the age of a person at any time is material for the purposes of any provision of this Act, his age at that time shall for the purposes of that provision be deemed, unless the contrary is proved, to be or to have been that which appears to the <Col N="1161" /> court to be or to have been his age at that time.</P>
    <P>In other words, the court is entitled to make an assumption about the person's age.  Amendment No. 12 simply seeks to insert the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; because it is only criminal proceedings that can be instituted for the purposes of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister has seen fit to introduce this amendment highlights the thrust of my objective in the amendments that I had tabled but were ruled out of order.  Following the adoption of the Bill we will be left with a very strange position.  Normally, the position is that the strength of evidence required in a criminal matter is of a much higher degree than that required in a civil matter.  The Bill frees up and introduces new elements in the laws of evidence.  It introdues new methods of proofs and new positions that would have been ruled out as insufficient under the law as it stood hitherto, and rightly so, as that is required.  However, unless something is done very quickly, we will be left with the ridiculous position that a higher standard of proof and a higher burden of proof will be required in civil proceedings than in criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>I do not know why it was not considered possible to introduce an evidence Bill to allow the new concepts of proof and evidence &mdash; video-recordings and television links for witnesses and so on &mdash; for civil cases.  For the life of me, I do not understand why they could not have been provided for civil cases very simply and appropriately in this Bill.  If a witness who is young or mentally handicapped may give evidence in a criminal case through a television link, why should the same facility not be accorded a similar witness in a civil case?  Would the Minister say whether there is to be a comparable Bill to cover the position of civil proceedings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A slip crept into section 2 (3), which is corrected by this amendment, an amendment we accept.  After the disposal of criminal proceedings initiated on behalf <Col N="1162" /> of an injured child who had been abused it might be desired to bring civil proceedings for damages against the person who assaulted the child.  That would be perfectly in order, an action for damages in tort.</P>
    <P>However, the degree of evidence required to establish that civil claim for damages would probably not be obtainable as the law stands at present because the new measures, such as video-recordings and television links, being introduced in this Bill for criminal proceedings are not open for civil proceedings.  We would be reduced to the ridiculous position whereby the prosecution would be in order and would stand under the new evidential provisions introduced by the Bill but the claim for damages on behalf of the unfortunate assaulted child would fail before it got under way because the new evidential measures would not be appropriate.  For example, the provision in section 2 (3) relating to proof of age is a new matter in the law of evidence.  Until now the court would not have been able to deem someone to be any particular age.  With the enactment of this legislation the courts will now be able to do that in criminal proceedings but will not be able to do that in the mirror image position of civil proceedings.  Why should that be the position?  There is no rhyme or reason to it.  If the Minister can tell the House that it is intended to introduce a measure to update the laws of civil evidence that would be a very welcome announcement.  I look forward to the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I must compliment Deputy Taylor on his ingenuity.  He had tabled an amendment to this effect this morning which was ruled out of order but he has managed to get in his spoke anyway, with which I will not quibble.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Taylor but this Bill would not be an appropriate vehicle for such an extension.  The Law Reform Commission published a report on the rule against hearsay in civil cases in 1988, recommending extensive changes in that rule.  It would be desirable to incorporate <Col N="1163" /> their recommendations in that respect in a separate Bill.  My view is that it would perhaps have been illogical to have proceeded, first, with amendments to the law of evidence in civil cases and then tackle the criminal law.  As Deputy Taylor rightly points out, the standard of proof required in criminal cases is much higher, requiring that conviction be sustained only on the basis of undoubted reliability. However, the recommendations on admissibility of business records in criminal proceedings were made first in the report of the Law Reform Commission on stolen property as being required as a matter of urgency.  When this Bill is enacted the way will be clear to proceed with updating the law in civil cases in accordance with the commission's proposals.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3), line 26, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any other Act involved in a criminal prosecution&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not seeking to be unduly clever in suggesting that this amendment be discussed in the context of the previous one; it struck me that they were closely related.  The reason I suggest that there be inserted after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or any other Act involved in a criminal prosecution&rdquo; is that the issue of age and proof of age, as a matter of practice, is not confined to the provisions of this Bill once passed.  The issue of age arises particularly when dealing with juvenile offenders in the context of penalty and, once a conviction is entered, how their case is to be disposed of.  From years of practice in the courts in Dublin my experience has been that very often defendants have an opportunity to play ducks and drakes with the court, to make great hay out of the inability of the Garda, or of the court, to obtain a birth certificate in regard to a particular defendant.  I do not want to suggest I am singling out any one sector or minority <Col N="1164" /> within our community but there was a particular minority group who made better hay and more play out of this provision than any other group.  Nonetheless, that practice was not confined by any means to that minority group.  The difficulty is that, in an area of the law that stipulates age limits, beginning, remarkably, in our law at seven years of age &mdash; in that a person becomes a criminal at the age of seven according to our enlightened Christian legislation in this area &mdash; different penalties can be visited in terms of to where an offender can be remanded and, once sentenced, where they can be committed &mdash; remanded in the first instance and after conviction, committed, which is dependent on their age, whether the defendant has reached the age of 14, 15 or 17 has a particular impact depending on the defendants sex.  For that reason I have often observed people being able to avoid the due process of the law simply because they were able to conceal their true age from the court because a garda might not have got the proper name, proper antecedence particulars, or whatever, to be able to produce a satisfactory record of birth from the register.</P>
    <P>For that reason I was suggesting that we add in the words &ldquo;or any other Act involved in a criminal prosecution&rdquo; which would expand the application of the provisions of this Bill beyond those provisions to that other area.  Rather than introduce a litany of specific Acts I was recommending the insertion of the words &ldquo;or any other Act involved in a criminal prosecution&rdquo;.  This would mean that in any case involving criminal evidence and criminal prosecution where the issue of the age of the accused was in doubt, a court should be allowed, for the purposes of the prosecution, to assume a defendant's age.  Obviously any such assumption would have to be based on firm grounds. One could not make an arbitrary or wistful assumption and it would have to be based on something that would enable the judge or court to reach a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt.  I contend that can and should be done, hence my suggested wording.  I do not see the difficulty. If the principle is good enough <Col N="1165" /> for the purposes of the Bill before us, once passed, I contend it should be applied on the broad, general basis when dealing with the prosecution of offences in the criminal courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some interest to what Deputy McCartan said. I should point out that section 2 (3) provides essentially that a judge may make an assumption as to age in certain cases. Of course, Deputy McCartan is quite right in saying that a judge cannot make an arbitrary or wistful assumption &mdash; to use his words &mdash; for instance, if the issue is whether or not a person is aged under 17.  If a person obviously is one, ten or 11 years of age a judge can make the appropriate assumption.</P>
      <P>The effect of Deputy McCartan's amendment would be to extend generally the provision in section 2 (3) so that at any particular time a person's age is deemed, until the contrary is proved, to be that which appears to the court to have been his or her age at that time.  Deputy McCartan wants to extend that provision from prosecutions for offences under the provisions of this Bill to criminal prosecutions generally, constituting quite an extension of this provision.  I can understand what Deputy McCartan is contending, that it does not seem logical to confine this innovation to this Bill, that perhaps it should be extended more widely.</P>
      <P>If his amendment was accepted I would have to make one minor point about it, which is this, in its present form, it would appear as part of section 2 (3) which is merely an interpretative provision.  It would have to be inserted in Part V of the Bill as a substantive provision because it would involve a very substantive change in criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to what Deputy McCartan said.  I will have to consult with my departmental officials further to ascertain what would be the implications of the extension Deputy McCartan proposes, that is, to other criminal statutes, and also to ascertain whether there are some particular parts of the criminal law to which it would not be appropriate to <Col N="1166" /> have this provision applied.  I give the Deputy a commitment to undertake that consultation.  If we consider we can insert it, if there is good reason for so doing, or good reason why this innovation should not be confined to offences covered under the provisions of this Bill only, since, as I have said, if it is ascertained that some criminal statutes should be subjected to this provision, I give the Deputy a commitment to consult about it to ascertain whether something can be done along those lines because, from a general point of view, it is a logical proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy McCartan's amendment.  As the Minister rightly says, it would represent an extension of what is provided for in the Bill but it is hard to understand why that extension should not be given effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us covers two distinct categories of cases.  For example, the narrow category of sex-type cases in respect of which special provisions are being introduced with regard to video-recordings, television links and so on. But that is one aspect of this Bill only. There is another very distinct aspect, that is dealing with admission of documents and a general extension of evidential provisions, quite distinct and separate altogether from the sexual offence aspect. Those general, new evidential provisions, for example, dealing with documents, are not confined to sexual offences but apply across the broad spectrum of the criminal law, to a prosecution under any Act.  Part II of the Bill &mdash; Admissibility of Documentary Evidence &mdash; applies, I think, to a prosecution for any crime, that is as I read it, and is not confined solely to sexual offences.  It is not as though the entirety of this Bill is confined to its effect on prosecutions of a sexual type since a major part of the Bill provides for relaxation, across the whole spectrum of the criminal law, of rules of evidence now being regarded as too tight and severe.  Therefore, why should we take this new evidential relaxation, namely, giving power to the court to presume age, and confine it to the sexual offences category only?  Why <Col N="1167" /> should we not do with it what is being done in the sections dealing with, for example, the admissibility of documentary evidence, and apply it across the broad spectrum of the criminal law?  I agree with Deputy McCartan's amendment and I welcome the obvious sympathy shown for it by the Minister in his reply.  So far as I can see there appears to be no logic in the restriction.  It is a very good and worthwhile amendment and I ask the Minister to consider it seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Taylor for his support for my amendment.  He probably puts the case far better than I could.  I thank the Minister for his response.  It may well be that my amendment is far too broad and sweeping in proposing that this provision should apply to any criminal prosecution.  In view of the resources available to the Minister and his research officers it may well be that the proposal in my amendment may not be appropriate in certain circumstances as it may well impinge upon the ingredients of a crime.  This point can be looked at.  However, I am not abandoning the point by any means. I also take the point that the amendment is more appropriate to Part V.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a contradiction which I see emerging under this section.  This is why I believe it is imperative for the Minister to look again at my amendment. Section 2 (3) provides that for the purposes of any provision in the Bill the court can assume the age of an accused in any criminal proceedings.  I want to give as an example the case of an accused in the dock.  He may be charged &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; because invariably it will affect a male defendant&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not necessarily be the accused; it could be the witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not have to be the accused.  I am merely giving an example to show how a basic contradiction could arise.  A court may make an assumption for the purposes of the <Col N="1168" /> working of the Bill that the accused in the dock is 17 years of age.  When he is subsequently convicted the question of penalty will arise.  As the law stands, the court will not be able to assume or make a presumption on how to deal with the accused, for example, whether he should be sent to St. Patrick's, a reformatory or correction school.  The court can make an assumption as to the age of the accused for part of the proceedings but cannot do so in another part of the proceedings.  We seem to be asking the court to deal with a provision which is approaching a nonsense. If the principle is good in part we should seek to apply it in general terms to the criminal law system so that incongruous contradictions cannot emerge in the prosecution of particular cases.  The example I have given is particularly peculiar and narrow but, as we unfortunately know from recent incidents, it is often the peculiar and narrow which can draw the law down around our ears.  For this reason I believe the Minister should look at my amendment a bit more closely between now and Report Stage.  If he agrees to do this I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I think that the law is probably unintentionally as Deputy McCartan would want to have it.  I suspect &mdash; I am using my intuition here &mdash; that the parliamentary draftsman intended to confine this provision to offences which enable witnesses to give evidence through video links.  Deputy Taylor made a very good point in this regard.  I take his point.  Section 2 (3) refers to &ldquo;any provision of this Act&rdquo;.  The provisions of this Bill relating to the admission of documentary evidence can, of course, cover any type of criminal prosecution. Under the Bill documentary evidence which meets the criteria set out in the Bill can be admitted to establish any type of offence.  Deputy McCartan has drawn our attention to this point in his amendment. I agree that this point needs consideration and I will look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 5, paragraph (a), line 8, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall include any record of the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages as established&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to address the Waterford case.  As I said on Second Stage, I do not see anything in the legislation, as drafted, which would clearly address that case or aspects of it.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle referred to this case in a much wider way on the Adjournment.  He referred to the bewilderment, dismay and anger felt by many people at the way in which that case progressed and was ultimately disposed of.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to what happened in that case.  A father was charged with multifarious offences of unlawful carnal knowledge with a child under a certain age.  When it came to proving parenthood, the birth certificate was not sufficient to prove that the person in the dock was the natural father of the complainant. In the absence of the testimony of the mother of the child the case did not succeed.</P>
      <P>We were told by the Minister on Second Stage that this Bill was specifically designed to deal with the Waterford case.  I looked through the Bill to see how I would be of help in that case.  The provisions in section 4 and Part II seem to be the only provisions which would offer any hope to the victim of this crime. Under this section, proof of evidence or fact will be by document generally.  It provides in a general way for an exception to the hearsay rule in regard to the presentation of fact and evidence in criminal trials.</P>

      <P>Like me, Deputy Taylor sees little or nothing in the Bill which would specifically address the difficulties which arose in the Waterford case.  In his reply to Second Stage debate the Minister took on board the point raised by other Deputies and myself. Amendment No. 20, which has been tabled by Deputy Shatter, may address the issue in a more comprehensive way. Under section 4 (a) any person or body remunerated or financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas may be regarded as a business. The Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages would come under that subparagraph and, for the purpose of this legislation, it could be construed as a business.  The rules to be provided in the subsequent sections would stand in regard to the production of the records of that register as proof of their content, having been compiled in the ordinary course of business proceedings.  In my amendment No. 14, on behalf of the Democratic Left Party, I attempted to address that matter specifically by ensuring that in subparagraph (a) we would add the words, &ldquo;and shall include any records of the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages as established&rdquo; to put it beyond doubt that the records of that organisation would be covered by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling result of the Waterford case deserves this type of amendment. Even if my amendment is accepted it does not adequately address the problem and I am open to better suggestions. Before we leave the Criminal Evidence Bill, which is designed to deal with fundamental areas of reform of the law, I want to ensure that we have copperfastened this issue so that what has been generally considered by the public &mdash; and very well articulated by you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in the House &mdash; as a ridiculous result of the preposterous prosecution will not be repeated in similar circumstances when this Bill has been passed.  We will not get a chance to do <Col N="1171" /> this in the general area of criminal evidence for a long time to come or to refer to these issues.  If my amendment is not adequate &mdash; I will accept the advice of the Minister of State in this regard &mdash; I should like to hear a better view.  I should like the Minister of State to give an undertaking that it will be addressed and that these matters will be put right as far as criminal evidence is concerned in those cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy McCartan for trying to address the Waterford case in his amendment.  The case certainly upset many people and it has not been addressed elsewhere in this Bill.  It is essential to take the opportunity now offered to address it.  Amendment No. 20, tabled by Fine Gael, is the correct and proper way to address the Waterford case.  I wonder what the Minister has in mind because we must address that problem.  Does he envisage bringing forward a new Bill in regard to children or amending the 1908 Act?  I hope we will have an opportunity this evening of discussing amendment No. 20, the following amendments and Part III of the Bill.  By the time we have finished debating the Bill I hope we will have plugged a loophole because people were very upset by this case and are interested in seeing that child abuse is properly dealt with under the law.</P>
      <P>I am not totally happy that amendment No. 14 would plug the loopholes.  I hope that amendment will be accepted because it fulfils all the requirements, at least in regard to the Waterford case.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister will say in regard to that amendment before I make up my mind in relation to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan is correct in saying that on Second Stage I indicated my intention that the law would be changed in this legislation to ensure that if a similar case to the Waterford one arose, a conviction would result.  Of course, one can never be absolutely sure about matters of this kind.  Many people <Col N="1172" /> were unhappy with the recent Supreme Court decision in regard to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.  It is impossible to foresee how the courts will interpret the law but we must do the best we can in this House.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the Waterford case is that the child's mother, for one reason or another, did not appear as a witness.  The prosecution sought to place in evidence the birth certificate to prove paternity but that was not acceptable because the court felt it constituted hearsay evidence.  My interpretation is that, as a result of section 4, the birth certificate in cases such as this will now be admissible and will be evidence of the facts contained therein, in other words, the fact contained in the birth certificate is that X is the father of the child in question which is an essential ingredient of proof in incest cases.  If that is admissible and evidence of the facts contained therein, namely paternity, then the accused person &mdash; the father in this case &mdash; will have to adduce evidence to counter that, otherwise it will stand.  The matter is dealt with specifically in amendment No. 20, tabled by Deputy Shatter, which we will reach in due course.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan's concern is to ensure that the birth certificate would be admissible.  He is not absolutely clear that, under section 4, a document such as a birth certificate will be admissible because, as I said, if it is admissible it is evidence of the matters contained therein, namely paternity.  I am advised that section 4 will adequately deal with the concerns voiced by Deputy McCartan. The relevant part of this section, as proposed to be amended, reads:</P>
      <P>In this Part &ldquo;business&rdquo; includes any trade, profession or other occupation carried on, for reward or otherwise, either within or outside the State and includes also the performance of functions by or on behalf of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) any person or body remunerated or financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> Deputy McCartan wants to add: &ldquo;and shall include any records of the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages as established&rdquo;. This Part provides that certain documents which were not hitherto admissible in evidence will now be admissible.  Certain criteria will have to be fulfilled before those documents will be accepted, one is that they must be prepared in the ordinary course of a business. The term &ldquo;business&rdquo; is not confined to business as popularly understood, it is defined to include the performance of functions by or on behalf of any person or bodies remunerated or financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That means if a document is prepared in the performance of functions by or on behalf of any person or body remunerated or financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, it will be admissible.  The local registrar who compiles the records of births, deaths and marriages is doing so on behalf of the relevant health board and as such he is performing his functions on behalf of a body &ldquo;financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  It seems to me that a birth certificate is issued on behalf of the relevant health board, which is a body financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In this section we refer to the &ldquo;performance of functions by or on behalf of&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;any person or body remunerated or financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  Deputy McCartan's amendment No. 14 seeks, to use the Shakespearean phrase, to make assurance doubly sure.  However I believe the matter is adequately covered already.  I agree with him that this matter should be made crystal clear and it is my intention to make it crystal clear and to ensure that the loophole is plugged in so far as we can do so by way of legislation. I intend to honour that commitment, if for some reason Deputy McCartan feels that a birth certificate is not covered by the wording of the section at present and that it is not covered &ldquo;by or on behalf of any person or body remunerated or <Col N="1174" /> financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  In compiling the register of births, deaths and marriages, the registrar is doing so on behalf of the health board and therefore fulfils the conditions.  If Deputy McCartan or other Deputies feel that the matter is not adequately covered, I am prepared to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information.  I have two reasons for proposing this amendment: first, if as the Minister says, it is an appendage and an unnecessary appendage, is there any harm in inserting it to make the matter crystal clear?  I would like to see a clear message going out from this House that we have succinctly dealt with the proposition in relation to the Waterford case.  Second, in the first criminal prosecution when a birth certificate <i>per se</i> is produced the judge will ask: &ldquo;Why are you producing this, Mr. O'Dea&rdquo;, as the judge might address you in your other capacity, and you might answer, &ldquo;In pursuance of the provisions of Part II of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992&rdquo;, but the counsel for the defence will say, &ldquo;That is not a business record&rdquo;.  The onus will be on the prosecution to call on the Registrar of Births to prove the fact that he or she is compiling the register on behalf of the health board; the health board's chief executive might have to be called on to prove that the health board is paid &ldquo;wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo; and you will become entangled in an amazingly complex set of proofs that the birth certificate is in fact the product of a &ldquo;business&rdquo; within the meaning of the Act.  This will have to be proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The analogous area that comes immediately to mind is road traffic prosecutions where the registered medical practitioner who signs the blood alcohol certificate must come into the witness box and swear on the Book that he or she is a registered medical practitioner.  That is not good enough and he or she must produce the actual register retained by the Medical Registration Council.  On occasion if the defence lawyer objects to <Col N="1175" /> that, the keeper or registrar himself or the person in charge of the register within the registrar's office may be obliged to come to court to prove the veracity of the document and that the content is accurate and correct to the extent that it states that the medical practitioner whose name is entered on the register is the same person who signed the certificate and is sitting in the body of the court.</P>
    <P>I see difficulties arising because inevitably the proofs will be complicated.  If I am right it will mean that in all of these cases, witnesses will have to be on standby lest the defence say they do not accept the validity of the birth certificate until the matter goes to a higher court and the Court of Criminal Appeal rules on it as a matter of law for future purposes. I believe we can overcome these difficulties by inserting the words of my amendment which do not take away from the effect of the section.  They serve merely to elaborate on the section.  It will also give a clear indication of the decisive action by this House in the wake of the Waterford case.  This is the best I can offer at this stage.  The reasons may not, however, be good enough for the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy McCartan is quite right in his prognosis of how it will work in practice.  Sections 6, 7 and 8 provide that if a certificate is produced to authenticate the document and if it purports to be in order, it is deemed to be in order.  That is quite a Draconian innovation in some respects in so far as the law of evidence is concerned. That is not to say that it is inappropriate, and according to my reading it should not be necessary to have all the witnesses that Deputy McCartan referred to on standby.  The certificate is all that is required and if that appears on the surface to be in order and the court accepts it, the document then speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that I have not had more detailed information as to what precisely happened in the Waterford case.  I know something about it from the references that have been made to it but I have not <Col N="1176" /> read any reports on it.  It appears that an essential element of the only charge before the court was the alleged paternity of the father.  A birth certificate was not admissible in evidence to prove that and the mother would not or could not give evidence because she was in hospital. Whatever the reason, it raised the thought I often have that we assert the tools of the trade given to us are not adequate and we introduce additional measures to meet the needs of the situation, such as this Bill, whereas if the tools that were available were used more efficiently they would prove to be quite adequate in many cases.  I cannot help feeling that if the tools that were available to the prosecution in the Waterford case were all used properly, the debacle might not have occurred.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan questioned in an aside, and the thought crossed my mind also why there was only one charge that depended on paternity, as apparently there could well have been alternative charges in which paternity would not have been an essential element, and why such charges were not before the court. Why should they complain about the difficulties with evidence and the insuperable problems as the law stands if other charges that could have been easily established were not brought?  Second, in so far as the actual charge before the court, the establishment of paternity, the only person who could establish that was the mother and I do not know why the mother was not called to give evidence. Was she not a compellable witness; was she too ill to come; was she not prepared to come; had she changed her evidence; was she not on subpoena?  I do not know the answers to those questions.  If she was too ill and was in hospital or something like that her evidence could have been taken on commission; if she was unavailable and out of the jurisdiction the case could and should have been adjourned to enable her evidence to be obtained. As she should have been on subpoena, the court could obviously adjourn the case, as is usually done when a witness who is on subpoena does not turn up.</P>
    <P>Maybe there were good and sufficient <Col N="1177" /> reasons it had to be the way it was but I cannot help feeling it would show on a thorough investigation that the debacle was not necessary even under the law as it is at present.  In regard to an issue such as proof of paternity we bring in a measure providing that the birth certificate may now be admitted in evidence and that it will be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts stated therein.  <i>Prima facie</i> evidence on a matter like that is some evidence to start with but it will not be very strong.  Any court will know, so far as the name given, on the certificate for the father, there is no great weight of evidence on a birth certificate as to who the father is.  All we know is that when a birth certificate is being made up, the registrar &mdash; or whoever it is from the hospital &mdash; goes along to the mother and asks her certain questions including who the father is.  The mother says &ldquo;Jim Smith&rdquo;, or whoever she wants to say, and that name is written down and goes on the birth certificate.  There is nothing very strong about that.</P>
    <P>In a court case, after the enactment of this Bill the only evidence available may be a birth certificate showing the name of the accused as the father.  If the father gets into the witness box and contravenes that and says: &ldquo;I know that may be what the mother told the hospital when the birth certificate particulars were being taken but I am giving evidence that what she said is not correct.  What is written there is not correct.  I am not the father&rdquo;, it would seem to me under most normal circumstances his evidence would have to carry more weight than the most heresay statement that would be on a birth certificate based only on an unsworn statement of the mother at the time of the birth.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should get carried away with the notion that this Bill will be some kind of panacea for cases of the Waterford type.  Major advances could be made if in many cases prosecution authorities throughout the country gave more thought and attention to availing of the remedies which are available in abundance but which, unfortunately, in all too many cases are not used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Deputy Taylor, particularly in regard to his latter point concerning an inexplicable case which has yet to be answered &mdash; publicly or elsewhere &mdash; as to why the prosecution relied solely on one charge in the Waterford case when there were so many other charges that could have been laid on the same set of facts without the necessary ingredient of paternity being at issue.  However, the question we need to address in regard to this amendment has to be looked at more closely: the question of the definition that we are statutorily giving to the concept of a business within the working of Part II of the Bill and whether or not that includes the operations of the registry of births, deaths and marriages.  Unfortunately, Deputy Taylor in referring to sections 6 and 7 did not have regard to section 6 (3) which states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that a certificate may have been given pursuant to subsection (1) the court&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) shall, where a notice has been served pursuant to section 7 (2) objecting to the admissibility in evidence of the whole or any specified part of the information concerned, and...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 outlines the basis on which an accused person has the absolute right on serving of notice to insist that the documentary evidence not be acted upon or admitted in evidence.  I have no doubt, where one is served with a book of evidence and where one is served with the documents indicating that the State intends to rely solely upon the production of the certificate the accused can, through his counsel or solicitor, serve the requisite notice and seek the leave of the court to challenge the admissibility of the birth certificate on the basis that it does not amount to a document emanating from a &ldquo;business&rdquo; within the meaning of Part II.  That then throws an onus on the prosecution to have available &mdash; until it is otherwise established by legal dictum from a higher court &mdash; in the court the <Col N="1179" /> witnesses necessary to prove all the ingredients of the definition included in the Bill, that is that the registrar, the compiler of the register, is in fact working for and on behalf of the health board and that the health board in turn are in receipt, exclusively or wholly, of moneys from the public purse.  That would not be an implausible scenario to emerge; in fact, it is a very probable scenario to emerge in the course of the current thrust in criminal prosecutions.  For that reason I am suggesting to the Minister, because of the clauses which exist giving rights to the accused out of necessity for balance, that it would be important to clarify the subsection</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Taylor's queries about the Waterford case, I am not in possession of all the facts about the case but from inquiries I have made my understanding is that the prosecution decided not to call the mother in this case as a witness because it was felt from the information available to them that she was totally under the domination of her husband and would not prove to be a useful witness for the State.  I take the points made by both Deputy McCartan and Deputy Taylor that as a substitute for the elaborate profits referred to by Deputy McCartan in his initial contribution, a certificate under section 6 would, of course, do the job in this case. However, as Deputy McCartan has rightly pointed out, if an objection is raised this will necessitate somebody being dragged in to give oral evidence.  Under section 6 (3) even when an objection is not raised the court may decide in its discretion to require oral evidence.  From that point of view there could be a problem. I am inclined towards the view that perhaps we should include the provision about the birth certificate and I will be recommending that to the Department. If there is some very strong objection to including it, naturally I will have to report that to the House on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Taylor's contribution, I should make the point that if somebody in the chain between the <Col N="1180" /> mother and father and the person who entered the birth on the register did not receive the information in the ordinary course of a business then the birth certificate is not admissible in evidence under section 5.  Having said that, an objection could be made to any provision to suggest that information in a birth certificate is admissible as evidence, where the information might have been conveyed to someone who did not do it as part of their duties and who could, therefore, not be regarded as someone who was likely to transmit the information accurately.  That is generally understandable.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the amendment, while I am satisfied that the matter is covered adequately in the section and in view of the fact that we do not want to drag people into court unnecessarily even in the case of a certificate when an objection is raised or as the court may direct, I am inclined to the view that a specific provision should be written in as regards birth certificates and I will be advising the Department accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a statement is compiled other than in the ordinary course of business and the person making the statement is unable to give evidence at the request or requirement of a party to any criminal proceedings for any of the following reasons:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  that he is dead or is unfit by <Col N="1181" /> reason of his bodily or mental condition to attend as a witness; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  that he is outside the State and that it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  that all reasonable steps have been taken to identify him, but that he cannot be identified; or</P>
    <P>(iv)  that, his identity being known, all reasonable steps have been taken to find him, but that he cannot be found, or</P>
    <P>(v)  that, having regard to the time that has elapsed since he supplied the information and to all the circumstances, he cannot reasonably be expected to have any recollection of the matters dealt with in the statement,</P>
    <P>then such statement shall be admissible in evidence by leave of the Court being satisfied that the interests of justice will be served by the admission in evidence, and reading of the statement.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment which deals with a general issue has been borrowed in part from the report of the Law Reform Commission on receiving stolen property.  I wish to challenge the Minister of State on the reasons this part of the Bill is confined to business documents or documents compiled in the course of a business only.  There are other circumstances and occasions when documents can be produced or compiled.  Therefore, the general principle should not be confined to business documents.  In relation to the question of waiving the hearsay rule, the principle should cover all documents by which I mean the documents covered by the permutations provided in the definition clauses we have just dealt with.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the thinking of the Minister of State, and the Department, and the reasons a very narrow approach is being adopted to this issue.  I do not want to disparage unnecessarily the good <Col N="1182" /> intentions of the Minister of State and his Department in bringing the Bill forward by describing it as narrow but we are being far more restrictive than necessary in the way this part of the Bill can be construed.  The Law Reform Commission report on the hearsay rule was published as far back as 1980 while the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions in England against Myers, which drew our attention to this problem, was handed down in 1965 or thereabouts.  The English legislature eventually responded to this in 1968.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the decision in that case related to the car industry in Britain nonetheless the Law Reform Commission adopted a commendable approach in relation to this issue and did not seek to confine themselves to business documents only.  There is a range of circumstances where a court could safely rely on a document as proof of fact and that it should be relied upon in criminal cases as proof of fact when particular difficulties arise.  I have itemised these in the various subparagraphs of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I suggest that where a statement is compiled other than in the ordinary course of business, and the person making the statement is unable to give evidence at the request or requirement of a party to any criminal proceedings for a number of reasons, that statement &ldquo;shall be admissible in evidence by leave of the court&rdquo;.  It would be a matter for the court to adjudicate on the application from the prosecution.  In ruling on it the judge will have to be satisfied that the interests of justice will be served by allowing the document to be admitted in evidence and read to the court.</P>
    <P>Where a document is produced as proof of fact and due to an &ldquo;unforeseen contingency arising&rdquo;, to use the Minister of State's own words the prosecution are unable to avail of it the facts should not have to be buried with the author.  The court should be entitled on an application from the prosecution, who feel that they have a good case to make to the judge, to at least listen to the arguments, to consider the pros and cons and how the <Col N="1183" /> interests of justice would best be served and if necessary, allow the testimony.</P>
    <P>In regard to that curious beast or concept, the business document, the hearsay rule can be waived but it cannot be waived when we come to a different form of document.  On Second Stage the Minister made no effort, except to regurgitate what is contained in the explanatory memorandum, to tease out the reasons the Government decided only to go a certain distance and not to accept the Law Reform Commission's proposals in their entirety in this regard.  I am still at a loss to know the reasons they did not go all the way.</P>
    <P>If we take the example of a serious murder case or, indeed, any criminal prosecution where the murder weapon is removed from the scene of the crime and produced in court this may carry important forensic traces to link it to the accused.  The biggest single complement of witnesses at the trial is the array of police who were &ldquo;scene of crime&rdquo; witnesses. They are the gardaí who have the thankless but important job of securing the scene of crime.  An officer must be in attendance throughout the investigation to ensure that no one interferes with it.</P>
    <P>When the trial eventually takes place up to 40 witnesses could be called to state that they were on duty at the scene of the crime at certain times and that no unauthorised person interfered with it. What this means is that the object left by the offender or criminal in flight and which was taken from the scene of the crime by the detectives to the forensic science laboratory was not interfered with.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the prosecution at the criminal trial to maintain this great concept of &ldquo;the chain of evidence&rdquo; and to show that each exhibit was not interfered with, was taken away and given to the forensic science laboratory so that forensic tests could be carried out and then placed in the locker of the Garda &mdash; this is what invariably happens &mdash; where it remained for weeks and months until it was produced at the trial.</P>
    <P>Those who handle it must make themselves <Col N="1184" /> available to give testimony.  Many of them make a statement but what will happen if one of the &ldquo;scene of the crime&rdquo; witnesses dies; if one is unwell by reason of his or her physical or mental condition and is unable to attend as a witness or if a witness is outside the State and it is not practicable to bring him or her back?  For example, a witness may be attending the Olympic Games or attending an international police federation conference.  It is worth noting that members of the Garda Síochána are in Angola overseeing the implementation of a UN peace initiative at present.  What will the position be if the witness cannot be identified or, if his identity is known, he cannot be located?  It is possible that a witness may have left the employment of the State laboratory or, if a trial drags on for a considerable period, the witness may not be able to recall all the details of the incident.  The statement of that person containing all the relevant details, and which was made at the time of the incident, may be included in a document.</P>
    <P>Why, in those circumstances, can we not apply the general principles outlined in my amendment?  Let us be practical and reasonable about it and provide that where the prosecution have documentary evidence duly signed and are in a position to authenticate and certify it under the general provisions provided here, they should not be put at an automatic disadvantage in regard to that testimony simply because their witness has died, emigrated or whatever.  I know there are provisions in the Bill in regard to criminal investigations that can save it from this provision.  However, the example I have given can apply on the civilian side as well.  We should be practical in our approach and move towards enabling the prosecution to make reasonable applications to the court and to allow a judge to decide on these matters having regard to all the factors involved and having particular regard to where the interests of justice would lie.

      <P>In certain limited instances it is permissible for a deposition properly taken under the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 to be read to the court as evidence in a trial.  This is a very narrow category which is specifically spelt out in the relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  The example mentioned by Deputy McCartan in regard to evidence of handling exhibits etc. appears to be covered by section 5 (4) (b) (iii) so even if one of the handlers died and was unavailable the evidence is still admissible. On the Deputy's amendment, the effect of it would be a very wide extension of the categories of documents that would be admissible in criminal proceedings under the Bill.  I do not necessarily mean that I disagree with it for that reason. The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to allow statements compiled outside the ordinary course of business to be admitted in evidence where the witness could not attend and the court considered the interests of justice would be served by admitting it.  The general policy in the legislation we are discussing today is to confine admissibility to information in documents which is likely to be reliable because it has been compiled in the ordinary course of business by people who have no incentive to distort it and who are acting without reference to the possibility that the recorded information may become the subject of litigation, whether civil or criminal.  There are certain limited exceptions made to that for certain reasons which we will go into when we come to the relevant section. There is a further check on reliability in section 5, that is, that the information in the document must have been supplied by somebody who had personal knowledge of the matters dealt with, or would reasonably be supposed to have had such knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither of those checks are available in the case of the documents mentioned in the amendment.  Even though admission of the evidence in Deputy McCartan's amendment is made contingent on a decision of the court that it would be in the interests of justice to do so, we feel that the proposed amendment in the <Col N="1186" /> name of Deputy McCartan may not survive a constitutional challenge in that it is contrary to the guarantee of basic fairness of procedures.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions in section 5 are based on the specific recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on receiving stolen property and were designed to amend the law on hearsay solely in relation to business and administrative documents because of the urgency of doing so.  The commission has not concluded their examination of the general law on heresay in criminal proceedings and, apart from what I have just said about possible constitutional difficulties, I think it would be unwise to extend the category of admissible hearsay in criminal proceedings without having the benefit of the commission's view on that.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of what I want to read the relevant section of the commission's report into the record of the House.  I refer to paragraph 144 referring to documentary records and computer printouts:</P>
    <P>In 1980 in the Commission's Working Paper on Hearsay, (Working Paper No. 9-1980) proposals were made which would have had the effect of making out-of-court statements admissible in all cases where the maker of the statement testified or was not available. While recommending that these proposals should be adopted in civil proceedings, the Commission deferred making a similar recommendation in relation to criminal proceedings until such time as observations had been received from interested persons. Unfortunately, despite repeated appeals, no such observations have been received and the Commission has not felt it was possible to proceed to a Final Report until such observations were received.  However, it is now represented that the amendment of the law relating to the admissibility of business and administrative records is required as a matter of urgency.  In these circumstances <i>the Commission recommends the immediate adoption of the limited provision suggested in its <Col N="1187" /> Working Paper as appropriate in a context where the existing rule against hearsay was retained.  Under this provision records possessed of a guarantee of trustworthiness comparable to direct oral evidence or admissible hearsay would be admissible</i>.  In its Report on a Criminal Evidence Bill the Commission proposes to consider whether a more far-reaching reform would be desirable &mdash; for example, a provision along the lines of sections 68 to 72 of the British <i>Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984</i>.  The Commission reiterates its appeal to interested parties to submit their observations.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any interested party have submitted their observations since the Law Reform Commission produced that report.  In the circumstances a debate on this would be futile, as the Law Reform Commission is actively considering this very matter: it would be better to wait until their deliberations have been concluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Law Reform Commission would republish their 1980 report.  It came in their early years and does not commend itself to easy reading whereas the presentation of their latter day reports makes them very much more attractive documents to take on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the commission did not get a response to their request for observations.  It was brought out at a time when I was too busy in practice and more worried about how the law was than about where it was going.  If this is something they are actively looking at, I would like to see them recirculate that report and invite those of us concerned to conference again so that we might contribute. The commission have adopted this practice more so recently than they did at that time.  I had regard to the paragraph of the report before I tabled the amendment.  Nevertheless in the general scheme of a Bill to provide a law relating to stolen property and other matters the report contained a provision very similar to a provision I have drafted for <Col N="1188" /> the purposes for my amendment.  As I indicated earlier, I borrowed from the Law Reform Commission report and they do go further.  While they say in the body of the report that they are dealing with business and administrative records, they talk about a wider scenario.  On page 118 at paragraph 13 (1) they say that it should be provided that &ldquo;in any criminal proceedings a statement contained in a document shall, subject to this section, be admissible as evidence of any fact...&rdquo; and they go on to deal with the various circumstances.  They do not confine it to a business or administrative document <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted is narrower than what the Law Reform Commission intended.  I will not convince the Minister of my argument in this case, but I wanted to put on record my view that perhaps the House should have gone beyond what the Law Reform Commission had recommended. I accept that the Minister wants to wait for their final report on this matter, but he and his predecessors have on many occasions come in here and ignored the reports of the Law Reform Commission.  The Government in bringing in legislation with regard to the handling of stolen property ignored the Law Reform Commission entirely.  There is in the Department the capacity to draft legislation without reference to the Law Reform Commission.  Nonetheless, I would like to hear more about the Minister's concerns on the constitutional aspects of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am conceding that my amendment would not have a very wide application. Since 1984 we have had legislation to enable evidence to be given by way of statement to cut out the unnecessary regurgitation of technical information by witness after witness, but for some reason or other that legislation is being consumed by gardaí having to hang about unnecessarily in the Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court.  I hope that we could in this Bill bring the position further and deal with much of the surplus uncontentious evidence which is nonetheless essential from the point of view of preserving the chain of <Col N="1189" /> evidence proofs at a criminal trial.  I can see that it is futile to continue to try to persuade the Minister to my point of view so I would ask the Chair to put the question.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (4) (b) (iv), line 26, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and including any examination carried out by a medical registered practitioner pursuant to a prosecution under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1968 and including a statement by the said medical practitioner that he or she is registered within the meaning of those Acts and for those purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to ensure absolute certainty with regard to this proposition. I am dealing here with the consequences of the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions against Haughey which attracted quite a degree of interest in the media, because the defendant in the case was a close relative of the then Taoiseach and because the case took a remarkable twist before its conclusion by reason of a narrow unbelievable chain of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the medical certificate of the blood alcohol level was being challenged during proceedings.  The registered medical practitioner had been giving evidence for the previous 20 years in the Dublin District Court and throughout the country as a police doctor in drunk driving cases and he was known <Col N="1190" /> universally as a registered medical practitioner. Unfortunately, due to illness, the doctor was unfit to attend the court. The certificate was quite properly challenged by the lawyers for the defence and because the doctor was not in a position to attend, even though the medical register was produced and an official employee of the Medical Council attended the court to produce the register and everyone knew that the doctor in question, perhaps more than any other doctor, was a registered medical practitioner, the case failed.  I subsequently tabled questions to the Minister for Justice and was told that the matter would be addressed in legislation being drafted to deal with criminal evidence generally. When the Bill was produced there was no specific reference to the Road Traffic Acts.  On reading the legislation I felt that it was incumbent on us to ensure that this curiosity in our law, which often provided an unjustifiable out for defendants in drunk driving cases should be dealt with emphatically, and that if there was found to be a loophole it should be plugged by way of legislation.  For that reason I am proposing my amendment to subsection (4) (b) (iv) which deals with the definition of the information contained in a document where it says:</P>
    <P>(iv) a record by a registered medical practitioner of an examination of a living or dead person.</P>
    <P>The specific addition of the following words:</P>
    <P>and including any examination carried out by a medical registered practitioner pursuant to a prosecution under the Road Traffic Act, 1961 to 1968 and including a statement by the said medical practitioner that he or she is registered within the meaning of those Acts and for those purposes.</P>
    <P>We should add those words to ensure that in future in a drunk driving case the certificate from the registered medical practitioner will speak for itself.  In the event of the doctor being unable to attend court, the testimony in the document should not fall.  For too long these unbelievable <Col N="1191" /> technicalities and loopholes have existed in the drunk driving laws.  I am glad that the climate of opinion is substantially changing and that the culture of bravado that has often surrounded the drunk getting behind a steering wheel of a motor car is disappearing.  It is a good development.  In this case the public were dismayed and outraged at the conclusion of the prosecution because at the time it was to be established that the man was a registered medical practitioner &mdash; a fact known to the universe &mdash; the case fell, because he was ill-disposed and in a hospital bed and could not come to court to state that he was a doctor.  I hope this amendment commends itself to the Minister.  It meets a specific concern of mine which I understood his predecessor intended to address in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to change section 5 in two respects.  It seeks to make it clear that a medical examination of a person in connection with a road traffic prosecution will be admissible under section 5.  It would also make admissible a statement by a doctor carrying out the examination that he or she is a registered medical practitioner. Subsection (4) (b) (iv) makes it clear that a record by a registered medical practitioner of an examination of a living or dead person is admissible.  An examination is any type of examination.  It would seem that strictly speaking the amendment is not necessary because it is clearly covered in the wording of the section.  The examination by a medical practitioner of a living person would include an examination for the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be in favour of making admissible a statement by a person in a document that he or she is a registered medical practitioner.  That would not have the inherent reliability that the section seeks to preserve.  The section already provides substantial machinery for documentary evidence to be given as to entries in the Medical Register.  These entries would have been made, in the words of subsection (1) (a) &ldquo;in the ordinary <Col N="1192" /> course of a business&rdquo; on the basis of information supplied by a person who had personal knowledge of the matters dealt with.  The definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; is wide enough to cover the activities of the Medical Council.  For these reasons I am not inclined to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons the amendment is necessary is the question of whether the taking of a blood alcohol sample is an examination within the common parlance of a doctor's practice. The function of the medical practitioner is simply to insert a needle, extract a certain level of blood, put it in a phial and hand it over to the sergeant, who then takes charge of it.  I have serious doubts whether that amounts to an examination. I would think that the purpose of an examination by a medical practitioner is to survey the person involved with a view to establishing a medical condition or to administering some medicine. The concept of an examination may not in judicial construction include the simple act of a doctor attending a police station, sticking a needle into a vein, extracting the small amount of blood required, and departing.  Has the Minister had regard to that concept?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment used the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo;.  I can see the sense in what he is saying in terms of the definition of the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo;. Perhaps he should consider amending the amendment and submitting it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I more than welcome correction at any time, particularly from the Minister.  Perhaps the matter could be simplified by adding to the subsection the words &ldquo;including any examinations or any functions performed by the doctor under the Road Traffic Acts.&rdquo;  That might be a way of dealing with it.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider this matter. There were definite indicators that the problem would be addressed.  It is preposterous that well-established and well-known medical practitioners have to <Col N="1193" /> involve themselves needlessly at our courts giving evidence in criminal road traffic cases where all they have to say is already stated on a certificate handed into the court.  I find it ridiculous, if not insulting to common sense, that the same doctor may have to turn up day after day before the same judges and go through the same rigmarole of stating that he or she is still a registered medical practitioner. Anything that introduces an element of common sense and closes a loophole should be accepted and I would urge the Minister to consider a better wording for Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In all probability the wording that &ldquo;the document containing the information is a record by a registered medical practitioner of an examination of a living or dead person&rdquo; would cover well enough the findings of an examination of the person, including any part of the person, including blood or urine.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The findings of the analysis would not be covered, but that might be covered by a certificate from some other source.  That would have to be dealt with separately.  In all probability the wording as it stands covers the issue, but when we are in the business of framing legislation we should try to do better than provide for something which in all probability is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undeniable that we are a very litigious people.  We are only looking for ways out and for loopholes and in our courts we will pick on a single word, following which the matter will go all the way to the Supreme Court.  This one could go to the Supreme Court.  A person who is to be prosecuted on a drunk driving charge which may have particularly serious implications may be prepared to go to the Supreme Court.  Lawyers love that kind of thing and it is happening all too often.  In many cases it is unavoidable. If we have the opportunity at the formative stage of legislation to do our best to cover every possible eventuality, <Col N="1194" /> it would be prudent to frame something for Report Stage to cover the point raised by Deputy McCartan.  Undoubtedly it has some force.</P>
    <P>As has been said, the Deputy's amendment would not cover this matter because he uses the same wording as that used in the subsection.  What is needed is a variation of that wording.  The definition should be extended to cover tests that would be carried out because X-rays and a myriad of tests of different types might not come within the narrow definition of an examination of the person.  No doubt Deputy McCartan will be considering the matter for Report Stage and perhaps the Minister would agree to do so also.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's point in regard to the certification of a medical practitioner. I have some reservations about accepting a certificate from a person to the effect that he is a medical practitioner because cases of bogus practitioners have come to light.  We need to have basic standards of proof in these matters.  It can be very tempting to go overboard and loosen up the requirements of evidential proof.  The Garda constantly complain that the rules are too strict and they are constantly pressing for relaxations in the rules of evidence to assist them in prosecutions. We must examine critically what they say and the representations they make on these issues, but we must strike a fair balance.  I think the Minister has struck a fair balance as regards the certification of the doctor and the medical association.  The requirement is a reasonable and proper one in those circumstances. However, additional clarification may be necessary on the other point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Taylor for his remarks.  I take Deputy McCartan's point about an examination.  The Government and I are most anxious that no unnecessary loopholes exist in drunken driving legislation, regardless of whether or not the accused has a high profile.  Drunken driving laws are there for a very good reason.  It is my experience and that of some of my colleagues in the medical profession that a great deal <Col N="1195" /> of misery and hardship is caused as a result of the activities of drunken drivers. That is why the penalty for drunken driving is a mandatory suspension.  Perhaps the penalty should be even harsher.  We will ensure in so far as possible that no loopholes exist in legislation to allow people to walk away on a technicality. I will have the specific point raised by Deputy McCartan reconsidered in terms of the definition of the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo;. I have a vague recollection of the Road Traffic Act and I think there is provision in that Act which affects the definition of examination in relation to the taking of a blood sample.  However, I will consider the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister explain again the reasons for his reservations about the second part of my amendment, which refers to the inclusion of a statement by a medical practitioner that he or she is registered?  The test will be taken by a doctor at the request of local gardaí.  Is there some concern that gardaí might be inveigled into employing a bogus doctor?  Am I to take it from what the Minister has said that an independent certificate from the Medical Registration Council is sufficient to cover the eventualities? I am concerned that we should eliminate the practice whereby on a daily basis busy medical practitioners, who could be doing much better work elsewhere, are required to attend courts to repeat a fact that is universally accepted, that they are registered medical practitioners.</P>

The reason a statement by a doctor would not be considered admissible is as stated by Deputy Taylor.  We are trying to free up the rules of evidence but we must maintain basic standards.

      <P>The Minister is allowing statements from witnesses in all areas. Every document produced will be a statement of proof.  That is why it is produced in evidence.  The medical practitioner should be required to state not only that he or she is a medical doctor but is registered currently by the Medical Registration Council.  Surely if a person is found to be bogus he would be subject to the sanction imposed against every witness who might abuse the law, and be prosecuted for making a false declaration. Is that not adequate to deal with the matter?  Why should we not provide in legislation that a doctor must state that he or she is registered, leaving him or her open to the standard sanctions that can be imposed under the Bill against all people who make a false statement?  Why is there a problem in accepting this proposal?</P>

      <P>I see no great difficulty in the alternative I have referred to, namely, producing the records of the Medical Council.  The Deputy says we are allowing documentation from all areas, but it is documentation produced in the ordinary course of a business as it is defined in section 5.  It is a matter of policy and we do not want to provide for proof beyond a certain point.  The Deputy will appreciate that we are going quite a considerable distance in this regard and it is our decision if we do not want to go any further.  The inclusion of the second part of the amendment would be contrary to the general policy in the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Taylor that we must maintain basic standards in so far as we can.  We have made exceptions where we believe they are necessary.</P>

      <P>It would not be very difficult to get a certificate from the secretary of the Medical Council.  That would be readily available, but one must remember that it is not necessarily a question of certification by a garda or doctor in a road traffic prosecution.  The section has a much more generalised application. We are talking about any evidence being given by a doctor in different cases, not just in drunken driving cases.  If the Deputy's amendment were accepted it would have a wider application than merely to road traffic.</P>

      <P>We cannot have a provision that certification be applicable to one narrow circumstance.  If evidence as to a person's medical qualification were to be required, it would have to be on a universal basis.  The normal basis is a certificate issued by the secretary of the Medical Council, which is very fair and simple and involves no effort.  I am not saying that bogus doctors are common by any means but they are not unheard of, either.  There have been instances of doctors being struck off the register and of persons reputed to be doctors but not being so qualified.  Such people could continue to practise in the medical area, gaily issuing certificates and so on.</P>

      <P>Before I say too much about my amendment I expect to be entirely on the other side in terms of the balance for which the Minister has been arguing.  Perhaps I have abandoned that almost entirely. Nonetheless, I consider this an issue worthy of discussion.</P>
      <P>Section 6 introduces the right of an accused to object to evidence being given by way of documentary proof.  That provision is contained specifically in section 6 (3), which I referred to earlier in another context.  Section 6 (3) states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that a certificate may have been given pursuant to subsection (1), the court&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  shall, where a notice has been served pursuant to section 7 (2) objecting to the admissibility in evidence of the whole or any specified part of the information concerned, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  may, in any other case, <Col N="1199" /> require oral evidence to be given of any matter stated or specified in the certificate.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that section 6 (3) (a) obliges the court to require the production of oral evidence whereas section 6 (3) (b) permits the court to so require.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to add the following proviso:</P>
    <P>provided, in either event, the request is reasonable having regard to the overall circumstances surrounding the case and the court considers it essential for the interests of justice.</P>
    <P>In discussion on my earlier amendment, No. 16 I argued for the broadening of the operation of the legislation beyond the instances of merely business documents into the wider context of all documents. I then itemised a series of events that could occur, which the prosecution could not be expected to anticipate could not be blamed for where a person had died, or could have no control over when a witness went missing, was no longer available or could not be traced after reasonable opportunity.  I am saying that where an accused seeks to exercise the right proposed under section 6 (3) it is not mandatory and obligatory in all circumstances, even where a notice pursuant to section 7 (2) is served, and that there should always be a residual right in the court to say that the evidence should be admitted because of unforeseen or other circumstances beyond the control of the prosecution, and where no injury is done to the overall concept of justice. Therefore for example, where an accused seeks to avail of the prosecution's difficulty in producing a witness who is a witness only to technical or commonsense propositions &mdash; when in the normal course of events a judge might say that there could be little, if any, controversy on the fact to be proved but in the traditional maintenance of concepts of our criminal law, such as the chain of evidence that I have talked about, the preservation of the scene of crime or the production of a witness who says that he or she turned the nut on an <Col N="1200" /> item of a certain piece of property &mdash; the court would have the right to say ultimately that having regard to the overall circumstances surrounding the case and, in the interest of justice, the evidence could and would be read in the absence of the oral testimony to give it support.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the Minister's response will be that a balance has to be drawn and that the Bill makes innovative changes to the law.  I suppose that to some degree I advance the amendment in the context of someone who will now be accused of being poacher turned gamekeeper.  I advance the amendment on the basis of someone who has practised in the area and who would be the first, when produced with a case to defend in these circumstances, to advise an accused to avail of every opportunity to harry, trip, obstruct, confront and create obstacles for the prosecution.  In doing that I would be motivated, as a practitioner, in the first instance in the interests of my client and in the second instance in the interests of ensuring, by fair means or foul, within the rules, that an accused avoids conviction.  Those are my duties as a criminal defence lawyer and I make no criticism of that.  However, we as legislators should approach the issue from a different perspective, from a perspective designed to ensure that the legislation we put in place works, that there is a fair balance in what we are contending for and that the interests of justice are served from the point of view of both the prosecution and the defence. For that reason I advance the formula contained in amendment No. 19.  Again I should be interested to hear whether this is a concept acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to add a proviso to section 6 (3).  Section 6 (3) empowers the court &mdash; in some cases imposes a duty on the court &mdash; to require the production of oral evidence of matters stated in a certificate.  The certificate relates to matters necessary to establish that the documentary evidence being tendered complies with the conditions of <Col N="1201" /> admissibility set out in section 5, for example, that the information contained in the documents was compiled in the ordinary course of business.</P>
      <P>That certificate must be given by a person who occupies a management position in the business concerned or a person otherwise in a position to give the certificate.</P>
      <P>If the other party to the proceedings &mdash; let us assume that is the accused, as it usually will be &mdash; objects to the admissibility of all or some of the information, it is right that he should be able to examine the person who signed the certificate or, if that person is not available, someone else in the business who can give the evidence, so as to be able to sustain the objection.</P>
      <P>Even where an objection is made by the accused outside the terms specified in section 7 (2), that is, later than seven days before the commencement of the trial, the trial judge may give leave for the objection to be made.  To cover that case and also to allow the judge maximum discretion to act of his own motion where the interests of justice may so require, it is provided that the court may, in any other case, require oral evidence to be given; in other words, the court must require oral evidence to be given whenever there is an objection, and in any other case where the court may feel it is in the interests of justice to so require.  It seems to me that the Deputy is slightly more concerned &mdash; if I correctly understand what he said in the first instance &mdash; with where the actual objection has been made before the trial, and oral evidence is compulsory in such a case.</P>
      <P>I accept there may be cases where objections may be made that will have no merit whatsoever.  However, I believe that any tendency to object unnecessarily or unreasonably will be exposed clearly as a waste of everybody's time and be dealt with on that basis by the trial judge. While not disagreeing with the principle behind the amendment I am reluctant to appear to impose restrictions on the right of an accused to cross-examine on matters mentioned in a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> As Deputy McCartan rightly pointed out, it is a question of striking a balance. The difference between us is as to where that balance should lie.  I feel that that balance lies not merely in allowing but in compelling oral evidence to be given where an objection has been made.  It is our hope that eventually the practice in this area will be that the vast majority of objections made will be of substance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is not unexpected.  I do not entirely disagree with his position any more than he seeks to entirely disagree with mine.  We are treading backwards and forwards on the see-saw to ascertain where the balance will ultimately lie.  I do not want to depart from this as quickly as that.  I contend we need to look somewhat closer at the history of this development of the law.  The origins of this concept of relying on exceptions to the hearsay rule was prompted by the Myers case in Britain which caused a furore in 1965 or thereabouts.  The accused was charged with receiving stolen property &mdash; I think it was from the Jaguar motor company &mdash; and handling stolen cars and parts of stolen cars.  In order to prove ownership after so many years production, it was established in the court, and by the court of appeal in subsequent hearings related to Myers, that in regard to all the cars and parts of cars found in the possession of the accused, every worker on the assembly line and every person involved in the compilation of the records relating to the assembly of the motor car to the point at which it became driveable, would have to be brought into court and testify: yes, I put that axle on to that vehicle.  I entered that record of work in the records of the company of Jaguar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day, by means of that device, the police would be able to prove positively that the vehicle found in the possession of the accused was one assembled in that factory and sold to Mr. X, from whom it had been stolen at some stage.  That imponderable proposition had to be dealt with in some manner or other specifically in the case of the Jaguar <Col N="1203" /> company, being an efficient, modern company having on file all of the documentary evidence sustaining all of those facts.</P>
    <P>What was sought to be done in the 1968 legislation in Britain was to allow for exceptions to the hearsay rule, so that, in future, a business manager, say, in charge of the Jaguar plant could bring that file, compiled in the ordinary course of business in the assembly of the motor car, into court, and say: it says in that document there that part X was put on that particular motor car on such a date. Thus the whole case could be tied up. The objective of the hearsay rule was to facilitate the presentation of evidence in circumstances in which it would be practically impossible otherwise.  That was the concept; that is why it was done.  That is why we here today are attempting to bring forward our evidentiary laws to accommodate business records with ease so that we will not have this crazy position that proofs emanating from the ordinary conduct of a business would have to be sustained by the attendance in court of the worker who had been employed by the company perhaps some ten or 15 years previously, who may have left the company, who, in the current climate, might have emigrated to Australia in pursuit of a better job opportunity, or who might be one of the several hundred thousand Irish people in America who cannot be traced, being illegals who have gone to ground and do not want their whereabouts known or where they can be contacted. What we are endeavouring to do in this Bill is to make it possible for prosecutions to prove these facts from the record without having to draw on the civilian witness, employee, emigrant or whoever, for whatever reason, who is no longer available.</P>
    <P>If an automatic right is allowed, subject to seven day's notice being served, in every circumstance, of challenge to this record of evidence and the door is opened for the accused to have oral testimony heard, then there is no control over it as far as the relevant legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> That is why the question of balance is lost in our minds while we endeavour to ascertain the origins and purpose of this Bill and what its provisions seek to achieve.  I have a genuine concern that the good work undertaken in its preparation and its very intentions would be set at nought if there is an absolute right of objection on the part of an accused, when a court will have no residual discretion. When I say I agree with the Minister, I agree that, in principle, an accused should have the right to have oral testimony heard in all circumstances whenever sought.  But, on the question of technical records being proven, the records of the scene of crimes man, of the technical witness, the person who has custody and care of the exhibit, of all of the myriad of technical witnesses who surround and pad out no more than the basic facts of any criminal trial, the legislation is being cast out the window entirely if one gives unfettered, absolute right to the accused to seek oral testimony.</P>
    <P>That is why I contend that &ldquo;in either event but more particularly, as the Minister says, in the absolute event of the circumstances pertaining to section 6 (3) (a) a court should have a right to decide whether the request is reasonable, even though an accused serves seven days' notice.  The test is reasonableness on the one hand and on the other, the service of the interests of justice.  In these circumstances if an accused is ruled against, a judge will be subject to the review of the appeal court.  A court of appeal would be ideally competent and suited to rule that in the circumstances as the case ultimately unravelled or in respect of the evidence the accused advanced on appeal by way of additional information, it would have been better, in the interests of justice, had the evidence been heard fully orally.</P>
    <P>Our intentions in this House are to ensure that the good legislation we are knitting together is not simply unravelled by the provision giving absolute right in any circumstance, without question, without review by the court, without anyone's say, to set our very good work <Col N="1205" /> entirely at nought.  For that reason I am not at all convinced by the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot support Deputy McCartan on this amendment. The long history of our criminal law has always been that oral evidence is required.  That is the key factor &mdash; the witness in the witness box is required to be cross-examined, etc.  Written documentation is fine as far as it goes but it can be subject to falsification easily enough.  We all know about that only too well.  To put ourselves in the position where we leave it to the judge to decide on this issue could raise some serious difficulties.  For example, a case could be tried by a judge alone, without a jury. The written material will come before the judge who is determining the case and he will have to decide whether, to use Deputy McCartan's words, it is fair or reasonable to admit it in evidence.  The snag is that the judge has to look at this written material before he is in a position to make a decision as to whether or not to admit it.  The whole purpose is immediately defeated because the judge will have seen the material when it may well be that the correct decision is that it should not be admitted in evidence.</P>
      <P>There is another important factor which is easy for us to lose sight of.  We all tend &mdash; like everyone else here I have fallen into the trap &mdash; to think in terms of the prosecution adducing this material and seeking to have it admitted and the defence raising an objection to its admissibility or production.  The Bill is not confined to this process; it is a two-way process.  In certain cases it is the defendant who adduces the mass of written material and seeks to have it admitted and the prosecution may wish to object to it.  The provision applies equally to any party to a criminal prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could have a Goodman type case where there is a mass of written material &mdash; records of goods, weights of beef, etc. This written material may be supplied by the tonne.  The defence may seek to adduce this material, much of which may be falsified.  This will give rise to a very <Col N="1206" /> serious problem immediately.  The prosecution may object to this material and the judge may decide to overrule that objection and say it is reasonable to admit all this written material.  This will give rise to serious problems.  It is a major intrusion into the law of evidence to go as far as the Bill proposes to go.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we have to strike a balance.  I believe the Minister has struck a reasonable balance on this issue at this stage of the development of our law.  I would hesitate to include in the Bill a measure which would leave such a wide discretion to a judge to decide whether it was reasonable to admit this material. The Bill has to be definitive.  I could envisage a criminal case being interrupted immediately to go to the Supreme Court simply on the issue of whether the judge was right or reasonable to accept this material and the entire case being adjourned on this point.</P>
    <P>Oral evidence is crucial; oral evidence is at the basis of our law, and always has been.  We are modifying this procedure here to some extent.  To enable casual documents covering a range of allegations containing material substance to be handed in and to set that up as evidence of the truth of the facts stated in it, without giving either the prosecution or defence the opportunity to question or probate it is a major step.  I would have very grave reservations about accepting that as a principle because the document will not just be accepted as a document. Once that document is handed in it is evidence of the truth of what is stated therein, with no opportunity for cross-examination. A judge may well be tempted to say it is unreasonable not to admit such documentation.  Once this is done it is a major and very dangerous instrusion into the present position. Therefore, we should be very slow to adopt such a proposal.</P>
    <P>The entire issue of documentation being handed in has to be approached with caution.  The Bill, as it stands, will be of help in a large range of cases.  It requires prior notification to be given to the prosecution or the defence if there is to be an objection.  If there is no objection <Col N="1207" /> the probability is that the material will be admitted.  This will avoid either the prosecution or the defence being taken short.  This is fair and reasonable.  To take away a right to cross-examine on what could turn out to be important matters of evidence would be too dangerous.  Therefore, I support the Minister's position on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It often happens in criminal trials, both at summary and indictment level, that a judge is asked to rule on the admissibility of evidence such as statements and other technical evidence. In the course of that <i>voir dire</i> a trial within a trial, the judge often has sight of the evidence which will ultimately be ruled upon or objected to.  This creates no difficulty whatever in the practice of the courts.  Having had regard to evidence in a trial within a trial, a judge often rules against its admissibility and is required to ignore it in coming to his ultimate conclusions.  I am not saying for a moment that this would confound Deputy Taylor but no doubt it confounds lay people and observers of trials.  They find it hard to understand how on the one hand a judge who knows the content of a statement and has ruled that it is inadmissible can, on the other hand, ignore it when coming to a conclusion. However, judges do this every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose in my amendment to take away in an absolute way the right of an accused to give oral evidence.  I am merely saying that a residual right should be left in the hands of the trial judge to review the request being made.  An accused would have to indicate in a very brief and succinct way, through his counsel, to the trial judge the basis upon which the evidence is to be challenged and the reasons oral evidence should be advanced.  Once these reasons are stated and are seen to be more than mere obstructions I do not think any judge could, in the interests of justice, deny an application.  From my practical experience of the law, I believe there is a need for a saving proviso which would leave discretion in the hands of the trial judge. <Col N="1208" /> This is why I put down my amendment. I ask that the question be put.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash; Where the birth of child is registered in a register maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987, and the name of a person is entered as father of the child on the register so maintained, then the information contained in the register shall be admissible in any criminal proceedings as evidence that the person whose name is so entered is the father of the child and such person shall be presumed to be the father of the child unless the contrary is satisfactorily proved.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a link between amendment No. 20, amendment No. 25 and the following amendments.  However, I will not address them because we will be taking them separately.  Amendment No. 20, and the later amendments, derive from something adverted to in dealing with amendment No. 14 tabled by Deputy McCartan.  The correct way to deal with the issue, to which I will refer shortly, is to take on board amendment No. 20 and the other extensive amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Waterford some weeks ago there was a case about which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I expressed great concern, in which a prosecution was brought under the Prevention of Incest Act and a person who was said to be the father of the child was prosecuted for incest.  The daughter, who is now an adult, gave evidence that she had been sexually abused over a long number of years by the alleged accused.  At the conclusion of the evidence for the prosecution &mdash; because the onus is on the <Col N="1209" /> prosecution to initially establish a <i>prima facie</i> case &mdash; it was indicated that the counsel for the person alleged to be the father of the girl did not accept that he actually was the father; the prosecution failed.  The judge directed the jury to dismiss the prosecution and the man walked free from the court.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious that anything said in this House about a criminal trial, particularly when there has been a finding of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo;, albeit by way of judicial direction, should not be used to cast doubts on the validity of the decision. However, the concern arising from this case is that in prosecution of incest cases, a substantial technical difficulty has now arisen which may in future cases prevent, in particular fathers who it is alleged have sexually abused their daughters or indeed their sons, from being successfully prosecuted. The effect of this case is that if someone, in particular the father, denies that he is the father of the child who has been abused, there can be substantial difficulties in establishing the position and successfully completing a prosecution.</P>

      <P>Why did the mother not give evidence in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that the mother did not give evidence in this case.  I am not privy to the reasons for not calling the mother.  There are rumours regarding why the mother was not called to give evidence but, unless the Minister has concrete information in that regard, I will not comment on rumours or bring them into this House because it would be wrong to do so.  In cases of this nature &mdash; I am not making these remarks in specific reference to this case &mdash; there are a variety of reasons for mothers not giving evidence.  For example, the husband and wife may be separated and the mother may not know of the events; she may not wish to give evidence about paternity because she does not want to become entangled in the family dispute.  A mother might be residing with the father and could be intimidated into not giving evidence for <Col N="1210" /> fear of future assaults.  The mother may know of events in the past to which she has become reconciled and, in the circumstances, feel that if she gives evidence she will jeopardise her marriage.</P>
      <P>In other sections we deal with the circumstances in which wives can be compelled to give evidence in court proceedings.  However, there would be a major difficulty in a case in which, for example, it was alleged that the father of a child had committed incest in circumstances where the mother has died. That is a problem which will have to be addressed and, if the logic of the Waterford decision applied, it would mean that in any case in which the mother of a child had died in circumstances where the father was accused of incest he could simply say he did not accept that he was her father and nobody would be available to give evidence to establish that he was the person alleged to be the father.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that we must resolve this difficulty in the context of ensuring that a technical problem in this area of the law is sorted out in a way which ensures that, where allegations are made of incest, they can be properly prosecuted. We must also bear in mind the necessity to ensure that people are not wrongly convicted of offences which they have not committed.  I propose a two-pronged approach to the House to deal with this issue.  The approach I propose is based on a commonsense attitude to the issue and on sound legal precedent, bringing into the criminal law area an approach which is seen to be correct and which has worked successfully in the civil and family law area as a result of the Status of Children Act, 1987.  Bearing in mind the difficulties in the criminal law area, taking account of the 1987 Act and the successful application of its provisions in these areas, I drafted the amendments which I brought before the House in relation to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty which arose in the Waterford case was, apparently, that even if a birth certificate was presented to the court naming the accused person as the father of a child, the court could not regard the birth certificate as even <Col N="1211" /> giving rise to a <i>prima facie</i> indication that the person was the father, or give rise to any presumption that that person was the father.  There are very stringent rules under existing legislation as it applies from the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1963-1987.  The 1987 reference incorporates amendments to earlier legislation by the Status of Children Act, 1987.  These stringent provisions lay down the circumstances in which someone can be named in a birth certificate as the father of a child.  We also have provision that where someone is incorrectly named as the father of the child, the name can be taken off the certificate.</P>
    <P>If one steps aside from the peculiarities of the bureaucracy of the legal administration, any person outside this House would be of the view that if someone is charged with the offence of incest and is named on a birth certificate, properly registered in this State as being the father of the child against whom the offence is committed, a presumption should arise that the person so named as father is in fact the father.  The production of the birth certificate should be sufficient to raise that presumption.  Of course if that person is not the father of the child, the raising of the presumption does not mean that the person might be wrongly convicted of the offence of incest.  That simply means that if evidence is given by someone that particularly obnoxious sexual acts had been committed against them, if they say that the person who committed those acts is their father and if a birth certificate is produced which confirms that the person alleged to have committed those acts is the father, it should be sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case.  It would ensure that in future cases of this nature a judge would not be required to direct a jury to bring in a verdict of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; in the absence of other evidence.</P>
    <P>Of course, the accused would be required to go into the witness box to give evidence and if he were pleading he was not guilty I presume he would give evidence that he did not commit the alleged acts.  However, if he were to give <Col N="1212" /> evidence that he was not the father of the victim he would have to rebut the presumption that he was the father.  He would have to explain why his name appeared, on the birth certificate, if he knew his name appeared on the birth certificate.  He would have to say whether he had acted as a father to the child since its birth, whether he was married to the mother of the child, or whether it had ever been indicated to him before the trial that he was not the father of the child.  Any lawyer in a criminal trial could put these pertinent questions to any accused who denied paternity.  The accused's replies would influence a jury in determining who was telling the truth.</P>
    <P>If the appearance of a name on a birth certificate can raise the presumption in civil cases that someone is the father of a child I do not see any reason why it should not do so in criminal cases.  I invite the Minister to look at the corresponding provisions in the Status of Children Act, 1987, that deal with presumptions of paternity and I ask the Minister to take that on board in the context of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is the objective of all Members to ensure that we do not have a repetition of the Waterford case in the future.  My recollection is that when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Tunney, raised this issue quite properly and carefully on the Adjournment before the Second Stage of this Bill was debated, the Minister for Justice indicated that this Bill would contain provisions to address that issue.  In my view the provisions contained in Part II of the Bill do not adequately address this issue.  I also believe that the issue would not be comprehensively addressed by Deputy McCartan's amendment alone, but it would be assisted by that amendment and perhaps an amalgam of the amendments proposed by Deputy McCartan and me would resolve the issue.  I have no theological commitment to this proposed new section being in this particular position and perhaps the amendment would more appropriately be part of the new Part III of the Bill.  I can see technical difficulties arising if it is included in Part II rather <Col N="1213" /> than Part III of the Bill.  I am very anxious to bring this amendment before the House on Committee Stage so that we have the opportunity for all party agreement on our objectives &mdash; and I believe the objective of everybody is to resolve the difficulty that arose in the Waterford case.  Having debated the technical problems on Committee Stage, we wanted to give the Minister time to consider the amendment, which I will not be pressing on Committee Stage but which I will press on Report Stage if the Minister either does not agree to this amendment or produce a substantive proposal which will resolve the problem.  It may be in different language or situated in a different part of the Bill, but we must resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>I now want to put the amendment into the context of the later amendments, which will be discussed later, because that is relevant.  Let us assume that someone who allegedly has abused his child is being prosecuted for incest.  The birth certificate is produced and there is a presumption that the person named is the father.  When the person named gets into the witness box he says he is not the father, that his wife had had an affair with someone else and the alleged victim who is thought to be his daughter is not his daughter, that, while he may have engaged in certain sexual acts, it was not a case of incest because the victim was not his daughter.  There is a presumption that he is the father but the judge has the opposite evidence.  Any good lawyer acting for the prosecution could cross examine the accused in detail to assist the jury in establishing the veracity of what he is saying.  Having raised the presumption and the accused having denied paternity, it would be unsatisfactory if the jury, having heard the evidence and seen the witness, had to make their decision in circumstances where medical science has advanced to such a degree that there can be a degree of certitude about the position.  Under the Status of Children Act, 1987, when there is alleged paternity but the person denies he is the father of the child, the judge hearing the case or either party to the court proceedings <Col N="1214" /> can make application for a blood test to be carried out.  The definition of a blood test under the Status of Children Act, 1987, allows not simply for the old fashioned blood test that could be conducted and which might determine that someone is not the father of a particular child but could not with any exactitude determine if someone was. However, the new style of testing in the form of genetic fingerprinting, which we recognise expressly under the Forensic Evidence Act, 1990, allows for the taking of a blood sample, or indeed other forms of tissue, which can with a substantial degree of accuracy determine whether a person alleged to be the father of the child is or is not the father of the child. All that is required is the taking of a sample from the accused and his alleged child.  It is not even essential that the mother of the child be available to give a sample to determine paternity, though obviously if she were available that would assist the genetic fingerprinting tests.</P>
    <P>The new Part III, which I propose be inserted in the Bill and which will be discussed in greater detail when we reach it, would allow a judge hearing a criminal case and faced with that dilemma to order the taking of a blood test and for genetic fingerprinting to take place in order to determine the issue of parentage.  It would allow for such an issue to be resolved by such testing in a way that we would have a greater degree of exactitude and certainty than is the case in most issues of contested fact in a criminal trial. Where the defendant is going to deny that he is the father of the victim, in such circumstances it would be desirable that the defendant must notify the court in a pre-trial procedure that he will take such a stance and it should be possible for the court in the pre-trial procedure to order that the tests be carried out.  Equally, the court should be able to adjourn proceedings in order that the tests be carried out.  I will deal with the specifics and complications of the various new sections which I am proposing be put into Part III of the Bill when we reach it.  The point I want to make in the context of amendment No. 20 is that it would allow the <Col N="1215" /> accused to go into the second part of the trial, where he would give evidence denying paternity; but, where it is necessary to assist the courts in determining the facts of paternity, genetic fingerprinting would be available.  It is possible that the provisions of the Forensic Evidence Act, 1990, if and when it is brought into force, could be used in this context; but it would be applied in circumstances where the Garda had reasonable cause to believe that someone had committed an offence in the particular circumstances laid down in the Act and this would have to be done prior to the prosecution commencing. Under Part III we have a proposal which allows a judge to adjourn a trial to allow for the carrying out of such genetic fingerprinting to assist in the establishment of the truth.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying we must find a comprehensive solution to the difficulty that arose in the Waterford case.  Many people looked askance at what took place in that case and felt it went beyond legal technicalities.  I am not making any criticism of the lawyers involved; the defence lawyers had their job to do to protect the defendant, the prosecution lawyers had their job to do and did their best to prosecute the case and they experienced a difficulty that had not arisen heretofore. To a lay person looking in it seemed that the dismissal of that case on a technicality was almost an abuse of the legal process. I am not saying it was an abuse, I am saying it was perceived as an abuse of the legal process.  I emphasise I am making no criticism of the defence lawyers who had a job to do and no criticism of the prosecution lawyers who found themselves confronted with a dilemma that had not previously arisen in this area.  It appeared to be an abuse of the legal process and we must correct it.  Fortunately, the Criminal Evidence Bill is uniquely suited to deal with this matter. It is a coincidence that this Bill came into the House so soon after that case.  I think the Minister tries to pretend this Bill was a response to that case but, of course, we all know it was in the course of preparation for a very lengthy period and it <Col N="1216" /> does not directly address the problems of that case, it only does so obliquely and not in a way that is explicit and clear and certainly not in a way that would provide the extensive provision I would like to see in the area.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I am trying to achieve here will have the general support of the House.  I appreciate this is the first time we have been able to deal with the technicalities of the case, that the Minister may need more time to consider it and, perhaps, we should come back to it on Report Stage.  The initial response of the Minister, and other Members of the House, to what is proposed would be helpful in ensuring that we find the right solution to this problem.  This would enable us to ensure that if cases of this nature are brought before our courts in the future we will not see charges dismissed on a technical basis.  We will ensure that birth certificates are admissible and that if somebody is named on a birth certificate as the father of a child he cannot, in a criminal trial, simply say he is not the father and as a result have very serious charges dismissed; charges which require the full rigours of the law to ensure that those who have committed that type of offence are properly convicted and sentenced.  This should not result in people escaping justice on legal technicalities based on the inadequacy of our laws of evidence.</P>

      <P>During the course of the afternoon &mdash; while Deputy Shatter was absent &mdash; we discussed amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy McCartan. The Minister said at that stage, as well as on Second Stage that he would try very hard to address the difficulty which arose in the Waterford case.  Indeed, Deputy Shatter has made a very cogent argument as to why amendment No. 20 should be accepted by the Minister and in that context he referred to the Waterford case in detail and the difficulties that arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That case upset a great many people who are conscious of the difficulties attached to cases of child sexual abuse. First of all, there is the difficulty of getting them into court and bringing about a <Col N="1217" /> prosecution.  The Waterford case upset people because it found that there were certain loopholes of which we were not aware which meant that when you succeeded in getting a case before the courts it could so easily fail to arrive at what might be described as a normal prosecution. It is very important that we address the matter in the course of this Bill.  It appears that the Bill as drafted does not deal with this problem.  Deputy McCartan attempted to include his amendment under section 14 because he felt it would go some way towards ensuring that a case similar to the Waterford case would not happen again.</P>
    <P>In our view, amendment No. 20 is much more comprehensive and the follow-up to it in Part III gives the courts power to demand that evidence be produced in the form of a blood test in a case where a birth certificate was provided as evidence and where the accused person states he is not the parent.  Before the Bill is finalised I hope, because of the openness with which the Government propose to proceed, that whatever loophole exists will be closed off.  We hope amendment No. 20 will form part of the Bill.  If the Minister has serious objections to the amendment, I suggest he and Deputy Shatter get together to ensure that what he and everybody in the House wants to see achieved will be achieved by means of this Bill.  Amendment No. 20 and the other amendments tabled by Deputy Shatter appear to achieve that aim and I hope they will be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  It would be more accurate to refer to the case as the west Waterford case rather than the Waterford case.  The reason the judge directed the jury to dismiss the case is a mystery to me, as a layman, but maybe not to some of the people here who are in the legal profession. The dismissal on the grounds directed by the judge to the jury has absolutely stunned people over a wide area.  It is entirely unbelievable that the court was not adjourned until the birth certificate was produced or until such <Col N="1218" /> time as the mother of the child involved &mdash; or the wife &mdash; was subpoenaed to attend court.  That a case could be allowed to collapse or to be dismissed on such a technicality defies the understanding of the ordinary public, of whom I am one.</P>
      <P>This amendment should close that loophole if, indeed, it was a loophole. My information is that in a statement the defendant had referred to the child as &ldquo;my daughter&rdquo;.  I would like also to make the point that at no stage was the victim, who is now 20 years of age, called to give evidence.  Because of that, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who is present this evening, should look further into the case and examine why the charge which was brought against the father of the child was merely limited to a charge of incest when the Garda Síochána investigating the case had specified there should be a number of charges, including rape and sexual assault.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the reason no further action has been taken in this instance.  Years ago if it was felt that there had been a miscarriage of justice the Attorney General or the State had the right to re-enter or reopen the case. There is a definite feeling that justice has not been done in this case.  There is an aura of fear in the general district where these incidents occurred &mdash; this should not be under-estimated and some awful deeds may be carried out; I hope not but we should not under-estimate the depravity of people who carry out certain acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a dreadful blot on our legal system and something should be done immediately to correct the malfunction of that system in this case.  I cannot understand the reason the case was not adjourned to allow the mother of the child, the wife of the defendant, to be subpoenaed to attend the court to verify that the accused was indeed the father of the victim.  The case would then have proceeded in the way it should have and a verdict would have been arrived at on all the evidence presented to the court. It is essential that amendments such as <Col N="1219" /> this are taken on board by the Government to ensure there is no repetition elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unsympathetic to the sentiments expressed in the amendment. As Deputies Shatter and Cotter said, Members on all sides of the House expressed the desire that if a similar case was to occur the accused should not get off on a technicality.  I cannot comment on the other factors mentioned by Deputy Deasy as I do not have sufficient information.  However, I have noted the other questions he raised and will have inquiries made.</P>
      <P>In relation to the birth certificate, which was central to the decision in the Waterford case, two matters have to be dealt with.  First, we have to ensure that a birth certificate will be admissible in evidence and, second, that this will have some significant effect.  While I do not want to go back over the arguments made on amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy McCartan which was debated at some length, he wished to ensure that there would be no doubt that the birth certificate would be admissible in evidence.</P>
      <P>I felt then and I still feel, having listened to the arguments put forward, that this legislation, as it stands, is sufficient without the need to include Deputy McCartan's amendment to ensure that a birth certificate will be admissible in evidence.  However, as I indicated to Deputy McCartan in reply to amendment No. 14, if necessary, I would be prepared to include the wording of his amendment to put it beyond doubt that a birth certificate will be admissible in evidence in all cases under section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter that has to be dealt with is the question of what significance a birth certificate would have if admitted in evidence.  That brings me to the substance of Deputy Shatter's amendment. Deputy Shatter is trying to ensure that if a birth certificate is admitted in evidence this would give rise to a rebuttable presumption of paternity; in other words, the person &ldquo;shall be presumed to be the <Col N="1220" /> father of the child unless the contrary is satisfactorily proved.&rdquo;  As I said, section 5 (1) provides for the admissibility of documentary evidence.  That subsection states that &ldquo;information contained in a document shall be admissible in any criminal proceedings as evidence of any fact therein&rdquo;.  If we ensure that a birth certificate will be admissible in evidence under section 5 (1) this will be considered to be evidence of any fact contained therein.  Obviously the principal fact would be that the person named is the father.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment seeks to go further.  If it is necessary to go further I am prepared to be persuaded that Deputy Shatter's amendment should be accepted but so far nothing that he has said has persuaded me that it is necessary to go that far.  It would seem that if the information contained in the document, namely, the birth certificate, is considered to be evidence of any fact therein and the birth certificate is admitted in evidence it would be up to the accused to adduce evidence to contradict this fact in relation to paternity; otherwise it would stand.  That is my understanding of the matter.</P>
    <P>I should say also that I dislike the wording of Deputy Shatter's amendment because there would be a presumption that the person so named is the father of the child and that he &ldquo;shall be presumed to be the father of the child unless the contrary is satisfactorily proved&rdquo;.  This would seem to shift the burden of proof &mdash; this would be most inappropriate in a criminal case &mdash; onto the accused.  Not only this, it would require the accused to prove a negative, a difficult thing to do at the best of times.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage, in referring to Part III, which provides for the giving of evidence by way of a television link, Deputy Shatter expressed his concern that the balance would shift towards the accused. I agreed with him at that time and I still agree with him.  If we are to be consistent we have to keep this question in mind at all times.  We cannot rectify a case which has been the source of great public interest and dissatisfaction in Deputy's <Col N="1221" /> Deasy's constituency and county by overturning the criminal law and requiring the accused to prove he is innocent.  A fundamental principle of criminal law is that the accused is innocent until proven guilty and the onus rests firmly on the prosecution to prove the case against the accused.</P>
    <P>It is said that hard cases make bad law. Therefore, we cannot use the result in one case to overturn the principles of criminal law and require the accused to prove his innocence or, in the words of Deputy Shatter's amendment, to prove satisfactorily that he is not the father of the child, that is, a negative.  I am not unsympathetic to the sentiments expressed in the amendment but, given the specific provisions of section 5 (1) and the fact that the information contained in the document, that is, the birth certificate, shall be admissible as evidence of the fact therein, I remain to be persuaded that there is a necessity to include this amendment.  I have been advised that it may give rise to constitutional difficulties from the point of view of maintaining a balance and that the onus should remain on the prosecution from the beginning to the end of a criminal trial to prove the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct when he says that this amendment tries to shift the burden of proof; that is the intention.  First, I was concerned that the Minister might bring the birth certificate in under section 5.  Certainly, if the amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan is brought in, the birth certificate would be included under it.  It would mean that the certificate would only be evidence of the fact contained therein. Then presumably the accused could get into the witness box and deny that fact, saying that he is not the father, and that would be the end of the story.</P>

      <Col N="1222" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> on Tuesday, 7 May 1992:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Finance to re-establish Fóir Teoranta and, conscious of the difficulties being experienced by Examiners appointed under the terms of the Companies Act, 1990, further calls on the Minister to extend the powers of Fóir Teoranta on its re-establishment to mandate it to provide Examiners with the working capital they need to carry out their functions so as to avoid unnecessary liquidations and</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the Government's overall economic policies as the best means of ensuring the creation and retention of long term sustainable jobs in the economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will be supporting this motion because, while we have many reservations about the limited role of Fóir Teoranta in the past, we still believe the State should retain for itself some mechanism for intervention in the economy in a positive way.  In the aftermath of the Communist collapse in eastern Europe there are questions we must ask ourselves concerning the dividing line between ourselves as a socialist party and member of the European Socialist Group of parties and other parties.  We must ask what is the role of the State in a mixed and open economy, which is the reality that confronts all of us in the immediate future pending the successful completion of the GATT negotiations.  It seems that on the right there are those who believe <Col N="1223" /> that the role of the State should be confined exclusively to getting the climate right, creating a not too clearly defined set of circumstances which will promote, among other things, a sense of confidence in the marketplace that would induce investment and risk taking &mdash; in other words, a hands off approach by the State to the economic affairs of the country.</P>
      <P>There is a second view that goes a little further.  It is that the State has a positive role to play in promoting, investing and providing the infrastructure of transportation, telecommunications, education, social security, peace and so on that would enable business activities to take place and eliminate risks that have nothing to do with commerce and everything to do with the society in which people live.  There is a third view that the State should intervene in enterprise itself, above and beyond infrastructure and way beyond providing the climate, both of which are necessary in themselves. There is a further view of intervention, which is controlling certain key elements and owning or taking control of sections of industry.  Finally, there is the now discarded command economy, which has been seen to have failed miserably right across the whole of central and eastern Europe and through the Soviet Union itself.</P>
      <P>This is not meant to be an economic lecture; I certainly do not have the time for that.  However, the Labour Party believe that the State must have a positive role in the economy and must be prepared and equipped to intervene in the economy.  In the words of someone else recently, the State must be prepared to be a marriage broker and not a pawnbroker and must be able to intervene in those enterprises that get themselves into trouble and which need a helping hand above and beyond what can be obtained from a commercial bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We argued strenuously for that kind of role for NADCORP, but NADCORP was &mdash; since we are in the climate of pro life discussion &mdash; strangled at birth by the mandarins of the IDA and was never allowed to flourish fully in the way <Col N="1224" /> intended.  There is no institution, other than the IDA itself, that can take direct equity in companies.  We have always argued against that schizophrenic role for the IDA; it is a bit like asking the referee to periodically play on one side or the other in a football match.  Notwithstanding the recommendations of Culliton, we do not see the IDA, whose primary task is one of promotion and encouragement of investment in this country, also taking equity, because having to carry out the two functions would confuse the decision makers.  We are all human in that respect and it would not be reasonable to ask people to make such decisions.</P>
    <P>While we would prefer a body like NADCORP to be in existence that could take equity shares and participate from the very beginning in promoting through venture capital those enterprises that could maximise employment through use of natural resources within our economy, in the context of this debate we are faced with a proposal by Fine Gael to restablish Fóir Teoranta and we will support that motion.  Tragically, I suspect that the Government will say there is no real need for it because of the experience of Fóir Teoranta in the past.  I think that would be a mistaken response, because Fóir Teoranta had to cope with a period of adjustment from the late seventies to the early eighties after the oil crisis.  There was a massive shake out at a time when many industrial jobs were lost.</P>
    <P>With the completion of the internal market and the full rigours of the European economic space, as it will initially be, and then full European union, with the accession of the five EFTA members, there will be a different kind of shakeout. If we want to have a level of economic activity which participates fully, openly and vigorously in that free and open market, but which at the same time contributes back to the Irish economy, we must promote the creation of large enterprises that above and beyond the normal criteria of investment have a loyalty to this place.  To that extent the historic role of the State intervening in the economy, which was an integral part of socialist <Col N="1225" /> philosophy and ideology, must be retained, but utterly transformed in the context of a multi-state or inter-state economic union, which is what the European Community will be.  This is an issue that is currently exercising the minds of socialists, economists and politicians in all of the other member parties of the confederation to which I belong to determine at what level the political economic institution can intervene &mdash; at the level of the nation state, the provincial Department, the German Lander and at the European level &mdash; in a manner that has been so successful in parts of Korea, albeit a totally different level of economic development, or indeed in Japan.</P>
    <P>One thing is sure.  The era of Reaganomics, the era of Thatcherism, as a philosophy that produces sound economic growth leading to buoyancy in the economy and overall net increases in employment is over.  Hopefully, it will be buried formally tomorrow in the elections in Great Britain, because the damage that Reaganism did to the United States economy and that Thatcherism did to the British economy &mdash; now that we have had a chance to look at it &mdash; is clearly a lesson that anyone who has a genuine, open intellectual interest in economics and politics should look at with a degree of objectivity.  The other achievements of Thatcherism &mdash; and there were many &mdash; are ones that will have to be left for another time.  In the economic field Mrs. Thatcher's admonition that the state should get out of the market place is altogether one that is unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>I know the UMP debacle is the progenitor of this motion here tonight.  There are enterprises which at an earlier stage than insolvency desperately need equity capital and ultimately they can only depend on the State to invest in them.</P>

For that reason, if we want to <Col N="1226" /> protect jobs and enhance job creation, we need an organisation like Fóir Teoranta.  In the absence of any initiative from the State and in the absence of the implementation of aspects of the Culliton report, the Government should take on board the sentiments of this motion and re-establish, with perhaps an enlarged mandate, Fóir Teoranta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of the analyses of the last speaker.  There must be some appropriate role for the State between the extremes.  One of the things we did in this small, open, vulnerable economy was to start to establish something of a middle way.  In many ways we were interventionist long before it was fashionable to be interventionist.  There was a famous Finlay lecture many years ago when Keynes came to this town and spoke of the interventionism of de Valera and the role he was trying to see for the State somewhere between the extremes. This is an interesting philosophical level on which to conduct this debate.  It is something we do not do often enough here.  The level of debate which we have just heard from Deputy Quinn is something that could with value be brought into the newly created committee, in order to establish the appropriate level of intervention for the State.</P>
      <P>I spoke on the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta and will speak along the same lines tonight, but I take the point made by Deputy Quinn about the strangulation of NADCORP at birth by the bureaucratic forces that operated at that time.  I am not sure how dramatic they were or whether they were departmental or State-sponsored bodies, but certainly they were forces to bring NADCORP down.</P>
      <P>I should have said at the outset that I will be sharing some time with the Minister when he arrives later, if the House agrees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The final sentiment in the motion, intended to protect jobs by <Col N="1227" /> avoiding unnecessary liquidations, is not one with which any Member would argue.  There is something pathetically tragic about a liquidation when one knows that the company could have been saved by an injection of funds or by the use of a safety net of some kind.  While we have sympathy with the sentiment, the means suggested for fulfilling the desire in this motion is questionable.  We are familiar with the history of Fóir Teoranta who were established in the run up to our entry into the EC.  Given the advent of a more competitive environment which EC membership heralded, and the lifting of protectionism which had been part of our industrial policy since the thirties, the establishment of Fóir Teoranta was a prudent step.  The company were right for their time.  There are organisational formats which are right for their time but they live out their usefulness and should then be consigned back to the shelf when new forms of intervention are considered.</P>
      <P>The opening up of the Irish economy was seen as inevitably leading to the restructuring of Irish industry.  This process inevitably had its victims and Fóir Teoranta were established to assist those who could survive.  It was intended to fill the gap which was perceived at the time as existing in the range of State services which were available to manufacturing industry.  The new Oireachtas Committee and the task force of Ministers looking at the Culliton report could consider exactly what gaps exist in the existing mechanism and perhaps something similar to Fóir Teoranta would be regarded as an appropriate mechanism for a particular set of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense, Fóir Teoranta were established with an implicit &ldquo;use by&rdquo; date. They had a limited shelf life and they lived out their life.  The major purpose of the company was to provide an orderly procedure for restructuring ailing but potentially viable industries which ran into problems and which either did not have the financial resources to weather the storms coming in with the new environment or which could not raise funds <Col N="1228" /> from the normal marketplace or from banking sources.</P>
    <P>It turned out that Fóir Teoranta's busiest time was not in the immediate aftermath of EC membership but during the recession of the early eighties.  During that recession Fóir Teoranta were called upon on many occasions to intervene.  On many occasions their intervention was futile, expensive and doomed to failure. During that recession the company provided substantial funding to traditional industries.  The companies listed in Fóir Teoranta's reports of that time read, as I said in my contribution to this House in May 1990, like a who's who of Irish traditional industry.  It is an inescapable fact that most of those companies mentioned in the reports have long since passed into history.  They no longer provide employment or engage in economic activity.  They failed to survive the twin rigours of EC membership and recession in spite of very considerable levels of State intervention, not least intervention by Fóir Teoranta and other agencies.</P>
    <P>The report of Fóir Teoranta do not suggest that the company were conspicuously successful in their operations. I am not passing judgement on those who worked for Fóir Teoranta.  It must have been a very difficult agency to work for because many of their clients were doomed to failure.  Fóir Teoranta by their very nature were doomed to fail or to achieve very limited success.  They were after all, a lender of last resort owned by the State.  Their positioning was at least as important as their basic ethos and objectives.  Now there is a universally odd attitude to any company in State ownership.  While the companies are established with reasonably clear-cut objectives and while State companies are almost inevitably established to be free of political intervention, they are inevitably forced to surrender their commercial purity to that most pervasive of Irish political characteristics &mdash; short term expediency. So it was with Fóir Teoranta.  They were very vulnerable throughout their life to expediency, to interventions which were motivated more by expediency than by commercial considerations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> It is obvious to anybody who takes the trouble to review the history of Fóir Teoranta, which throughout its most active period was, because it was publicly owned, forced to take up cases which had no chance of success.  At best Fóir Teoranta helped to put off the inevitable evil day, and at some considerable cost to its owners, the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte, in a very interesting contribution on 31 May, 1990, dwelt on this point at some length.  It would be worth hearing his contribution again. Parting company with the mover of the motion, who had been lavish in his praise of Fóir Teoranta and had argued that the firm had made achievements which even its most loyal employee would not have proclaimed, Deputy Rabbitte spoke about how the company had been abused by the banks.  He highlighted other vulnerabilities of the company.  Deputy Rabbitte's comments are, at least in part, worth quoting.  He stated as follows:</P>
    <P>To some extent they were seen as an easy touch and as a mechanism for the banks to avoid their social responsibility. Customers who were too much of a risk were pawned off on Fóir Teoranta and the banks did not feel they would come under any pressure as a result.  In some cases Fóir Teoranta were used as a milk cow for inefficient businessmen.  That is an important point, because successive persons associated with the management and board of Fóir Teoranta have commented that they were often asked to bail out companies whose difficulties were also due to inherent managerial weakness.</P>
    <P>That is a very true summary.  The fact that the lender of last resort was owned by the State meant that the lender of last resort was inevitably extremely vulnerable to forced interventions.  While I would have some doubt about some of the language used by Deputy Rabbitte, it is true that the banks, who did well out of traditional companies for many years, decided, very frequently <i>in extremis</i>, to dump their problems on Fóir Teoranta <Col N="1230" /> when the writing on the wall came into their collective corporate focus.</P>
    <P>The banks were not the only culprits. Because Fóir Teoranta was in the State sector it was particularly vulnerable to political as well as commercial expediency. An industrial or commercial collapse in a marginal constituency &mdash; and many of our constituencies could be so described &mdash; was always a very potent thing in Irish political life.  With Fóir Teoranta in place the inevitable clamour would be raised for its intervention.</P>
    <P>In the UMP case, which is the progenitor of this motion, we have witnessed a breathtaking disregard for harsh economic facts.  We have heard intelligent political personalities, Members of this House, argue that the company could have been saved by putting in £2 million or £4 million.  We all know the tragic truth that the company had reached such a state that ten or 15 times that amount would have been necessary to safeguard it.  The company had so woefully stretched itself that considerable injections would have been necessary to preserve it.  I would wish, as would all Members, that the opposite were the case.  If Fóir Teoranta had been in operation during the past couple of months, when people in this House were arguing that this very considerable employer could be saved for only £3 million or £4 million, I have no doubt that such money would have been forced into the company through Fóir Teoranta.  Within five or six weeks another £4 million would be needed and so on.  The reality which is relevant is that if the State were to intervene to re-establish a State-owned lender of last resort we would go back to the situation where companies which were simply not saveable would die a death on the instalment system at the expense of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The examiner mechanism established in the Companies Act is effective.  It has not been in place for long and there is no doubt that the mechanism could be improved.  I would suggest that we take the opportunity to examine the mechanism and then consider how it can be strengthened.  Setting up or re-establishing Fóir Teoranta to act as the examiner's <Col N="1231" /> banker would leave us with the very real danger that the new State body would be little more than a safety net to allow bankers and other creditors to offload reasonable commercial exposure. That does not strike me as a sensible proposition.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Fine Gael want to make a reasonable contribution to the resolution of the employment problem. Suggestions such as this have some merit and deserve to be studied, not in an arid debate in this House but in the committee which this House has just established. Fine Gael could use their very considerable talents more effectively by agreeing to participate in the committee.</P>

It might be useful at the outset if I outlined the background and thinking behind this legislation.</P>
      <P>These provisions have their origin in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, originally published as far back as early 1987. Part IX of that Bill made provision for the establishment of a new rescue procedure for companies experiencing difficulties. Towards the end of August 1990, in highly publicised circumstances, Part IX was hived off and enacted as the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>We should not, of course, re-open the Oireachtas debate on the Bill which eventually became the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990.  However, to the extent that there have been some loose references to the efficacy of the legislation, it may be helpful to outline the philosophy behind it and some of the main elements enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides that a company which is, or is likely to be, unable to pay its debts and in respect of which no resolution for a winding-up, or no winding-up order has been made, may apply to the courts to have an examiner <Col N="1232" /> appointed to examine the state of the company's affairs.  The court may in particular make an order appointing an examiner where it considers that it would be likely to facilitate the survival of the company, and the whole or any part of it, as a going concern.  In addition, where a receiver has been appointed to a company an application for the appointment of an examiner can be made within three days.</P>
    <P>The analogy that I have previously used is that the examiner is like a doctor tending to an ill, but not necessarily terminally ill, patient.  If he forms the opinion that the patient is terminally ill, he says so.  If he diagnoses that the patient can be saved, he draws up a &ldquo;survival plan&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Because of the way the Act is structured, with the examiner being appointed by and answerable to the courts, there is no direct role from a company law perspective for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Department where a company is brought under an examiner.</P>
    <P>The essential responsibilities of the examiner are to examine the affairs of the company with a view to determining whether or not the company can be put back on a sound footing.  The examiner is obliged to submit a report within 21 days of his appointment to the court and, if he is of the view that the company cannot be saved, he so reports to the court and the court can take whatever action it considers appropriate, including the discharge from the protection of the court of the whole or any part of the assets of the company or the winding up of the company.  On the other hand, where the examiner is of the opinion that the whole or any part of the undertaking is capable of surviving as a going concern, he is obliged to formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme or arrangement. When he has prepared such proposals he has to discuss them with the creditors and report back to the court and the court has then to consider whether or not it should confirm the examiner's proposals. Where the court confirms the proposals, they are binding on all of the creditors of the company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> It was, of course, recognised from the outset that parties might be reluctant to deal with a company to which an examiner has been appointed.  In particular, it was recognised that such a company might have difficulty ensuring continuity of supplies to enable the company continue to trade while under the protection of the court.</P>
    <P>After the Bill was published, the almost universal response was that one of the main difficulties to be faced by a company under court protection &mdash; and, of course, by the examiner &mdash; would be the reluctance of ordinary trade creditors to continue supplying the company during the protection period.  Such a refusal would be based on fear that the company might be wound up subsequently anyway, or a receiver appointed, after the company came &ldquo;out of protection&rdquo; and that they would, effectively, just be throwing good money after bad.</P>
    <P>Not alone would this apply to such ordinary trade creditors, so the argument goes, but also to suppliers of other forms of credit, for example, bank overdrafts which are often of very great importance in such circumstances.  If some special arrangements were not made for such suppliers, the company would invariably be faced with demands for &ldquo;cash on delivery&rdquo; and so on, and would not be able to obtain other forms of credit either. Indeed, suppliers would probably simply refuse to supply.</P>
    <P>The Act addresses this problem of ensuring continuity of supply by ranking any &ldquo;post-protection&rdquo; debts, certified by the examiner as essential for the survival of the company, as an expense of the examiner which must be paid before any other debts &mdash; even preferential ones &mdash; in the event that the company are subsequently wound up or a receiver appointed.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Act sets out the effect of the presentation of the initial petition and provides that, for a period of three, or in exceptional cases four, months from the presentation of the petition, or unless the petition is withdrawn or refused, the company will be deemed to be under the <Col N="1234" /> protection of the court.  During this time, the debts of the company will effectively be frozen, and no action can be taken by a creditor to enforce his debt.  Neither can proceedings for a winding-up of the company be commenced or a receiver appointed.  The purpose of this &ldquo;stay&rdquo; is obviously to preserve the status quo to allow the examiner to complete his inquiries in a less threatening environment.</P>
    <P>Several commentators have bemoaned the fact that such a short period is allowed for a rescue under the 1990 Act. However, I was, and remain, convinced that this is the right approach.  For one thing, I think it would be unreasonable to ask creditors effectively to stand aside, for any more than the shortest possible period.  There is also the point that, if a longer period were allowed, then, human nature being what it is, Parkinson's Law would inevitably apply, and considerable time could be wasted in the early stages. As it is, the examiner really has to &ldquo;hit the ground running&rdquo;, and that is the way I would want it to be.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Act requires the examiner to indicate, in his initial report, whether the &ldquo;patient&rdquo; can be saved.  If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, the Act required him to go ahead with rescue proposals, put these proposals to meetings of the members and creditors, and report back to the court.</P>
    <P>The company, examiner and creditors and members whose interests are impaired are entitled to appear and be heard at the court hearing, and there are provisions for creditors, who feel they will be unfairly prejudiced, to be heard. Furthermore, the court cannot confirm the proposals unless at least one class of members and one class of creditors whose interests are impaired accept them.  Once confirmed, however, the proposals are binding on all parties.  The court may make any necessary order for the implementation of the proposals, and where it refuses to confirm proposals, it can order the winding-up of the company or make such other orders as it deems fit.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, came into law <Col N="1235" /> on 29 August 1990.  According to the most recently available Companies Registration Office records examiners have been appointed to 116 companies &mdash; 61 in the Goodman Group; six in UMP.  In the most recently publicised case, United Meat Packers Limited, media reports have highlighted the delay in the payment of the moneys due to suppliers of product to the company while under the protection of the examinership.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the statutory provisions on examinership because of the difficulties in the UMP case. Undoubtedly the collapse of UMP has caused real loss and distress to a number of parties, particularly the employees in the companies concerned and also farmers who provided cattle to the companies in the belief and expectation that they would be paid quickly.</P>
    <P>I want to say clearly that it is my belief that the problems which have arisen in this case have not arisen because of the provisions of the law, but because of a much more fundamental reason &mdash; that the debts of the company were such that it could not be saved.  An Act such as the companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, cannot save all companies which are threatened with insolvency.  Neither can the Act be expected to provide for every circumstance that can arise when an examiner is seeking, in a short period of time, to find a way to save a company. Instead, the Act provides a means by which the High Court is involved in arriving at fair solutions to conflicting claims of creditors.</P>
    <P>An Act such as this can only provide the framework in which a balance can be struck between the conflicting claims of different parties.  The Act cannot set aside or disregard the rights of some creditors for the benefit of others.  That can be done only by a court on the basis of a set of principles set out in the Act and which have due regard to the legitimate interests of all involved.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, regrettable that a delay arose in the case of UMP in having payments made to farmers who had provided <Col N="1236" /> supplies to the companies concerned while they were under examinership.  The High Court judge who dealt with this matter yesterday explained cogently how this problem had arisen.  As he made clear, there did not appear to be any doubt that the sums due would be paid; the question was when?  The judge went on to say that the UMP Receiver was anxious that farmers be paid in full or to the fullest extent possible immediately. The banks by whom the receiver was appointed accepted that it was in their own interests that the farmers be paid.  I understand that following discussions this afternoon between my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Receiver, Mr. Donnelly, farmers who hold `examiner' cheques have been assured that if they present those cheques to the banks tomorrow morning they will be paid in full.</P>
    <P>One of the main criticisms of rescue systems operating in other countries is that they are too longdrawn out and too costly.  In the United States, for example, the &ldquo;Chapter 11&rdquo; procedure is, I think, generally considered, because of the costs involved, to be available only to the largest of companies and, indeed, that companies can seem to go on forever &ldquo;in Chapter 11&rdquo;.  I am convinced that, by keeping the period of court protection to three months, and by giving both the examiner and the court considerable flexibility and room to manoeuvre, the new system will be very useful alternative to either receivership or liquidation in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, the basic framework for examinerships was first published as Part IX of the Companies (No. 2) Bill as far back as early 1987.  Since then, they have been the subject of the most detailed debate in the Oireachtas and of detailed submissions from many interest groups.  Of course, it must equally be remembered that there previously was, and continues to be, existing legislation on the subject of company rescue, since sections 201 to 204 of the Companies Act, 1963, provided for court-sanctioned compromises or arrangements between a company, their creditors and members. <Col N="1237" /> However, the reality was that for various reasons these procedures were usually ignored as an option, with the result that many ailing but potentially viable companies may have needlessly gone to the wall over the years.  There was, therefore, a compelling need for a new approach. The basic purpose of a rescue procedure is to encourage companies to identify and face up to problems at an early stage and to provide a mechanism for appropriate remedial action.  It was vital to ensure that the Act was balanced, and equitable to all parties concerned, and I see the following features of the Act as contributing to this aim: first, close involvement by the High Court at various stages of the process; second, a clear definition of the role and powers of the Examiner; third, continuity of the business while the Examiner carries out his functions; fourth, the shortest possible period within which rescue plans must be drawn up and put in place, and finally, an assurance that the entire process is as cost-effective as possible, and within the resources of small as well as large companies.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that there can hardly be a greater guarantee of equity and fairness all round than the close involvement of the High Court in the proceedings involving the Examiner's appointment, in supervising his subsequent actions, considering his reports and hearing the views of other parties and, finally, in taking decisions as to the future of the company or companies concerned. The Oireachtas has been fit to so provide in companies legislation and there has been no evidence so far that the provisions have not been working effectively as designed.</P>

      <P>I support the motion before the House.  I wish to make it clear <Col N="1238" /> that I speak for our spokesperson. Deputy Noonan, when I say that the need for the re-establishment of Fóir Teoranta is obvious.  However, we do not want a Fóir Teoranta, as Deputy Roche indicated, that would be interfered with.  The Deputy referred to politicians interfering in the role of Fóir Teoranta in the past. Perhaps he was referring to Fianna Fáil who interfered on a regular basis with the workings of Fóir Teoranta.  I do not like to hear Members of this House saying that politicians interfered with the workings of Fóir Teoranta.  People should speak for themselves.  A new Fóir Teoranta, like any other business, should be run on a commercial basis, and be allowed to make commercial decisions, despite the fact that they are run by the State.  I would foresee a new Fóir Teoranta playing a completely new role as a rescue agency, with strict guidelines and approved procedures that would be carried out in the open.  We should be able to see that the right commercial decisions were taken in the interests of the taxpayer.  I do not want taxpayers' money squandered to save political necks in particular constituencies.</P>
      <P>The reason for the motion is, no doubt, highlighted by the failure of United Meat Packers.  I shall have a few remarks to make about that and, in particular, about the comments by the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few moments ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland today is in a unique position in that it has several agencies involved in job creation, for example, the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta. They spend large sums of taxpayers' money on the creation of jobs but we do not have one agency to rescue businesses in trouble.  The Culliton report shows that in the period under examination by that group £1.6 billion of taxpayers' money was spent on direct grants to industry. The number of jobs created for that huge sum shows up the tremendous cost to the taxpayer, which continues today.  Those figures do not take into account the loss of revenue to the State as a result of tax breaks given to various companies or the cost to the Exchequer of training and education.  I am not saying that we should <Col N="1239" /> not invest in the creation of jobs but I am drawing attention to the fact that we have many agencies concentrating on the creation of jobs but no agency to rescue jobs in trouble.</P>
    <P>Many of the companies in which jobs have been lost &mdash; UMP in particular &mdash; were Irish-based and provided significant employment in rural areas.  Valuable jobs were provided by industries who sourced much of their inputs here compared to foreign-based companies who, as indicated in the Culliton report, source only about 4 per cent of their inputs here.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense to spend vast sums of money, at horrific cost to the taxpayer, on the creation of new jobs through various agencies when we do not have a rescue agency working towards the preservation of jobs already in existence. Companies have gone out of business because they had no venture capital available to them.  That is the reason we need a rescue agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the reason UMP failed was that the company had become insolvent.  Who is the Minister to say that the company had become insolvent?  As my party's spokesman on Industry and Commerce at the time, I was involved in processing the companies legislation and setting up the office of the examiner. In the case of UMP the examiner did not get an opportunity to complete his work because there were no funds available to him.  If the Minister says that the reason UMP folded up was that they were insolvent from day one, one must question this legislation and the role of the High Court judge who decided on day one that an examiner should be appointed.  Why did the court agree to the appointment of an examiner if the Minister now says it was all a farce because the company were insolvent?  Who is the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell us the company were insolvent?  That was a matter for the examiner, under procedures set down in legislation.</P>
    <P>He was obliged to report back to the court within 21 days and set out a rescue package to save the company.  How can the Minister, the person responsible for <Col N="1240" /> the legislation, say that the company were insolvent thus leading to their closure, when the examiner did not have an opportunity to complete his work?</P>
    <P>The reason the examiner did not get an opportunity to complete his work is that he needed £7 million but the banks would not give him that amount.  The banks gave the examiner £3 million, which was not sufficient for him to complete his work.  The Dáil Official Report of August, when the legislation was debated, shows that I said that the one question that had to be answered was where the money would come from.  I asked who could save companies or jobs without access to funds.  The fundamental weakness in that legislation was that the examiner from day one could not be guaranteed funds.  An examiner must have funds available.  The banks will not advance the money if there is the slightest chance that a company might ultimately become insolvent because in that instance they lose their priority for debts due to them.  That is why they are slow to advance more money.  The Minister was right when he said that any funds advanced to the examiner under court protection and with the approval of the court have priority and are guaranteed as the examiner's expenses.  The court will not give authority to the examiner to borrow more than the value of the assets of the company.</P>
    <P>The legislation is well intentioned and has potential but it cannot work unless funds are made available to the examiner. An examination of the Dáil Official report will show that I also made this point during the Committee Stage debate on the Companies Bill.  It was politically foolish to abolish Fóil Teoranta and at the same time set up the office of examiner without determining the way the procedure would work.  Had Fóir Teoranta been operating the UMP examiner would have been in a position to approach that body, get his £7 million and continue trading.  There would not have been any loss to the taxpayer because the £7 million advanced would have been guaranteed under the legislation.  A rescue <Col N="1241" /> agency such as Fóir Teoranta would have saved the jobs.</P>
    <P>We should not put all our eggs in one basket, spend huge sums of taxpayers' money, borrowed money, on job creation and, at the same time, ignore the jobs being lost every day.  In fact, there are so many companies closing down daily that the news hardly gets one line in the newspapers.  Businesses going out of existence is becoming too common.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to comments by the Minister last night when criticising this motion.  He talked about the waste of taxpayers' money in a rescue agency such as Fóir Teoranta.  The Minister, and the Government, have shown no interest in saving existing jobs.  They did not come in here offering a solution.  We did not even have a proper debate in this House on United Meat Packers.  This affects not just one company; it affects regional policy, it affects the whole of the west and extends beyond the point of saving one single company.  This is about keeping people in rural Ireland, keeping the west and other parts alive.  There is a wider social aspect to this whole issue than merely the 900 jobs that have been lost.  This is a much deeper political issue than a strict economist view of whether it is or is not viable.</P>
    <P>We are being told it will cost the taxpayer in the region of £45,000 &mdash; there are various figures being advanced &mdash; to create one new job.  The cost of a new job is horrific compared with the amount that would be involved in the restructure of existing companies and/or their maintenance. I repeat that the legislation providing for the examiner was well intentioned, deserved support and will deserve support in the future; but we should not appoint someone an examiner, tie their hands behind their backs and let them pray that somebody will send money down from the skies so that they can perform their task.  It is up to the Government of the day to say: yes, we want this.  The House supports it.  We will ensure that funds are made available. It is the job of Government to ensure we have a banking system capable of <Col N="1242" /> supplying commercial capital.  Indeed, if the commercial sector do not do so, I have no hang-ups about saying that if the State can do so profitably, at no expense to the taxpayer, as it can in this case, why should the State not do so?  Yes, charge the going rate, the interest rate charged by the banks; but just make the money available, giving the examiner the chance to save these jobs.</P>
    <P>We do not want to hear Ministers come into this House telling us that the reason United Meat Packers failed was because the company was insolvent anyway.  That is the Minister making a laughing stock of his legislation.  I would ask the Minister of State present, if that was the case why the High Court agreed in the first instance to the appointment of an examiner, if that company had been insolvent from its inception?  In such circumstances an examiner should never have been appointed.  That is not the intention of this motion.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to a point made by Deputy Bell's colleague, Deputy Ferris, last evening when, much to my amazement, he spent the bulk of his contribution criticising the Fine Gael Party for having tabled this motion, giving the impression we were a group of right wing extremists who cared about nothing but profit and capitalism.  I should like Deputy Ferris to know &mdash; and I should like this to be recorded &mdash; that when the Fóir Teóranta Bill was presented to this House we, as a party, opposed it.  In fact, I went to the bother of checking today the result of the vote on Second Stage, held on 19 June 1990, which was 73 to 68.  Therefore, Fine Gael did vote against the abolition of Fóir Teoranta.  Fine Gael did vote against the abolition of NADCORP. Fine Gael oppose the Government's lack of policy in the overall area of job creation, the survival of existing jobs and the creation of new ones. Whether we like it or not, since 1987 the Minister for Industry and Commerce appears to have an opinion on everything but the activities of his Department.  I have yet to hear him come out forcibly with one bright idea in relation to job creation.  Yet he has an opinion when it <Col N="1243" /> comes to every other aspect of Government &mdash; for example, who should be a candidate for the Presidency; who should hold what position on committee.  He has an opinion on everything but I claim he is a total disaster as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He even contradicted himself this evening when he spoke about this legislation.  He does not even know what it is about.  He gave us a rundown presumably prepared by his civil servants, whom I compliment because it is very clear; but for a Minister for Industry and Commerce to say that United Meat Packers failed because the company had been insolvent from its inception and then continue to applaud the legislation appointing the examiner, when the examiner was never given an opportunity to complete his task, is totally unacceptable. Who is he to lecture us on whether the motion before the House is a good or bad one?</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about our commercial banking sector.  The reason many of us public representatives are contacted regularly by individuals struggling to remain in business is because our banking system &mdash; I do not want to appear to knock the banks for the sake of doing so &mdash; has come to a standstill.  It is impossible for bright young people &mdash; people on whom we have spent a fortune educating, training and encouraging to acquire entrepreneurial skills and attitudes &mdash; to get one penny to start up a new business here.  The one most valuable asset we have is comprised of the skills, ability and intelligence of our young people. Because we do not make capital available to them to use those skills to start businesses for themselves, rather than seeking employment from somebody else, they are not given even a fair chance. There is no finance available to assist them in initiating such new businesses.  If one can walk into a bank and give personal guarantees, one will get finance.  If one has a lot of personal wealth one will experience no difficulty in borrowing money.  If one has fixed assets one will experience no difficulty in borrowing <Col N="1244" /> money.  But who in their right mind would not loan money in those circumstances? There are now almost 300,000 people unemployed.  We have a very young population.  Our taxpayers expend large amounts of money educating and encouraging our young people to advance as far as possible in education. But what do we do with them when they reach the point of being ready for the job market, when they have acquired the ideas and ability and have the will to get going.  Nothing.  The reality is that nobody will lend them money.  I claim it is the responsibility of the Government of the day, whoever they may be, to ensure we have a banking system that operates effectively, ensuring that venture capital is available to help people in existing businesses and others to start up new ones.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining to me I want to point out that when the present Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, came into this House to abolish Fóir Teoranta he gave a number of reasons for his actions.  The main reasons he advanced are no longer acceptable.  For example, he said the economy had picked up and there was little demand for the intervention of Fóir Teoranta.  It is now self-evident that that is no longer true. Whether or not we like to admit it, our economy is in crisis.  Job losses mount on job losses daily.  The Government have not one single idea how to overcome that difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Government came up with the idea of a jobs committee.  In that respect a most extraordinary position has arisen. The idea of a jobs forum was promoted by Fine Gael through our party Leader, Deputy John Bruton.  It was something badly needed, a good, practical idea in an endeavour to resolve the difficulties confronting all of us as a nation.  What has happened?  Through proper public relations and good handling on the part of certain people representing the Government, Fine Gael are now being blamed for not participating in a jobs committee.  It was a unique, skilful exercise in public relations.  We in Fine Gael propose something as a bright idea and <Col N="1245" /> at the end of the day we are blamed for not participating.</P>
    <P>When we proposed a jobs forum we were serious about it.  If we are to have a jobs forum, let us have a really serious jobs forum.  Let us have Ministers available to discuss with their Opposition spokesperson ways and means of clearing the blockages in relation to job creation here.  But let us not have another committee to be chaired by some backbencher who may have been disappointed he did not get a Ministerial post; a committee comprised of others who may ramble in and out of committee meetings, as we witness on a daily basis, who believe they have fulfilled their function by merely attending such committee meetings.</P>
    <P>No doubt at times the clerk to the committee will have great difficulty in getting a quorum.  It was never the intention of the Fine Gael Party in proposing the establishment of a jobs forum to have that sort of set up.  If we are going to have a jobs forum the people who make the decisions, that is, the Government, should attend the committee &mdash; it is the very least they can do considering the fact that they have no other ideas &mdash; where they can discuss with their opposite numbers from the Opposition parties ways and means of dealing with the problem of unemployment.  They should not shove this issue into another committee manned by disappointed and disillusioned backbenchers of the Government party together with the Opposition spokespersons.  We should sit down and talk about the real issues and involve the social partners and the unemployed people who know what it is like not to have work.  We should not once again start fighting with each other to see who wins the PR war.  That is what has happened in this case.  I have to admit that the PR war is being won by the Government at present.  However, this will not solve the problem.  The problem will still exist.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have run out of time and there are many other points I would like to have made.  In the interests of <Col N="1246" /> doing something positive to create jobs, save jobs and make the legislation in relation to the examiner worthwhile I ask the House to support this motion.  If new rules and regulations have to be laid down for Fóir Teoranta I will accept that as I recognise the need for them.  I do not want the taxpayer to be throwing good money after bad.  That is not what we are proposing.  In the case of an examiner having been appointed, any moneys advanced by the rescue agency would be guaranteed at no loss to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>First, I thank Deputy Barrett for sharing his time with me, and I should like to start my contribution at the point he left off.  He referred to how dramatically circumstances have changed since the Minister brought legislation before the House to abolish Fóir Teoranta. As I recall it, on that day the Minister basically outlined four reasons for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta.  The first was that interest rates were at their lowest for a decade.  That situation has changed beyond all recognition.  Second, he said that inflation was at a very low level.  Inflation is still at a reasonably low level but it is on the up at present.  Third, the Minister said sufficient funds were available to the business expansion scheme to make the necessity for Fóir Teoranta obsolete.  We know we have made drastic changes in subsequent Finance Acts to curtail the business expansion scheme.  This is quite proper as there were some disgraceful abuses of that scheme but that reason is no longer valid.  Fourth, the Minister anticipated the introduction of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, to specifically set up the examiner process.  He said that this would provide a mechanism which would deter creditors for a period. These were the four reasons advanced by the Minister for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta.  As Deputy <Col N="1247" /> Barrett rightly said, those four reasons have changed utterly.</P>
      <P>It is correct that our attention ought to be focused again on the necessity for a rescue agency for potentially viable enterprises &mdash; I emphasise the term &ldquo;potentially viable enterprises&rdquo;&mdash; who have short term cash flow difficulties.  I have very serious doubts about whether we should regress to the old style Fóir Teoranta because I am satisfied that too often in the past Fóir Teoranta were used as a milking cow for inefficient business. Frequently the damage was already done when companies resorted to the services of Fóir Teoranta.  In these circumstances these firms very often went to the wall anyway.  Many companies who resorted to Fóir Teoranta for assistance did so because of inherent managerial weaknesses rather than for financial reasons. In addition, the manner of operation of Fóir Teoranta sometimes seemed to expose them to intolerable political pressure which ignored stark commercial realities.  Indeed, the nature of the political appointments to the board of Fóir Teoranta on occasions enhanced the potential for conflicts of interest.  Finally, the commercial banks were happy to be able to pawn off bad risk customers onto Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of a simple regression to the old style Fóir Teoranta who too often were regarded as a soft touch by the inefficient Irish businesses. Neither do I think that the taxpayer always got good value for the money spent through Fóir Teoranta.  Of course, it is indisputable that there were some success stories, but there were also many casualties.  The figures being bandied around in this debate in regard to the number of jobs saved by Fóir Teoranta, which range between 29,000 and 40,000, are expressly exaggerated.  I do not believe that the companies who retained that number of jobs can say in all accuracy that they were retained because of Fóir Teoranta intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having expressed these reservations about the functioning of the old style Fóir Teoranta, I am convinced of the necessity <Col N="1248" /> for some combination of rescue agency &mdash; venture capital company for potentially viable enterprises with short term difficulties. I concur entirely with the remarks made by Deputy Barrett about the availability of venture capital.  Most businessmen today will tell you that unless they can secure loans, produce collateral, give personal guarantees etc., it is extremely difficult to get working capital for potentially good enterprises.  I want to emphasise that I am talking about potentially viable enterprises because I see no merit in throwing good money after bad when it is evident that the firm in question are not viable or would be better dealt with by being transferred to more substantive owners through the normal receivership-liquidation process.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the reasons given by the Minister for Finance in 1990 for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta are no longer valid, if indeed they ever were.  I want to draw the attention of the House to a remark made by the Minister in the debate on 31 May, 1990, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Venture capital funds also exist on a significant scale, within an important role in this regard being played by public sector agencies such as NADCORP...</P>
    <P>I suggest that it will come as a great surprise to business people to learn that this venture capital is available on this grant scale.  As the House knows, we have abolished NADCORP since then.  I believe we never permitted that body to function as was envisaged.</P>
    <P>My party consider that the necessity for a rescue agency for potentially viable enterprises should be provided in the context of an overall review of industrial strategy.  There is no reason a division of the IDA or a specialist division of the ICC could not provide this service.  More important is the necessity to equip any such agency with the professional expertise to tackle the inherent managerial weaknesses which have often contributed to firms being put on a life support system.  In our document, A New Agenda for Industry, we recommended an executive <Col N="1249" /> tack force system where professionals could be deployed to work closely with the firms concerned.</P>
    <P>I was not entirely won over by the very defensive prformance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in defence of the examiner system.  There are good reasons that the examiner process should be looked at.  Deputy Barrett referred to the UMP case.  I could draw the attention of the House to a factory in my constituency, Atlantic Magnetics, with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is familiar, where the examinership process failed and where certain inherent weaknesses in the examiner process were highlighted.  There is a necessity to look at this process again.</P>
    <P>It is proper to emphasise the necessity for job retention because, at a time when we are talking about the scale of the mountain we have to climb in terms of job creation, it is crazy to lose jobs every day which need not necessarily be lost. Because of the banking system it is virtually impossible for many of the major domestic commercial banks to raise money for useful purposes for potentially viable jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to reiterate some of the main points made by the Minister here last night.</P>
      <P>The fundamentals of the economy and the public finances are in good shape.  In spite of recessionary conditions in our main export markets, GDP growth was about 2 per cent last year, with industrial exports rising by over 6½ per cent.  Despite our difficulties, non-agricultural employment increased by 4.3 per cent in the period 1988-91.  Nominal after tax incomes should rise by about 6 per cent this year.  Given the return of many former emigrants as job opportunities abroad dry up, and the cessation of emigration, average unemployment here is, unfortunately, likely to rise again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have taken a number of steps to combat unemployment.  They have implemented the new employment <Col N="1250" /> subsidy scheme, and the employment training scheme, designed for a total of 25,000 places.  The area partnership schemes envisaged under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to combat long term unemployment are up and running in 12 pilot areas.  The recent Report of the Industrial Policy Review Group represents a significant input to our approach to industrial policy and to how that policy can contribute to increasing employment and living standards. The task force to follow up on their recommendations, with the Task Force on Employment, will report to a committee of Ministers headed by the Taoiseach in order to accord the highest priority to this problem.</P>
    <P>On Fóir Teoranta, a number of points spring to mind.  Fóir Teoranta were never in a position to remunerate Exchequer advances made to them over the years and, at the time of their wind-up, the Exchequer had to write off £75 million of the £87.5 million then outstanding. Further, despite their main function of keeping firms and jobs in existence, the fact is that overall employment in manufacturing industry declined from 216,700 in 1973 to 182,900 in 1988.  In the years following their closure, manufacturing employment actually increased, back up to 194,000 in 1991.  Therefore, it would be very difficult to sustain an argument that the winding up of Fóir Teoranta had any negative impact on employment in the manufacturing sector, which was the sector in which they operated.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is very noticeable that industry itself did not object to the closure of Fóir Teoranta, nor has there been any demand from industry for their re-establishment. Industry has long since recognised that the Government's job has much more to do with creating the right overall economic conditions which facilitate the creation of long term sustainable employment.  Thus, non-agricultural employment in the private sector rose by over 70,000 in the period April 1987 to April 1991.  The Government's actions affecting areas such as interest rates, inflation, Exchequer borrowing, reform of the tax system etc, are far more <Col N="1251" /> insignificant than interventions at the individual firm level.  The Culliton report on industrial policy, which has been accepted broadly across all sections of industry, saw no place for a body such as Fóir Teoranta and indeed the whole thrust of that report would be against such State interventions.  Indeed, it seems extremely doubtful if the European Commission would accept the establishment of such a body today.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the IDA provide management guidance and support through a number of schemes outlined by the Minister last night.  They can also take a hand in restructuring cases, by helping new owners or investors in ailing firms to put together a commercially viable operation using the assets, skills and expertise already in existence.  Further, over £1 billion of expenditure supported by the Structural Funds will be spent on industry over the five year period ending in 1993.</P>
    <P>As regards the Examinership provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already dealt with this matter.  Suffice it to say that it would not be possible to justify the re-establishment of a body such as Fóir Teoranta to supply working capital to examiners.  Given that the expenses of examiners are a first charge on the assets of the company concerned, there should not be a need for State intervention.  Further, I am not aware of any company who have gone into liquidation as a result solely of the examiner being unable to obtain working capital.  It is not difficult to imagine that Fóir Teoranta if they were in existence, would be regarded as an easy source of financing in examinership cases, and could even assume the role of alternative banker, as happened in the past when the banks were not very eager to participate along with Fóir Teoranta in rescue cases.</P>
    <P>We are all very much aware of the difficulties being experienced by small creditors in the UMP case.  There appears to be a timing problem involved here. However, we are all hopeful that this matter will be resolved satisfactorily very <Col N="1252" /> shortly following the outcome of the recent High Court action.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this Government are serious in their determination to tackle unemployment by bringing about major improvement in the economic fundamentals, which is the best way towards creating and retaining long term sustainable employment in our economy. The resurrection of a body like Fóir Teoranta forms no part of that strategy and would involve turning back the clock, instead of progressing with sound economic and industrial policies.  It would not be in the best interests of the taxpayers of this country.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I strongly commend the Minister's amended motion to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he was not aware of any company having gone into liquidation as a result solely of the examiner being unable to obtain working capital.  If Fóir Teoranta had not been abolished in 1990 the UMP company could now be saved.  No effort was made by the Government to save them.  The Minister and the Government should take this matter more seriously than they appear to be taking it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing the Government should do is to ensure that farmers' cheques are paid.  As late as today, farmers still have worthless pieces of paper in their pockets as a result of the receivership.  A widow showed me a cheque for £308.61p yesterday which had been issued on 26 February 1992.  &ldquo;Under the protection of the court&rdquo; was printed on the top left hand corner under &ldquo;United Meat Packers&rdquo;. While people may say that £308.61p is not a large amount, it is to that lady who had a reactor animal collected from her by the Department of Agriculture and sent to United Meat Packers in Ballyhaunis. <Col N="1253" /> Since then she has been unable to obtain any money for her cheque.</P>
    <P>Farming organisations are making great play of the fact that farmers will not supply stock, etc.  There is no need for the farming organisations to make that play because nobody would be expected to supply stock to a factory when they cannot get money for the cheque issued. Six weeks after the cheque has been issued they still cannot get money. Tomorrow is the vital day in regard to this matter.  I appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Taoiseach &mdash; who was elected as a result of his regard for the west &mdash; to ensure that farmers who received cheques get money for them before anybody says that stock should be supplied to those factories.  It is no good saying when the closing dates for tenders are up on Friday that Goodman or some other company can buy those factories, because that would result in a monopoly in the west, which would be disastrous.  Already 40 per cent of sheep killed in the west were killed by the UMP factories; about 80 per cent of the Connemara hill lambs were killed in the UMP factories in Ballyhaunis.  No other factory can cater for this because the proprietors had built up a special trade for those lambs in Europe and the Eastern countries.  As a result, other factories would not be interested in having this kind of trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is present to represent the Government and may I ask if he or the Government have any interest in the west, in maintaining viable industries in the west, or in the far-reaching repercussions of factory closures?  If they were interested in the west they would ensure that the UMP cheques paid to farmers would be honoured and the farmers would get their money tomorrow.  I gave an example of only one cheque, but there are many instances where cheques to the tune of £10,000 or £11,000 are outstanding in payment for all cattle the farmer reared for the year, which were sent to the factory to be killed in February, and still the farmers has not received any payment for them.  This indicates the complete disregard of this <Col N="1254" /> callous Government for the west.  I ask the Minister of State to get this message to the Taoiseach and the relevant Ministers in order to ensure there is money to meet the farmers' cheques tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, may I thank the other parties for supporting this motion in my name on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, the Minister for Finance who took the debate last night and gave a very full reply and the Minister of State who is present for the conclusion of the debate tonight?  It seems to me that the main thrust of the case put forward by the Minister for Finance was that we were firmly on the road towards a market economy on all fronts; that old fashioned mechanisms such as intervention by state companies to rescue companies at risk, or rescue the jobs in those companies where no longer needed.  As the Minister said, intervention by state agencies to rescue companies and jobs was putting back the clock and was no longer needed because we were going down the road to a free market economy and in the case of a problem the examiner sections of the Companies (Amendment) Act were adequate to deal with any emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Minister is wrong on both counts.  First, we are a long way from a free market economy at present.  The Progressive Democrats, and indeed the Minister for Finance and other Ministers with economic portfolios, use all the language of free market economies, they expound all the theory of free market economics but even a cursory glance at our economy, as the Culliton report will show, indicated that it is bedevilled by intervention and we do not have the free market economy that the theorists on the Government side are propounding.  For example, last night the Minister said that marvellous progress had been made in making the tax system more pro-jobs, moving it away from capital investment and providing the taxation environment that is necessary for enterprise.  That theory has been expounded in the Book of Estimates speech, in the budget speech and it will be expounded again when we come to deal with the Finance Bill.  What <Col N="1255" /> happened in actual fact in the budget was that all the theory was expounded but when it came to abolishing tax breaks, reliefs and the various gaps through which the professionals can steer their clients, only £37 million was gathered by the Minister for Finance and £17 million of that will, in the next nine months, be taken from the changes in benefit-in-kind on company cars.  There has been no switch in relieving the burden of taxation on jobs and increasing the burden of taxation on fixed assets.  The Culliton report pointed this out among other things and the Government response is to set up a task force to examine the recommendations in the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>If we examine the way we deal with energy we know that maintaining Whitegate adds 15p or 16p to the price of a gallon of petrol or diesel.  The Culliton report recommended that the Whitegate mandate should be terminated.  I know the reason the Government were not enthusiastic about that proposal in the Culliton report, so they will ask the task force to look at that.  It is a clear example that whatever we call it, it is not free market economics when an arrangement is in place under the direction of the Government that artificially keeps up the price of petrol 15p or 16p higher than what it should be.  The Culliton report also recommended that NET, which is now known by a new name, would pay an economic price for gas to Bord Gáis Éireann.  Again, there was no great enthusiasm from the free marketeers, as represented by the Minister for Energy, to accept this.  I know that the political problems that will arise in the main industries around Cork harbour weigh heavier on the present administration than the theory they expound of free market economics.</P>
    <P>It was also recommended in the Culliton report that the Industrial Development Authority would be abolished and that it should be replaced by two agencies: one manned from the present resources of the IDA which would deal exclusively with attracting foreign investment into the country, and another which <Col N="1256" /> would be dedicated to the promotion of indigenous industries, and that the agency that would deal exclusively with indigenous industry would operate in the regions.  SFADCo would be a regional department of the new agency and Údarás na Gaeltachta would be another. I did not see the Members opposite making a mad dash to implement that recommendation either.</P>
    <P>While the Government, and especially the &ldquo;Lilliput&rdquo; partner in Government, talk in terms of free market economics, when it comes down to actually making decisions they do everything rather than take free market economy decisions.  If I thought we were going straight down the road which the Minister for Finance points to, I would not put down a motion to restore Fóir Teoranta, but, in the kind of economy we have, Fóir Teoranta are necessary because companies are folding up all the time and we need a body like Fóir Teoranta to intervene, to save jobs and to rescue companies.  In the last five years that they operated, they rescued 24,800 jobs and they intervened in hundreds of companies right across the country. I know they lost money since 1972, and a great deal of money was written off since 1972, but why hold up the example of the money that was written off which Fóir Teoranta invested in the highest risk areas of the economy, companies that were dying on their feet and had to be rescued, when nobody holds up the tab from the Industrial Development Authority? How much money did they pay out in grant-aid to start up industries that went down the tubes in the past 18 years? How much money from SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta went down the tubes?  We have the most interventionist economy outside the Eastern Bloc countries. If the Government are intent on dismantling all the interventions and were to take on board the recommendations in the Culliton report, I could understand their attitude to this proposal, but the type of economics that they practise is consistent with re-establishing Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1257" /> have both maintained that the examiner provisions in the Companies (Amendment) Act are an adequate replacement for the work that Fóir Teoranta did and that an examiner appointed under the auspices of the court can examine whether the company are worthy of rescue and subsequently get a mandate from the court and go ahead and trade that company out of their difficulties. What happens in practice is that the examiner is appointed and comes back to the court after 21 days &mdash; I do not know of any case where the courts do not proceed further &mdash; but when he tries to proceed further, he needs working capital.  The company's creditors will not advance working capital and he cannot in effect go to the company's bank and get working capital from the bank because when he attempts to do that the banks find that all the expenses of the examiner will have first call on the company's assets.  When a bank provides an examiner with working capital they are moving themselves down the preference scale and in effect they are worsening their own position.  They are cutting their own throats.  Banks are not State organisations or philanthropic bodies.  They are there to make a profit. What banker would willingly move the bank's existing debt further down the scale of claims and assets by providing working capital to an examiner?  These <Col N="1258" /> difficulties have been very well illustrated in the case of UMP.  I am glad to learn tonight that the courts have sanctioned the £2.5 million that is owed to farmers, but what about the 700 workers who have lost their jobs?</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I know you are disappointed that I have run out of time because you are listening to me very carefully.  We will be pressing this motion to a vote because there is an illogicality in the Government's position. That illogicality has been illustrated in the course of this debate, as have the gaps in the Companies Act since the Goodman affair in August 1990, which was the first time it was introduced.  The series of appointments of examiners since that legislation was enacted has worked very indifferently and it does not serve as a mechanism for rescuing companies in difficulties which deserve to be rescued.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `Council Directive' means Council Directive of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (85/337/EEC);'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to add a new definition to the definition section of the Bill.  Although reference is made in the <Col N="1261" /> body of the Bill to &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo;, it contains no definition of this term. Therefore, for the purposes of clarity, I ask the Minister to accept that &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo; means the Council Directive of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment.  The appropriate EC reference code is given.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's amendment seeks to include a definition of the term &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo; which is used in sections 1 and 8 of the Bill.  I am advised however that this definition is not necessary. Article 5 of the European Communities Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1989 inserted a definition of this term along similar lines to those proposed by the Deputy in section 2 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Because this Bill, when enacted, will be construed together with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1991 that definition will apply here also.  Accordingly, I ask the Deputy to agree to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>As we have many amendments to deal with, I do not want to labour the point, but those of us who contributed to the debate on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill during the past few weeks agreed that there was a need to ensure clarity in legislation.  Even for those of us who are reasonably proficient at reading legislation it is difficult to accept that when we come across a phrase in legislation such as &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo;, we are supposed to be inspired that we should look up the 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act to see what the definition is.  I do not think it is too much to ask, when specific terms are mentioned in the body of legislation, that they be defined.  It is neither here nor there that it is already defined in the 1963 Act and, for the purposes of clarity, this amendment should be accepted.  We should strive as far as practicable to make the legislation clear not only for practitioners <Col N="1262" /> but for members of the general public. There are probably umpteen precedents to explain why this is not done.  Perhaps we could have some degree of clarity in this legislation and proceed on that basis to a number of other amendments that will arise.</P>

If we were to go down the road the Deputy is suggesting we would have to include other areas in the same way.  It has never been the practice to specify what is already clearly specified in the body of legislation dealing with the same general area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) any person who, having met the statutory requirements, had lodged an objection to the appeal,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this an important amendment. In the definition section of the Bill, section 1, &ldquo;party to an appeal&rdquo; proposes to cover three categories of people.  The categories are: the appellant, who presumably would be the person who applied for the planning permission in the first place, the planning authority against whose decision the appeal is made, and the applicant for any permission or approval in relation to which an appeal was made by another person other than a person acting on behalf of the appellant; and &ldquo;party&rdquo; is to be construed accordingly. I want to insert here an addition <Col N="1263" /> to those categories, that is, &ldquo;any person who, having met the statutory requirements, has lodged an objection to the appeal&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to clarify what categories are covered by (a), (b) and (c) and whether he would not consider it better for clarity to include the extended definition which I now propose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would mean that any person who made submissions or observations to the board about the appeal would be regarded as a party to the appeal.  Under the Bill there would be two or three parties to any appeal, depending on the identity of the appellant.  In the case of an appeal by the applicant for planning permission there would be two parties &mdash; the applicant and the planning authority.  Where the appeal is by a person other than the applicant there would be three parties &mdash; the appellant, the applicant for planning permission and the planning authority.  The definition of &ldquo;party&rdquo; in section 1 of the Bill is essentially similar to the existing definition in planning law and I do not consider that it would be appropriate to confer formal party status on any other participant in the appeal.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputies that, for the first time, in cases not involving environmental impact assessment, the rights of persons who are not direct parties to the appeal to make their views known and to have those views considered is specifically provided for in section 8 of this Bill.  The board will have to take account of submissions made by such persons, including any further submissions that they may make as a result of requests from the board under section 9 of the Bill.  I therefore do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply because I consider that a person who has met the statutory requirements in objecting to an appeal being granted, including lodging any fees necessary, should be entitled to be considered a party to that appeal for the <Col N="1264" /> purposes of communication and consideration. Notwithstanding section 8 of this Bill, I do not think a person who has lodged an objection is treated equally with other parties to an appeal, and that would further diminish the rights of individuals to object to planning applications or planning appeals which might have a material effect on their interest.  I would therefore ask the Minister to reconsider accepting this extended definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of merit in the amendment proposed by Deputy Mitchell.  A situation can arise where the party making the appeal is the developer.  As it stands at the moment the party to the appeal is defined as the appellant, who in some cases may be the developer, the planning authority and if the appeal is by a third party, the applicant. However, where the developer is submitting the appeal and where there may be considerable local interest and community interest in opposing an appeal lodged by the developer &mdash; for instance, an appeal against certain conditions which might impinge on a local community or a local neighbourhood &mdash; the local community should have the rights afforded to a party to an appeal if they put in an objection to that.  As things stand, parties to an appeal have certain rights built into this Bill that other persons who are not party to the appeal do not have.  If Deputy Mitchell's amendment is not accepted then local communities, in situations where the developer is making the appeal, may find themselves at a disadvantage in the appeal process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputies are asking me to do here is to confer the same status on somebody who has an observation in relation to the planning appeal as that conferred on the parties who are directly involved.  The Bill as proposed does not limit in any way the rights of individuals in that area.  To confer the same status on both would be entirely unacceptable.  However, if individuals in that category feel so strongly with regard to the matter there is nothing <Col N="1265" /> in this Bill which prevents them from becoming a party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my support to the amendment.  It is patently obvious that there would be cases where a formal objector would have every right to be a party to a process and have the same rights.  I see no merit in excluding such a person.  I am not swayed by the Minister's argument that he would be conferring rights on somebody who would not be entitled to such rights.  If an objector has paid the statutory fees and is properly entitled to be considered as such, it is right that he would be considered as much a party as the applicant and the local authority.  There is great merit in the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in my earlier reply, for the first time we are conferring statutory rights on people in that category. Deputies should accept in that context that that is about as far as I can go to meet these considerations.  In the final analysis these new provisions accord new statutory rights on people who are submitting observations in relation to appeals.  If they wish to go further than that, there is nothing in this legislation which prevents them from becoming full parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to differ from the Minister and I would refer him to section 7, which says:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Board shall, as soon as may be after receipt of an appeal, give a copy thereof to each other party.</P>
      <P>(2)  (a) Each other party may make submissions or observations in writing to the Board in relation to the appeal within a period of one month beginning on the day on which a copy of the appeal is sent to that party by the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Any submissions or observations received by the Board after the expiration of the period mentioned in paragraph <Col N="1266" /> (a) shall not be considered by the Board.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where no submissions or observations have been received from a party within the period mentioned in subsection (2), the Board may without further notice to that party determine the appeal.</P>
    <P>This section gives parties to appeals rights to documentation, but it does not give an objector that right, perhaps a person who lives beside a proposed chemical factory. The Minister is from Tipperary and knows the famous case.  Is the Minister saying that a farmer who lives next to a proposed chemical factory should not have rights to documentation in an appeal?  Of course he should, and he should be considered to be a party to the appeal.  The Minister would be wise to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the argument that Deputy Mitchell has made.  I was dealing today, in a planning committee of Dublin County Council, with an application for an intensification of industrial use, changing one unit into three for light industrial use in an area backing onto a housing estate.  The residents, for very understandable reasons, object.  A planning authority can decide to grant permission but attach conditions to that permission relating to boundary treatment, hours of use, noise or whatever and the residents association, having made their case to the planning authority, may be happy with the planning permission granted.  However, if the developer is unhappy with the conditions attached and decides to appeal to an Bord Pleanála, he can do so and become a party to the appeal.  But the residents association are not a party to the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides a very restricted format for the exchange of documents between parties to the appeal.  There is only one shot at it.  Once one has sent in the appeal and the other side has replied, there is only one shot at answering the reply and that shot is only open to a party to the appeal.  Somebody who is not a party to the appeal cannot as of right <Col N="1267" /> see the case that has been made by the developer and is entirely dependent on the planning authority.  They should have a right to see the documents that are being exchanged and to comment on them.  They should have the same rights as a party to the appeal.  The definition the Minister provides for here excludes that possibility; Deputy Mitchell's amendment includes it.  The Minister should at the very least give this further consideration before the next Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have good news for the Deputies in the sense that where we have a consistent situation with regard to identified parties, where we for the first time give new statutory rights to people who have observations to submit with regard to appeals, and where I intend in the context of the regulations to make everything that is applicable here as transparent as possible, I do not know how much further I can be expected to go.  In the final analysis the persons whom the Deputies seem to represent, who conceivably could have an injustice done to them, have the fundamental right to become appellants.</P>

      <P>The Minister is clearly not in command of his brief.  There is a major void in this Bill and those organisations which have criticised this Bill as curtailing the rights of individuals and organisations are absolutely correct.  In a case where an Taisce or some other organisation &mdash; for instance, a residents association &mdash; lodged an objection to a planning application and were successful and the applicant appealed, the applicant would be treated as a party to the appeal, as would the local authority.  But the <Col N="1268" /> person who succeeded in getting the planning permission turned down will not be considered to be a party.  Does the Minister not see that he is creating an anomaly here?  The amendment was drafted so as to give the Minister an opportunity to put in statutory requirements with regard to third parties.  I would urge the Minister to take this on board as a reasonable, sensible amendment.  The Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment in this form or to indicate that he will put forward an amendment to the same effect on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not addressed the issues in any of his comments. Deputies on this side are arguing that there are people who are quite properly party in some circumstances to an appeals process but under the definition they will be excluded from participation. The Minister has not addressed either of the two instances which have been put from this side of the House.  The first instance is one with which I am familiar &mdash; where permission is granted but conditions are appealed by the developer. The people who insisted on the conditions in the first instance would not be parties to the appeal.  Surely that is an injustice.  It will cause great aggravation and frustration if we do not allow such people to legitimately have their say and have sight of the documents within the very tight timeframe and to put their side of the argument, particularly if their side of the argument was the convincing one when the local authority made their initial decision.  If the Minister addressed the point put from this side of the House we might see why he is not accepting the amendment, but the Minister has not made any case for his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was introduced ostensibly to speed up the planning process. No doubt in the course of the Committee Stage debate we will have plenty of time to air that proposal, but the effect of turning down this amendment may well be to slow down the appeals procedure. The Minister is in effect encouraging additional appeals.  If a third party <Col N="1269" /> wish to guarantee that they will be a party to an appeal they will themselves have to lodge an appeal.  If I as a member of a residents' association lodge an objection against a certain development and the planning authority turn it down or attach conditions.  I then have to make up my mind as to whether the developer will appeal.  If he does so, I no longer have right of access to documentation and so on.  The only way I can get that access is by putting in an appeal of my own.  This will put third parties to unnecessary expense since fees for making an appeal have reached an exorbitant level.  People will be forced to lodge safeguard appeals to protect their rights in the event of the developer making an appeal.  This is encouraging the lodging of unnecessary appeals which could be avoided if the Minister put into the legislation the rights we are seeking for third parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become an established practice for third party observations to be taken into account in planning appeals.  For the first time I am providing statutory rights for these people.  Section 8 specifies the conditions. The board are obliged to take account of these observations.  There is ample scope in those provisions without extending them to the degree Deputies wish.  On the basis of any knowledge that I can gather in connection with planning appeals procedures in most parts of Europe, we have a very open, fair and balanced system which takes account of all considerations.  The conferring of new statutory rights on the people whom Deputies seek to represent is a welcome step forward.  That is as far as I can go in this regard.</P>

      <P>I can well understand the Minister's not wishing to extend the status of party to everybody who makes a submission in relation to a planning appeal.  There can be vexatious or incidental submissions which are not central to the issue.  However, I cannot understand why he should wish to exclude a person or group who were a major party <Col N="1270" /> involved in the original application, either for or against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is refusing to give them the status of party.  I cite the case of An Taisce who may have successfully lodged objections to a planning application.  The case is appealed and because they are not a first or second party they will not be treated as a party at all.  They will not have the rights of a party as provided by section 7.  That is a major mistake.</P>
      <P>A group like An Taisce, a residents' association or an individual who may live next to a proposed project and whose property, lifestyle and amenity could be adversely affected by that proposed development may have successfully lodged objections at planning application stage, but in the event of an appeal the objector does not have rights as a party. The Minister must know that he is wrong. I accept that he might want to distinguish between that category of person and other individuals or groups who may not have been central to the original planning application and any objections thereto.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider, otherwise he will be giving a very large benefit to applicants as distinct from objectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all cite specific cases.  I am familiar with a light industry in my home town which causes quite a problem in relation to noise.  It applied for planning permission in a largely built-up area and received permission with certain conditions regarding working hours, operations and noise output.  Should that company appeal those conditions the residents who successfully raised the original objections need not necessarily be aware of the appeal.  They would have the right to make submissions under section 8, but not the right automatically to have the documentation.  There is a very strict timeframe of one month from the date of lodgement of the appeal for any submissions to be received.  They should <Col N="1271" /> have the documentation as of right if they were formal objectors in the first instance.  I do not see that this would be difficult from an administrative point of view.  We are not talking about people who have made observations.  The amendment is quite clear in that it refers to people who have made formal objection in compliance with the statute.</P>

People who are party to an objection to a planning application in the first place will not be party to an appeal and will not be entitled under this Bill to get the new documentation submitted at the appeals stage.  Therefore they will not be able to rebut or comment on the submissions made by the appellant or the local authority. That is manifestly wrong.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" />&ldquo; `publication' means a notice published in a newspaper which has general circulation in the area of the proposed development.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment defines the term &ldquo;publication&rdquo; as being a notice published in a newspaper which has general circulation in the area of the proposed development. It relates to amendments Nos. 16c and 18a, which deal with the section of the Bill that prescribes the appropriate period within which an appeal may be made.</P>
    <P>The general idea under the Bill is that an appeal must be made within a month. A full statement of appeal under other sections of the Bill that will be debated later must be made in the initial statement of appeal made to the board. However, there are several problems in relation to the period of a month.  The amended section 26 (5) (f) contained in section 3 (a), defines &ldquo;the appropriate period&rdquo;.  In the case of the applicant the period of one month dates from the day of receipt by him or her of the decision of the planning authority.  In other words, the developer has a clear month from the time of receipt of notice from the planning authority of the planning authority's decision.  However, in the case of third parties, the month dates from the day of the giving of the decision by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>In the submission most Members present in the House will have received from An Taisce an interesting point is made in relation to the length of time it normally takes local authorities to get their planning lists back out to the public. I might quote from the An Taisce submission which states:</P>
    <P>Local authority planning lists often in the case of a large planning authority like Dublin Corporation &mdash; which issues a weekly list &mdash; do not reach An Taisce until 17 days after a particular decision.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities such as Wicklow County Council only compile a monthly planning list.  For example its <Col N="1276" /> January 1992 list only reached An Taisce on 7 February 1992.</P>
    <P>Therefore, third parties do not have a month within which to prepare their appeal.  In the case of many individual citizens it might be right up to the month before they become aware that the planning authority have taken the decision. In the case of people dependent on local authority planning lists being issued to them, as has been pointed out here, two weeks or more may elapse after a decision will have been taken.  If I may use the phrase, we do not have &ldquo;a level playing pitch&rdquo; here as far as developers and third parties are concerned.  Indeed, it is a feature of this Bill that the balance of advantage is being tilted significantly in favour of the developer and significantly away from communities, residents' associations, community organisations and individual citizens.</P>
    <P>At the very least this period of one month should be the same for both the developer and for third parties.  The formula I propose is that there should be a requirement on the planning authority to publish their decisions in a newspaper generally circulated in the area of the proposed development.  There is already an obligation on applicants to publish a notice in newspapers; that is just at the application stage.  It is now fairly common for many local newspapers, as a matter of routine, to carry a report on planning decisions or very often publish a list of planning decisions taken by local authorities.  However, this is inconsistent, sometimes they do and sometimes they do not.  Sometimes they carry the more significant ones and so on.  For example, many community organisations make arrangements, through newsletters and so on, to circulate to their local communities the decisions of the planning authority.  In many such cases by the time an individual citizen gets to read the list the month will have expired.  This period of one month is critical in that if one has not lodged one's appeal within the month, one has no rights; not only that, if one has not made one's full statement of appeal <Col N="1277" /> within the month one does not have any rights.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this period of one month is very important for both the developer and the public in that they should both have the same starting point.  The month should be exactly the time for the developer and for the public.  It is very unfair that a developer, who will already have undertaken all his professional work on an application will then in the event of an appeal, probably have the bulk of his case already prepared.  However a member of the public or a community organisation, when they discover the decision has been taken, may have to search for a planning consultant, an engineer or somebody else to help them put their case together.  At the very minimum, a developer should not have an advantage in that his month begins from the date he receives notice of the decision of the planning authority, while the month in the case of everybody else is the date from which the decision is made. At the very least a developer automatically has a few days advantage in that formula; in practice, a developer probably has two to three weeks' advantage, in most cases.  In addition, he will also have the advantage of knowing what is the score whereas a member of the public may not be so aware at all.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for people not to spot a planning application advertisement in a newspaper.  I came across a case recently of somebody who found a factory literally being built onto their garden wall.  They had not spotted the planning notice when it was published in the paper for the very good reason that they were on holiday at the time.  For that reason also there should be an obligation on the planning authority to publish a notice of their planning decisions.  It would not be very costly.  It need not be a full page advertisement or anything of that nature, but a simple, standard notice in the statutory notices columns of whatever papers are circulated in the locality clearly setting out the planning decisions taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three amendments to section 3 which endeavour to <Col N="1278" /> address the same issue, all of the same import, that is, as Deputy Gilmore said, first, to try to adhere to the spirit of everybody having the same length of time in which to prepare for or respond to an appeal.  The timescale set out in the Bill is one month, a very tight timescale, one I am not convinced is wholly justified. We are anxious to help the Minister in relation to the whole application of appeals which is what the Bill is all about. We want to set the tightest timescale consistent with fairness and good planning.</P>
      <P>It is important that, in the actual lay out of the regulations and procedures to be followed, we should be seen to treat all people in like manner.  Quite clearly there is a discrepancy in the lay out in section 3 in how a developer is notified, in that the time starts ticking from the time he is notified, and the time a third party is notified and the time starts ticking. In the Minister's phraseology in any other case the period of one month begins on the day of the giving of the decision which might not be the same date as that on which the third party is made aware of it.  An Taisce and other such groups are very concerned because they meet monthly and weeks might elapse before they might become aware of a planning decision.  I would be concerned to ensure that any third party would have the same timescale, reasonably, to prepare their response to any such appeal.</P>
      <P>The mechanism by which the actual decisions are made public is a very important issue.  I am minded to support Deputy Gilmore in his amendment No. 2a in which he defines the term &ldquo;publication&rdquo; which he then uses to amend section 3 in his amendment No. 18a, which is better than my amendment No. 18, which uses the term &ldquo;making public&rdquo; as opposed to defining clearly what &ldquo;making public&rdquo; means which is publication in a newspaper circulated in the relevant area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will all be aware of the lengths to which some people will go, even in terms of the normal planning application process, to render it as inconvenient as possible for anybody to be aware of their <Col N="1279" /> development intentions.  For example, sometimes they print notices in evening newspapers that might not be popular in one part of the country or another, in national newspapers that might not have a great circulation in one part of the country or another, or even print them in Irish.  This used be popular at one stage and, of course, not everybody is conversant with the first official language. It is a ruse sometimes used by people to blunt others awareness of it.  In terms of making people aware of planning authorities' decisions it is a very useful suggestion that there be a column, which I do not think would be all that expensive, in which planning authorities would publish their planning decisions on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>Most people would welcome that practice. I know that in one of the two planning authorities of which I am a member, we circularise members with planning decisions on a fortnightly basis, broken down into areas, with a nice little chart, with cross-references, so that we can clearly ascertain what is involved.  If that is done for members of a local authority it should be done for the public as well without undue cost.</P>
    <P>There are two strands to the amendment now grouped together.  First, planning decisions should be published and that information made available to the general public.  Second, all parties to an appeal should, within reason, have the same amount of time to respond to any such decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to accept the intent of this group of amendments.  The wording proposed by Deputy Gilmore in his amendment is perfectly acceptable to me and I am prepared to accept his amendment and withdraw mine, if that is acceptable to the Minister.  I agree with Deputies Gilmore and Howlin that we should be seeking to include in planning legislation the right of people potentially affected by planning applications to know about such applications in good time.  We need to clarify and expand the requirements in <Col N="1280" /> regard to publication of notices of proposed developments in newspapers and at the sites.  Later amendments deal with the requirement to place notices at the site of the proposed development.  My amendment No. 51 proposes that the planning authorities should publish on a weekly basis in a local newspaper with wide circulation a list of planning applications and appeals received.  I hope the Minister will accept one of the amendments.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputies Howlin and Mitchell have indicated their preference for the wording proposed in Deputy Gilmore's amendment which is the best proposal for dealing with this issue.  I agree totally with the points made by the Deputies.  I hope the Minister will adopt a commonsense attitude to this issue.  A very strong case has been made by the previous speakers for acceptance of one of the amendments by the Minister. It is a very reasonable request.  I will be very disappointed if the Minister does not accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the definition of the word &ldquo;publication&rdquo; proposed by Deputy Gilmore.  I am not well versed in planning matters as I am not a member of a local authority and I am competing here against people with immense experience in these matters.  Nevertheless, I am aware of a general dissatisfaction among people about the way notices are printed in newspapers.  One could argue that the placing of a notice in one newspaper is not sufficient.  It is a question of striking a balance.  If we decide that a notice should be published in four newspapers some people who buy the fifth newspaper may not see the notice.  I am not sure where the balance lies but one could argue that the notice should be advertised in two newspapers.  I am interested in hearing if there is support for my suggestion. I may consider tabling a suitable amendment on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern which underlies the amendments proposed by the Deputies, that persons other <Col N="1281" /> than the applicant for planning permission should know about the planning application in good time and the need for them to have in their possession the decision of the planning authority within a certain time.  Apart from notifying the applicant, a planning authority are also required, by regulations, to give notice of their decision to any person who makes submissions to them about the application. I have noted the strong views of the Deputies in regard to the procedures for notification and the need to improve them.  However, this is not a matter which should be included in primary legislation. I am advised that this matter should be dealt with by way of regulations.  In my review of the planning regulations I will bear in mind the views expressed and ensure, as far as I possibly can, that persons in that cetegory will receive from the local authority at the earliest practical time all of the information necessary to enable them to make their appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>Will the Minister elaborate on the present procedure?  There seems to be varying practices between local authorities.  Is the procedure covered by regulations or law?  If it is covered by regulations, what are the regulations? Why do local authorities have different requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Howlin and Mitchell for their support.  It shows a degree of generosity and willingness by Members on this side of the House to take on board other people's points of <Col N="1282" /> view.  Perhaps the Minister will take note of this.</P>
      <P>I take some encouragement from the Minister's statement that he will take note of the points made during the course of the debate when reviewing the regulations. However, I do not agree with him that this is not a matter for primary legislation.  Two situations are described in section 26 (5) (<i>f</i>) of the primary legislation which provides that the applicant will get a full month's notice of the proposed development and everyone else will get less than a month's notice.  That is the issue we are here to address.  I presume the Minister is not suggesting that the primary legislation should be amended by way of regulation.  I do not see how that can be achieved.  The problem created in the Bill will have to be addressed by way of amendment.  At the very least everybody will have to be given a month's notice, and not a full calendar month for applicants and a lunar month or some other kind of month for everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue which arises is publication, an idea which should be taken on board.  I take the point made by the Minister that persons who have made submissions, observations or objections to a local authority about a planning application are notified by the local authority. At the very least the Minister should accept an amendment which would provide that people who have made submissions or observations should receive a month's notice of their decision. This would put them on the same footing as the applicant.  If they are getting notification from the local authority it should not be, in their case, the date from which the month starts.  I will be delighted if the Minister when reviewing the regulations takes into account whatever views are expressed in this House.  However, he still has to address himself to the fact that the provision in the Bill is unequal as between the applicant and everybody else.  It is an unjust, unbalanced decision and it will have to be amended.  I put forward one formula and Deputy Howline and Deputy Jim Mitchell also put <Col N="1283" /> forward a formula each.  If there is another way of doing it I am open to suggestions, but it will have to be done because it would not be right to pass legislation through this House which confers an unfair advantage on the developer to the detriment of third parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the question put by Deputy Jim Mitchell in regard to the 1977 planning and development regulations.  Section 24 of the regulations states that notice of every planning application and the date of its receipt shall be published by a planning authority by inclusion in a weekly list. Section 32 states that where a planning authority have given notice of a planning application to a body in pursuance of Article 25, the authority shall notify the body of the decision of the authority in respect of the application within seven days.</P>

      <P>I was asking about notices in newspapers regarding planning applications.  I know it is required in the Dublin local authority area, but it varies round the country.  Is there a regulation or power at present requiring that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there is no such regulation on power in relation to publication in newspapers, but we are talking about what we will try to achieve in future.  In the context of the new planning regulations I hope to introduce a uniform set of regulations which will take account of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings us back to the fundamental question of whether matters like this can be dealt with in the context of primary legislation or through regulations. I indicated to Deputy Gilmore and others in an earlier reply that I would take on board the strongly expressed views of Members of the House in this context and that I hope to be able to address them to the fullest possible extent <Col N="1284" /> in the context of the regulations.  For that reason I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not clear. The Minister said that he accepts the principle of what the Deputies on this side of the House want to achieve but that he wants to do it by way of regulations and not by altering the primary legislation.  The proposal in my amendment is very modest, simply to take away &ldquo;giving&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;making public&rdquo;. As far as I am concerned, it is not really adequate and that is why I support Deputy Gilmore.  If we leave it as it is it will be the law of the land and the Minister will not be able to change it by regulation. There are two mechanisms for starting the clock, if you like, for two different categories of parties to an appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Bill as a whole we are trying to get a proper balance and to be as fair as possible in every type of situation which one can envisage.  We are seeking to streamline planning, not to take away any fundamental rights.  There is broad agreement in the House that we should try to achieve these broad objectives because there is a real need for development.  A great number of applications are under consideration at various stages at local authority level and by the planning appeals board.  The question of ensuring that we get proper decisions will be maintained, but the speed at which we get them will very largely determine how we address the question of employment in many parts of the country.  I am satisfied that we have, in the context of the provisions in the Bill or in the regulations which will follow, achieved a balance.  I do not accept that the developer will have any undue advantage.  The board will be obliged to take account of all the objections and submissions and there will be ample time for everybody concerned to make a case, appeal, lodge objections and have them considered in a fair, broad and open-minded way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1285" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take issue with something the Minister said.  He is greatly mistaken if he takes the view that there is broad agreement in the House about the nature of this Bill.  Certainly, I regard it as very dangerous legislation, the purpose of which is not so much to streamline the planning process and the planning appeal system but to seriously infringe the rights currently enjoyed by third parties in relation to appeals.  The motivation for this Bill has come from developers from the construction and industrial side of development who have put pressure on the Minister to reduce and limit the opportunities for third party appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for development, which indeed I accept; but if you look at the facts the arguments made about the need for this Bill have been greatly exaggerated.  For example, in 1990 there were 42,000 planning decisions by local authorities; only 7 per cent, 3,000, were appealed to An Bord Pleanála; only 30 per cent of the appeals were made by third parties; in fact, over 70 per cent of the appeals were made by the applicant in the first place.  In other words, we are talking about 2 per cent of all planning decisions being appealed by third parties.  It is interesting to note that, of that tiny amount of planning decisions appealed by third parties, in 90 per cent of the cases the planning authority's decision was either overturned or significantly changed.  Only a tiny fraction of third party appeals did not make some progress at the planning appeal stage.  A huge campaign then evolved suggesting that the big obstacle to development was third party planning appeals.  That is a load of nonsense.  The big problem in regard to delays at the appeals stage, as the Minister knows, was the shortage of staff and resources with which An Bord Pleanála had to cope for a very long time.  Despite that evidence, this massive campaign developed and the Bill has now been introduced.  Its purpose is to limit the right of third parties.  They must make the appeal within a month.  First, they must lodge the appeal within one month; they must state their case in full and they get one opportunity only to refute the <Col N="1286" /> reply from the developer.  The rights of people other than parties to the appeal are very seriously infringed and the whole process must be over and done with in a period of four months no matter how large or complex the application may be, or whether an environmental impact study is involved.  On top of all that, the number of days in a month for the applicant is different from the number of days in a month for the third party.  In my amendment I am seeking to have the same length of time applied to everybody.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for the Minister to say he will deal with this by way of regulation.  The Minister has put into the primary legislation a different number of days for the applicant and for the third party and I want to see this ironed out before it gets past this stage.  I want to see the same number of days in a month applying to everybody and that is hardly an unreasonable request.  It has not been clarified whether a 31-day month or a 28-day month is involved but for argument sake let us say it is a 28-day month.  A 28-day month will apply to the developer and if the postal system is good and the planning authority get their list out on the same day, it might at the very best be a 25 or 26-day month for third parties. In all probability, for most third parties it is a 14-day month.  We should get this point right before we proceed because this is not a matter for regulations.  It is in the primary legislation and it will have to be sorted out in the primary legislation. My amendment is a lay person's attempt to try to deal with it.  Members on this side of the House do not have the assistance of parliamentary draftpersons and we have to make the best stab we can at it.  That is my best stab at it.  If the Minister has a better solution to deal with that problem, I am open to it, but if he cannot offer us a better solution this evening, I will certainly wish to press my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the Minister's previous comments.  We have said that the developer or the applicant, where they are the appellant, will have a <Col N="1287" /> calendar month to make their case but in fact it could be as long as they need because if the applicant is on holidays in the Costa del Sol, I presume the month does not start until they receive the notice.  If they are out of the country for weeks, will the month start when they receive the notice?  How long will their month be?  The other party's month, however, is very curtailed indeed.  It starts the day the notice is received by them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am concerned that the two categories of parties to the appeal process would actually have the same length of time to deal with the matter. There is a very clear argument being put from this side of the House for this.  As I have said, our amendments are not exactly revolutionary in their impact and I do not think they will do a huge amount to address that imbalance, as they only go one small step of the road to address the imbalance between the two categories of parties.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept this amendment to the primary legislation.</P>

I said earlier this evening that we <Col N="1288" /> have, and hopefully will always have the type of planning appeals system which many countries are not prepared to provide.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore tried also to convey the impression that there was a small number of applications about which we may be concerned.  Approximately 1,100 applications are before An Bord Pleanála at any one time.  If we translate that into development in the country, having regard to the number of applications passed by An Bord Pleanála, we will begin to see the extent to which they are interwoven with development and employment.  Let us get that point out of the way.  There is no pressure from any one group trying to influence the Government in the context of what we are trying to achieve.  Indeed there is very broad agreement in this House, in the main, in reaching decisions which facilitate that streamlining.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that I would try to ensure that the regulations which will follow the passage of this Bill meet the expressed needs of Deputies in giving the fullest possible opportunity to anybody who wishes to lodge an appeal.  However I have decided on the force of argument and my normal goodwill to the Deputies on the other side of the House and my wish to facilitate them wherever I can, to reconsider this provision to ensure that the same starting time applies to both categories.  I will come back to the more detailed analysis of this and how it will be achieved on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister is yielding on this point.  It makes a lot of sense.  However, on the question of streamlining, there are other aspects of the Bill which also need to be streamlined, for example section 6, although I do not want to go into the substance of it now.  That section provides that it will apply from the day it was sent by the board to the planning authority.  That could take five or six days by post and at least seven days over Easter or Christmas.  It should be the day on which it is received by the planning authority.  I hope that when the Minister <Col N="1289" /> is considering streamlining he will consider points like this.</P>
      <P>When using the word &ldquo;sent&rdquo; the Minister should look at the means of communication by modern technology and require for instance that it should be sent by fax so that it is received on the same day.  There are other methods by way of modern technology which will eliminate avoidable delays so that if it was sent by fax, the local authority would receive it the same day it was sent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 40, after &ldquo;may be&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to proper planning and environmental considerations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2 defines the duty and objective of the board.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Board to ensure that appeals and other matters with which it is concerned are disposed of as expeditiously as may be....</P>
      <P>That is the nub of the Bill.  I have no fundamental disagreement with the Minister in trying to dispose of appeals expeditiously so long as that expedition does not trample on the rights of ordinary citizens and that justice and common rights are vindicated in it.  To make that crystal clear I am seeking to insert in the section the simple phrase &ldquo;subject to proper planning and environmental considerations&rdquo; so that the expedition would not be the be all and end all, that there would be a qualifying break put in for proper planning and environmental considerations.  This particular clause is an aspiration, or what our American cousins would call a &ldquo;mission statement&rdquo;. It seeks to set out the purpose and <i>raison d'etre</i> of the board.  It should be tempered in the way I suggest to ensure that the expedition &mdash; I think there would be agreement to this from all sides of the House &mdash; should apply to appeals and always be subject to proper planning and proper environmental considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support that amendment; indeed, it is one I should have tabled myself.  Deputy <Col N="1291" /> Howlin, who has much greater experience in these matters, beat me to it.  The environmental aspects are absolutely essential and I am sure other Deputies on this side of the House will enthusiastically endorse this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this amendment.  I do not think Deputy Garland should consider he has a monopoly on environmental concern or a patent on all potential amendments to this Bill. Deputy Howlin's amendment is a very good amendment.  He is correct in saying there is a need to state the <i>raison d'etre</i> because much concern has been expressed.  I know the Minister responded by saying there are 1,100 appeals at any one time before An Bord Pleanála.  However, I recall that the explanatory memorandum to the Bill &mdash; I do not have it with me &mdash; stated very distinctly it was not intended to provide any additional staff or resources to An Bord Pleanála as a result of this Bill.  As I said earlier, the problem with the large number of appeals before An Bord Pleanála at any one time has to do primarily with shortage of staff and shortage of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a public concern that this Bill is the product of pressure &mdash; the Minister refuted this earlier.  I have in front of me a chronicle from the Cork Environmental Alliance describing a campaign conducted in the media over a period between June and November 1991, a short time before this Bill was actually published.  In it is listed a number of very prominent people in public life, industrial life and so on making calls for changes in he planning appeal process.  They talked about the number of appeals and the delays.  Significantly, many of these calls are now essential features of this Bill.  For example, the four month idea surfaced time and again in the public statements made by many people calling for changes in the planning appeals system.  There is documentary evidence to show that, and I do not think there is anything necessarily wrong in that.  It is perfectly in order for an organisation representing industrialists <Col N="1292" /> or whatever to make their case publicly and to lobby and apply pressure &mdash; there is nothing wrong with that &mdash; but in all honesty we should acknowledge that this is where this Bill had its origins. Because of public concern it is important to insert in the Bill a statement that the expedition of appeals is subject to proper planning and environmental considerations as contained in Deputy Howlin's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I am against clogging up legislation with words which, though they may sound attractive, are not necessary for the purposes of establishing law.  It is clear from the Planning Acts that An Bord Pleanála must deal with any appeal by reference to the proper planning and development of the area in question.  This obligation will not be prejudiced or affected by the board's general duty under section 2 (1) to deal expeditiously with cases.  I should add also that this provision simply restates the board's existing duty under section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983.  In these circumstances I am unable to acept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin and others will appreciate that proper planning and environmental considerations have to be part of how any board would deal with these and other matters and merely adding these words is unnecessary.  If it is considered that An Bord Pleanála would act in any other way, then the provisions we are enacting here would make an awful lot of nonsense.  It is fundamental that that is and will be the case.  Deputy Howlin is smiling; he knows he is gilding the lily.  The inclusion of those words is unnecessary.  I want to assure him, and indeed all others, if there is need for further assurance, that these considerations are properly enshrined already.  It is the duty of the board to deal with appeals by reference to the highest standards in all these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>These few words of clogging are very important.  What the Minister has set out in section 2 is the <Col N="1293" /> reasoning behind this Bill.  As I have said, it is the mission statement, the purpose. What this House is telling An Bord Pleanála is that their duty is to expedite planning appeals &mdash; that is what is spelt out in the section.  I say that is not the intention of this House, rather that they expedite and deal with planning appeals but that they consider always proper planning and proper environmental protection and concern.</P>
      <P>I do not think we would gild any lily or clog the Bill if we spell out clearly on what the House has reached a consensus &mdash; even the Minister has indicated that the House has reached a consensus. There should be no ambiguity, therefore, and the Minister should accept those few words as they give clear expression to the intent of the House so that the board and their successors would be under no illusions and would know that what we want them to do is deal expeditiously, fairly and properly with all planning appeals.</P>

Before the Deputy proceeds may I make a brief point?  As this matter is concerned with individuals who are identifiable I ask the Deputy or Deputies concerned to exercise the utmost restraint in their contribution.  It is a long-standing rule of this House that charges of a personal nature should not be made in this privileged Assembly against persons outside the House who have no means of redress open to them. On that basis I will hear the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue and <Col N="1294" /> while I will have to be mindful of your warning I should say, with the greatest of respect, that I will be unable to promote my case if I cannot refer to the person concerned.  Perhaps you will help me as I go along.</P>
      <P>I wish to express my utter disgust &mdash; I believe I am speaking for thousands of other Irish people &mdash; at the outrageous and scandalous public endorsement of support for Gerry Adams in the British election by the chairman of Bord na Gaeilge, Mr. Proinsias Mac Aonghusa. For the past 23 years we have witnessed a horrific slaughter in the Six Counties. While the awful problems which beset Beirut have now faded from world headlines the problems associated with Belfast, that tragic part of our island, continue.  The chronicle of deaths makes tragic reading.  Almost 4,000 people have been butchered in horrific circumstances by paramilitaries on both sides in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is beyond belief that a responsible journalist of the calibre of Mr. Mac Aonghusa who is the chairman of an Irish State board, would publicly call for support for an international terrorist like Gerry Adams.  I can only believe that this was an aberration on his part, particularly when there is a man of the calibre of Dr. Joe Hendron, who is a man of great integrity and courage, available to the Catholic voters of West Belfast.  I very much hope that Dr. Hendron will be successful in the forthcoming election. Rightly or wrongly, Unionists believe that people in the Irish language movement in the North have links with the Provos.  This endorsement confirms that view and will harden Unionist resistance to all things Irish.  I think, therefore, that Mr. Mac Aonghusa has delivered a body blow to the Irish language movement which he purports to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In using the phrase &ldquo;British imperialism&rdquo;, Mr. Mac Aonghusa has shown that he lives in a time warp.  This phrase is redolent of Provo talk and is much used by them.  While it might have been apt and true in other years the era of British imperialism all over the world is now dead, and thankfully so.  Mr. Mac <Col N="1295" /> Aonghusa in his other manifestation as Gulliver often refers to the phrase used by my colourful and courageous predecessor, Mr. Paddy Donegan.  I would like to append that phrase, &ldquo;a thundering disgrace&rdquo;, to Mr. Mac Aonghusa.  He is a thundering disgrace to the profession he serves, the profession of journalism, and to the Irish nation.  I ask the Minister to call Mr. Mac Aonghusa in and ask him for a rational explanation as to why he delivered this body blow to the Irish nation and, if he fails to give an acceptable explanation, to remove him from his position.  I also call on the Minister to do his bit to support constitutional politics in the North and to support the SDLP in their efforts to bring constitutional politics to that tragic part of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter, which is a very urgent one.  It is very urgent because there are 45 growers in the north east in my own region who would produce approximately 500 tonnes of fruit, valued well in excess of £300,000 this year.  However, at this moment they have no market for their produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lairds of Drumshanbo started making jam some time around 1934.  They did it successfully for many years.  In 1989 Food Industries bought the plant and it became a Greencore company later, following a takeover.  Greencore decided that the business was of no interest to them and <Col N="1297" /> it was put into liquidation.  The assets of Laird Foods Limited were bought over in December 1991 by a new company set up specifically for that purpose, a company called Leitrim Preserves Limited.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that this new company get support from all Government agencies so that processing will begin as soon as possible.  I was heartened to learn that the IDA are taking a positive approach, that Leitrim County Council will also facilitate with any planning permission that is required and, barring an unforeseen hitch, the factory should be operational again in the autumn.  However, my primary concern is for the growers.  I am disappointed that Greencore decided not to keep the plant going.  By putting the company, Laird Foods as it was known at the time, into liquidation Greencore effectively tore up an agreement with the producers, producers who were induced by Teagasc in the first place to grow fruit for this factory.  I understand further that some growers have not yet been paid for their 1991 produce.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to take an interest in this and to ensure that they are paid in full.  I also want An Bord Glas, who have a responsibility in this area, to find a market for the 1992 crop, which will be coming on stream before the factory can reopen again.  I want the Minister to take a specific interest in that matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, the producers must be protected by being given a contract for the supply of food to the new company.  That is not obviously an easy matter to resolve but it must be resolved.  Fruit growing is an important alternative enterprise in the northern counties of the State.  Whereas I am talking about the north east there is probably more fruit from the north-west &mdash; I am not privy to the figures that are involved in that area.  Unless the growers are now treated properly this alternative enterprise will certainly be destroyed and, as we know, when that happens once it is virtually impossible to get people to grow fruit again.  That would be desperately sad.  I am asking the Minister now to ensure that this whole messy business is tidied up once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me thank Deputy Cotter for raising this matter.  It is obvious that it is something about which he is very concerned. He has raised two issues, namely, the future status of the jam factory in Drumshanbo and the markets for raspberries and strawberries for north eastern farmers.</P>
      <P>Since the announcement by Food Industries of their intention to close the Laird's jam factory in Drumshanbo, the IDA have been actively involved in seeking to maintain the factory in production. In recent weeks proposals have been submitted to the IDA for the takeover of the factory.  The proposals involve the purchase of the assets of Lairds by a reputable company already well established in the packaging and distribution of grocery products.  They have a very good reputation with the grocery trade. The IDA are agreeable to support the capital investment required for the factory to reopen.  However, negotiations are on going and a satisfactory agreement between food industries and the new promoters has yet to be completed.  It is unlikely that the arrangements will be finalised in time to enable the new owners to bid for the purchase of soft fruit this season.  I understand that the growers' organisations for the farmers in question, in association with An Bord Glas, are meeting a number of soft fruit buyers later this week to discuss arrangements for the purchase of the coming season's fruit.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep closely in touch with developments regarding the factory itself and the growers of horticultural produce. I can also assure the Deputy that the relevant State agencies will continue their efforts to find a satisfactory outcome to this problem for all concerned.  I shall be meeting the growers' representatives on Wednesday next to examine the situation further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to see this factory restored to full production.  If we are to successfully expand horticultural production <Col N="1299" /> in this country, there is a need for market development and processing. Therefore this factory has a very important role to play in the overall development of horticulture as an ancillary farm enterprise.  It is important also from the point of view of job creation in the area. I can assure the Deputy that over the next week in particular I will be keeping in very close contact with the IDA and An Bord Glas for the purpose of ensuring that this factory is opened as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare and his Department could not have been aware of the devastating consequences of the decision taken last Monday and communicated by his Department to the ITGWU on Tuesday that, with immediate effect, the more than 2,000 employees at Waterford Crystal on short time working, who are working a week on and a week off, will no longer be paid pay-related benefit.  The Minister has effectively signed the redundancy notices for a large number of Waterford Crystal workers.  This decision is anti-worker Thatcherism in its vilest form.  Workers at Waterford Crystal have been huge PAYE-PRSI payers for many years until two years ago.  Now, for a niggardly £17.40 every second week, they are being stripped of this income, vital in terms of financial survival and of keeping jobs alive.  All the sacrifices that have been made by the workforce to protect and maintain jobs, in a company which yesterday announced a profit for the first time since 1986, are to be set at nought. The problems which the employees have in relation to their finances and, in particular, in relation to house mortgages are legion.  Repossession is a word which has become all too familiar in relation to the family home.  People are surviving <Col N="1300" /> or worse.  At a time when the Minister should be implementing measures to financially assist the workers in the short term in relation to their family homes, he is in effect crushing them and their families down.</P>
    <P>I am speaking here on behalf of all workers throughout the country who are working a week on and a week off. However, the dimensions of the effect in Waterford and Dungarvan are enormous. The Minister and his Department cannot persist with this ill-conceived, unjust and inequitable measure, which is forcing people on to full time unemployment benefit and housing lists.  It is economic madness.  I demand that the Minister pulls back before utter devastation is visited on the economy of the Waterford constituency.  This is not just one of the many and varied cutbacks since 1987; this is a fundamental attack on employment.  I understand that the Minister is new to the job and is into an enterprising economy, but this measure which is neither cost effective nor jobs orientated is a kick in the teeth to workers who have made a large contribution to this State.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not present tonight.  He may have been afraid to face this issue because this has been a dastardly mistake.  The Minister must pull back from the folly before real damage is done.  There is still time.  The employees at Waterford Crystal have lived in mounting uncertainty as to their future for two years and the Minister by this Act has added greatly to that uncertainty.  Has the Minister any comprehension of the suffering that families have been through and are going through?  What sense is there in employers being forced to take on the redundancy option because the Government have chosen to reduce benefit, and workers being forced to take up that option?  Does it not give the complete lie to the Government's commitments to tackle unemployment?  Where is the legality in cutting off pay-related benefit this week, based on the four previous weeks when the Social Welfare Act only passed into law in recent days?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> I look to the Minister to address this measure which will have a devastating effect on Waterford, Dungarvan and the whole economy of the Waterford constituency. This is a dastardly attack on a workforce who have contributed so much to this State.  For God's sake, Minister, pull back now before the constituency is devastated.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom leithscéal a ghabháil thar cheann an Aire Leasa Shóisialaigh, an Teachta McCreevy, os rud é nach bhfuil sé ar a chumas bheith anseo anocht.</P>
      <P>The change in entitlement to pay-related benefit referred to by the Deputy arises as a consequence of section 30 of the Social Welfare Act, 1992 which has just been enacted.  The effect of the legislative change is to extend to workers who systematically work a pattern of work that includes periods of lay-off, such as week on-week off, fortnight on-fortnight off, the restriction on payment of pay-related benefit that already applies to workers working three days on-two days off or a similar rota each week.</P>
      <P>This issue was dealt with extensively during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill in this House in the past two weeks. I welcome this opportunity to again explain on behalf of the Minister, the rationale underlying this measure.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1983, short time working usually took the form of a short working week, that is a two or three day working week on a systematic basis for a certain period of time.  Until then workers had full entitlement to unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit for all days not spent working.  In addition, many workers on short time could qualify for income tax refunds because of their reduced earnings.</P>
      <P>The overall effect prior to 1983 was that short-time workers were very often better off working short-time than working a full normal week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1983 addressed that problem through new provisions including the discontinuance of payment of pay-related benefit to workers working <Col N="1302" /> these short-time arrangements.  This restriction on pay-related benefit has been applied since 1983 to people who, for the time being, are systematically working for a number of days which is less than normal in a working week.</P>
    <P>In recent years, it has become apparent that some industries faced with reduced demand have devised work patterns to maximise the social welfare entitlement of their workers through the imposition of a week on-week off or similar pattern of short-time work.  Indeed, there have been instances of firms which were already engaged in short-time working switching from a short working week to a week on-week off situation.  There have also been instances of overtime working occurring concurrently with short-time working so as to replace earnings lost during the period of temporary lay-off.</P>
    <P>These trends have been closely monitored by the Department of Social Welfare. I would not go so far as to say that such practices amount to a conscious abuse of the social welfare system but they are unacceptable.  This is particularly so where the arrangements are continued over a long period.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the two patterns of short-time working, that is the short working week and week on-week off working, are for all practical purposes identical and, therefore, the same arrangements in regard to benefit entitlements should apply equally to both. Section 30 of the Social Welfare Act, 1992 seeks to achieve that objective.  It provides that workers who systematically work a reduced working pattern such as week on-week off or fortnight on-fortnight off are no longer entitled to pay-related benefit while still employed with the same employer.</P>
    <P>The effect of the provision is that where, in a four week period, and having regard to the normal working days, the number of days worked is equal to or greater than the number of days laid off the claimant will not be entitled to pay-related benefit in addition to his unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>However, employees who work for less than the number of days that they are <Col N="1303" /> laid off will continue to be entitled to pay-related benefit.  I am aware of the difficult trading conditions being experienced by the company mentioned in the Deputy's question and that employees have been put on a systematic pattern of reduced work for over a year.  The result of this pattern of lay-off in the company is that most employees work more than half the normal working days in any four week period and so will not be entitled to pay-related benefit from this week on.</P>
    <P>I understand that due to the high level of earnings in the employment concerned most of those affected have been in receipt of the maximum pay-related benefit entitlement of £17.40 per week. Therefore, most will lose £17.40 a week from the introduction of this measure. However, let me put that loss in some perspective.  A married man with two children employed by the company concerned and working a week on/week off system would have, in respect of the week he is laid off, received a social welfare payment of £124.40, made up of £107 unemployment benefit and £17.40 pay-related benefit.  In addition, a tax refund of £35, the average figure, would be payable, thus giving total income for the week of about £159.40.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements the same worker would lose his pay-related benefit reducing total weekly income to £142. Gross weekly wages for the company in question range from £240 for general operatives to £470 for craftsmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the need to provide a new Garda station in Cahir to replace the dilapidated and appalling station there.  This question has a history of broken promises.  The ESB offices in Cahir were purchased two years ago with the intention of providing a new Garda station.  I tabled a parliamentary question on 18 December 1990 asking when the repair and renovation would take place so that we would have a new garda <Col N="1304" /> station.  I was informed by the Minister that detailed planning was proceeding and that it was hoped to be able to invite tenders for the work and place a contract as soon as possible.  Last September we were informed that work was about to commence yet at this stage nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>It is very unfair to a tremendous police force in Cahir who are surviving in appalling conditions.  Having visited the Garda station, I was alarmed to find that the basement was rat infested.  The duty room is surrounded by rotten timber, plaster is falling off the walls and there is dampness throughout.  The building has been deemed unsafe from a fire and evacuation point of view.  There is no doctor's room, no recreation room, no sergeant's room.  There are not separate toilet or shower facilities for the staff.</P>
      <P>This is very unfair to the tremendous police force which we are lucky to have in Cahir.  They should be given the facilities they deserve.  I am not just waiting to hear where we are on the priority list.  I want to know the date for the commencement of work so that some relief and hope will be given to the staff in that station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am completely committed to bringing Garda accommodation in all divisions to a proper standard. It was in this same spirit that the Garda building programme was launched seven years ago, since then, over £35 million has been spent on the programme, a considerable investment by any standards.  The programme has seen the replacement of eight divisional headquarters, 13 district headquarters, 30 smaller stations as well as four major extensions.</P>
      <P>This expenditure has seen some of the worst black spots removed, but I accept that it has by no means dealt completely with the problem.  The building programme is based on priorities agreed after consultation with the Garda authorities. We deal with them as best we can, taking the most urgent needs first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> As Deputy Ahearn rightly points out, Cahir is certainly in need of a new station. It is top of the priority list.  In consultation with the Garda, plans have been finalised, tenders have been sought and work is due to commence before the end of the year.  That is a ministerial promise.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, given available resources, each project must be examined within the context of priorities across the country.  The Tipperary division alone has seen eight new stations since the programme began, at a total cost of almost £2 million.  A new district headquarters, in Tipperary town is to be completed in May of this year, and the station in Carrick-on-Suir is due to be completed in November.  I am pleased that work will commence on Cahir Garda station this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I last raised the general issue of the inadequate policing of the Dublin North-East constituency in this House on 20 June last and I appreciate permission to raise the matter again, specifically because of the recurring outbreaks of lawlessness, housebreaking, vandalism and drug abuse which are plaguing the constituency as a whole.  I recently attended a meeting of residents of the Alden-Verbena district of Bayside in Sutton where the experience of residents brought home to me the fact that, whatever promises had been given in the House by the Minister, the constituency generally is very poorly policed and needs urgent attention.  I repeat the general point that in Dublin we have the phenomenon of crime moving from the city centre to the suburbs.  In many respects we have been taken unawares.  Figures indicate that, for example, at Howth Garda station numbers have decreased since 1986 from 38 to 32.  People believe that Howth station may be closed in the near future.  I hope the Minister can scotch that rumour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask him to address the possibility of opening a new police station in Donaghmede.  There is a project for an extra 1,000 dwellings to be built in that area in the next five years.  Problems are intolerable in that the people of the district <Col N="1306" /> are beset from time to time by a wave of crime carried out by a small few.  It requires urgent attention from the Minister in consultation with the Commissioner with regard to the allocation of adequate personnel to the district generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that two additional gardaí have been assigned to Howth Garda station in recent weeks and that the question of allocating further additional manpower to the station is being considered in the light of overall demands on Garda manpower in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  The additional members assigned to Howth are operating in plainclothes and they have been quite successful to date in detecting a number of local crimes in respect of which two persons are currently before the courts.</P>
      <P>The other matters to which the Deputy refers are not the subject matter of his question, but I have taken note of his comments and I will bring the matter before the relevant authorities.  I hope there will be a substantial improvement in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The appalling saga of the individual of whom I speak began with the collapse in highly controversial circumstances of his meat firm, Towey Meats of Ballaghaderreen in 1980.  Following on the collapse he was investigated for fraud by the Garda Fraud Squade but for some very strange reason this fraud investigation was not allowed to be completed.  In other words, the Fraud Squad were taken off the investigation. The amount of money owed by this company at the time of their collapse, most of which was owed to small cattle producers who had supplied cattle to the Ballaghaderreen factory, was approximately £2.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early in 1981 Mr. Towey came under the notice of the Garda at Ballyneety in County Limerick, where he was found to have in his possession at least one lethal firearm, a Kalashnikov rifle of the type used by terrorist organisations, and several rounds of ammunition.  His case <Col N="1307" /> eventually got a first hearing at Limerick district court on 8 December 1981, but by that time he had absconded to Spain. A warrant was issued for his arrest but it was well known to the authorities that he was living in Spain and enjoying a most extravagant lifestyle.  The publicity surrounding his lavish lifestyle culminated in a television documentary a few years ago showing the property he owned, the property deals in which he was involved and the fact that he was using a false identity.  No attempt was made to have him extradited to face the serious criminal charges filed against him in this country.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to let this House know what steps have been taken to bring this man back to Ireland to face the charges against him.  If, as I suspect, the answer is none, I would ask the Minister to tell the House what steps will be taken to extradite him.  I do not want an answer like the evasive rubbish I was given by way of written reply to this question on 4 February last.</P>
    <P>The law and the courts in this country have sentenced people like itinerants to prison for the larceny of as little as £10. Others steal millions from small people and break our laws in a spectacular way. They then abscond to enjoy their illgotten gains.  Very often the law stands idly by like an ass, even though it has the instruments and the wherewithal to deal with these people.  It is little wonder that there is a widespread belief abroad in this country that if you have powerful political friends, as this Mr. Towey had, and perhaps still has, you can do anything and get away with it.  The Minister can <Col N="1308" /> dispel that belief by giving a positive reply on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is going to be a short reply because I am not at all sure that some of the matters that have been addressed by the Deputy have been taken in the proper way.  It certainly has not been the practice in dealing with these matters on previous occasions to name people in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

      <P>I would have much preferred that names were not mentioned and that the person was not identified.  The charges were such that I would have preferred if the matter was raised by way of substantive motion rather than in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason the Ceann Comhairle disallowed a major portion of the Deputy's question.  It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice either to confirm or to deny the existence of particular extradition requests or whether proceedings have been initiated in a specific case in advance of an arrest or the bringing of an individual before a court.  There is a very simple reason.  Apart from other considerations, the disclosure of information of this kind in relation to a particular case could seriously hinder appropriate Garda action.  It is not my intention to pursue the matter further in the House at this time.</P>

      <P>The UN Secretary General, Dr. Boutros Ghali, is making strenuous efforts to secure agreement between Morocco and the Polisario Front on the organisation of the referendum in the Western Sahara. He is pressing in particular for agreement on the criteria for compiling the electoral list of voters for the referendum.  The Secretary-General has undertaken to report again to the Security Council before the end of next month and he considers that, if agreement has not been reached by that date, a new approach may have to be adopted to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is directly involved in <Col N="1103" /> MINURSO, the United Nations Missions for the Referendum in Western Sahara.  Irish military personnel serving with the mission will be assisting in the organisation of the referendum.  As we are already contributing personnel to the mission, I do not consider that the presence of additional Irish observers would be warranted.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the difficult physical conditions in which the MINURSO military observers are serving.  The Secretary-General has himself expressed concern about this situation and is committed to improving their conditions and providing adequate accommodation for them.</P>

      <P>The Department have been actively involved in the drawing up of the technical assistance programme which the European Community has established for the states of the former Soviet Union.  Food production and distribution are among the priorities set out in this programme.  The funds involved are substantial: 400 million ECU (£307 million approximately) were set aside in 1991 and 450 million ECU (£345 million approximately) in 1992.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to which Ireland contributes has a significant technical assistance programme for the Commonwealth of Independent States.</P>

      <P>There was hope last year that a solution might be found to the civil war, as a result of international efforts, not least that of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) under the chairmanship of President Babangida of Nigeria. However, as on many occasions in the past, these hopes and endeavours came to nothing.  The Government deplore the recent renewed fighting between Sudanese Government troops and the SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army) in Southern Sudan which only adds to the misery of an already suffering civilian population.</P>
      <P>Ireland continues to raise the situation in Sudan, whenever the occasion arises, and to stress the need to respond to the human tragedy in that country.  Through our Permanent Mission in New York, we are in contact with the United Nations. While not wishing to be pessimistic, we have to recognise the gulf that exists between the parties.  The cultural and religious divide between the two communities, and the dissension that exists within those communities, exacerbate an already difficult political conflict.  Nonetheless, we shall continue to encourage the parties, and the international community, to work for a cease-fire, with a view to resolving a conflict which has bedevilled Sudan for decades.</P>

      <P>On foot of a request from the United Nations Secretariat, the Government decided to make available 20 Garda <Col N="1108" /> and four Army officers for service with the UN peacekeeping mission in Yugoslavia, which is known as the UN Protection Force, or UNPROFOR.</P>
      <P>In my reply to questions on 27 February I outlined to the House in some detail the background to and the mandate and composition of UNPROFOR. Since then, the process of deploying the Force has begun and it is hoped to complete that process in the course of this month.  At full strength, the Force will number around 14,000 military, police and civilian personnel.</P>
      <P>UNPROFOR has a central role to play in creating the conditions required for the negotiation of an overall settlement of the Yugoslav crisis.  That settlement is to be reached through the active participation of all the parties concerned in the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia sponsored by the European Community.</P>
      <P>In considering the question of Irish participation in the UN operation in Yugoslavia, account must also be taken of our involvement in the efforts of the European Community and its member States, carried out under a mandate from the CSCE, to bring about a peaceful settlement of the conflict there.  These efforts include the continuing work of the EC Monitor Mission, in which seven Irish personnel are currently serving, and that of the Peace Conference under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington.  The Government attach a high priority to the overall contribution that Ireland can make to the restoration of peace in the area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 105 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are deeply concerned about the famine situation in Sudan and will continue to do what they can to alleviate the situation.  Critical food shortages continue in certain areas. Southern Sudan is particularly badly affected by continuing civil war, faction fighting, and widespread flooding. Communications have almost completely broken down rendering the relief operation extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>Ireland has given help in the form both of emergency aid and of normal development assistance.  In 1991 we contributed to an EC initiative involving 600,000 tonnes of extra food aid for different countries in Africa, including the Sudan. Ireland's share of this operation is estimated at £1.3 million.  This is in addition to regular EC commitments of one million tonnes of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the generosity of the international donor community, the needs still remain great.  It is estimated by the UN that Sudan's needs for this year are about <Col N="1110" /> 700,000 tonnes.  Facilities for delivering the food aid remain a paramount concern.</P>
    <P>The situation has not been helped by the less than supportive attitude of the Sudanese government towards the relief effort.  Constant representations have been made at a very high level by UN agencies to the Sudanese authorities. Ireland has been fully supportive of these efforts.  Along with my colleagues in the European Community I will continue to maintain pressure to improve the position. Close contact is being maintained with the appropriate UN agencies to monitor the implementation of the relief effort.</P>
    <P>The Government have been concerned for some time about the Sudanese government's plan to move forcibly large numbers of displaced persons from Khartoum to inadequately prepared camps outside the city.</P>
    <P>The Government raised the issue at the last European Development Council in November and at the United Nations. The Irish ambassador to Sudan, who is based in Cairo, has also raised the plight of the residents of the Khartoum camps with the Sudanese authorities, as have Department officials from Dublin who visited Sudan.  The ambassador will shortly visit Sudan again and will make further representations.</P>
    <P>Our concern about the situation is shared by our EC partners and by the United Nations Secretariat.  EC and UN representatives in Khartoum are working closely together on this matter and have made strong representations to the Sudanese government.  Unfortunately, according to the information available to me, there has been no improvement in the situation.  I shall remain in close contact with our EC partners to decide what is the best course of action to be followed.</P>
    <P>Two studies relating to the Irish aid programme were completed at the end of last year by the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation.  One gives an overview of the aid programme since its inception and the other deals with the issue of gender and Irish aid.  The overview study in particular is extensive in scope, covering a wide range of topics <Col N="1111" /> which merit careful consideration.  I am giving careful attention to the issues raised.  While there are some proposals in the reports with which I cannot agree, as a whole I find the two volumes valuable, and they contain a number of helpful ideas which I propose to implement.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the results achieved by our bilateral aid programme in recent years &mdash; within the resources available &mdash; have made a substantial contribution to assisting our partner countries with their development needs.  There is, of course, always room for improvement and the regular monitoring of our aid projects is an integral part of the management of our programme.  The bilateral aid programme is targeted at four priority countries in Africa &mdash; Zambia, Tanzania, Sudan and Lesotho &mdash; and I have no plans to alter or expand the list of countries at present.  I would see our priority as being to build up the resources available to our existing programme in these countries.  I note that this view is endorsed in the overview study I have referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to Questions Nos. 34, 36 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are very concerned about the serious situation in the Horn of Africa, where an estimated 23 million people are believed to be at risk from food shortages due to drought and conflict. Ireland is doing what it can to confront this problem both on a bilateral and a multilateral basis, in particular through our EC participation through which we have contributed both long term and emergency food aid.  In 1991 the EC committed the equivalent of over £80 million worth of food aid to the Horn of Africa.</P>
      <P>The Horn of Africa has also been the biggest single beneficiary of Irish Government relief aid, which since January 1990 amounts to nearly £2 million. This includes a total allocation to date of £240,000 from the Government's disaster relief fund to the appeal by the UN Secretary-General for the special emergency programme for the Horn of Africa.  Ireland also participated in the EC contribution to this appeal, which amounted to over $7 million.</P>
      <P>The beneficiaries targeted have been refugees and displaced persons, of whom there are many millions throughout the Horn of Africa.  However, the problems are not restricted to the Horn of Africa alone.  There is an emerging crisis in many countries in the southern part of Africa due to unprecedented drought and crop failure which will need to be addressed. It is estimated that about 40 million people are threatened by famine.  Some of the countries worst affected are Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> While the situation is still being fully assessed, present estimates indicate that an inflow of some seven to ten million tons of food will be needed for the whole of Africa in 1992, including both commercial imports and food aid.</P>
    <P>As a response to the massive scale of the crisis the EC Commission has presented a special food aid programme to provide 800,000 extra tons of cereals or equivalent for Africa and for other countries in the world threatened by large food shortages such as Cambodia, Peru and Afghanistan which are threatened by large food shortages.  Ireland welcomes this initiative.</P>
    <P>The costs involved in such an operation will be very high, of the order of £170 million.  This will have to be met by extra Community funds necessitating revisions of the Community budget and arrangements are being made to achieve this as quickly as possible.  The assistance given to NGOs so far is intended to enable them to keep the food pipeline open pending the launch of the special programme.</P>
    <P>The Commission will be inviting EC member states to provide additional bilateral funding.  By way of immediate response, we have allocated £150,000 from the disaster relief fund for relief operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 56, 97, 106, 107 and 108 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12 November last in Dili, the capital of East Timor, members of the Indonesian armed forces carried out an unprovoked attack on a party of mourners.  According to reports, over 50 people were killed and many more were wounded.  On the following day EC Foreign Ministers issued a declaration strongly <Col N="1115" /> condemning the violence as being in clear contravention of the most fundamental human rights.  On 3 December 1991, they called on the Indonesian authorities to respond to the serious concerns of the international community and for a thorough and credible investigation by impartial and independent experts.</P>
    <P>Indonesia rejected the call for an international investigation.  However, President Suharto did respond to the international outcry by establishing a national investigation commission into the incident at Dili.  The commission submitted their summary report to the President at the end of December.</P>
    <P>On 13 February the Twelve expressed encouragement at the prompt response which the summary report of the national investigation commission had elicited from the highest Indonesian authorities. They mentioned especially the investigation commission's criticism of the actions of the armed forces, the decision to dismiss the two senior commanders responsible for East Timor, and the decision to proceed with further investigations into the actions of the armed forces and into the fate of those unaccounted for.</P>
    <P>One of the results of the report of the national investigation commission was the setting up of a military honour council to examine the role of the security forces in handling the incident at Dili.  The military honour council reported in February. The Government notes with satisfaction the acceptance by the Indonesian armed forces of culpability, as well as formal responsibility, for the shootings of civilians in Dili.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations sent a personal representative to Indonesia and East Timor in February to seek clarifications on the tragic events of 12 November.  We look forward to hearing the results of his visit.</P>
    <P>The human rights situation in East Timor was the subject of discussion at the 48th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which took place recently in Geneva.  Ireland played an active part within the Twelve in these <Col N="1116" /> discussions.  A consensus statement by the Commission noted with serious concern the human rights situation in East Timor and strongly deplored the violent incident at Dili.  The statement urged the government of Indonesia to improve the human rights situation in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Portugal was designated by the United Nations some considerable time ago as the administering power in East Timor but they have been unable to exercise this role since the invasion and annexation of the territory by Indonesia in 1975-76. There have, however, been talks on the status of East Timor between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary General of the United Nations and Ireland has supported these talks. We hope that they will resume at an early date and will lead to a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable settlement of the question of East Timor.  Such a settlement should respect the principles of the UN Charter.  It should also take into account the need to defend human rights and fundamental freedoms, and should respect the legitimate interests and aspirations of the people of East Timor.</P>

      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty on <Col N="1117" /> European Union will come into force only if and when it has been ratified by all 12 member states of the European Community who signed it on 7 February 1992.  The relevant provision in the Treaty is contained in Article R.2 which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>This Treaty shall enter into force on 1 January 1993, provided that all the instruments of ratification have been deposited, or, failing that, on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification by the last signatory State to take this step.</P>
      <P>If Ireland, or indeed any other member state should decide not to ratify then the Treaty will not come into effect for any state.  The existing EC Treaties would remain in force and current policies under the Treaties such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the Structural Funds would remain in place for the present.</P>
      <P>That is the formal legal position.  The political position would however be very different.</P>
      <P>First, as regards the existing Treaties: the benefits currently accruing to Ireland under the Common Agricultural Policy and the existing Structural Funds would not immediately be affected but we could have no assurance that they would continue for very far into the future.  These funds which have resulted in a substantial net flow of resources to Ireland each year are not simply there for the taking &mdash; they are to a great extent a matter for regular negotiation which involves action on our part to ensure that Community arrangements meet our specific needs, especially in the Common Agricultural Policy area.  It seems to me very unlikely that our partners would be willing for very long to continue a funding arrangement which provides a substantial annual flow of resources to a member state which had blocked a new step forward for all member states of the Community and opted for its own part, to remain outside the new European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, as regards the new union treaty not having been ratified by all member states it would not come into <Col N="1118" /> force for anyone.  I believe that in this unprecedented situation all 12 member states would need in the first instance to meet to consider what should be done. What exactly would be decided must to some extent be a matter of speculation. However, there is no doubt in my mind that, in the event of one State deciding not to ratify the Treaty, the other member states would want to press ahead to create a European Union with a number less than 12.  It is clear from the fact that an Agreement on Social Policy was concluded at Maastricht between 11 member states following the decision by the UK not to accept the social provisions of the new treaty, that most of our partners no longer feel constrained to halt the further development of the Community because of a blockage resulting from the position of a single member state.  This was a reality which Ireland understood when we went along with the other 11 in accepting the Agreement on Social Policy.  Accordingly it seems likely that, in a situation without precedent the other member states would wish to negotiate something very like the Maastricht Treaty between themselves and press ahead without us.</P>
    <P>For a better appreciation of the consequences for Ireland, if it were to decide to block the coming into force of the Maastricht Treaty, and stay outside any similar new arrangement, it is necessary to summarise briefly some of the main elements which that Treaty contains.</P>
    <P>First, there is the fact that the Maastricht Treaty provides a legal basis for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It puts in place a procedure to achieve full economic and monetary union by 1999 at the latest and, subsequently, a single currency which will replace the individual national currencies in use at present.  European Monetary Union is a natural extension of the Single European Market and is necessary if the full benefits of a single market are to be realised. It is estimated that the long term benefit to the Community for European Monetary Union and the Single Market could be up to 15 per cent of GDP.  Furthermore, if we were not part of Economic <Col N="1119" /> and Monetary Union, Ireland would not be able to participate in decisions which have the most fundamental consequences for our economy and currency.</P>
    <P>A second feature of the new Treaty is that for the first time it includes the promotion of Economic and Social Cohesion as one of the aims of the Community. It also contains a protocol on Economic and Social Cohesion.  This establishes a Cohesion Fund through which the Community will contribute financially to projects in relation to the environment and trans-European networks &mdash; transport, communications etc. &mdash; in less prosperous member states. These provisions were inserted to address the concern that the more prosperous central regions of the Community would gain disproportionately at the expense of the periphery.</P>
    <P>A third feature of the new Treaty is that it has given the Community competence to deal with new areas such as education, public health, consumer protection, industry, development co-operation, trans-European networks and culture. The intention is that Community action should supplement national actions in these areas, thus taking account of what is described as the principle of subsidiarity.</P>
    <P>Other important aspects of the new Treaty are the provisions for closer co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs; and the provisions in relation to a Common Foreign and Security Policy which established systematic co-operation between member states in the conduct of foreign policy and joint action in certain areas where member states have important interests in common.</P>
    <P>These are all important steps forward in European integration; they are important for the Community; and they would all, I believe, be important for Ireland. None of them however would be taken at this stage if the Treaty itself does not come into force.</P>
    <P>If that were to happen, as I have said, our partners would no doubt find a way of going forward with very similar proposals without us.  But we would, by our own decision have decided to turn aside from <Col N="1120" /> a path which the Irish people embarked on by a clear majority in 1972 when they approved our membership of the Community, which they confirmed in the referendum on the Single European Act in 1987.  We would also have turned our back on the road now being taken by some six other European countries who have applied to join the Community. These countries, in joining, are willing to commit themselves to the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.  They include several countries which, like Ireland, have had a traditional policy of remaining outside of military alliances.</P>
    <P>I would add in conclusion that while a number of the points mentioned in the Deputy's question are legal ones, the fundamental question which the Irish people will have to answer in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty is a political and economic one: do we move forward together with our partners towards greater prosperity; or do we block the whole process of Community integration for every one for a time at least and opt instead to isolate ourselves for the future with all the disastrous consequences which that could entail?  If this choice is made clear to them I have no doubt but that a majority of the Irish people will decide to vote in favour of the new Treaty.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy has in mind the comments made by President Bush on St. Patrick's Day at a function at the White House which I attended on behalf of the Government.</P>
      <P>President Bush reiterated on that occasion the long-standing readiness of the US Administration to play a constructive role in the search for a settlement to the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Describing the Irish-American <Col N="1121" /> relationship as &ldquo;strong, good and very, very important to us&rdquo;, the President emphasised the need for close contact between the US and Irish Governments. He stated that the US was &ldquo;vitally interested&rdquo; in the problem of Northern Ireland, first, because of the many Americans of Irish heritage; secondly, because of Ireland's role in the European Community; and thirdly, because of the importance of Irish-US relations.</P>
    <P>President Bush indicated that the US would like to help in relation to Northern Ireland in any way which the Irish Government deemed possible.  At the same time, he restated the view of successive administrations that the US is not in a position to dictate a solution or to act as a sole arbiter of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government naturally welcome these helpful and supportive remarks by President Bush and greatly appreciate the underlying interest and goodwill of the US Administration in relation to the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Maastricht Summit in December 1991 reached agreement on the text of the Treaty on European Union.  The Treaty and its attached Cohesion Protocol greatly strengthen the Community's policies relating to the promotion of cohesion.  In the Treaty itself, for example, cohesion and solidarity between member states is added to the basic tasks of the Community in Article 2.</P>
      <P>The Cohesion Protocol reaffirms that the promotion of economic and social cohesion is vital and underlines the importance of the inclusion of economic and social cohesion in the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Protocol also reaffirms the role <Col N="1122" /> of the Structural Funds in the field of cohesion.  It states that the appropriate size of these funds is to be reviewed in 1992 in the light of the tasks of the Community in the area of economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The Treaty also provides for a Cohesion Fund in addition to the existing Structural Funds.  The Protocol provides that this Cohesion Fund shall be set up during 1993 and be for the benefit of member states with a per capita GNP below 90 per cent of the Community average, in other words, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain.  The Treaty and Protocol do not specify the levels of the funds.  They set out the framework within which amounts are to be set.</P>
    <P>Following Maastricht, the Commission made proposals on the budgetary framework for 1993 to 1997.  They propose that the Structural Funds for the less developed regions, that is to say the Objective 1 regions which include the whole of Ireland, should increase by 67 per cent.  They also propose that, taking the new Cohesion Fund into account, the total funds for the four cohesion countries &mdash; Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain taken as a whole &mdash; would be doubled.</P>
    <P>These proposals are now being discussed by the Council.  The Government will continue to press within the Council, and as necessary in bilateral contacts with our partners, for agreement on the provision of as high a level as possible of funds for cohesion purposes.</P>

      <P>About 30 per cent of visa applications <Col N="1123" /> each year come from nationals of countries where Ireland does not have a resident Embassy nor an Honorary Consulate. Nationals of these countries may submit visa applications either directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs or through any of our diplomatic missions abroad.</P>
      <P>In 1991, 3,929 applicants from countries in which we do not have a resident Embassy or Honorary Consulate received Irish visas.  The Department have not received complaints of particular difficulties arising for this category of applicants.  In all cases visa applications are handled as expeditiously as possible and every effort is made to facilitate the individuals concerned. However, if it appears that there is a problem in relation to a particular country, I will do everything possible to ensure that the necessary corrective action is taken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>On 31 March, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 748 which imposes the following sanctions on Libya, with effect from 15 April: a ban on flights to or from Libya, except in cases of significant humanitarian need, as well as a ban on the supply of aircraft materials; a ban on arms sales, and a significant reduction in the number of Libyan diplomats in missions abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolution also provides that the Libyan Government must commit itself definitively to cease all forms of terrorist action and all assistance to terrorists <Col N="1124" /> groups, and that it must promptly, by concrete actions, demonstrate its renunciation of terrorism.  Furthermore, the resolution provides that all states are to deny entry to or expel Libyan nationals who have been denied entry to, or expelled from other states because of their involvement in terrorist activities.</P>
    <P>The sanctions follow Libya's refusal to comply with the Security Council's earlier resolution on this question, adopted on 21 January.  That Resolution urged the Libyan Government to provide a full and effective response to the requests from France, Britain and the USA to cooperate fully in establishing responsibility for the destruction of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 and UTA flight 772 over Africa in 1989.  A total of 441 innocent lives were lost in these two appalling outrages.  Three of the Pan Am victims were Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>Under Article 25 of the UN Charter member states of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the Charter.  Ireland will, therefore, implement these sanctions with effect from 15 April.</P>

      <P>Consideration by member states of the Austrian application to join the EC has to date been limited.  The application was made in July 1989 and in accordance with procedures was referred by the Council of Ministers to the Commission for an opinion.  The Commission's opinion, which is broadly positive, was delivered in August 1991. This will form the basis of a detailed consideration by the Council in which we will play our part.</P>

      <P>Subsequent to the judgment of the Supreme Court on 5 March in the case of the Attorney General and X and Others, the Government decided that it would be necessary to seek an amendment to Protocol No. 17 of the Treaty on European Union to take account of the judgment.  This would involve an Intergovernmental Conference to consider and agree on the necessary amendments.</P>
      <P>In taking up the matter with partners, the Government were fully conscious that there would be a reluctance to reopen the Maastricht Treaty.  We are aware that in other member states there was pressure to seek changes and that Governments would be anxious to avoid the risk that fundamental questions relating to the Treaty on European Union, which was negotiated with considerable difficulty, might be reopened.</P>
      <P>The issue was raised at diplomatic level in Brussels and in capitals.  At the General Affairs Council on Monday 6 April the issue was discussed in detail.  While partners expressed full understanding of the Irish request and could readily accept the substance of our concerns, a majority of my colleagues were very reluctant to reopen the negotiations on the Treaty to enable the Irish amendment to be inserted in the Protocol.  These concerns were related to the pressures in their countries which exist independently of our request to seek changes in the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to meet the difficulties posed for the Government some partners suggested <Col N="1126" /> that an interpretative declaration emphasising the substance of our proposed amendment on the travel and information issues could suffice.  I have maintained our request for an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Protocol and the Government are currently considering the options open to them in the light of the situation as it has developed.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs are committed to ensuring a good flow of information to the public on developments in Irish foreign policy. Every effort is made when replying to parliamentary questions and to queries from the media and members of the public to provide as clear and comprehensive a response as possible.  Publications <Col N="1128" /> such as the six-monthly report on Developments in the European Communities and the annual report on Ireland's Official Development Assistance help to disseminate knowledge in these key areas.  Close contact is maintained with bodies having a specialist interest in foreign policy, such as the Irish United Nations Association, the Irish Council for the European Movement, the Committee for the Study of International Affairs of the Royal Irish Academy, and there is also valuable interaction with the recently established Institute of European Affairs.</P>
      <P>My intention is to ensure that this general approach of openness is continued and where possible reinforced.

      <P>I would however like to assure the Deputy that the position of Irish people who find themselves homeless in Britain is a matter of very serious concern to the Government.  The Embassy in London maintains contact with the appropriate statutory authorities on this and a wide range of social issues of concern to the Irish community in Britain.  The DÍON Committee, which is chaired by the Labour Attache of the London Embassy, advise the Minister for Labour on grant allocations to Irish support groups in British cities.  In recognition of the problem faced by the homeless, the DÍON Committee has this year decided to give priority to applications from organisations for projects concerned with the provision of accommodation for the homeless. Despite the fall-off in net emigration in this year, and budgetary cutbacks in many areas, it has been possible to maintain the funding of the DÍON Committee at IR£0.5 million, in recognition of the continuing needs of emigrants arriving in Britain.</P>

    <P>(b) OECD National Accounts, Volume 1, Paris, 1992.</P>
    <P>The impact of the corporation tax measures announced in the 1992 budget is likely to be marginal.  Such measures, in any event, must be seen in the light of the effects of the whole budget package. In this context, the responsible thrust of budgetary and economic policy of recent years, which was continued in the 1992 budget, has underpinned a strong recovery of investment which expanded by 30 per cent in volume during the years in question, reaching the EC average in 1990.</P>
    <P>In addition to restoring the environment for investment, under the Community Support Framework negotiated by the Government Ireland has received a commitment of EC aid amounting to £2.86 billion (in 1989 prices) over the 1989-1993 period.  Additional aid under Community initiatives has brought the total commitment to Ireland above £3 billion.  Of this amount, £1.7 billion relates to the three years to end-1991.</P>
    <P>The Government propose to continue to implement responsible budgetary and economic policies which will support future investment; and, in the context of ongoing developments within the Community, to continue to seek adequate structural and cohesion assistance for its poorer regions.  The Deputy will be aware that the recent Commission proposals on the Community budget for 1993 to 1997, contained in the so-called Delors II package, call for a doubling of structural resources available to the poorer regions of the EC, including Ireland, in the period 1993 to 1997, over the 1992 level.</P>

      <P>Eligibility for school transport is determined by reference to the nearest suitable school and the age of the pupil.</P>
      <P>Pupils under ten years of age must live at least two miles from the nearest suitable school while older pupils must live at least three miles from the school. For those who wish to attend an all-Irish school, the nearest all-Irish school is regarded as being the nearest suitable school.</P>
      <P>The parents in this case opted for Carrickmacross all-Irish as their nearest suitable school.  This school is less than three miles from the boy's house and he will therefore become ineligible for free transport at the end of the current school term, by which time he will have reached his tenth birthday.</P>
      <P>There is no charge for eligible pupils at primary level.  However, ineligible pupils are required to pay £15 per term.  This provision will apply to this pupil from commencement of the summer school term 1992.</P>

      <P>The motorway scheme for the Northern Cross Route was prepared by Dublin County Council acting on their own behalf and on behalf of Dublin Corporation in so far as sections of the proposed scheme lie in the administrative area of the corporation.  During the course of a local public inquiry held in June 1990, all aspects of the motorway scheme, including the environmental impact study and design report prepared by Dublin County Council, were considered and the scheme was approved by the Minister for the Environment, subject to modifications, in February 1991. The county council have been asked to send a copy of the design report to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Complaints have been lodged with the EC Commission in connection with implementation of Directive 85/337/EEC in relation to the motorway scheme.  My Department have responded to these complaints and are involved in ongoing discussions with the Commission concerning them.</P>

      <P>The embargo on all political, economic and commercial relations which the United States instituted against Cuba has been in operation since 1962.  The embargo applies solely to the United States' relations with Cuba and is not in any way binding on other States or international organisations.  The question of lifting the embargo is a bilateral matter for the two Governments concerned.</P>
      <P>The operation of the embargo over the past 30 years has not in any way impeded other countries from developing trade and commercial links with Cuba.  Nor has it prevented the provision of humanitarian aid to Cuba.  The European Community provide food aid to Cuba via the World Food Programme.  In 1991 food aid provided by the Community to Cuba was valued at 1.6 million ECU.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that the instances of non-accompaniment to which his questions refer have been raised with the British authorities.  In this regard the Deputy will recall that my predecessor informed the House on 7 November that the British authorities had indicated that a number of practical, logistical or resource constraints made it impossible to guarantee a continuous police accompaniment in all areas.  They stated moreover that they were no longer willing to ask the RUC to investigate specific reports of unaccompanied patrols unless there was also a complaint of misbehaviour of the patrol in question or the patrol was alleged to be operating in an area where it should not be.</P>
      <P>My predecessor made it clear on that occasion that this position was unsatisfactory and that he had so informed the Secretary of State.  I can confirm that in the Anglo-Irish Conference and through the Secretariat in Belfast we have continued to make clear to the British authorities our view that all necessary steps should be taken to give effect to the commitment on accompaniment given at the highest level in the Hillsborough communiqué and that, in the case of reports of unaccompanied patrols, it remains appropriate to inquire into the exceptional circumstances which justified a particular departure from the principles agreed between the two Governments.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to pursue this matter within the Conference framework and that we will continue to raise through these channels instances of unaccompanied patrols which come to our attention.</P>

      <P>Three-quarters of a million Irish people have emigrated in the past 45 years and their children also are Irish citizens.  Given these numbers, and the small size of our embassies, the compilation of a register would be a hugely time-consuming task and probably disproportionate to the benefits involved.  I am satisfied that the targeted approach adopted by our missions abroad and by the offices of the semi-State bodies (which involves close and regular contact with Irish cultural, economic and social groups and Irish community leaders) is better suited to Irish circumstances.</P>

These must be agreed by common accord &mdash; in effect by unanimity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article N of the Treaty on European Union provides for the convening in 1996 of a conference of representatives of the Governments of the member states to examine Treaty provisions for which revision is provided, in accordance with the objectives set out in Articles A and B of the Treaty.  These include the establishment of a single currency, the framing <Col N="1149" /> of a common defence policy and consideration of the policies and forms of the co-operation introduced by the Treaty that may need to be revised with the aim of ensuring the effectiveness of the mechanisms and the institutions of the Community.</P>

      <P>Teamwork is fully funded by the Exchequer.  The 1992 allocation for the scheme had been reduced to £3 million but I announced last week that I had allocated an additional £0.5 million to the scheme in 1992 which should help to alleviate current difficulties.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the focus of the scheme is to provide opportunities for young people in their search for permanent employment.  It was never intended that the scheme would provide funding for groups providing local services on a continuing basis.  Groups providing such services, including those providing services for the handicapped, should seek to secure their State funding from the appropriate Departments and agencies which, in the case of services for the handicapped, would be the health boards and the Department of Health.</P>
