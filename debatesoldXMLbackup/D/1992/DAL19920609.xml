      <P>The Government's approach to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was set out during the course of the debate on the conference which took place in the House on 8 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Important global conventions on climate change and biodiversity have already been concluded and will be signed by many countries, including Ireland.  The Rio Declaration, or Earth Charter, will establish basic international ground rules for environment policy for the years ahead.  And Agenda 21 will set out a practical agenda for sustainable development into the next century across a range of areas, including climate change, depletion of the ozone layer, transboundary air and water pollution and the contamination of the oceans and seas, as well as areas of development policy like action to combat poverty, health and education, the role of women <Col N="1770" /> in the development process and the impact of population trends.</P>
    <P>Ireland is participating actively at the Rio Conference which began last week. The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith; the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Daly, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with special responsibility for the protection of the environment, Deputy Harney, are participating in the Conference at appropriate times in its two weeks duration.  I have arranged for the inclusion of representatives of the main Opposition parties and of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights in the Irish delegation.  The Government are also assisting attendance at the Rio Global Forum of a sizeable representation from Irish environment and development nongovernmental organisations.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that Ireland, which has already, last January, hosted in Dublin a major UN Conference on Water and Sustainable Development, and has just enacted important new environmental legislation, will work actively for the success of the Rio Conference and for the practical implementation of its conclusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach support the proposal for a ten dollar a barrel carbon tax to combat global warming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That proposal emanated in the first instance, as far as Ireland is concerned, at EC level and related to energy tax to be used for various purposes.  However, it is at a very early stage and, of course, would have enormous consequences for Ireland in regard to the cost of energy.  Consequently, we would have to look at various alternatives of environmentally friendly energy production before we come to any conclusions in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that this matter is being discussed at Rio de Janeiro?  Is he further aware that Argentina and Brazil have both proposed <Col N="1771" /> that $1 out of that $10 tax should be used for Third World aid?  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he supports such a proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the nature of this conference to make proposals and decisions lightly in the manner which the Deputy is suggesting.  The Government, as I hope the Deputy knows, have strongly supported the UNCED process and, indeed, have participated fully in all the major preparatory committees and meetings, including the last one in New York in March.  They are the committees and the fora from which those issues emanate. The Rio Conference will finalise the work that has been done to date and Ireland will be contributing to this process during the conference.  It is not in the nature of the conference that Governments would put forward specific proposals for decisions in the manner in which the Deputy is suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach, as head of the Government, has no proposals to make on any topic at Rio de Janeiro, why does he propose to spend the last five days of the Maastricht Treaty campaign out of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite confident of the Government's action campaign in relation to the Maastricht Treaty and I cannot see what bearing that has on the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should have told Deputy Andrews that last night before he went on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Minister told the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I hope that today's declaration by the leaders of the four main parties, in conjunction with the action programme that has been devised by the Government and, indeed, by the individual parties, will mean that we will <Col N="1772" /> get a positive &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.  I did not say that I would not be making suggestions in relation to items that can be examined.  Indeed, I shall be asking the conference to accelerate conserving technologies that should be rapidly brought forward in order to help in the fight against global warming, harmful emissions and rain forest destruction.  For instance, I shall suggest consideration of the use of alternatives to charcoal and coke in the steel industry in Brazil, which contributes more than 10 per cent of CO2 emission into the atmosphere.  The emission of CO2 into the atmosphere can cause flaring gas.  We shall certainly be making plenty of suggestions on such issues.  The Deputy need not be worried; this country will be well and truly represented at the Conference in Rio de Janeiro.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas the Government's focus at the Rio de Janeiro Conference may be at the main conference, my understanding is that much good work is taking place at the margins of the conference.  From the Taoiseach's schedule, could he outline to us whether he will be attending or addressing any conferences on the margin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought various meetings with some Heads of Government in relation to conferences on the margins.  I hope to finalise the arrangements when I get to Rio de Janeiro.  Some meetings have already been finalised but others have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach two questions concerning the conference at Rio de Janeiro.  First, would he not agree that global warming is one of the most serious ecological problems that the world has to face?  Would he further agree that something must be done to reduce the pollution from fossil fuel power stations?  That could be done primarily by way of an energy tax.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is a disgrace that Ireland is not supporting the concept of an energy tax?  Second, will the Taoiseach support Dublin Corporation <Col N="1773" /> tomorrow when, as is very likely, they make a call for Dublin to be a CFC-free zone, in view of the tremendous damage that CFCs are causing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This question deals with the Earth Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Garland is trying to bring the Taoiseach down to earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere is one of the main issues in relation to pollution of the environment.  Undoubtedly this country will be addressing that issue.  The answer does not necessarily lie in taking the easy way out and putting a tax on energy as the only solution to the problem.  The use of fossil fuels in energy production is one aspect that is receiving much attention at Government level and from the Department of Energy and the agencies involved in energy production under their aegis. There is an ongoing and lively investigation into proposals for alternative methods of energy production.  We shall continue to examine the issue; we will not merely jump in as a knee-jerk reaction and say that the answer is a carbon tax, because there may well be other options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that his failure today to give any indication of serious thought on the matter of a carbon tax must convey the impression that he does not have a very clear purpose in his visit to Rio de Janeiro?  I should like to ask the Taoiseach a separate question entirely: is he aware that Sir Ninian Steven, the proposed chairman of Strand II of the talks on Northern Ireland will be present in Rio de Janeiro as the official head of the Australian delegation?  Will he avail of the opportunity presented by the attendance of Sir Ninian and also that of the British Prime Minister to have further discussions on prospects for advancing the talks process in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is <Col N="1774" /> raising a very separate and distinct matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To allay the Deputy's fear that I have not given serious thought to the environment or to the matters coming before the conference, I refer him to a very wide-ranging speech that I made in Cork last September in which I examined that issue a long time before the Deputy or any other Opposition Member even thought of it.  The Deputy should not think that I am short on ideas.  I am prepared to give the Deputy a copy of the speech to which I have referred.  The speech shows clearly that I was addressing the issue of the emission of CO² into the air long before anyone else in the House.  In response to the Deputy's other question, I shall be meeting the British Prime Minister in Rio de Janeiro and have already received a courtesy call from Sir Ninian here in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask a brief supplementary question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a brief supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but we cannot dwell unduly long on this, the first question.  That would only be to the detriment of all other questions.  I shall hear a brief question from Deputy Shatter and then a brief and final question from Deputy Garland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not confirm that the Government do not have a single view on any of the issues that are to be raised at the conference in Rio de Janeiro and that his visit to Rio is more by way of a piece of environmental political optics than for any substantive reason?  Is there a single initiative that the Taoiseach will take while in Rio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a typical outburst of &ldquo;Shatterism&rdquo;.  Every area of the conference is being covered by representatives of the Government.  The Fine Gael Party were so concerned about the conference that they wanted their <Col N="1775" /> own representative to attend.  The Government gladly agreed to that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government wanted someone there who knew about the issues being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Fine Gael representative has been instructed with all of the wisdom that seems to emanate from Fine Gael benches.  With all of that wisdom, Fine Gael have only one proposal &mdash; to tax energy.  The Government have a broad range of ideas on energy conservation and pollution of the environment.  Deputy Shatter need not worry about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow the Taoiseach will know of the Fine Gael ideas on the environment.</P>

      <P>I call Deputy Garland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach confirm that the press release which indicated that he would act as co-ordinator of the whole conference was a figment of Tom Savage's mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that he would need more time to study the energy tax.  Might I remind him that the tax was proposed as long ago as 18 months.  Surely that would be time enough for examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Further to my statement in the House on Wednesday, 3 June, Deputies will be aware that at their special meeting in Oslo on Thursday last, EC Foreign Ministers agreed that the ratification process in member states will continue on the basis of the existing text of the Treaty on European Union and in accordance with the Treaty timetable before the end of the year.  In short, the agreed procedures for ratification will go ahead and the door for Denmark's participation remains open.  The position will be reviewed later in the light of developments.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the European Council in Lisbon has not yet been finalised but, as I have indicated before in the House, it will include the Delors II budgetary package and EC enlargement.  The Government will be participating actively and constructively in that Council.</P>
      <P>The statement agreed today by the leaders of the four main parties in the House, Deputy John Bruton, Deputy Dick Spring, Deputy Des O'Malley and myself, is relevant to the attitude which the Government will take at the Lisbon Summit.</P>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate a copy of that statement with this reply.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Four Party Leaders call for &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Treaty on European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a meeting today between the Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil, Albert Reynolds, T.D.; the Leader of Fine Gael, John Bruton, T.D.; the Leader of the Labour Party, Dick Spring, <Col N="1777" /> T.D.; and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Desmond O'Malley, T.D.; the following statement was issued.</P>
    <P>The four leaders have concluded that:</P>
    <P>The balance of advantage for Ireland remains, very strongly, in favour of supporting the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>For, either the Danish decision will change, in which event a referendum decision authorising Irish ratification will be of crucial importance, or the Danish decision stands, in which event a positive Irish decision will be a strong expression by the Irish people of our commitment to the principle and process of European integration, and provide a solid political basis for the Irish approach to the Community discussions that will then be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Treaty has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the Dáil and Seanad.  The economic, social and political benefits for Ireland have not changed with the Danish referendum result.  Our other partners are resolved to move ahead and ratify the Treaty.  Re-negotiation has been firmly ruled out.</P>
    <P>The Treaty has the potential to boost economic growth, provide more jobs and narrow disparities in living standards between Community countries.  The task for us is to translate that economic growth into jobs here in Ireland.  The Economic and Social Research Institute stated last week:</P>
    <P>The strength with which Ireland weathered the international recession and the favourable prospects opened up by the Single European Market and, assuming ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, by moves towards European Monetary Union are powerful reasons why confidence in Ireland's ability to sustain a growth rate well above the European average over the coming decade should increase steadily from now on.</P>
    <P>Economic and Monetary Union should help bring about lower interest rates, thus facilitating greater investment and helping <Col N="1778" /> to realise the potential that exists for economic growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would be clearly against our national interest.  It would run the risk of causing a flow of investment funds out of the country, an increase in interest rates, still higher unemployment and lower living standards.  It would also relegate us to the margins, with a greatly reduced ability to influence the major decisions being made internationally which directly affect our interests one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The breaking down of trade barriers presents us with the challenge of competing even more effectively.  But if we can compete, the Treaty also helps the creation of jobs in Ireland because it underpins our freedom to sell our goods and services all over Europe.  It will create a single European currency, saving the time and costs of changing money at every border, including our own.</P>
    <P>The Treaty also offers a new framework for fruitful co-operation between Irish men and women, North and South in this country.  As already exemplified in the European Community, the prospects for peace, reconciliation, and stability throughout the island of Ireland can only be strengthened by a much greater degree of economic co-operation and interdependence.</P>
    <P>The Treaty will guarantee common environmental standards across Europe, protecting countries from pollution generated by their neighbours.  Although much remains to be done, the Agreement on Social Policy associated with the Treaty extends the scope of majority voting and significantly improves workers' and women's rights.  The Treaty has the potential to strengthen the Community's role as a core of stability in Europe, to place Europe in the vanguard of the battle against hunger, want and oppression, and to make Europe a force for peace, justice and development in the world.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty is helping us to build a structure for peace in Europe &mdash; peace through unity.  Defence issues are not being decided in this Treaty.  The Treaty provides for an Intergovernmental <Col N="1779" /> Conference on defence and other issues in 1996.  At this conference decisions will have to be taken by unanimity. In short, a union decision on defence could not take effect without Ireland's agreement.  All the Party leaders who are signatories to this statement confirm that Ireland's agreement to any such decision will not be given without a further referendum of the people.</P>
    <P>All the Leaders who have signed this statement agree that the right to information, appropriately regulated by law, and to travel will be copperfastened in a further Referendum in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Legislative and-or Constitutional changes arising from the Supreme Court decision on Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution will be placed before the Dáil by the Government as soon as is practicable and, in any case, by the autumn.</P>
    <P>Along with other European leaders, we are disappointed with the outcome of the recent referendum in Denmark.  But the Community has confirmed that the door remains open for Denmark's participation in European Union.  In the meantime, the focus of attention will be on Ireland's decision.  It is, more than ever, vitally important for Ireland, and for Europe, that the people of Ireland vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This will enhance our standing in Europe and strengthen our position in EC negotiating fora at a time when very important negotiations are under way. This is, therefore, a time for the greatest possible national unity and consensus. This is why we have joined together in this call to the Irish people for a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>European integration is a response to practical realities.  But, in its best form, as reflected in the preamble to the Treaty on European Union, it is also a noble ideal, involving the deepening of solidarity between the European peoples, while respecting their respective histories, cultures and traditions.  It has the potential further to consolidate the foundations for durable peace in Europe and for a constructive and unselfish European <Col N="1780" /> role in promoting peace, liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and prosperity throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have always supported this European ideal.  The Treaty on European Union offers a fresh opportunity of shaping a Community in tune with the best traditions and values of the Irish people.  Ní neart go cur le chéile!</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know that on this side of the House there is a very strong hope that the Danish people will take the opportunity to reconsider their decision, after having taken ample time for reflection?  Could the Taoiseach outline the contingency plan that he and his colleagues as Heads of Government of the European Community have to deal with the event of the Danish people not changing their mind? What procedure is contemplated for a revision of the Maastricht Treaty and of associated European treaties to allow the other 11 member states to go ahead with the proposals contained in the Maastricht Treaty with Denmark's agreement but without Denmark's participation in the event that Denmark decides finally not to participate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the ratification process proceeds. Nobody is entitled to take a view as to what the Danes will or will not do.  I share the Deputy's hope and expectation that the Danish people will eventually decide to come into the Maastricht Treaty in the way in which it stands.  That is their own decision.  The Twelve Foreign Ministers, including the Danish Minister, met in Oslo and agreed that the ratification process should proceed.  We are honouring our international obligations in that regard, as are the other member states. Agreement was also reached that the 11 member states proceed with ratification; the Danes agreed to that.  We shall go ahead on the basis of ratification.  The Treaty is now as valid as it was until one country or more decide not to proceed with the ratification process.  At this stage any questions relating to that are hypothetical because we believe and hope that <Col N="1781" /> all member states who have participated so far in bringing the development of Europe and the integration of Europe to the stage at which it is today will in the end proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome provides that any Treaty amendment stemming from it must be agreed by common consent, which must include all members, including Denmark?  For the benefit of the Irish electorate, will the Taoiseach outline the way in which the other 11 countries, including Ireland, could go ahead with the Maastricht Treaty in the absence of Danish agreement? Will he agree that it is possible to draft a second treaty which would represent a relatively minor amendment to the Maastricht Treaty, which would allow the Eleven to go ahead while recognising that it would, of course, require the consent of Denmark?  Has the Taoiseach, with his colleagues, given thought to outlining how that could be done so that the people could before 18 June, be given as clear a picture as possible in relation to the contingency plans to deal with the eventuality &mdash; which we hope will be avoided &mdash; of ultimate Danish non-participation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view &mdash; and hope &mdash; that this question will not arise and that the Danes will participate in the Maastricht Treaty eventually.  There may be other alternatives which will have to be examined if that situation should arise.  However, the Twelve foreign ministers of the member countries gave a very clear signal that they wanted to proceed and, consequently, also said that there would not be renegotiation.  The text and provisions are the important matters as far as Ireland is concerned.  It is not what it is called, the text and provisions of the Treaty signed at Maastricht on 7 February are the important matters.  As I said, the other member states are not in favour of renegotiation.  We will honour our obligations in that regard, others will do the same and there is no point in <Col N="1782" /> talking about alternatives.  However, it is a matter which is receiving close attention in the legal services of the Commission and they will advise the Community, in due course, if that situation arises.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that there is substantial public confusion about the Maastricht Treaty?  Will he agree that the evasion of direct answers to specific questions by him and Ministers is fuelling confusion and suspicion?  Will he also agree that the Maastricht Treaty should be supported for sound economic and political reasons in the forthcoming referendum and that no damage will be done to a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote by admitting that, for constitutional and legal reasons, a further referendum may be required at a later stage if the Danes remain outside the process?</P>

It would be very helpful if the Taoiseach was more forthcoming in his response to questions.  It would help the debate, especially in the context of the statement made today by the four party leaders. The Taoiseach cannot have it both ways by saying that the Treaty is valid as long as it is ratified by all members states. We must acknowledge the way Denmark voted and the Taoiseach should now also acknowledge that an Irish &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will be a strong expression by the people &mdash; as we said this morning &mdash; of our commitment to the principle and process of European integration.  Has the Taoiseach received advice from his legal advisers, or indeed from the Commission's legal advisers, as to the present constitutional status of the Maastricht Treaty?</P>

Will the Taoiseach also agree that, too frequently, members of his Government, when faced with a crisis in relation to the Maastricht Treaty, have shot from the hip and, for reasons of political expediency, made inaccurate comments?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary predicts <Col N="1788" /> growth in GDP of 3¾ per cent and GNP growth of 2¼ per cent this year.  This is the most optimistic forecast yet published by a major forecasting agency.  It compares with recent forecasts of GDP growth of 2¼ per cent and 2½ per cent by the EC Commission and the Central Bank respectively.  The commentary also predicts that tax receipts will come in about £150 million better than the budget target and that the EBR will be about £500 million &mdash; some £90 million below the budget estimate.</P>
      <P>In the January budget, the Minister for Finance projected GDP growth of 2¼ per cent and GNP growth of 2 per cent.  The difference between the ESRI's assessment and that underpinning the budget is not as great as it seems.  Half of the difference is due to a technical factor &mdash; the projected change in EC Intervention Agency stocks.  The remainder is due to the ESRI's forecast of stronger growth in industrial exports and investment.</P>
      <P>Economic data available since the budget suggest that growth could be stronger than envisaged at budget time but I would not be as optimistic as the ESRI.  The institute's forecast for industrial exports and investment seems to be somewhat optimistic in view of the sluggishness of the international recovery, particularly in the UK.  I note that the EC Commission has recently revised downwards by ½ per cent its forecast for EC growth in 1992 and has revised down its forecast for UK growth from 2 per cent to 0.6 per cent.  On the other hand, the latest economic data from Germany are encouraging showing an annualised GDP growth rate in the first quarter of 1992 of over 8 per cent which is probably due to technical reasons but nevertheless may be significant.  Projected growth rates are matters on which analysts do, and may reasonably, differ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the ESRI's forecast that tax revenue this year will come in £150 million better than projected in the budget.  The ESRI's forecast is not based on a projection of stronger domestic economic growth than that on which the budget was based.  In fact, growth in the key variables driving tax revenue &mdash; the <Col N="1789" /> value of consumption and the non-agricultural wage bill &mdash; is actually less in the ESRI's assessement than that projected by the Department of Finance at budget time.</P>
    <P>All the available information suggests that tax revenue so far this year is in line with budget expectations but not significantly better.  As is the usual practice, the Department of Finance will be reviewing economic and budgetary prospects in July and will publish their updated forecasts in <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i> in a couple of months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach studied in particular the section of the report which draws attention to the fact that a large amount of capital has been invested overseas by both institutions and Irish business and is he aware that, in relation to job creation, it identifies this as a key issue in terms of how that capital should be invested domestically; if he agrees with it and, if so, do the Government propose to take any measures to ensure that some of that overseas investment is invested in the domestic economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was always recognised, with the liberalisation of capital movements, that there would be a movement of Irish capital abroad by investment managers in Ireland to ensure a balanced portfolio.  However the Deputy should look at both sides of the coin. Inflows of capital have been extremely strong from Germany and other foreign investors.  This forms part and parcel of the single market and we are going to have to live with it in the future.  We will have to continue to try to attract as much if not more than what goes out.  Our reserves at this point in time would suggest that we are doing extremely well in that regard.  There is also the question of Irish companies making acquisitions abroad to strengthen their home base and company activities for the future. Therefore, while there will always be the free movement of capital, what is important is that we attract more in than goes out.  Job creation remains the unsolved problem in the economy and that is the <Col N="1790" /> reason we take every initiative and seek out every opportunity to create jobs because that is what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that the ESRI forecast on economic growth will change the projected out-turn for unemployment at the end of the year as contained in the budget and is he concerned, despite the projected increase in growth for the year, that the ESRI conclude that there will be a rise in unemployment of 10,000 and, with regard to the slowing down pattern witnessed at the end of 1991 &mdash; I think this is specifically referred to on page 24 &mdash; an accelerating rate of unemployment in the early months of 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for the rise in unemployment, which we all anticipate and debate at length in the House from time to time, include the non-availability of job opportunities in many traditional areas, the return of many people throughout 1991 and into 1992 and the increase in the labour force of 25,000 every year at a time when the world recession makes it impossible to create jobs at the level required to stem the rise in unemployment.  There is no simple, instant, quick fix solution, as the Deputy is well aware, but, as I said, the Government will continue to do what they can in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forecasting is an inexact science and it is a question of taking views on certain segments of the economy from the ERSI, other forecasters and the Department of Finance.  As we all recall, at the start of last year the forecasters predicted a disastrous year in terms of budgetary overruns.  Indeed, many of the Deputies sitting opposite in this House pleaded the same cause but, as we are all aware, at the end of the year there was not this budgetary overrun despite the scare given by various forecasters throughout the year and by various politicians as well.  I caution everybody that forecasting is an inexact science; people take a different view on different aspects of statistics but, as I have already said, I forecast growth of close on 3 per cent while the <Col N="1791" /> ESRI forecast growth of 3.75 per cent.  I have no doubt that between now and the end of the year other forecasts will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is a considerable buildup of unspent savings in the economy at present and that if people had confidence to invest those savings the ingredients exist for rapid economic growth in Ireland?  Is he aware that the ESRI forecasts which, as the Taoiseach said, are among the most optimistic that have been made in recent times, are predicated on continued guaranteed free access to the European market and on the prospects for a single European currency and that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum could undermine a good part of the optimism in the ESRI report?  Furthermore, is he aware that there is a substantial volume of German money invested in the Irish money market, Deutsche Marks converted into Irish Punts, in Irish gilts so that any suggestion that Ireland was not going to be a full participant in economic monetary union could lead to a withdrawal of those funds almost overnight resulting in the possibility of quite a significant increase in interest rates here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about four or five elements to the question.  I will reply to them as best I can.  I agree with the Deputy, there has been a large buildup of savings, a normal trend that follows deep world recession when people are uncertain about the future.  As the recession recedes, as Ireland is now well poised to take advantage of an upturn in the world economy, I expect there will be more foreign demand generated in our economy.  I would certainly agree with that.  Of course, all of the ERSI forecasts are predicated on the assumption of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to the Maastricht Treaty. Indeed, they quite clearly point out that we are at a juncture from which we could take off and have very large growth rates in ensuing years, based on a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June, on increased growth in Europe, a single currency, on European <Col N="1792" /> monetary union, all the aspects which will be beneficial to us resulting from the Maastricht Treaty.  The ESRI are forecasting high growth rates on that basis. One would have to agree with them in that respect.  While one might be inclined to quarrel with some elements of the figures, that is the underlying position.</P>
      <P>I must agree wholeheartedly with Deputy John Bruton when he said that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would create uncertainty in the future, a certain type of isolationism on the part of Ireland, giving the impression that we do not want to be part of mainstream development in Europe and, consequently, would affect the investment climate here, investment in the Irish market and uncertainty among multinationals looking to invest here, as happened in the early days of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in Denmark.  Only this morning I read or heard about a multinational company, Lego &mdash; a company with which we will all be familiar &mdash; who were to invest heavily in Denmark but who have changed their minds.  Those are the types of uncertainties that have flowed from the result of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in Denmark. Certainly, the uncertainty a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would create here &mdash; in an economy so largely dependent on investor confidence, on international investment, on good world trade, on a sound, integrated European market &mdash; would mean that we would have a great deal to lose and everybody should be fully aware of that fact.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his initial comments about our export prospects for this year are perhaps unduly pessimistic in view of the 15 per cent increase in the value of manufactured exports in the first quarter, pointing to the probability that the ESRI forecast of a 10 per cent volume of growth for the year may be on the low side? Second, and more importantly, can the Taoiseach say why, in his reply he concentrated exclusively on the short term position and made no reference to the essential, crucial part of the ESRI report in which the point was made, that, because of our extraordinary balance of <Col N="1793" /> payments surplus position &mdash; which is something like over three times that of Japan in relation to our GNP &mdash; we now have a capacity for growth of 6 per cent per annum over four or five years which could yield 30,000 net extra jobs per annum?  Will he agree that the only thing holding us back is the pessimistic assessment on the part of people here of our prospects with regard to outflow of capital, in the mistaken belief that a better return can be got in the United Kingdom and USA than can be got here? Why does the Taoiseach not emphasise these positive features, all of which depend on a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy FitzGerald said, that there were over pessimistic forecasts of our economy last year, in which many Members of this House participated.  Indeed, I constantly fought a rear-guard battle all last year, saying that that will not be the position, while people complained about the Government fiddling the figures, doing this, that and the other.  Those are the sorts of things that affect public confidence. Consequently, we should look at what the facts demonstrate.  The reason for placing a question mark over the ESRI forecast of export growth is because of the OECD forecasted downturn in relation to growth in the United Kingdom market, as they see it, and the sluggishness of the recovery in the international market.  We must remember that everybody takes a different view but I have given the view of the Department of Finance and of my Department at present.  There are other aspects of the ending of the recession that may well lead to stronger pluses than are being forecast by the ESRI.  There are always different views between forecasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what Deputy Garret FitzGerald said and agree with him.  I said we were poised for enhanced growth in the years ahead if there is a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum, if everything transpires in the manner we want and hope. Indeed, our balance of payments is such that we can afford growth rates of the size <Col N="1794" /> about which Deputy FitzGerald spoke without any constraint thereon.  All in all, we could not be better poised or in a better position if we do the right thing on 18 June.  Let us get on with developing our economy in the manner in which we all desire.</P>

It appears now that the future of the world hangs on Ireland voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum. We were told our future was dependent on getting inflation down and on getting our productivity up.  We were told we could not have jobs unless an economic miracle was achieved.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A major campaign of the type referred to by the Deputy would be very costly. Bearing in mind the current state of the public finances and the need to limit Exchequer expenditure, the funds necessary to mount such a campaign are not available at the present time.  I am not convinced in any event, that such a campaign would give the best return on the money invested compared with more targeted campaigns.</P>
      <P>Targeted education and awareness campaigns aimed at specific sectors and subsectors of the economy and operated within budgetary constraints have for a number of years been a feature of my Department's ongoing energy conservation programme.  Sectors and groups are identified by reference to the perceived scope for energy savings in that sector or group and promotional campaigns are structured with the nature of the particular group in mind.  These measures often include seminars, conferences and workshops tailored to the needs of the particular group.  They have proved to be extremely successful in bringing together the various interests involved in an individual sector to exchange information and new ideas in the area of energy efficiency.</P>
      <P>The ESB are engaged in a campaign to promote efficiency and conservation in the use of electricity in accordance with their commitment to demand-side management. Whilst the campaign is broadly based it also targets particular areas of electricity consumption in the domestic, industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed with the Minister's reply, as I thought all he needed was a tickle at the elbow before taking this proposal on board.  The Minister said such a campaign would be too costly but it is estimated that the current level of waste runs at <Col N="1801" /> £400 million per annum and what could be more costly than that?  Will the Minister confirm to the House that one of the major sectoral consumers of energy is the domestic consumer who has to meet both the need for energy and for heating in the household.  This would be a very important group to target, as every penny spent on promoting conservation would be recouped many times over each year. Is it not the case, because of a cut of 28 per cent in the allocation for conservation, that in effect, the Minister has no money to spend in this area and has no serious commitment to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not exactly true to say that there has been a substantial cut in the amount of money allocated to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact &mdash; it is in the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If one examines the Estimates, one will see a substantial reduction but it must be borne in mind that the amount of money allocated each year since 1980 is around the £300,000 mark and we have continued with that level of allocation.  Under a special Government programme, we added £500,000 to that.  This was expected to have been spent in 1990 but there was a run on into 1991.  However, that additional amount of money over and above the allocation has been accounted for in the 1990 and 1991 Estimates.  The amounts of money allocated in the period from 1980 to 1992 are similar for every year and indeed the Deputy's party were in Government during this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of the Deputy's argument does not stand up to examination.  There is no proof that throwing money at a campaign, as suggested by the Deputy, would necessarily achieve the objective, which is to conserve energy and thereby reduce our energy costs and emissions of pollution into the atmosphere.  I believe that within the present financial constraints we have taken the wisest course in targeting our efforts where we can achieve the greatest possible success.  In <Col N="1802" /> fact a great deal of work that the Department are doing in this area is not implemented by the Department but by Eolas who undertake quite a wide range of activities in promoting conservation in the industrial and commercial world in the public sector.  It has to be remembered that the savings that are achieved in one year are repeated in subsequent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, absolutely, and that is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the additional advantage to be gained.  I do not think that the Deputy and I disagree on the necessity to achieve the maximum degree of conservation in energy consumption because this has obvious benefits to the economy and to the environment, and I am certainly very committed to achieving this.  I feel that we have been very successful given the present constraints.</P>
      <P>The public, as individuals, have a major role to play in conserving their use of energy.  On numerous occasions I have appealed to the public to respond positively to this, because everybody accepts the benefits and advantages of conserving energy.  I do not wish to delay the House with a very long reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Following reports in the press regarding allegations of high levels of non-ionising radiation from natural and man-made sources, my Department sought information in the matter from Healthwatch, the organisation mentioned in the reports.  Certain information in the matter has been received by my Department from Healthwatch and it has been copied to the Department of Health.

      <P>I very much welcome the involvement of the Minister's Department in this matter.  Given the tremendous level of local concern about the matter, will he ensure that this investigation is carried out as speedily as possible? It is vital that we know whether there is an increased level of deaths from cancer in the area and whether there is a risk of radiation from whatever source. An action programme which will allay public fears should be implemented as quickly as possible.  Has the Minister received any information from the ESB in relation to their activities in the locality which Healthwatch seem to claim are the source of this non-ionising radiation?  If he has such information will he make it available to public representatives so that <Col N="1804" /> they can pass it on to the public immediately?</P>

      <P>First, I wish to caution people against over-reacting to the suggested implications which were drawn from this document.  As far as I can establish, the Healthwatch document is unsigned.  From an initial reading of the document, it seems the so-called investigation was not very extensive &mdash; it was carried out on one day, Saturday, 16 May 1992.  In addition, the locations are codified for the purposes of confidentiality. As I said, the document will be carefully examined and I will make public the views of my Department on it.  After the document has been carefully examined the Department of Health will convey their views on it by way of a public statement. I would caution people against rushing into making extreme assumptions based on what seems to be very unscientific evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Remedial action to deal with unacceptable levels of radon gas is primarily a matter for the householders and property owners concerned. However, guidance on remedial action is provided by the Department of the Environment through the Environmental Research Unit which has issued an advisory booklet in the matter entitled <i>Radon in Buildings</i>.  That booklet, which is available on request from the ERU, advises that, where appropriate measures cannot be chosen with confidence, an architect, engineer or radiation scientist, who is properly qualified to advise on remedial measures, should be contacted.  The Department of the Environment also recently co-operated with engineering and architectural organisations in arranging <Col N="1805" /> seminars in Cork and Galway on the radon gas problem.</P>
      <P>In the particular case of certain schools in Counties Mayo and Galway, in which radon gas levels have been established to be unacceptably high, the Department of Education, in co-operation with the Office of Public Works and the school authorities, have initiated remedial measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the remedial measures which have been initiated in Counties Mayo and Galway.  Does the Minister have any information in relation to the other counties which were identified as being at a particularly high risk, County Clare and parts of County Cork? Has he been in touch with the Minister for Health to discuss the possibility of carrying out an analysis of the health risk to people who have been exposed to high levels of radon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the risk of contacting lung cancer as a result of exposure to radon depends on the level of radon concentration one is exposed to and, in particular, the length of time. The average lifetime risk in Ireland of contracting lung cancer is 3 per cent.  It is currently estimated that for a person in whose house the average radon concentration is the same as the reference level this risk is approximately doubled. In the case of smokers, there is evidence that the risks associated with exposure to radon are considerably higher than for non-smokers.  Each householder who resides in an area where there is deemed to be a high radon level has a duty to himself to have his house tested.  This test can be carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute for a fee of £15 over a period of seven to nine months.  If it is found that the radon levels are in excess of the reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre then it is recommended that some remedial action be taken.  As I said, the Department of the Environment have issued a booklet on how best to take that remedial action.</P>

      <P>That is a more recent speech.

I have been charged with the responsibility of carrying out that examination and to report back to the Government on my proposals which would result in the introduction of competition to the electricity industry.  There does not now seem to be any justification for allowing the ESB to maintain a monopoly position in the generation of electricity. It is for that purpose alone that this matter is being examined.  It is the intention to try to encourage private investment in the construction of electricity generating plants which would be able to supply electricity in competition with a restructured ESB through a distribution and transmission unit.  That is the intention and purpose of this examination.</P>
      <P>There is also the obligation imposed on us by our membership of the European Community which is moving in the direction of establishing an internal energy market which will require unbundling in energy utilities and the identification of costs so as to ensure that there is full transparency of costs in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and gas.  We will be obliged to comply with these requirements in time. This study is being undertaken to achieve the Government's objective of trying to get the best possible value for consumers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 47 together.  Two fields, Kinsale Head and Ballycotton, constitute Ireland's proven reserves of natural gas. A continuous process of study measures reserves in both gas fields.  The latest <Col N="1809" /> studies suggest that at end March 1992 remaining recoverable reserves from both fields amount to about 700 billion cubic feet (BCF).</P>
      <P>Based on the current and anticipated requirements of Bord Gáis Éireann, both fields will be depleted early in the next decade.  In 1991, 83 BCF of natural gas was delivered from the fields.  Quantities of this order will be maintained for a few years due to the installation of compression facilities on the platforms.  After that the annual rates will fall off as the ability of the fields to deliver declines.  In addition to supplies from the two fields, Bord Gáis Éireann's requirements for the future will also be served by new discoveries of gas or imports through the gas interconnector or by a combination of both.  Prospects for growth in gas usage are excellent and the current volumes could double over the next 15 years.</P>

It is my hope that the gas pipeline will, in time, be extended to supply all the major areas of population in the country, but that will <Col N="1810" /> depend on availability of gas and the progress made by the company in extending supply to the areas where there is already a major pipeline.</P>

Contracts were negotiated by previous Governments, and I dare not comment as to whether they were good or bad value for this country &mdash; people will form their own opinions in that regard.  The company policy being followed at present is very progressive and is the best possible way in which we can maximise the benefit of the natural gas which we have at present.  Hopefully further drilling programmes will result in new discoveries of gas which will add to our stocks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Today, Dáil Éireann has the opportunity to explain clearly and simply to the Irish people the main issues when they vote next week on 18 June on ratification of the European Union Treaty, and why they should not be influenced by the decision of the Danish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the main parties in this House, and the vast majority of organisations outside, especially the trade unions, the employers and the farmers, share my conviction that there is an enormous amount at stake for this country.  We are all advocating what we believe in good faith to be in the best interests of the Irish people, and it is hardly credible to suggest that we are all intent on deceiving the people. Irish politicians are closer to the people than is the case in any other country.  This <Col N="1924" /> is a major decision, which should not be taken lightly, or on the basis of concerns about one issue, however important.  The decision should be based on a judgment on the broad balance of advantage, and on a clear view of where Ireland's future lies.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that voters should have the fullest possible information on all the issues.  With the end to the postal strike, the Government's short guide should be in the hands of all voters, including those in the Dublin area, in the next day or two at the latest.  A number of supplementary leaflets covering the Treaty and its benefits have also been produced.  I would also like to announce that as and from Thursday a special free telephone information line will be established to answer any queries which voters may have. Details will be advertised.  There has also been very full information provided in the media, and in that regard I would like to pay tribute to the print media for their full coverage, and especially to RTE on their decision to broadcast the next two hours of Dáil proceedings, as a means of bringing information direct to the listening public.</P>
    <P>The decision here on 18 June is vitally important, not just for Ireland, but for the whole of Europe.  We are being asked to decide whether European Union should go ahead.  We have a right and a duty as a sovereign, independent country to give our own answer to that.  There can be no question of our position, or our right to decide, being pre-empted or taken away from us by the Danes.  The Irish as a sovereign people have their own right to speak.  Danish concerns have always been very different from ours. They have the highest <i>per capita</i> income in the Community.  Geographically, they are much more centrally placed.  They will be net contributors to the EC budget. Like Britain, but unlike Ireland, they have for their own reasons never been keen supporters of close European integration.</P>
    <P>We are proceeding with the referendum to ratify, because each member state under the Treaty has agreed to complete the procedure before the end of the <Col N="1925" /> year, and we are therefore legally obliged to do so.  The Foreign Ministers of the Twelve meeting in Oslo, including the Danish Foreign Minister, all agreed that ratification by each member state should go ahead as planned.  We cannot presume what the situation will be, until the ratification procedure is complete in all countries. As things stand, the Treaty remains open for ratification by all who have signed the Treaty till the end of the year and even beyond.  What would happen, if one or more member states finally and definitively refuse to ratify the European Union Treaty, with the other member states still willing and, indeed, determined to go ahead, is a matter that may have to be addressed, if and when the time comes.  The Danish Foreign Minister has not looked for a renegotiation and has clearly expressed a desire that the rest of the Community should go ahead with European Union with or without Denmark.  Ireland has no wish to exclude anyone.  We would like Denmark to be full participants in European Union, to the extent that they themselves wish, bearing in mind the need for a workable legal and institutional framework.</P>
    <P>The decision to ratify is in the first instance a political choice.  In proceeding with the referendum on 18 June, we are asking the Irish people to make this political choice.  Making the choice, whether we wish to be part of the European Union on the basis of the Treaty, retains its full political validity, regardless of the Danish decision.  Our choice could have very important consequences, if at the end of the day some alternative to the European Union Treaty, even if only as to the number of participants, has to be found. It will indicate whether Ireland does or does not want to be part of a group of countries committed to further European integration.</P>
    <P>It is untrue that the Community's reaction to the Danish decision shows a willingness to override small nations that would not be displayed towards a larger one.  If the Community is to maintain momentum, it has to be able to find a way to proceed, even when one or more <Col N="1926" /> member states choose to opt out, and they are not always the smaller ones. The Social Charter and the EMS were proceeded with, despite the non-participation of Britain, which also has an opt-out clause in relation to European Monetary Union.  President Mitterrand, when he argues against French isolation in Europe, is not counting on any special treatment for France, if it votes &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our experience in the Community, on the contrary, is that small countries are shown every consideration.  The best way to enhance our sovereignty in an interdependent world is to belong to a body like the European Community, which gives us a chance to influence and shape decisions often out of proportion to our numerical weight in terms of population. How often have specific Irish interests been protected by a special clause, an exemption, a declaration?</P>

      <P>In the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform deal, for instance, we obtained a special measure, to assist the production of winter beef, unique to Ireland.  The alternative to full participation, to a seat at the table, is to be a spectator on the outside without any influence looking in.  The EFTA countries have found that unsatisfactory. Under the principle of subsidiarity most decisions will still be taken by an Irish Government in Dublin, respecting the criteria which we have accepted for European Monetary Union.  Far from enhancing the power of the European Commission, the Treaty increases the role of the directly elected European Parliament and the European Council, made up of heads of government and Foreign Ministers, thus reducing the power of the bureaucrats in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last 40 years Western Europe has enjoyed unprecedented peace and prosperity.  The holocaust of war, acute tensions between states, great economic depressions have been banished.  The founding of the European Community, a new and unique concept in international relations, can be compared in importance <Col N="1927" /> to the founding of the United States of America, and is the product of a similar enlightenment.  The Community has not only protected the peace and stability of Western Europe, but provided a magnet and an alternative model for the peoples of Eastern Europe to break loose from foreign domination, from the dictatorship of a State system devised to suppress the individual.  A dynamic Community played a part in breaking down the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>In the inter-war years the absence of any such structures undermined democracy and led to terrible consequences. We can see in other parts of Europe today the dangers to peace and the potential for destruction caused by ethnic tensions and territorial rivalries that go back to the pre-1914 era.  In our own island of Ireland the European Community can contribute to the framework for a settlement that will bring about peace and reconciliation, that transcends historic differences, and provides a basis for constructive co-operation, given the growing economic interdependence between the North and the South.  A negative outcome would reinforce Partition.</P>
    <P>If Ireland were to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, either of two situations could arise.  We could either be excluded from European Union, which would go ahead with a smaller number on a slightly different legal basis yet to be determined.  Alternatively, European Union would not go ahead at all.  I want to explain as simply as I can why it is in our interest that European Union goes ahead, and why Ireland should be part of it, and why the converse would be very detrimental to our national interests.</P>
    <P>The kind of stability that the Community has given is the foundation of economic confidence and prosperity.  If European Union were to be halted or rejected, it would represent a huge confidence blow to the whole Community. Ireland would no longer be so attractive a place for investment.  The Community would at best be condemned to stagnate and at worst it would begin to break up.</P>
    <P>European Union is the next logical step <Col N="1928" /> after joining the Community, and the completion of the Single Market.  To operate effectively the Single Market needs a single currency, which requires the pursuit of common economic policies, resulting in convergence through cohesion.  You cannot run a common currency without a high degree of political solidarity, hence the need for Political Union.  Everything in the Treaty hangs together.  The kernel of the Treaty is the single currency.  Everything else is built round it.</P>
    <P>What are the advantages to Ireland of belonging to European Union?  First of all, we have free, unhindered access to a European market of 360 million consumers, including EFTA.  We are the country that is most dependent on exports.  1,000 foreign companies have established in Ireland, including some very large and important ones, in recent years.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, a serious doubt will arise, as has already happened in Denmark, as to whether Ireland is a suitable base for supplying the European market.  Will these companies remain in Ireland to supply a market of 3.5 million people?</P>
    <P>A common currency will facilitate transactions, and it will eliminate exchange costs.  It will create a stable framework of investment, and enhance confidence in our future.  We will be represented on the European Central Bank, and along with other countries we will be able to exert more influence on interest rates, which are now effectively determined by Germany alone, reflecting purely domestic German considerations.</P>
    <P>One of the most common misconceptions is that European Monetary Union involves severely deflationary policies.  This is simply not the case. Ireland is eligible to participate in European Monetary Union now.  We are required to make steady progress towards an eventual debt &mdash; GDP ratio of 60 per cent, which we have been successfully doing since 1987.  All that is required is a continuation of current policies under sound economic management.</P>
    <P>Consequently, there is no truth in the suggestion that severe Government cut-backs <Col N="1929" /> are in the offing, or that social welfare payments will have to be drastically cut.  The Government have shown their good faith over many years to those on social welfare.  Even in the most adverse budgetary conditions in the 1980s Fianna Fáil substantially improved in real terms the position of the old and the unemployed and their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When, for budgetary reasons, there had to be severe cut-backs, social welfare was spared.  I want to give a categorical assurance to everyone dependent on social welfare that the Government will adhere to the commitments agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to maintain the value of social welfare payments in real terms.</P>
      <P>A country that refused to participate in European Union would be excluded altogether from the Cohesion Fund, because this fund is strictly tied to the Maastricht Treaty.  Here it is interesting to quote from an article in the business page of the London <i>Times</i> yesterday on the consequences of rejection of that European Union Treaty and it not proceeding as it is.  The article suggests that a subgroup of countries, mainly the Benelux countries, France and Germany, would move even faster towards monetary union.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The main question for the inner monetary core of Europe would be which other countries to admit.  There would also be no question of &lsquo;cohesion funds&rsquo; to transfer resources from the richer northern European countries to poorer southern ones as a reward for joining the monetary club.  In fact, far from bribing new countries to join, this club's membership policy would be &ldquo;strictly by invitation only&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland at present enjoys very favourable financial arrangements with the Community.  We receive £6 from the EC for every £1 we contribute.  Community net transfers amount to 7 per cent of our <Col N="1930" /> gross national product.  Last year, our farmers received direct into the hand £290 million in premia and subsidies. When the Common Agricultural Policy reform is fully implemented, this figure will rise to £650 million per year.</P>
    <P>The proposal to double the funds to the poorer countries from the Commission remains on the table.  Of course, these have to be negotiated.  I have never suggested otherwise.  The present round of Structural Funds expires in 1993, and if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, we will not even have a seat at the table for the negotiations which are now beginning.  Without these funds the Community would be largely a free trade area with little to countervail the impact of the marketplace.  I have to ask opponents of the Treaty do they have a vision of Europe that corresponds largely to that of the previous British Prime Minister, because that would be the most likely outcome of a collapse of the European Union Treaty.</P>
    <P>I do not honestly believe Ireland could negotiate a better deal, even if the Treaty were open for re-negotiation.  It is far more likely that we would lose more than we would gain.</P>
    <P>Virtually every economic and social programme that we have depends on the European funding element: our infrastructure, environment, education and training, rural development, scientific research, our industry, financial services and tourism, forestry and fishing.  If we want a modern public transport system in Dublin, if we want to renew our mainline railway, we will need European funds. It is no use saying we are in favour of European Union, but not in this particular form.  It is not on offer to us in any other form, and certainly not on any more advantageous terms.</P>
    <P>We have an immense unrealised potential in this country, which was highlighted in the latest ESRI report.  Our economy is now balanced so as to be able to sustain a very high rate of economic growth.  The ESRI stress and I quote:</P>
    <P>that Ireland's growth potential in the context of the Single European Market and approaching monetary union is <Col N="1931" /> significantly greater than that of most competing economies.</P>
    <P>They also make the point that Ireland is well placed to attract a share of increasing international investment, I again quote: &ldquo;assuming, of course, that Ireland remains in the mainstream of movement towards European Economic Union&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We need above-average growth if we are to succesfully tackle the problem of unemployment.  We had a glimpse of what could be achieved in 1989-90, when the economy grew by an average of 6 per cent and employment grew by nearly 40,000.  The unemployed had every reason to support Ireland's participation in European Union.  It provided the best hope of increased investment and jobs, and of providing the wealth needed to maintain and improve the position of the disadvantaged throughout our society.</P>
    <P>The economic consequences of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would be very serious.  Things would not stay the same.  As we have seen in Denmark, interest and mortgage rates would rise immediately.  To the extent that German investors, who have a huge amount invested in Ireland, lost confidence in our ability to maintain our exchange rate, the protection of our currency could cost us even more dearly in higher interest and mortgage rates. Industrialists would put their investment decisions on hold.  Weakened confidence in the economy would lead to higher unemployment.  The likelihood of a serious reduction over time in EC funds transferred to Ireland could cause severe deflation, including tax rises and expenditure cuts.  Many projects would have to be cancelled and deferred.  The notion that nothing would change could not be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The European Union Treaty has a strong social dimension, that will extend and improve the rights of employers and workers.  That is why it is supported not only by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but by the European Trade Union organisations.  European citizenship rights will underpin the right to <Col N="1932" /> free movement to take up employment or residence anywhere in the Union.</P>
    <P>Europe has also done much to advance women's rights, promoting equality of opportunity and equal treatment in the workplace, in social security and pension rights.  It has repeatedly been European-inspired decisions that much of the advance in equlity for women has derived from.  I welcome the recognition of this today by the Council for the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>The European Union does not mean abortion.  The problems that have arisen must be dealt with in our own domestic law.  Our European partners have no desire to become involved, under the principle of subsidiarity which is set out explicitly in a new article of the Treaty. Social and moral legislation is a question entirely for ourselves.  These matters will be dealt with separately later on this year. The abortion issue has been separated, as far as most reasonable people are concerned, from the European Union Treaty.  It is not relevant to next week's decision.</P>
    <P>We will not be joining NATO or any other military alliance, following ratification of the European Union Treaty. Any new proposals that may be presented in 1996 will have to be agreed unanimously, and put to the Irish people. There is absolutely no provision for conscription to a Euro-army in the Treaty.  I would like to reassure parents, and particularly mothers, that regardless of what else happens in 1996 Ireland will not agree to any arrangements that involve conscription.  Britain has long been a member of both NATO and the Western European Union and abolished conscription nearly 30 years ago.</P>

      <P>Ireland has a long and honourable tradition of international peacekeeping and a commitment to disarmament and to helping developing countries.  Along with other countries of a similar tradition, which will be applying to join on the basis of the Treaty, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, we will seek to put those traditions to the service of Europe.  We can exercise much more effective political influence for peace and make a bigger real contribution to the solution of international problems inside the European Union, which is the world's strongest trading bloc.  We have exercised much positive influence in the past on the Community's policy towards the Middle East, apartheid and Latin America.  However, it would be unreal to pretend that we have more in common with the countries of the Third World than with our neighbours in Europe, under the pretext of internationalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, the balance of advantage to Ireland on 18 June is on the side of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  There is a strong economic case, whatever reservations there may be about it.  It is not sufficient to abstain and hope this will preserve things as they are. Abstention will not maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  Everyone has a duty to vote.  There are few identifiable advantages and great <Col N="1935" /> risks about the consequences of a rejection of the Treaty.  A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote is not a safe option that will ensure that nothing happens.  It is potentially a disastrous decision, which could wreck Ireland's future and perhaps wreck the future of Europe as well.  Politically, we would be reversing a 20 year trend, overturning the consistent pro-European policy followed by all Irish Governments and now supported by all major groups in our society. We have the opportunity instead of reaffirming, not only Ireland's determination to join the front rank of European nations, but also the process of European Union itself, which will consolidate the immense progress made by the Community.  The hopes, particularly of those outside it, like the people of Poland, may depend on our decision. Only a strong Europe will be capable in time of dealing effectively with all the problems of Europe and of assisting third countries to achieve a higher level of development.</P>
    <P>I would therefore ask the people of Ireland to weigh their decision carefully. A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is in all our people's interest and in the larger interest of the continent to which we belong.  Let us grasp this unique opportunity in European history to give a lead to the other member states in advancing European integration and earn for ourselves an enhanced status among the other member states of the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The most important things are, in the final analysis, very simple.  The Maastricht Treaty with all its complexities and detail has confused many people.  Its ramifications are far reaching and in so far as economic and monetary union are concerned, an acquaintance with the principles of monetary economics is necessary, to come to an understanding of the concepts involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> The decision is, however, simple.  The Maastricht Treaty, if passed, will provide us all with new opportunities: opportunities for greater economic growth, for higher living standards, for jobs for our neighbours, our families and our friends, for greater choices and for more elbow room in our personal lives and opportunities for greater freedom in a Europe with a diversity of cultures and ways of life.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is a vote to take these opportunities.  A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote slams the door on these opportunities.</P>
    <P>It is really quite simple: we can decide to go forward or to go backwards.  If we go forward we face the future with pride and confidence, dedicating our talents to building a new Ireland in a new Europe, proud of being Irish in that new Europe. If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; we turn our backs on the future and take a conscious decision to remain in an Irish backwater, while our European neighbours proceed to decide our future without our participation.</P>
    <P>I believe that our economy is now very well positioned to avail of the opportunities which will come once the Maastricht Treaty is passed.  There is undercapacity in our economy and, at the same time, our competitive position is quite strong.  The modest growth rates which we are now experiencing, could be boosted dramatically by the process of Economic and Monetary Union, and by the massive boost to confidence the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty will bring.  By 1994 our growth rates could be the highest in Europe, up to and in excess of 5 per cent.  This level of growth in recent years has only been achieved in the Pacific rim economies but because of the special conditions now prevailing it is possible to achieve such growth levels from 1994 to the completion of European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>Those are the kinds of growth rates we need if we are to make any serious impression on job creation.  Sustained growth of 5 per cent for five years would create about 120,000 new jobs in Ireland. That is the kind of job creation which would make the necessary dramatic impact on our way of life.  The possibility is now opening for us to do that.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;<Col N="1937" /> vote alone will not achieve that.  The Government must also reverse the anti-business policies they introduced in the last budget.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, however, will provide the confidence necessary for those growth levels and will help to reduce interest rates, a factor so crucial to growth, and the opportunities of a market of 380 million persons, all committed to the concept of a new Europe, is an opportunity that this country needs and cannot turn its back on.  It is that opportunity rather than £1 million here or there in the Structural Funds which is the exciting prospect.</P>
    <P>After 1 January 1993 citizens of all member states will be citizens of the Union.  They will have all the rights of citizens of the Union but those rights will not derive simply because they are citizens of their own country but because they will have a new citizenship conferred on them, that of the European Union. These citizens will have equal rights under the law.  Principal among the rights will be the right to travel, the right to work and the right to set up a home or a business in any part of the Union.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is it not a noble and exciting prospect that after 800 years of domination by our nearest neighbours and after such a short period of having the freedom to run our own affairs, we will now participate in the building of the new Europe: free and equal citizens not only of this ancient land but also of a Europe growing in confidence, influence and power?  We should not underplay the importance of this aspect of the Maastricht Treaty, because this is the very key to the Treaty. During the long years of economic and political domination by Great Britain, how often did our forefathers turn to Europe for aid and refuge?  Frequently our wars, which were so important to us, were mere sideshows in wider European conflicts, but the very domination by the British, &ldquo;the seed of all our woes&rdquo;, drove us to closer links with Europe.  As <Col N="1938" /> missionaries, as mendicants, as soldiers of fortune and as patriotic emissaries to the great courts of Europe our forefathers went, and every generation rewove and re-established the links.  The great halls of Versailles were as well known to the Irish as were the libraries of Louvain or Salamanca or the battlefields of Flanders or Passchendaele.  I say this to remind ourselves that we are not participating as strangers in a European Union.  The Celts, the Vikings and the Normans who settled in so much of Europe settled in Ireland too.  We have a common heritage, a common cultural background with our European neighbours, and we should claim that inheritance by a very strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>At the weekend I watched the French film &ldquo;Jean de Florette&rdquo;, and I was struck by the similarities of its theme and action with that of John B. Keane's &ldquo;The Field&rdquo;.  I was struck also by the fact that the rural life of north Kerry and Provence could be the seed beds for two such brilliant films in the final ten years of the 20th century.  We have more in common with our European neighbours than we frequently realise.</P>
      <P>I speak of such things because I believe the Government have diminished the importance of the Maastricht Treaty by approaching it in traditional Fianna Fáil fashion with the begging-bowl mentality. The Taoiseach's initial view of European Union was far too narrow, a simple paraphrase of which would be &ldquo;If you don't vote &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; we won't get the £6 billion from the Structural Funds&rdquo;.  When I first heard that it reminded me of a line from an old rhyme, &ldquo;They sold their souls for penny rolls and hairy lumps of bacon&rdquo;. The Government should not underestimate the idealism of the Irish, and especially that of the young Irish.  The power of an idea is profound.  I believe that if the Government had pitched their campaign at an idealistic rather than a materialistic level they would have stronger support at this point in the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of neutrality has been raised on a number of occasions in the course of the campaign.  Our neutrality has become one of the sacred cows that we are now <Col N="1939" /> almost afraid to debate.  Yet at no time in our history were we really neutral. For hundreds of years we participated in Great Britain's wars, sometimes as unwilling allies.  Frequently, England's difficulty became our opportunity and we sided with her enemies, but neutral we certainly were not.</P>
    <P>In the first Great War thousands of Irish, from both North and South, died on the battlefields of Europe and even though conscription was resisted here by the Home Rule movement, thousands joined the British army and were actively encouraged to do so by the Home Rule leaders, including John Redmond. Indeed, Redmond's brother Willie and his friend Tom Kettle, one of the brightest stars of his party, were killed in France.</P>
    <P>We did not participate in the Second World War.  Our difficulties with Britain and the problems of partition made it politically impossible for us to do so.  De Valera's reply to Churchill at the end of the war subsequently became the plank on which the policy of neutrality was built.  While understanding the political difficulties which gave rise to that policy from 1939 to 1945, I do not think that our being neutral between 1939 and 1945 was necessarily our finest hour.  Is it possible to be a civilised human being and be neutral about Hitler?  Is it possible to be a modern European and be neutral about the holocaust?  Is it possible to stand for human rights and not deplore the racism of the Third Reich and the elimination in the concentration camps of Jews, gypsies and so-called deviant elements?</P>
    <P>In more recent times, is it possible in retrospect not to come to the conclusion that, through the fifties, sixties, seventies and eighties, the West was right and that those on the Left in politics in Ireland who extolled the virtues of economic order and social cohesion in the socialist bloc, who held up Ceaucescu's Romania and Honecker's East Germany as role models for Ireland and who always played the neutrality card in their anti-American campaigns, were wrong and remain wrong?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1940" /> The fact of the matter is that Ireland is not and has never been ideologically neutral.  We have refused to join military alliances, and we have been neutral in that sense.  It is also true that successive Taoisigh have clearly stated on all occasions on which the issue arose that if Ireland were part of a united Europe it would play its part in the defence and security of such an entity.</P>
    <P>Those issues do not arise in the Maastricht Treaty, as the Taoiseach pointed out.  The Irish electorate will not be expected to decide on security and defence issues on 18 June.  But those issues are clearly flagged in the Treaty and I have no doubt at all that by the end of the decade they will be put before the Irish people by way of referendum.  I suggest that rather than dodge the issue we should begin to clear our heads on these matters now.</P>
    <P>Central to the Treaty of Maastricht is the question of economic and monetary union.  Opponents of the Treaty claim that the arrangements for a Euro-currency will lead to a major loss of sovereignty in Ireland to a European Central Bank, an institution on which we will have very little influence.  It is true, of course, that there will be some loss of sovereignty.  On several occasions in the past arrangements have been made with our European partners which have led to a pooling of sovereignty, which resulted in decisions being taken centrally rather than locally.  The loss of sovereignty on this occasion, however, is more apparent than real.  The obligations we have undertaken to remain members of the European Monetary System have left us with very little control over monetary policy. We retain nominal powers but the real decisions that affect the value of our currency are taken elsewhere at the moment.  It is possible to argue that the establishment of a single currency would give us more rather than less influence on monetary policy.  If a European Central Bank becomes a strong fifth institution of the European Community we will have appropriate representation on it and we will be exchanging the nominal control <Col N="1941" /> we have at present for some real say in the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>Ireland, of course, will have to comply with certain fiscal targets under the Treaty.  The current budget deficit may not exceed 3 per cent and the debt as a percentage of GNP must be reduced to 60 per cent.  Both of these rules of membership will restrict the scope for domestic macro-economic management.  Key-nesian demand management will no longer be an option and control of fiscal policy will be shared with our European neighbours.  Here again, the disadvantages are more apparent than real. There has been little scope for Keynesian-type demand management of the economy in recent years.  The last occasion on which this was tried in any significant way was under Dr. Martin O'Donoghue and his colleagues in the economic Departments, the late Deputy George Colley and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Desmond O'Malley.  It could hardly be described as a successful experiment and the smell of burnt fingers ever since in the corridors of power is likely to ensure that no such daft attempt at demand management will be undertaken again in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government must consider carefully how they will reduce the debt to 60 per cent of GNP.  There are three options, to cut public expenditure further, to get higher growth rates in the economy, to sell shares in State companies and to dedicate the proceeds to reducing the debt.  I believe that cutting public expenditure is no longer an option. Expenditure must be kept under control but none of the major spending Departments &mdash; Social Welfare, Health and Education, can sustain further cuts and deliver the services we expect.  The Government must combine the second and third options if they are to avail of the opportunities now presenting themselves and they must reject the anti-business and anti-jobs approach of the first budget of Deputy Ahern as Minister for Finance. If they do this it will be possible to achieve the very high growth rates which, in the course of the decade, will continue to <Col N="1942" /> reduce the debt-GNP ratio to the appropriate level.  In those circumstances we will reach 60 per cent by 1997 or 1998.</P>
    <P>The question of abortion is now intrinsically linked with the Maastricht Treaty. The issue was very badly handled by the Government by the inclusion of the Irish Protocol in the Treaty and in the management of the events which flowed from the Supreme Court judgement in X <i>v</i> the Attorney General.  I have found this past weekend that the issue of abortion is on many people's minds, especially on the minds of older people, many of whom believe that the principal issue arising from Maastricht is whether abortion will be legalised.  This false impression will undoubtedly swell the ranks of those voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Government have mishandled the issue and I appeal to the Taoiseach to make a statement clearly setting out Government policy on abortion. He should not just give the overall position but give details of the legislative course of action he intends taking in the autumn.  This would help to allay the fears which, for one reason or another, are in the minds of many people.  You can make all the logical arguments you like when you talk to people on the doorstep but you will not rid the idea in the minds of some people that, if they vote for Maastricht, they are voting for abortion.</P>
    <P>The Danish rejection of the Treaty will influence the decision here on 18 June. The rejection of Maastricht, however, by the Danes is principally a problem for the Danes.  All EC members must ratify the Treaty, we must fulfil our obligations and seek to do that by way of referendum. The issues are extremely complex, they are difficult to explain, difficult to understand and many voters are confused.</P>
    <P>People should approach the decision of 18 June from the point of view of principle rather than detail.  Those who want to continue on the journey begun by our EC partners 40 years ago, those who look to the future rather than to the past, those with the confidence to embrace the new and to reject the old, will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  We made our choice to participate in Europe in 1972.  This <Col N="1943" /> decision has served us well and was reaffirmed by the Irish people when they endorsed the Single European Act.  I do not believe that they will now turn their backs on the opportunities of the new Europe, on the hopes for lasting peace and continuing prosperity which Maastricht provides.  I look forward to a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; majority.</P>

      <P>The labour movement is convinced that the prospects for Irish working people can best be secured and enhanced within the context of a European Community which is committed to moving ever closer to a European Union. For that reason the Labour Party are in favour of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.</P>
      <P>Since 1973, most of the protective social legislation which has been enacted in Ireland only came into law because of the social dimension of the European Community.  Many things for which the Irish labour movement had campaigned over many years had been successfully denied by conservative administrations at the insistence of employers' organisations. Independent and isolated from the European Community and the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, the labour movement, both within the Dáil and across the Congress of Trade Unions, was unable to convince successive conservative Governments in Ireland to respond to the legitimate demands of working people.</P>
      <P>The vast body of modern legislation on the Irish Statute Book, designed to protect the rights of working people and their families, would not be there &mdash; or would have arrived much later &mdash; if it had not been for Ireland's membership of the European Community.  That membership imposed responsibilities on the Irish Government to enact within their domestic jurisdiction the Directives from the Social Affairs Ministers throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question remaining to be answered by Irish citizens is whether a further development of that Community into a European Union will continue to be in the best interests of Irish working <Col N="1944" /> people.  The Labour Party have published a detailed White Paper on this complex subject and have analysed the components of the economic and monetary union provisions of the Treaty as well as the commitments to cohesion and subsidiarity. These are complex and detailed technical provisions in which the balance of favour or support can be weighed against clear difficulties and reservations. Most Irish people are not in a position to readily assess those costs and benefits. Indeed, most commentators indicated that much of what is proposed will have to be taken on trust.  In short, the move to economic and monetary union consists of a large leap of faith based on our past experience and our best assessment of what our future might be.</P>
    <P>Any normal person would have doubts about such a leap of faith.  It is for that reason that many Irish people are concerned and worried about the full and precise implications of Maastricht at a time when those implications cannot be clearly defined.  That is a perfectly reasonable and understandable position to hold but yet the Government's response to such people is to ridicule their legitimate doubts and either to threaten or bribe them with the consequences of a negative outcome.  Such an approach is hardly democratic and it is certainly ineffective.</P>
    <P>Many politicians, as well as business and trade union leaders, have failed to realise that an essential part of the Maastricht Treaty requires a fundamental shift from a Europe of separate states in a common market to a Europe of separate states in a common union.  While the first objective had clear commercial and economic objectives and benefits the second objective has political consequences and democratic uncertainties. This Government for the last 12 months, first under Deputy Haughey and secondly under Deputy Reynolds, have refused to even recognise the doubts and fears which Irish people legitimately have.  They also steadfastly declined to make known their own views and to invite discussion upon them.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are now being invited <Col N="1945" /> to embark down a road which will ultimately lead to a much closer political union involving the further transfer of political power from the Oireachtas to Brussels and Strasbourg.  There are serious doubts about the democratic accountability of the European institutions to which we are being asked to transfer power and there is a cloak of secrecy over the way in which some decisions take place at present within Brussels.  Just look at how the controversial Protocol was inserted without debate.</P>
    <P>In the fifties and sixties Irish workers had fallen progressively behind their counterparts within the rest of Europe. This was particularly true of those smaller European countries such as Finland, Denmark, Belgium and The Netherlands. While progress was made in both Denmark and Finland because of the strength of the labour movement and the Social Democratic Parties, the advances which occurred both in Belgium and The Netherlands were reinforced by their membership of the original European Community of six member states.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing protection and support for those at work, the European Community recognised the necessity to further assist those seeking work and to equip them with the skills and training which they required.  The support which Ireland derived from 1973 to the present day from the European Social Fund has enabled us to develop and extend an enormous array of training, education and work experience programmes which would not have come into existence if we had remained outside the European Community.  Today, FÁS have a budget of £240 million.  The Department of Education facilitate many students with grants funded by the European Social Fund in the pursuit of training courses in our third-level colleges and institutions.</P>
    <P>The list of benefits from Europe to which Irish workers have become entitled is extensive and ongoing.  We must, however, ask ourselves three questions: first, have we made the best use of those benefits; second, would those benefits have been obtained if Ireland had <Col N="1946" /> remained outside the European Community and third, would Ireland have become a more enlightened society which would have moved towards the construction of a social partnership and the promotion of consensus between employers, trade unions and Government as a means towards economic and social development?</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I believe that, in recent times, we have not used the full resources of the Social Fund to best effect.  There are many criticisms of the relationship of FÁS to industry.  The initial dynamism with which AnCO were established has not been maintained following the merger of the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service to create FÁS.  We have undoubtedly got a major network of very good training centres, but we need to rethink our approach to training and the way in which FÁS handle their trainees.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the combination of conservative forces in Ireland which predominated in the fifties and sixties could not lead one to the conclusion that the political establishment of that day would have made so much money and resources available for the benefit of improving the workforce.  All the evidence of antagonism from the past would lead one to the conclusion that those resources, even if they had been available, would not in the first instance have been spent by a separate and isolated conservative Ireland had we remained outside the European Community.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, as a consequence of that isolation I believe that the pattern of economic and social development would have been modelled on the British and American experiences with little or no influence coming from mainland Europe.  It would have led to the continued improverishment of Irish workers.  The exclusive influence of Anglo-American management thinking would have made Ireland a confrontational and adversarial society.  As a result, the economic and industrial disruption which would of necessity have been characteristic of that model would have reduced Ireland's <Col N="1947" /> attractiveness as a place for economic activity and investment by outsiders.  In addition, Ireland's isolation from the European Community would have deterred inward investment by many other people in the first instance.</P>
    <P>On balance, therefore, the labour movement must conclude that our experience to date of our participation within the European Community has been positive and progressive notwithstanding the many difficulties we have experienced and in some cases mismanagement by ourselves at home.</P>
    <P>In the eighties European economic growth slowed down, inflation rose and unemployment increased dramatically not just in Ireland but throughout Europe.  This Euro-stagnation, in contrast to the performance of the United States and Japan, was attributed to the lack of a real common market because of the various protective non-tariff barriers which some member states had erected to protect their national industries.</P>
    <P>In 1985, Jacques Delors launched the single market project which aimed at removing these barriers and opening up all areas of economic activity to full European competition.  Various studies had concluded that such a move, if implemented, would result in a dynamic increase in European economic growth, but such growth in an enlarged market would not be without severe social and regional costs.  In order to balance these costs against the essential gains of the required economic growth two major intervention measures were agreed.</P>
    <P>A social charter was agreed by all except Mrs. Thatcher's Britain in order to protect workers and the unemployed. In addition, the Structural Funds were to be doubled so as to assist the poorer regions of the Community and to enable them to reduce the peripheral disadvantages which they had within the single market.  The European Trade Unions Confederation agreed to support the single market project because of the advantages which the social charter and the Structural Funds provided to European workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> The logic of a single market ultimately demanded the evolution of a single currency so as to reduce banking costs and currency costs and to eliminate fluctuations in currency rates, between member states.  An economic and monetary union was proposed and it was negotiated in considerable detail.  It proposes, among other things, the establishment of a single currency by 1997 supervised by a central European bank. A separate Cohesion Fund is to be established to help member states converge their budgetary policies in order to meet the requirements of a single currency.</P>
    <P>In the autumn of 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and with it the collapse of the geo-political stability with which Europe had lived for nearly half a century.  An urgent response was demanded and the European Political Union was negotiated hurriedly in advance of its natural time in conjunction with economic and monetary union.  In effect, the Common Market was soon to become a common union according to the central provisions of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Labour's commitment to Ireland's future in Europe is not at the expense of democratic values.  We have consistently criticised the present way in which decisions are made, the lack of accountability and the lack of democratic control. It is in this climate of uncertainty that the legitimate fears of Irish people have been expressed whether it is on the question of abortion or the question of national security, defence and neutrality.  These legitimate fears have been either ridiculed or disregarded by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Danish decision has now cast a doubt upon the whole Maastricht process. The Treaty as such no longer legally exists because it will not be ratified by Denmark following the outcome of their referendum.  All that we can vote for on 18 June is a commitment in principle to a closer European Union, based upon the contents of the now defunct Maastricht Treaty.  That is a fact and I invite the Minister and the Minister of State present, or any Minister who will participate in this debate tonight, to clarify their interpretation of that point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> Given that choice, a vote for a commitment in principle to a closer European Union based upon the contents of the Maastricht Treaty, Labour are committed to an ever closer political union because we believe on balance that it will best serve the interests of Irish people. Let me say to the Government Ministers present that the interests of the Irish people can only be ultimately served by a political society which is pluralist and democratic.  That society must obtain the loyalty and support of its citizens and its political institutions must earn their respect.  This Government's approach to European Union has insulted the intelligence of the Irish electorate and I fear has lost their respect.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June must be seen as a commitment to address urgently the deficiencies within the Maastricht proposals and to advance Ireland's interests.  The real work begins on 19 June because we will have to address those deficiencies in a major way.  A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June is essential if we are to play a constructive and effective role in that work.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this century the Irish people decided that they were Irish and not British.  What they have to decide on Thursday week is whether they are Irish or European. It is in that context that the debate should take place and in which the people should consider what they are being asked to do on 18 June.  In the meantime, from those two identities that we have acquired in this century &mdash; the idea of being independently Irish and of being a member of the European Community as well &mdash; we have witnessed two of the greatest conflagrations in human conflict since the beginning of the century. We have seen the European Community emanate from that experience, from the need to achieve political stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps because we are an island nation who may have retained an island mentality sufficiently long, we have not seen the significance of developments <Col N="1950" /> within the European Community since the Treaty of Rome was first introduced. Since the Treaty of Rome was signed by the original Six, we have seen an internal dynamic which has continued to the present day, a Community which has seen an enlargement now to 12 member states, a Single European Act which has brought institutional reform, and now the Treaty on European Union which seeks to move from the transition of a common market to the achievement and operations of a single market within Europe.</P>
    <P>In considering this overall issue I would say to the electorate they are not involved in a leap into the dark but rather in a natural progression which began in the late fifties in the centre of Europe, between the two great protagonists of Europe, France and Germany, the link, as it were, between the achievement of political independence here, the modernisation of our economy and the new political realities that ensued as a result of the establishment of that European Economic Community in the fifties, under the late Seán Lemass.  In the early sixties, around the time I was born, Seán Lemass had the vision to ensure that our future and destiny lay in Europe with our European partners.  One can compare that vision, that breadth of horizon, which has been the consistent vision of the party to which I belong &mdash; which was not always the vision of the party to which Deputy Quinn belongs &mdash; that identification by this party with full participation in Europe from the beginning when the opportunity first arose for this country under the political leadership of the late Seán Lemass with what I would regard as the narrow, false, nationalistic tendencies of those who seek to obtain a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on Thursday week.  That is a vision that would be alien to those who, like the late Seán Lemass, achieved political independence for this country, had a vision his successors must endeavour to render tangible for our people, a vision of European unity from the nineties and beyond.  What I would say to our electorate in relation to this referendum is that they can vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the sure knowledge that this is not something new <Col N="1951" /> or unique, but rather is a natural progression in which our people must pursue their goals in common with their counterparts in the European Community.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, it is a political decision, the legalities of which must be worked out as a result of the Danish referendum decision.  As the Taoiseach has made very clear, our essential national interests have not changed because of the Danish decision.  Our essential national interests remain the same.  Of course, it must be remembered that in the Danish rejection of the Treaty for everyone who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, because they did not want integration, there was another who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; because the terms of the Treaty did not go sufficiently far.</P>
    <P>It is important that people realise that, in taking their independent decision on this issue, they should not be fooled into listening to an argument which states &ldquo;be independent and follow the Danes blindly&rdquo;.  That is not only illogical but is mischievous and wrong.  For that reason that element of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign is something I reject with contempt.</P>
    <P>We must vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; positively, not because of shortcomings in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign being put forward.  As Minister for Labour I might make this point: as a country which has gained significantly from membership of the European Community, a country with the fastest growing population in Europe, a country which needs further programmes for economic and social development to enable us to compete effectively on an equal basis with the more advanced/developed economies of Europe, a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is imperative on Thursday week.  If we look at the demographic trends of our population structure over the past ten years, let alone beyond, we see the percentage of those of working age in our economy likely to increase from 68 per cent to over 71 per cent by 1996.  Those percentage figures alone would mean that we would have the highest participating rate of any European country.  Therefore, in terms of our population structure there will be <Col N="1952" /> greater demand for more jobs in our economy than in any other.  That is another reason we must vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum.  Our future economically lies in full, active participation in an integrated Europe from which trade barriers are removed, where there is freedom of movement of capital, services and labour in a manner freer than has obtained heretofore, a Europe in which those blockages to free trade are removed, enabling us increase our market share, our national wealth, sustain existing jobs and create new ones in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to make this point.  It is wrong of those &mdash; and there are some in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign as well &mdash; who blame Europe for our ills, who ask what has Europe done for us over the past 20 years.  Rather the question that should be posed is what have we not done for ourselves?  What more can we do for ourselves in the future with the assistance of our European partners who are interested in the development of our economy, interested in helping us financially, not solely out of an altruistic motive but rather because they perceive the economic and social benefits of a Community with a balanced growth throughout, so that the spending power of every economy within that Community has the ability to absorb the goods and services it will provide in the future?</P>
    <P>That is the reason we can negotiate for increased funding for our economy, not because we have a &ldquo;begging bowl&rdquo; mentality but precisely because the European ideal is to bring about what is known as convergence, cohesion, leading to a balanced growth within the Community so that we will all benefit from developments that will ensue from ratification of this Treaty on European Union.  Primarily, they will involve economic and monetary union, the establishment of a single currency and a single central bank. That is estimated to improve and increase economic growth throughout the Community by 15 per cent, the equivalent of four years growth, on average, within the Community.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, looking at it from our <Col N="1953" /> perspective, with the youngest population in Europe and a current unemployment rate in excess of 20 per cent, that if we are genuine about solving our unemployment problem, genuine in endeavouring to provide more jobs in our economy over the next ten years, it becomes clear that we will require unprecedented levels of growth in our economy even to provide for the increase in the labour market of 2.5 per cent or a net 25,000 jobs per annum.  That is the reality.  I would say to people who want to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; or are under the mistaken belief they can vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; and maintain the <i>status quo</i>&mdash; the false argument being advanced by some people inside and outside this House &mdash; we will reap a very bad harvest indeed should we send that signal to our European partners by voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; in this referendum.  We need to generate economic growth at EC level, through the cohesion mechanism, to render a balanced growth in the peripheral regions such as Ireland and other Objective I countries and we can attempt, in a political sense, to tackle the real social issues affecting this country, including, primarily, unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would ask those calling for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in this campaign what are they offering to people who are at present outside the workforce and in receipt of unemployment benefit?  What are they offering the 25,000 people who will come onto our jobs market annually over the next ten years?  What answers have they got that would provide the sort of economic growth required to maintain and increase those jobs on a long term, viable basis? It is quite clear that on Thursday week we must decide whether to indicate acceptance that our common destiny lies in the European Community, the richest trading bloc in the world which is receptive to the goods we produce and the services we provide.  If we are prepared to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; I suggest that a more appropriate analogy than being prepared to cut off your nose to spite your face is to cut your throat from ear to ear while smiling at the same time.  It makes no economic sense whatever to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; because there is no genuine alternative that provides <Col N="1954" /> a solution to the economic difficulties we will have to face in the next ten years.  I put it up to anyone who is serious about proposing a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to come forward with alternative economic answers, because I do not believe there are alternatives.</P>
    <P>Other issues have become entangled in this referendum.  There is a sincere intention, which is acceptable to most reasonable rational people, that the issues that have been raised in an institution of the State, namely the Supreme Court will be dealt with later in the autumn.  European Union has nothing to do with that issue.  European Union is about the co-ordination of economic policies and achieving economic growth in the Community and it provides a mechaism through the Cohesion Fund and increased allocations from the Structural Funds to enable underdeveloped regions to compete on a level playing pitch in the Single Market.  European Union is a natural progression and development of our European Community membership, from which we have benefited greatly.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the growth in unemployment is not that we have been unable to achieve economic growth but that our economic growth, which is twice the EC average, has not resulted in the level of job creation that we would expect from such growth.  We must examine this in terms of the working of our economy. One of the reasons for the growth of unemployment is that we have one of the fastest growing young populations, growing at a rate faster than we can provide them with jobs.  We have to look to internal and external stimuli to meet the demand for an increasing number of jobs. We need to look to Europe for increased funding from the Structural and Cohesion Funds and capital transfers to provide for social and economic development programmes.  We also have to look at the labour market both at home and in the European Community.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on this occasion who will address that problem?  I suggest nobody.</P>
    <P>Those who are shouting for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote should look at the situation because many are of the generation who have <Col N="1955" /> benefited most from EC membership. Unfortunately we have mortgaged our future and we will have to pay back for a long time to come for the standard of living which people have achieved over the past 20 to 30 years, most of it during our membership of the European Community.</P>

      <P>If they take a narrow view of the Treaty are they entitled to mortgage the future potential of another generation of Irish men and women who want to make their full contribution in the European Community?  Surely we should look at the potential contribution that the next generation of Irish men and women can make to their country in the context of a developing European Union.  Surely people should be allowed to reach their potential in an integrated European market.  Surely we should be given the opportunity to prove ourselves in the far more difficult economic circumstances that face us now than prevailed in 1972. It is true that we have revelled in our mediocrity and we have not maximised the potential benefits of our EC membership. That is not Europe's fault. Surely it is time we stood up on our own two feet and acknowledged we have made mistakes and have not achieved our potential.  There is nothing wrong with saying that, but we must continue to learn from our mistakes, as we have been doing &mdash; and the Commission acknowledges that we have learned from our mistakes &mdash; by now making proper use of the moneys from the first tranche of the Structural Funds since the Single European Market. For the sake of those who have yet to come on to the labour market and earn a living in this economy for the next ten to 20 years, we must not cut off our economic lifeline because people are confusing the issues.  Surely they should accept in a representative parliamentary democracy the stated sincere intention of the Government to deal with those issues in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> People must face up to the issues.  I wish to reiterate a simple point that I made at the outset.  We made a decision at the beginning of this century that we were Irish and not British but we have to make a decision at the end of the century that we are not only Irish but European as well.  This Treaty gives us European citizenship and we will join with those in a part of Europe who have suffered far greater than we ever did despite the hardships we had to face during the war but who know the importance of political stability.  In the East we can see the difficulties that have arisen as a result of the collapse of a failed system once supported by Members of this House.  People must realise that we have far more in common than what separates us from our European partners.  We should not succumb to the cowardly philosophy that we will be overwhelmed by a European influence when we have so much to temper the philosophy that will be part and parcel of the development of the European Community.</P>
    <P>We must realise that the ratification of this Treaty is a test of our political maturity as a people.  Despite the distortions, the semi-truths and the cant that are doing the rounds, I am a great believer in the innate common sense of Irish people, and I look forward to their endorsement of the position of the overwhelming majority of the Members of this House who represent them.  I am confident that they will endorse European Union so that not only this Government but successive Governments in the future will have the opportunity to contribute to Europe.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, made a very interesting speech.  I think it was more enlightening and useful than the Taoiseach's speech.  We are faced with a choice.  We have the choice of accepting or rejecting another amendment to the Treaty of Rome as amended by the Single European Act.  We are not being asked to choose between the continuation of the European Community and the end of the European Community but whether <Col N="1957" /> we want this kind of Europe or a better kind of Europe that may be negotiable if we say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this Treaty.  The Danish people clearly felt that, despite the powerful club of businessmen, politicians and bankers, they wanted a different kind of Europe.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the kind of Europe that everybody in Denmark wants is achievable or whether it is possible, in a blunt &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the question in the referendum, to express the views of the Irish people on European Union.</P>
      <P>Despite his eloquence, Deputy Cowen, does us a disservice to present the case as do or die, as between Europe and against Europe, the continuation of Europe or the end of Europe.</P>
      <P>Neither I nor anyone else in Democratic Left has ever suggested that things will remain as they were if a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote is achieved on 18 June.  Clearly, they will not remain the same.  The grand design which the leaders of the 12 members states constructed above the heads of the people of Europe will have to be revised if there is a further &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in one of the member states.  What we are seeing here is a failure of democracy, the failure of the politicians who lead this country to communicate to people what they were designing over the past three years in relation to Europe.  It is pointless for any Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats Deputy to rail against the ignorance of the Irish people in not fully understanding this great design or fully appreciating what is good for them when they have been kept in the dark for so long about what precisely was being designed, why and how it was being designed, and, specifically, the role they would play in this great design.  The stark fact about Maastricht Treaty is that the role of the people of Europe is being diminished relative to the powers which have been transferred from national parliaments to the institutions of the Community.  The European Parliament, despite having got additional blocking functions, has extremely little extended power in relation to, for example, the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have time in this debate to use <Col N="1958" /> all the references I would like to try to bring the debate down a decibel or two so that the issue can be debated with a degree of common sense.  Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who are calling for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote enclosed with their documentation calling for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote a letter addressed to me which stated:</P>
    <P>Dear Proinsias,</P>
    <P>I enclose for your information a copy of the position adopted by our Executive Council on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.  We are recommending to our members and their families that they vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum on 18 June.</P>
    <P>The first point about that letter is that it was an executive decision to recommend a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and not a decision of the members of the trade unions of the State. They went on to make the interesting points: that they have serious concerns in three areas: (1) there is too much emphasis on monetary union and not enough on economic union; (2) job creation and unemployment should be put back at the top of the agenda in Europe, and (3) there is a need for greater democratic accountability, particularly in the case of the proposed new European Central Bank.  Those are genuine concerns, which have been weighed up, about the benefits they see in the Maastricht Treaty.  I am one of those calling for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote who has never denied that there are benefits in relation to Maastricht. However, we have made our choice because we believe the benefits are far outweighed by the disbenefits in a range of areas.</P>
    <P>The factors which have marked this debate in Ireland &mdash; this has been echoed in other parts of Europe since the Danish vote &mdash; are the arrogance of those who have called for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and the contempt with which people have been treated.  People were told this was something they must vote for because it was good for them.  It is like telling a child that the castor oil they are being given will do them good; they do not understand why they have to take it and it <Col N="1959" /> tastes terrible but they are told that it will do them good at the end of the day. Scientific evidence now shows that the castor oil we were given as children had little to do with one's growth and so on.</P>
    <P>Treating people with the contempt that their betters know better has raised the hackles of a large number of people in Ireland.  It raised the hackles of people in Denmark to such an extent that despite the huge phalanx of parties from centre to right, businessmen, trade unions and social democratic parties &mdash; much the same as the line up here &mdash; 51 per cent, over two million people, said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Maastricht Treaty for a variety of reasons.  The main reason for this &mdash; over the weekend I read a considerable amount trying to find out precisely why the people of Denmark voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash; is precisely because they were being treated with contempt; they were told what was good for them but they were not brought into the dialogue.  That was in a country where the dialogue in relation to Europe far outstrips the dialogue anywhere else in Europe and, certainly, far outstrips the dialogue here.</P>
    <P>We are in the extraordinary position where we do not have a foreign affairs committee.  We have a Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities who never examine any of the material which the European Community produces until it has virtually finalised its way through the various institutions. We have a proposal for a foreign affairs committee, the terms of reference of which will exclude the committee from examining the negotiating position of an Irish Government in the European Community. That is a further restriction on the democratic process here.</P>
    <P>Until such time as those people &mdash; I am one of them &mdash; who support a European Union recognise that the people of this country have a right to a say and have a right to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; in regard to the type of Europe they want then, we are building up a store of trouble for ourselves which will explode in time to come.  If at the end of this year 11 or 12 member states ratify the Treaty, no <Col N="1960" /> matter how well cobbled together it is, trouble will build up if we do not set about ensuring that there is genuine democratic dialogue between the people and those who claim to lead them in the direction we take in Europe.  If this is not done people will be alienated from the European Community and will not participate in it.  As I said, the bottom line is a question of democracy.  We want a democratic Europe or we will not have a European Community.  We may well have a Single Market but, as the Taoiseach said a Single Market is a Single Market and no more.  I appeal to those who are urging a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to lower the decibels and stop trying to frighten Irish people into voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Rather they should argue with them cogently, sensibly and democratically.</P>
    <P>The old political cliché says that a week is a long time in politics.  For those who have given unqualified support to the Maastricht Treaty, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats, the last week must have seemed like an eternity as, first, the courageous Danish voters rendered the Treaty effectively null and void and second, they saw the support they had expected for the Maastricht Treaty here disappear like snow off a ditch in spring sunshine.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that the Taoiseach in his speech said the Treaty would still have full political validity.  What about the legal validity of the Treaty?  I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to tell us the legal standing of the Treaty.  The Taoiseach said that we are legally obliged to ratify the Treaty.  On what basis does he claim that we are legally obliged to ratify a Treaty which has already been struck down by one country when it is clear from the Treaty that all 12 member states must ratify it for it to be legally valid?  I am asking for straight answers to these questions and not bluff or bluster because we deserve straight and honest answers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made a number of other points in his speech.  He said that the Community reaction was not an attempt to override small nations.  Yet he goes on to quote the London <i>Times</i> which states that unless this Treaty is <Col N="1961" /> ratified the Benelux countries and France and Germany will go ahead with monetary union on their own.  Which is it &mdash; the smaller countries are not going to be overridden, the reaction in relation to Denmark was not an anti-democratic impulse, Denmark will be accommodated or France, Germany and the Benelux countries will go ahead on their own?  We need to know which is true. Are we going to be treated as second class parts of Europe?</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Danish referendum is probably the most significant event in the history of the European Community over the past two decades. For the first time, a European people have had the courage to stand up to the Eurocrats, to challenge the consensus and say &ldquo;No, we do not agree with your proposals, we insist on having our voice heard&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Establishment reaction to the outcome of the Danish referendum has contributed greatly to the public concerns about the Maastricht agreement in this country and has been a significant factor in the substantial increase in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote which all parties have been finding on the doorsteps in the past week.  The reaction of the European Commission and of most other countries, including, to our eternal shame, our own country, has been characterised by threats and bullying.  What right have the Danish people to challenge the grand design for Europe has been the arrogant reaction of the Eurocrats.  The response of the larger countries in particular has raised disturbing echoes of their imperial past. Europe is supposed to be a community of equal partners, yet Denmark has been treated like some troublesome colony.</P>
    <P>When the initial panic died down, following the Danish result, the clear strategy worked out by the Commission and the other Governments was to ignore the fact that the Danish people had effectively rendered the Treaty signed at Maastricht null and void and they continued on as if nothing had happened. There was no attempt to address the legitimate grievances of Denmark; the plan instead is clearly to go through a phoney <Col N="1962" /> form of ratification here and in the other member states and then go back to Denmark with a Lloyd George type ultimatum of &ldquo;ratify or else&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary that within an hour of the four Leaders of what are now described as the main parties in this House, declaring that the people should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, two of them, Deputy Spring and Deputy Bruton, stood up in this House at Question Time to question the legal validity of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, of what precisely we are voting for.  Should they not have sorted that out before they agreed to sign this call on the Irish people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;?  It seems a failure in political leadership.</P>
    <P>I am shocked that our Government have been such a willing participant in the ugly approach to Denmark.  Surely the correct response of Ireland as another small State should have been to show solidarity with Denmark and to try to work out a sympathetic response to the issues and concerns which were behind the Danish vote.  Instead, the response of our Government has been servile and fawning, designed to ingratiate themselves further with the big powers in Europe.</P>
    <P>It was not just the Danish vote itself which caused so many people here to rethink their position on Maastricht, but the Brussels reaction to it.  It has focused attention on the democratic question within the Community.  If the democratic wishes of the Danish people are to be treated with such contempt, what hope can we have that the powers transferred under the Maastricht agreement from Ireland to Brussels, and which will not be subject to any element of democratic accountability, will be used fairly and that our voice will be listened to on how they are used?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us repeatedly that there will be a referendum in 1996 to consult the Irish people on proposals for a Community defence arrangement. Suppose we ratify the Maastricht Treaty but decide in 1996 that we do not want to be part of the European defence arrangement, are we likely to face the same sort of threats to which Denmark is <Col N="1963" /> now being subjected?  Will the economic gun be put to our heads?  Will we be threatened with virtual expulsion, with being left behind?</P>
    <P>If the member states ignore the outcome of the Danish referendum and go ahead with the Maastricht Treaty without Denmark then it will be a fundamental departure from the ideals on which the Community has operated, and will raise very serious questions about the relationship within the EC between the large states and the smaller states like Ireland and Denmark.  From its very origins, from the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the basic principle of the Community was that it could only move on to its next stage of development when all member states were happy with the proposals. This applied equally to all members states, big and small, and was seen as a vital safeguard for the interests of the smaller states.  If this principle is now to be abandoned, as the response to the Danish vote would seem to suggest, then the implications for Ireland and the other smaller states are enormous.</P>
    <P>We have made the point before and we make it again.  Denmark is being treated in this way only because it is a small country.  France is to hold a referendum in the autumn.  Is anyone really suggesting if France were to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; that the reaction of the Commission and the Council of Ministers would be to continue with ratification as if nothing happened? Would the Taoiseach's response be that &ldquo;this is a problem for France, and not for the Community&rdquo;?  Would EC diplomats be saying that France would now &ldquo;be left in the slow lane&rdquo;, while the others moved on to the &ldquo;EC fast track&rdquo;? Would the President of the Council of Ministers be stating resolutely that &ldquo;there can be no renegotiation of the Treaty to satisfy any demands made by France&rdquo;? Is there nobody with any ounce of honesty on the pro-Maastricht side who is prepared to admit that this would not happen, and that the response would be to pull out all the stops to find a solution to the French difficulties?  If this is a response that a French &ldquo;No&rdquo; would provoke, <Col N="1964" /> why should it not happen when Denmark has voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, or if Ireland votes &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 18 June?</P>
    <P>I do not have half enough time to deal with the issues that have been raised in this debate but I will seek to deal with one or two other points as briefly as possible. The Taoiseach has referred to the defence element of Maastricht and has said that defence is not on the agenda. He shifted his position somewhat in this regard last week by announcing that it is intended to apply for permanent observer status of the Western European Union.  As I have repeatedly stated, the Western European Union are a body who operate outside the European Community, a body whose strategy is based on nuclear deterrents.  They are a body which are regarded as the European pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.</P>
    <P>For the Taoiseach or anybody else to pretend to the people of this country that Maastricht does not have defence implications is misleading and dishonest. I do not argue, as others have argued, that Maastricht automatically means that conscription will be introduced into this country.  There is no way that claim can be justified.  Such a claim simply throws a red herring across the real debate about what kind of defence the European Community should be involved in, what kind of disarmament policy the European Community should have and what kind of assistance the European Community should give to the Third World.  That is what we should concentrate on instead of trying to build up the European Community as a new super-power, which is the clear intention of Maastricht in that it states that it is establishing an international identity in order to defend the values and the interests of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by stating that Maastricht does not refer to the defence of the territory of Europe, it refers to defence of the interests and values of Europe.  I cannot see how nuclear weapons can be used to defend those values or why it is necessary to be associated with NATO in order to defend those values.  We have <Col N="1965" /> heard much from the Taoiseach about Cold War thinking and Cold War relics &mdash; NATO and the Western European Union are precisely that.  Cold War relics should now be abandoned and the European Community should have nothing to do with them.  We should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in order to demonstrate that we want a peaceful Europe.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa, at the beginning of his speech, described the speech of the preceding speaker, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, as interesting and useful.  I would make the same comment on Deputy De Rossa's speech, but I would add that it was illuminating. I noticed the way in which the Deputy distanced himself from some of the people in his own camp, on the same side of the argument.  I particularly welcome the remarks in relation to those who have raised the bogey of conscription. I thank the Deputy for denouncing those people and for effectively distancing himself from them. These are some of the people who have been describing as scaremongering some of the things that have been said on this side of the House.  Let us hope that Deputy De Rossa's remarks represent the end of those who have talked about conscription. I also welcome the Deputy's remarks about his attitude to Europe. The Deputy has changed, but we have all changed throughout the years.  I am glad that the Deputy is now in favour of a united Europe and is a strong advocate of the European Community as it stands and that he looks to the future, to Europe performing a more useful role.  I am sorry that that is not the case in relation to many of the others who are in his camp on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look at the television and see those people talking about the wonderful arrangements currently in the European Community which we should not disrupt <Col N="1966" /> with this Maastricht Treaty.  Then, I remind myself of the role and attitude of those people in the past.  These are precisely the same people who opposed our entry in Europe in the first instance. They are the same old tired faces that we saw coming out against the SEA.  There is a reason for this sham conversion of many of them and it is that they know they are being challenged for an alternative to the European Union Act, and they have no alternative.  They are now supporters of the European Community as it stands, and that underlines that lack of an alternative, although they tell us to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate we have heard a great deal about economics and about the legal position, but man does not live by bread alone.  Among those of us who support the Treaty there is an idealism in relation to Europe that must be communicated particularly to the young people who want some idealism to aspire to, who want to identify with idealism, who really feel motivated by the concept of a united Europe and the concept of a new Ireland and a new Europe &mdash; people like ourselves who are proud to be Irish in Europe.</P>
    <P>Among the highest of priorities is the idealism about international peace and peace in our own country.  The world today is a dangerous place.  Maybe in a few years time, if not already, some of us will be yearning for the stability we had in the cold war.  We had stability but threats.  The world today is even more dangerous.  I am reminded of a quotation by Winston Churchill in relation to my part of this country in the North.  At the end of the First World War Churchill referred to the deluge, the flood all over Europe where empires had fallen and where new countries had come into existence and where the whole political map of Europe had changed, when he said, &ldquo;all changed, changed utterly, except for the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone which appeared above the deluge&rdquo;.  I cannot help thinking that those words of Churchill are probably as appropriate to the circumstances of Europe today as they were to the circumstances <Col N="1967" /> of Europe and my former constituency in Fermanagh and Tyrone 70 years ago.</P>
    <P>When I studied history 30 or 40 years go there were names of certain places that I had great difficulty in spelling, in remembering and in pronouncing, places like Nagorno Karabakh, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Sarajevo where it all began in the Great War in 1914.  These are the names we are hearing today.  This is what modern reality is.  This is the part of the world the threat to peace is coming from today.  No matter what might be said about the European Community, one thing is clear, that the European Community has been a factor for stability and peace in this world.  Why today, of all days do we want to change it?  The world is already a dangerous place.  We have a brooding sleeping giant so far unaffected, the 1 billion people in China apparently unaffected by what is happening all around them.  But, ideas know no bounds and the idea of nationalism, as I too well know, knowns no bounds. The Lord only knows what is happening in China and what we will have to cope with in the next few years.  Why now do some people propose a course of action which at the very least will interrupt, if not stop, progress towards a united Europe, the Continent which has done so much for peace?</P>
    <P>We may argue the exact contribution that Europe has made.  Someone like Maggie Thatcher may say that the reason why we have had peace in Europe this past 40 years has more to do with NATO than the European Community.  No matter how one looks at it, it is a fact that the Franco-German <i>entente</i> in the EC has been central to the formation and the building of the European Community. We ought to bear that in mind and we ought to be seriously concerned about any movement which would in the slightest take away from Europe as that factor for peace in the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton in the Dáil last Wednesday said that the European Single Market, the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund give the two parts of Ireland a unique chance to build a <Col N="1968" /> structure of peace on this island that is based on more trade between us, not on the supremacy of one tradition over the other and that this was perhaps the most cogent of all arguments for Irish people to vote in favour of Maastricht.  With my experience and background I could not agree more.  What has been lacking so far in this debate is reference to Northern Ireland and the future of peace in relation to Northern Ireland.  People have said to me on occasions, particularly after major atrocities, that the best solution to the problem of Northern Ireland would be to throw it into the middle of the Atlantic and sink it without trace.  Now another Irish solution to an Irish problem is being proposed in the context of the Maastricht Treaty, it is to throw the Twenty-six Counties out into the middle of the Atlantic and sink it.  Politically, economically, socially and psychologically that would be the effect of voting against the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of the Maastricht decision for the future relationship North and South on this island and for political developments within Northern Ireland.  I know of no one who sincerely believes in a peaceful solution to the Northern Ireland problem whose hopes are not based on the opportunities for political progress inherent in both parts of the island being in the European Community.  Any progress made so far owes a lot to that fact and the potential is even greater.  Whatever argument there may be over the effects of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, one thing is clear: if we vote against the Treaty on European Union and the British ratify it, as they have already done in their parliament, then Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will be in different categories of membership of the Union, with all that implies.  Politically and economically that would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>Ironically, my first speech, 30 years ago, was made to a Fine Gael meeting.  I proposed a motion, which was not too popular, to the effect that the South had a major responsibility for Partition.  That was not acceptable to quite a few people at that time.  I made the point that it was <Col N="1969" /> the South, not Britain, not the Unionists, who first set up customs posts along the Border.  That is a matter of history. Would it not be ironic if history were to repeat itself 70 years later by a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on Maastricht?  If Britain goes in and we stay out, whatever the level of difference, there will be a difference.  That difference will represent a reversal of the trend of history as far as relationships on this island are concerned and it will in my opinion put back still further the possibility of a peaceful solution to the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    <P>I remember a saying of the ancients to the effect that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.  I do not want to exaggerate the position but those who vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; or who consider voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum ought to bear that reservation in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Currie for allowing me to share his time.  The debate so far on the Maastricht Treaty has treated the electorate with nothing short of contempt.  There are two essential elements to growing mushrooms.  One is to keep them in the dark and the other, because of the sensibilities of the listening public, I do not intend to announce here. The Government's programme and their publicity with regard to the Maastricht Treaty has been almost parallel to the programme for growing mushrooms.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty was signed in February last but this is the first opportunity this House has had to debate the substantial issues involved.  It is only because of the uncertainties foisted on the EC by the Danish decision that we are having any debate in this House.  We express surprise at the lack of interest and the possible levels of support for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Is that any wonder, in light of the manner in which we have conducted our affairs in this context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in the interests of upholding democracy and respect for the institutions of the State should have funded both sides of the argument in regard to the Treaty.  This would have exposed the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign and forced them to address the real and substantial <Col N="1970" /> issues involved.  Ultimately it would have ensured that an informed electorate would reach the correct decision &mdash; namely a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on polling day.  I suspect that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign may actually be grateful that they have not been funded because this has enabled them to trade on innuendo and scare-mongering, avoiding the real and substantial issues.</P>

      <P>The spurious arguments relating to neutrality and conscription were raised when we joined the EC and when we signed the Single European Act. They are as predictable as they are reactionary. They were wrong then and the people who suggest that ratifying the European Union Treaty will result in the end of our neutrality and the conscription of Irish people into a European army are wrong now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the brief time available I want absolutely to distance myself from the Government's tactics in their efforts to ensure the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. I want to outline why Fine Gael believe the electorate should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The essential vision of Europe from the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats perspective is that of a feeding trough. The attitude is to get your snout in and get as much as possible.  It is the begging bowl approach, with no vision and no idealism.  It is surely the best possible way to ensure the non-ratification of the Treaty.  We in Fine Gael believe that the real issues in the Treaty should be put before the people in a fair and honest way.  We believe that the electorate should make a calm appraisal of those proposals and make an informed decision to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  We want the electorate to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because we share the vision of a united, peaceful Europe which offers maximum economic opportunity to its citizens.  We want the Irish people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the basis of calm assessment of their best interests, not on the basis of fear or greed induced by frantic exaggerations <Col N="1971" /> from quarters who do not share the broader vision of Europe.</P>
    <P>We believe a single currency will be a distinct advantage to a trading nation like ours and will offer us additional economic and employment opportunities.  We believe a politically more united Europe will be an effective player on the world political stage, ensuring a more coordinated and efficient response to world crises which was so sadly lacking from the Community in the context of the Gulf War.  We believe that the political commitment to a more economically cohesive Europe as contained in the Cohesion Fund will have obvious benefits to a peripheral region like Ireland.  For all these reasons we believe it would be foolish not to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 18 June.</P>

      <P>At this stage of the national debate I have lost count of the multitude of spurious, inaccurate and misleading arguments put forward by the vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt the concerns of many who advance that argument.  However, when I hear some opponents putting forward the case that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to Maastricht will lead to social welfare cutbacks, my faith in their bona fides is totally undermined.</P>
      <P>I do not need to remind the House of the strain that our unemployment level is placing on the Exchequer finances.  The published Estimate of the Department of Social Welfare for 1992 discloses that we will spend a gross £3,360 million, of which £946 million will go to the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One does not have to be either a mathematical or financial genius to comprehend that rising unemployment is the major constraining factor in expanding and improving our welfare services.  In that context, are people really serious in advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote for the Treaty?  Many of our foreign industries are located here solely due to our Community membership.  Furthermore, our chances of attracting new industry here are dependent on continuing <Col N="1972" /> as first division members of the Community.  As Minister for Social Welfare, I dare not contemplate the thought of the Irish people rejecting the Treaty on 18 June.  Such a scenario will mean certain increasing unemployment in the immediate short to medium term &mdash; the longer term would be even more disastrous.</P>
    <P>Some people have expressed concern that the disciplines imposed by the move towards economic and monetary union will necessarily require reductions in social welfare expenditure.  This is one of the most absurd and nonsensical points put forward by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote lobby.  The real facts are, however, that the benefits which will flow from European Monetary Union will, by strengthening the economy, put us in a much stronger position to develop our welfare services in the future in a more planned and structured way and in line with our capacity to meet the costs.</P>
    <P>Participation in an integrated Europe will not reduce the need for effective management and for the adoption of the correct policies at national level.  By doing so we stand to make major advances and to avail fully of the benefits of a more integrated Europe.</P>
    <P>Control of the national debt and discipline in the public finances will be very important in the context of the new situation and the Treaty contains specific targets which we will be committed to.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering, however, that the need for discipline is there in any event, whether we are participating in the move towards economic and monetary union or not.  We have to get our public finances and our level of debt under effective and lasting control.  While we have undertaken in the context of the Maastricht Treaty to operate within certain specific parameters and timescales, we should not think that staying out would make life easier for us on that front. Difficult decisions will be necessary whether we opt to stay in or instead try to go it alone.  It is much more in our interests to deal with our problems within the framework of an international agreement which contains specific measures <Col N="1973" /> and commitments to assist us and where we will have a direct voice in the ongoing development of the Community.</P>
    <P>The idea which some people have put about that the Maastricht Treaty will require cuts in social welfare services is a complete distortion.  It is a lie.  The Maastricht Treaty is good for social welfare recipients.  The development of the Community up to now has been to the good of social welfare recipients and the further developments which are to take place under the Treaty can only be of benefit to them as well.</P>
    <P>The improvements which we will derive from being part of the process of achieving economic and monetary union will strengthen our economy and, therefore, our capacity to fund the developments in social welfare to which we are committed.  By getting our economy in order and resolving our underlying problems in relation to the public finances we will create the conditions for a firm and soundly-based development of the social welfare support systems.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty is of vital importance to Ireland.  It is the latest step in the achievement of a more integrated Europe.  Ireland is participating in that process.  We have always been very clear that, politically, economically and socially the best way forward for Europe is through closer integration of the countries of the Community.</P>
    <P>As a small open economy we have already derived great benefits from our membership of the Community.  Despite the problems which we have, our economy is now in a much stronger position than it would otherwise have been.  With the development of the Single Market we have full and free access to a market of 340 million people.  Community countries take over 75 per cent of our exports.  Irish agriculture derives major benefits from the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Structural Funds have brought about major investments in infrastructure and industry.</P>
    <P>The benefits from membership of the Community are, of course, not automatic. If our membership has proved one thing, however, it is that it is far better to <Col N="1974" /> be in at the negotiating table and taking a full part in the development of the Community.  Only in this way can we exert the necessary influence, not only to avoid the possible disadvantages for a country like ours which would otherwise arise from the development of a Single European Market, but to have our agenda specifically recognised and taken on board in the context of these developments. Our continued active participation in the development of the Community is, I am convinced, vital if we are to be able to tackle the major issues which face us as a country.</P>
    <P>We have also, I feel, become more realistic about what can be achieved. There is no guaranteed pot of gold at the end of the Community rainbow.  We may have felt at an earlier stage that it would be only a matter of time before standards of living here would be on a par with standards throughout the Community.  It is not as easy as that.  All member states have suffered the effects of recession.  It is my firm belief, however, that for all countries, particularly Ireland, the best prospect for improved living standards in the future is in the context of active partnership in the further development of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty will undoubtedly make Europe a wealthier place. Economic and monetary union will lead to an increased level of economic activity in the Community.  As an open economy relying very heavily on international trade we should be in a position to benefit significantly from this growth.</P>
    <P>Central to the objectives of the Treaty are the achievement of an environment of low inflation, steady growth, a high level of employment, convergence of economic performance and economic and social cohesion.  Specific targets are set down to achieve these in stages.  These will impose certain disciplines on us as a country in the short term.  But the achievement of these targets will put the economy on a much stronger footing.</P>
    <P>The challenge will be to see how continued economic development and prosperity can be achieved through the functioning of the Single Market while at <Col N="1975" /> the same time ensuring that economic and social cohesion is maintained.  The commitments built into the Treaty give us an excellent basis on which to achieve progress and to ensure that we participate in and benefit fully from the development of the Community.</P>
    <P>As well as the economic benefits which we have obtained from our membership of the Community, it has also been responsible for significant developments in the area of social protection which have been to the benefit of workers here.  As far as social security is concerned EC initiatives in the early stages mainly involved measures to facilitate freedom of movement of workers, which was one of the basic pillars of the Community.</P>
    <P>As a result of our EC membership there is now a wide range of protection for migrant workers in the social security field, including transfer of pensions and other welfare benefits.  In the future this protection will be extended to other categories of people and as a country with large migration we will be very interested to be involved in such developments.</P>
    <P>I might also refer in this connection to the provisions for equality of treatment for men and women.  While recognising the difficulties which have arisen because of the delay in implementing the equal treatment directive in the area of social security, we have to recognise that the Community has been at the forefront of developments in relation to equality of treatment and non-discrimination and overall this has been greatly to the benefit of Irish women.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the things that membership of the European Community means for women.  The Community leads the way, through its modern legal framework and its supporting efforts, in raising awareness of equal opportunity and equal treatment in daily thinking at every level, in all spheres.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the Community has been the driving force behind the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977. The EC programmes on equal opportunities covering the years up to 1990 <Col N="1976" /> focused attention on a number of areas of specific relevance to women.  These include the need to shape policies to tackle the effect of new technologies on womens employment; womens unequal access to vocational training; the impact of the achievement of the Single Market on the services sector where female employment is predominant; and the growth of temporary and atypical work. EC social policy has also been a driving force, as I mentioned, behind the implementation of equal treatment for women in social welfare.</P>
    <P>Initiatives such as those I have outlined have served to increase the participation of women in the Irish labour force.  Since our accession to the Community the level of womens participation in training has increased every year.  In 1971 only 5 per cent of trainees in Ireland were women. By 1991 women represented 42 per cent of all those completing training.</P>
    <P>Irish women have also benefited from a wide range of interventions sponsored by the European Commission including the Commission-sponsored networks and programmes.  These include vocational training for women, local employment initiatives, childcare, positive action strategies, the elimination of sexism in our schools, the portrayal of the image of women in the media.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead, the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty will enable Ireland to participate fully in the third medium-term Community Action Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 1991 to 1995.  This will address issues such as equal pay for work of equal value and the concept of indirect discrimination and the integration of women into the labour market; improving the status of women in society through awareness-raising initiatives and promoting the participation of women in the decision-making process in economic and social life.  We are not talking, therefore, just about an economic Europe but about a social Europe as well.  As Minister for Social Welfare I will be seeking to ensure that the benefits of Community membership reach people on social welfare and other people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> The Treaty also contains a special Protocol which includes an agreement by eleven member states &mdash; all except the United Kingdom &mdash; to adopt specific measures in the social policy field by continuing along the path laid down in the Fundamental Charter of Social Rights which was adopted by eleven of the member states in December 1989.</P>
    <P>The Social Charter, as it is called, sets out a number of principles which will guide Community social policy in a number of areas, including rights in relation to freedom of movement of workers within the Community, improved living and working conditions for workers, the right to adequate social protection, an adequate level of social security benefits for workers and a guarantee of resources for people outside the labour market.</P>
    <P>The inclusion in the agreement annexed to the Treaty of the commitment of the eleven member states to implement the Social Charter puts social policy clearly within a Community framework and guarantees its place within the Single Market.  In the context of developments in social policy at national level in the future it will be necessary to take more and more account of developments throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The convergence of social security policies within Europe is an objective of the Social Charter to which we have given our support.  All of our countries are faced with common problems in the social security field, namely, ageing of the population, rising unemployment levels, changes in family structures and new patterns of employment.</P>
    <P>We all need to look to the future and ensure that we have systems which meet the needs of our people for security in old age, widowhood, sickness, unemployment and so on, which is viable from a financial point of view and which does not inhibit, but rather encourages people towards greater independence and self-reliance where this is possible.  It is for member states to determine the priorities in terms of their developments of their systems but the monitoring of progress by the Commission and the process of <Col N="1978" /> consultation will facilitate member states in developing more efficient and better targeted systems.</P>
    <P>There is no point in pretending that the process of social convergence will be easy.  There are costs involved and there is no provision for transfer of resources at Community level.  There is a challenge for us here.  I am already acutely aware of the financial problems which face me as Minister for Social Welfare in meeting the growing costs of social protection even without any movement towards higher levels of protection.  The costs of unemployment are obviously a major element of this increasing cost and it may well be that in future the financing of unusually high levels of unemployment in any member state should be seen as a Community problem needing Community support even on a limited scale.</P>
    <P>I have made clear the Government's commitment to protect the position of people who depend on social welfare, and particularly those at lower income levels.  We have made commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to improve the basic rates of payments.  It is clear to me, however, that there is a need to look at how we are going to pay for the system in the longer term.  We have a plethora of schemes and services, all introduced at different times to meet particular needs, many of them involving major and growing financial commitments and many of them, in my view, overlapping with each other.  It is difficult for people to know what their entitlements are in many cases because of the sheer complexity of the system.</P>
    <P>My objective is to simplify and streamline the system.  I believe we can achieve a more logical and sensible system, with clear objectives and simpler conditions of entitlement, and one which will be sustainable in the long term.  If we do not set our minds to doing this in a planned way, we run the risk of not being able to sustain the supports which are there.  I believe that the development of common agendas and common approaches in a Community context can help us in developing our social welfare system in an effective way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Leaders of the four principal parties in this House saw fit today to issue the statement that they did.  It was time we showed clearly that there is in fact a very wide consensus in the political world here about the issues that arise in the context of this Treaty and that it is a matter of conviction for those four parties anyway that they take the view that they do.</P>
      <P>I hope I will be forgiven for introducing a slightly discordant note into this debate. I am delighted that the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, saw fit to participate in this morning's exercise and put an end to the ambiguity that has characterised the Labour Party's position on these issues for quite some time, an ambiguity which led to Deputy Spring acquiring the nickname on this side of the House of the &ldquo;shilling each way man&rdquo; because he has faced in both directions on these issues for quite a long time.  I hope he has finally come down off the fence and decided definitively which way he is facing.  We had this ambiguity before in relation to the proposed amendment to this mischievous nonsensical Protocol that we have in this Treaty where Deputy Spring was quick to leap in to agree with the Government and then saw fit a little while afterwards to see the light and accept the advice coming from my party on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we should have been having debates on these issues throughout 1991 as the Intergovernmental Conferences were taking place.  We did not have them because the Government seemed to give in to this unnecessary coyness we see all the time up in Iveagh House whereby we are not supposed to discuss foreign affairs issues because they are so sensitive, especially when negotiations are going on that are of more than passing interest to Members of this House and to the general public.  The Government's silly refusal to debate these issues last year has given ammunition to the people who oppose this Treaty for totally spurious reasons and allowed them to claim, as some of them do, that in some way information is being withheld.  Spurious claims have been <Col N="1980" /> made about issues to which the Government are alleged to have objected and which have still found their way into the Maastricht Treaty and so on and so forth. Most of that is pure invention, but it is being made possible for people to use that to muddy the waters and confuse the issues in this debate because the Government refused to discuss any of these issues at the time they were being examined in the Intergovernmental Conferences.</P>
    <P>I have no patience with people inside this House, or indeed outside it, who claim that it is difficult to find out what is in the Treaty, what went on during the course of the discussions, and why various options have been taken in the Treaty.  In fact, it was not difficult for any Member of this House to find out what was going on.  It is well known that the decision-making process in the European Community is probably one of the most open.  It is certainly much more open than Government discussions in any member state.  The whole process in the European Community has often been described, quite rightly, as being as leaky as a sieve. There is absolutely no difficulty in finding out what is going on.  Any Member would easily find in this House four or five other Members of different parties who are very well clued in to what is going on. They will find much information in the European Parliament European Commission offices in Molesworth Street. There is absolutely no excuse for any Member claiming that he or she is prevented from getting information not just about the Treaty but about the discussions that went into it.</P>
    <P>The very famous publication, <i>Agence Europe,</i> seems to know what every Minister and every Commissioner has for breakfast and what size nail clipper he uses.  That information is available and much read by Ministers who are trying to find out why their colleagues in the Council think the way they do and what pressures are on them at home to make them adopt the positions they do.  It is totally spurious of any Member to claim that he or she is in any way prevented from getting information.  I find it absolutely <Col N="1981" /> outrageous that Deputy Blaney, a Member of the European Parliament and a Member of this House, can claim that he does not know what is in the Treaty, that he needs advice to find out what is in it and, because he is uncertain about all these things, he is asking people to vote against it.  He is doing that for one reason only, he is concerned about his own brand image, he wants to be different from everyone else.  That is the sum total of his attitude.  It is a most cynical manoeuvre on his part to try to keep the independent Blaney empire going in Donegal.  I was in Ballyliffen last night and I heard the kind of spurious rubbish that is emerging and being purveyed by Deputy Blaney and his friends and by the others on the anti-Maastricht side.  If those people had any decency or regard for the truth they would find it hard to hold up their heads in public after making the kind of comments they are coming out with.</P>
    <P>Although he is not a Member of this House I find the position of The Worker's Party MEP to be very curious. He also claims that there is a lack of information about motivations and the reasons for some of the provisions contained in the Treaty.  In a sense, he might be given a fool's pardon because he is a new hand at the job, but I have met no other MEP from any other party or any other country &mdash; and I have met a good few of them &mdash; who has complained to me that he or she was in any way deprived of the opportunity to be fully informed of the content of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Treaty sets out to do three very simple but very essential things.  First, it sets out to strengthen the European Community economically by setting up a common monetary policy and a single currency.  Second, it sets out to make the Community a more effective participant in all the major issues on the world stage than it has been up to now for the benefit of its own citizens and of its neighbours and other countries around the world. Third, it sets out to give the Community a structure under which it can enable member states to co-operate more closely <Col N="1982" /> together in the judicial systems, among their police forces and in other ways, to deal with both the advantages and the disadvantages of the opening of borders within the Community.  When one considers the Treaty in that way, the inescapable conclusion is that the Treaty is a very sensible, well thought-out and well balanced reaction to the changes that have been taking place in the world that the European Community has to live in.</P>
    <P>I have said before in the House that for my taste the Maastricht Treaty is too timid and does not go far enough.  That is particularly so in relation to Titles Five and Six, which remain purely intergovernmental arrangements.  Perhaps we will have more &ldquo;intergovernmentality&rdquo; when we reach the end of the ratification process, with 11 member states rather than 12, but in my opinion it is a pity that the governments of the member states chose to leave the matters dealt with in Titles Five and Six of the Treaty on a purely intergovernmental basis.  I think they should have gone further but, of course, I am not going to vote against the Maastricht Treaty because it does not go far enough in the direction I want.  I would encourage the Community to go further and perhaps when this Treaty is reviewed in 1996 we might be able to take further steps to consolidate what is in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>When one considers the Treaty in that light it very quickly becomes clear just how silly, how inward looking and how false is most of the opposition to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Some of the opposition is based on a very discredited economic analysis, which has in fact been repudiated by those who invented it.  I was present in August last year when the economic guru of the opposition to Maastricht, Mr. Raymond Crotty, dumped his theory &mdash; if I may be pardoned use of the expression &ldquo;theory&rdquo;&mdash; that we should tax the &ldquo;be jaysus&rdquo; out of Irish farmers in order to make them more efficient and more productive so that they would produce more meat and milk.  He admitted last August that even if that idea worked there would not now be much point in carrying that <Col N="1983" /> out because we are surrounded and hedged about by quotas.  Mind you, I hope that the present Government will not let quotas come into the sheep sector, because that would be the end for a lot of small farmers.  However, that is another day's work.  That aspect of the spurious economic case against the Maastricht Treaty has been disowned by its author.</P>
    <P>I have heard the other nonsense &mdash; the people who say that they are worried that a European Central Bank will not be subject to any democratic control.  Have those people read our Central Bank Act? Do they know, or do they care, that the European Central Bank, with an obligation to report to the European Parliament every year, will actually have more democratic control over it than has our Central Bank?  Does it ever occur to them to think what has happened in countries in which the central bank has been subject to democratic control or political control?  They all have one thing in common, they all went bankrupt and most of them are now members of the Confederation of Independent States or Central or Eastern European states which are now trying to make the transition from dictatorship to a market economy while up to and over their ears in debt.  That is what has happened by giving political control over central banks.  I make no apology for saying that the people who claim they are worried about the Treaty because of that aspect, are worried about it because of something they have just been told to say and they have not the slightest understanding of the meaning of what they are saying.  I am not often given to extravagant language, and I am a former Minister for Finance, but I must say that if I ever thought we would be in a position in which the Dáil would debate monetary policy and decide what we would do about our interest rates or our exchange rate I would emigrate, because we would always make very bad decisions in that regard for the reason that our framework is short term and reactive.</P>
    <P>Some of the opposition to the Treaty has been based on what could only be <Col N="1984" /> called the most ingenious contortions of provisions in the Treaty itself.  Mind you, we heard that before &mdash; we heard it in 1972 and we heard it again in 1987 when we discussed the Single European Act. There are a couple of peculiarly vicious examples of that species, perpetrated by liars, this time around.  No less than a senior counsel, whom I shall not name in the House but he knows who I am talking about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;came onto a radio programme with me a few weeks ago.  His expressed worry about the Maastricht Treaty was that we might be forced under Titles Five and Six of the Treaty, concerning the common foreign and security policy and co-operation in justice and home affairs, to do certain things that we did not want to do and that if we did not agree with the other member states they could call in the Court of Justice of the European Community to make us do those things.  I shall not say anything about the man's profession, but it was obvious that he had not read the text of the Treaty.  He thought at that stage that Titles Five and Six of the Treaty were justiciable before the Court of Justice. Now, of course, he has found out that that is not so and that Titles Five and Six are completely intergovernmental.  The Court of Justice of the European Community has no jurisdiction over decisions made under those two Titles of the Treaty.  Not a bit abashed, he contorts again and now says that he is worried that we do not have any right to appeal to the Court of Justice against decisions that might be taken under Title Five or Title Six.  He is a perfect example of the legal mind gone mad; &ldquo;you are damned if you do and damned if you do not&rdquo;.  The only thing about him and those who think like him is that they do not want to know what is in the Treaty, they do not want to know why and they do not know what it means.  They just do not like the Treaty because they have closed minds and they are afraid of the world outside.  They are afraid that their own incapacity to deal <Col N="1985" /> with these things is shared by everybody else.  Thank God, that is not the case.</P>
      <P>A particularly vicious distortion has to do with Declaration No. 27, the declaration appended to the Treaty, which deals with the idea that member states should not unnecessarily prevent the emergence of unanimity when unanimous decisions are required.  The prophets of doom latch on to the declaration and say that it means the end of unanimity. Do they know &mdash; or have they even thought &mdash; that we had a similar provision in the Single European Act? Title 3, Article 33 (c) had the same intention and, to the best of my knowledge, that Article has never been invoked because member states do not readily do that kind of thing to one another and the circumstances have not arisen in which it would require to be made.</P>
      <P>That particular contortion of Declaration No. 27 was where this canard of conscription came from, they believe we could be forced into a defence policy and that, since ten of the other 11 member states have conscription, we would also be obliged to have it.  That is a patently dishonest misrepresentation of the Treaty.  It might be all very fine for an eminent senior counsel in court to milk evidence for everything it is worth because he is working for his client but in a matter of this kind &mdash; where we are talking about the future of the European Community &mdash; it is not only irresponsible, it is downright vicious to try to do that kind of job in public on a text on which our people will be asked to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people also claim to be worried that the amendment to be put to the people on 18 June is an open-ended one because the courts of justice do not have any jurisdiction over these things; many more ingenious arguments are advanced. I recommend those people to read the text of the proposed amendment and Article 29.3º of the Constitution, which was passed in 1972 after a referendum. They will find that, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> given the fact that we are dealing with a Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, the amendment we will propose to the people next week is, in its effect, <Col N="1986" /> scope and intent, identical in the context of the Maastricht Treaty to the one which we passed by a majority of four to one &mdash; if I remember correctly &mdash; in 1972 when we joined the European Economic Community.  Therefore, far from it being a great, mysterious, unknowable new departure in constitutional terms, what we are proposing to do now is virtually identical to what we did in 1972.  To present it in any other way is mischievous and dishonest.</P>
    <P>There are issues with which the anti-Maastricht people never deal.  They talk about sovereignty but if you ask them what it means they do not have a clear idea apart from the fact that we should make our own decisions about all the matters affecting us and that nobody else should have any hand, act or part in them.  That notion of sovereignty disappeared from the face of the earth at the end of the Second World War, if indeed it had not gone long before that. There is a difference between &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; and &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo;.  It is a sovereign act to recognise that you are not entirely autonomous; that is our position, we are a small open economy.  More of our GNP comes from trade than is the case for any other member state of the European Community.  On the markets where we sell our goods we are price takers, we do not determine the level of prices because we are not big enough to do so.  On the markets where we borrow money we are price takers, we do not determine interest rates apart from the last margin which Government mismanagement here can determine for us and they have done so in the past. However, they are now getting their act together.  We do not determine interest rates, we do not even determine our own exchange rate unless we decide to engage in the kind of devaluations which we had in the fifties and sixties, the effect of which washes through the economy in six months leaving us no better off than we were before; that is simplifying it in the extreme.</P>
    <P>We do not determine these things because, as an economic actor on the world stage, we are too small to have <Col N="1987" /> an influence.  This notion of giving up sovereignty, which is being advanced as an objection to signing the Maastricht Treaty is false, you cannot give up something which you never had.  To try to fool people into the belief that in ratifying the Maastricht Treaty we will give up some great control over our destiny, which we had before, is nonsense.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, Democratic Left are the only part of the group in the European Parliament which are against the Maastricht Treaty.  The inspiration for the Maastricht Treaty came from the late Altiero Spinelli, who was a member of that same part of the Left in the European Parliament of which Democratic Left are a member.  Do they intend to turn their backs on it?  I never thought I would hear myself saying this, but I cannot deny myself the pleasure of saying that Democratic Left are the only Thatcherite party here, they are in exactly the same position as Mrs. Thatcher.  They have destroyed any credibility they ever had in terms of articulating a consistent economic and political approach from a left wing point of view.  I am delighted that Deputy Spring is now articulating a reasonable point of view from the Left and has got rid of the ambiguity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that a debate is taking place on this very important matter because it will focus public attention on the issue which has to be decided by the electorate on 18 June.  It is important that everyone in this House <Col N="1988" /> does everything he or she can to cut through the element of confusion which still remains.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to concur with many of the remarks made by Deputy Dukes in regard to the negative attack on the Treaty by those who oppose it.  Some of the arguments do not stand up to any serious study, indeed from a number of public debates in which I participated, it is clear that those who used the arguments to try to harm the Treaty were not prepared to accept any of the answers being offered.  It is a type of ambush tactic of hit and run in the hope that as much damage as possible will be done at a particular time.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Dukes in relation to one or two small matters.  I do not accept that the Government refused debating time in this House during the negotiations.  Indeed, I recall that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, made statements in the House on a number of occasions when it was appropriate to do so.  I recall quite clearly on a number of occasions being questioned at great length during Question Time dealing with Foreign Affairs by members of other political parties in regard to what we were doing.  At one stage &mdash; the record of the House will verify this &mdash; I offered to come to the House on one Friday out of four to speak on matters pertaining to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My offer was made in good faith and it is on the record of the House.  It was unfair of Deputy Dukes to refer to the so-called coyness which he believes exists in Iveagh House.  I am quite certain it is not true.  The Deputy will know that prior to the Institute for European Affairs being established, in discussions with those involved in getting it under way, the Government at the time clearly agreed that senior personnel &mdash;<Col N="1989" /> not just from the Department of Foreign Affairs but from the Departments of Justice and Finance &mdash; would be available to give as much briefing information as possible to those involved.  As I said, we were prepared to have a debate in the Dáil but this offer was not taken up.</P>
      <P>I should say however given the speed of the negotiations during the last couple of months, in particular during October and November, it would have been difficult to meet the demand for a debate because situations were changing.  Indeed I found myself in difficulty at times because the positions which had been agreed at one intergovernmental conference were changed at the next conference. In relation to the negotiations on a common foreign and security policy, having regard to the interests and positions of those who were strong alliance people and strong Western European Union people, positions changed as the negotiations proceeded.  However I can assure the House that the Government were not reluctant to debate the matter in the House.</P>

    <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes who expressed disbelief at the fact that Members of the European Parliament have said they were not aware of what was going on.  Nothing could be further from the truth because in the run-up to the commencement of the intergovernmental talks proper we agreed, during our Presidency, with the European Parliament that we would have a series of inter-institutional talks.  Meetings were held on a regular basis between the leaders of the groups within the parliament &mdash; as Deputy De Rossa will recall as he was a Member of the European Parliament at the time &mdash; the leaders of the parties, the representatives of governments, normally at Foreign Minister level, and the relevant Commissioners. These meetings were held over a considerable period of time and all matters relating to the developments that were taking place, in particular the role of the institutions, including the parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission, and pertaining to the restructuring and reorganisation of these <Col N="1990" /> institutions, were debated constantly. While these debates were taking place a number of debates were held in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I can recall reading a worthwhile document which was produced by the Labour Party MEP from the United Kingdom, Mr. Martin, which was of tremendous value to each and every one of us.  It is wrong therefore for people like Deputy Blaney and Mr. Geraghty, MEP, and others to say that they were not consulted and did not know what was going on. They would have known what was going on if they were interested in making the effort to find out.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been very positive in its contributions to the process of European integration, and at this time in the development of this principle on our agenda it is more important than ever to be positive.  Ireland now has a real opportunity to be most supportive, in the eyes of Europe and the world, of a Europe that we are actively engaged in, not just economically for our own betterment but for the European integration process to which we have always subscribed even from the early sixties when we foresaw our future role in the European context.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Dukes, and I am sure practically all other Members of the House, I welcome the statement which was issued today by the four party leaders who came together in the interests of Ireland and Europe to ask for a majority vote in favour of the European Union Treaty on Thursday next.  This is by far the strongest political signal to the Irish electorate on the issue of ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  This statement will have a steadying effect on all and a positive influence on a mature and discerning electorate.  Regrettably, there is still an area of confusion to be penetrated between now and election day but today's efforts by the party leaders will be helpful in this respect.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the rejection of the Treaty by the Danish electorate has caused considerable confusion not just in Denmark but in all member states of the Community and in the European Commission <Col N="1991" /> in Brussels also.  I am satisfied that the Danish result is an extremely serious matter for us all, in particular for the European Union Treaty itself given its potential to impede the ratification process and prevent legal effect being given to the provisions of the Treaty having regard to Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>We must all understand that Denmark, a dedicated member of the Community, has to come to terms with the reality of the situation it has created for itself and to take whatever necessary action it might consider appropriate if it is to continue to play its full role in the new Europe that is developing.  For our part we must try to help it through this difficult period. We welcome the fact that the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve, including Denmark, agreed in Oslo late last week that the ratification process should proceed in the other member states.  That was a good decision, and it is an indication that Denmark is evaluating its position.</P>
    <P>I welcome that decision for another important reason, that is I believe it is crucial that we maintain the forward momentum of the Community which we have witnessed in recent times, in particular since our Presidency of the Community. When I last spoke on this issue in the House a couple of weeks ago I said something which was endorsed a few minutes ago by Deputy Dukes.  I said then that I believed we had not moved as far as we should have in the development of the Community.  It was not a great quantum leap, to borrow a phrase used by somebody else some time ago; it was a positive step but not a large step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Dukes, I believe that in 1996 or perhaps shortly afterwards, the need to move forward again will have to be addressed.  I also believe that all of us must ensure that those within the Community who are not committed to the principle of European integration, as we are, are not allowed to draw down support for their non-progressive attitude and position from the results of the Danish referendum.  We cannot accept <Col N="1992" /> the ideal of a Community of 12 member states in constant competition with each other as the model for the future.  A successful referendum in Ireland for the Treaty will ensure much needed developments in relation to a European Union which cannot remain static or ignore the economic and political developments taking place around us almost daily.</P>
    <P>We must have regard to what is at stake in the referendum on 18 June: the future of the Community itself.  There is tremendous potential for development and we have the resources to allow this to happen.  However we must have the political will and courage to move forward, avail of the many opportunities that will be presented to us and face up to the challenges and the threats that will have to be dealt with as we make progress.</P>
    <P>If for any reason we are unsuccessful in our efforts to ratify the Treaty, such an unwelcome and undeserved result would possibly mark the beginning of the disintegration of the European Community as we know it.  If we cannot move forward and meet the aspirations of the European Union Treaty we will not be able to meet the demands on the Community either from within so far as the internal agenda is concerned or externally, given that that agenda demands our involvement in the creation of economic and political stability from the Baltic to the Mediterranean and throughout the world.  If this much desired stability, which is essential if the European Community is to survive, is lost it will be most difficult to recover.  If there is no economic or political stability within the Community we will not make any progress.  There will then be a real threat &mdash; I hope I am wrong on this &mdash; that the Community will disintegrate.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the European Union Treaty before us at present has received a measure of public support. That consensus of support is a recognition that the package resulting from the intergovernmental conferences &mdash; who were engaged in the detailed preparation and negotiation of the issues involved for over a year and a half &mdash; is acceptable as far as Ireland is concerned.  Certainly it is a package which prepares the way for <Col N="1993" /> our continued development as a nation, economically and politically within the Community and charts out the future role of the Community itself in this ever-changing world.  We want to be part of the new, peaceful Community.  We want to be united with our neighbours so that, through our combined efforts, we can develop greater economic growth and stability which will benefit everybody.</P>
    <P>In addition to the political party consensus that exists here &mdash; I wish it were that little bit more and I say that genuinely, but I accept the right of the Democratic Left to do as they wish &mdash; I am particularly pleased to note the strong support on the part of the trade unions, the farming organisations, business and employers.  This means that all of us together are endeavouring to convince the electorate that there is nothing whatever deceitful in what we are about.  We all believe it is in the best interests of the Irish people and of the country and the Community.  All together we support Ireland's continuing positive role in the reconstruction of the new Europe at present taking place.  Above all, the message emanating loudly and clearly from this consensus is a general recognition that we cannot cut ourselves adrift from our neighbours in the Community without realising the consequences of total uncertainty about our future and the very grave difficulties we would certainly encounter.</P>
    <P>In addition this consensus clearly shows there is a recognition of how important it is for our survival that we should continue to have a positive input in the restructuring of the Community. Everybody who speaks on this issue speaks of the very many changes taking place.  Of course, there are great changes under way and more are to come.  There are many key issues dominating the EC agenda at present which, on resolution, will have a direct or indirect impact on each and every one of us.</P>
    <P>In addition to economic and monetary union, in addition to political union, there are issues such as the internal market and its completion by the end of this year.  There are developments arising <Col N="1994" /> from the recent successful negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy.  The GATT negotiations are continuing and will have a great effect on us also.  Then there are the Structural Funds flanking Community policies, budget reform, the whole question of enlargement and our obligations to developing economies in Central and Eastern Europe.  There are our obligations to reinforce or support stability in developing democracies and our obligations to Third World countries. Each of these issues is of vital importance to us.  We have an obligation to ourselves, as Irish people, and as Europeans, to continue to make a positive input into their development.</P>
    <P>The Treaty establishes a new European Union of 12 member states which for the first time will have a common foreign and security policy.  I mention that chapter in particular.  This Treaty constitutes a major step in that direction. Much has been said about this which is not true and is unhelpful.  Indeed the provisions of this chapter constitute an attempt to respond to the pressures for change which have emerged over the past few years.  Changes in European and international politics in recent years provide an unprecedented opportunity to work for the goals Ireland has always pursued in world affairs.  The Community can be a powerful voice in the world on these issues.  The common security and foreign policy will strengthen the Community's ability to work together on international issues such as the promotion of peace, disarmament and human rights.  It is important to remember that Ireland will have an equal voice and a full say in establishing Community policy.</P>
    <P>For the record it must be stated &mdash; because people outside who are against us are saying the opposite &mdash; that the fact is that decisions on common foreign and security policy must be unanimous.  Our position in relation to military alliances is not affected by the Treaty on European Union negotiated at Maastricht.  The Treaty does not establish an alliance or require us to join one.  In fact, as many speakers are aware, other applicants for <Col N="1995" /> membership, not members of any alliance, such as Austria, Sweden and Finland, have accepted the provisions of the Treaty.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union does not establish a common defence policy.  That is a matter for further negotiation and another intergovernmental conference in 1996.  The Treaty contains no mutual defence commitments. The Treaty states that the policy of the Union will not prejudice the specific character of Ireland's security and defence position.</P>
      <P>The outcome of these intergovernmental conferences as far as this country is concerned is that we succeeded in negotiating a balanced package, one which is truly worthy of the people's support on 18 June.</P>

      <P>That is if Deputy Taylor can return in time because we are making progress.  In concurring with our party spokesperson, Deputy Quinn, and in support of my party leader, Deputy Spring, who joined the three other party leaders, including the Taoiseach, in calling today for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, I want to say categorically that the Labour Party remain committed to the principle of European Union.  We remain committed to this principle, particularly when one has regard to the possible potential of a properly negotiated process of integration and the benefits such can yield. Hopefully, after the efforts of our Minister for Finance today, the extra prosperity which should result from the Cohesion Fund, if fairly distributed <Col N="1996" /> throughout the EC regions, can give us confidence in the process of European integration and what it will mean for us.</P>
      <P>However, we should not under-estimate some of the difficulties that have arisen.  For example, there is the process of educating the electorate on the whole concept of what Maastricht is about, its ratification and its importance for us.  Difficulties have arisen which have created complications not easily resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to enter into immediate discussions with the relevant Northern Ireland authorities to agree on the preparation of a joint operational programme for the entire island of Ireland, for submission to the European Community to avail of the EC Structural Funds for the period 1993-1997, with a view to promoting much more intensive trade between both parts of the island.</P>
      <P>I am proposing something that is completely new: instead of the administration in the South drawing up a scheme and presenting it to Brussels and the authorities in London drawing up a separate scheme for Northern Ireland and Britain and presenting it in Brussels, I believe we should look at the whole island of Ireland as one unit, economically speaking, and draw up a joint operational programme for both parts of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a radical approach and has never been tried before, but people in Northern Ireland are receptive to the idea.  I have had the opportunity during the past two weeks of visiting Northern Ireland and having discussions with representatives of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Farmers' Union, the Northern <Col N="1997" /> Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with community leaders.  I met people from every religious persuasion and none, but they were all agreed that, as long as there is no hidden agenda and no political strings attached, co-operation on economic development projects will be extremely welcome in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe that rather than simply taking the time-worn path of public servants &mdash; the pursuit of the familiar, and following precedent, which is ingrained in all those who work in the public service all over the world &mdash; we should do something very different.  However, I am greatly disappointed by the Government's response to my proposal.  The Government amendment rejects the idea of a joint operational programme and asks us to approve continuing the policies that have been pursued in the past.  Of course, it stresses the strong co-operative approach; indeed we know there is and always has been a strong co-operative approach once the priorities of the administration on this side of the Border have been satisfied.  Following the past pattern of activity will not solve the problem. The fact is we are spending vast sums of money developing markets for our produce in Japan, Britain, France, and to penetrate these markets our people have to learn other languages and other legal systems in order to sell their goods, while ignoring the market on our doorstep in the North.</P>
    <P>It has been calculated that cross-Border trade from North to South amounted to £500 million last year and exports from South to North amounted to £800 million.  However, manufacturers in the Republic only sell one-quarter as much in Northern Ireland in proportion to the size of the economy as they sell in the Republic.  Likewise, Northern manufacturers sell only one-third as much to the South proportionate to the size of the population as they sell in their own markets.  In other words, we are not selling to each other what would be normal for economies on the same island and people who are essentially living in the same economic space.  To penetrate distant <Col N="1998" /> markets we have to learn other languages, Japanese, Italian and French. Learning languages is something to be encouraged &mdash; indeed the only school teaching Russian at present is the Methodist College in Belfast but I hope to see more languages on offer in our schools in the future.  The fact of the matter is that we are not taking advantage of the opportunities on our doorstep.</P>
    <P>Dr. George Quigley, the chairman of the Ulster Bank, is very prominent in the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland.  He suggests that we should try to create an island economy and further that we develop a Belfast-Dublin economic corridor.  In Massachusetts, for example, there has been particularly intensive economic development along a transport network, route 66, because a certain synergy developed in that particular zone.  Likewise in the Po valley in northern Italy, competing firms, by co-operating with each other, enjoyed within a very short time massive economic growth after the last war.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether there is any agreement in the Stormont talks that are taking place at present, we have the opportunity now to create a Belfast-Dublin economic corridor around which we can develop tremendous job opportunities. Obviously if jobs are to be generated in the economic corridor it is a basic essential to have a proper road network between Belfast and Dublin.  That is not the case at present.  There is no by-pass at Balbriggan or Julianstown; recently Swords got a by-pass, but there is no by-pass in Drogheda and traffic has to travel very slowly from North to South. We could avail of moneys from the European Community to carry out this work but that requires a decision.  Not so long ago the proposed by-pass for Dundalk was delayed because the authorities North and South could not agree where the by-pass should be built.  The Southern authorities wanted the by-pass to be located on the side of town which involves the lowest cost to the Republic while the Northern authorities want it located where it would involve the lowest cost for them.  Both fought about it, <Col N="1999" /> hoping that the other Government would have to pay more.</P>
    <P>The type of mentality that would hold up a development that is so important in terms of building a one island economy, all for the sake of saving a few pounds, is what I would like to see eradicated by this debate.  We should start looking at the economies on this island as one economy and recognise that if jobs can be created on the other side of the Border, that also creates wealth on this side of the Border.  Once we have a Single European Market &mdash; which we will have if the Irish people vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, then economic activity that is generated in Newry can have the sub supply, the components, produced in Dundalk or <i>vice versa</i>.  In a Single European Market if industry is attracted to Derry, the people from Buncrana will be encouraged to go to work there.  That is the idea of a Single European Market and a single island economy in Ireland.  The Maastricht Treaty gives us the opportunity to create a single economy on this island and to do so without any hidden agenda.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of this arising because, say, traditional Catholic nationalism has got the better of traditional Protestant unionism or, alternatively, that the Unionist view has got the better of the Nationalist view and we have decided to re-enter the Commonwealth or some economic zone with Britain.  That issue is off the agenda. Questions as to whether it was one side's view of the world or the other side's view of the world which would reign supreme in an integrated area are no longer at issue because we have changed the concept of the problem; we are looking at it in the much wider scale of a European agreement which has been negotiated for an area much larger than the islands of either Ireland or Britain.  We have an opportunity within that wider context of building a single island economy on this island.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated by the Confederation of Irish Industry that up to 75,000 extra jobs could be created on <Col N="2000" /> this island as a whole if we were able to achieve the level of trade between North and South which would be normal as between two parts of an island so close together.  If we could, so to speak, remove the economic border which still exists in our minds more than in reality we have the potential to create all those jobs.  I want to give an example.  A hospital which cannot identify a supplier within &ldquo;the State&rdquo; from whom it can get certain equipment should obviously look next at Northern Ireland to see if the equipment can be obtained on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the very odd situation whereby the guidebook on the Giant's Causeway is printed in London.  If there is no printer in Northern Ireland who can print this guidebook to the standard required then the obvious and most cost-effective place to get the printing done is on this side of the Border.  This is a sensible approach regardless of politics &mdash; people save money by buying from suppliers close to them rather than buying from suppliers who are an airline journey away.  If a person has difficulties with a product, he is able to ask a supplier to visit his plant to see how it is being used if he is just down the road.  This is not the case if the goods are bought in Britain, France or further afield.</P>
    <P>We need to change the way we look at the economic choices we have to make when purchasing goods.  The northern part of this island is the first place we should look to make those purchases if we cannot get the goods nearer home.  I suggest that there should be an agreement between the Government purchasing service in Northern Ireland and the Department of Finance in the Republic, in liaison with the Irish Trade Board, to establish an easy access purchasing and tenders register for the entire public sector on the island of Ireland whereby people in Northern Ireland would have easy access on computer to any tenders advertised for the purchase of goods or services on this side of the Border and <i>vice versa</i>.  I believe there is a procedure in the Department of Finance for accrediting certain public sector <Col N="2001" /> suppliers of particular goods and services, approved suppliers of particular goods.  Instead of the Government purchasing service in Northern Ireland retaining one list of approved suppliers in Northern Ireland for the products we buy and our Department of Finance maintaining an entirely separate list of suppliers on the other side of the Border we should have one list of approved suppliers for the entire island of Ireland.  This would give wider choice, more competition and better quality.  An electronic catalogue should be established for all the goods which are likely to be made available for purchase from the public sector on the island.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we cannot create an economic corridor unless we have good transport links.  We should demand that by 1997 there will be a dual carriageway all the way from Dublin to Belfast.  This should be an agreed objective between North and South.  We should also agree that the rail link between North and South should be upgraded so that trains can travel at a much greater speed than they travel at present.  There should be a common united demand by the peace loving people on both sides of the Border to the Provisional IRA to stop their activities which are interfering with rail links between North and South.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to think that a criminal gang who claim to be interested in a united Ireland &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;claim&rdquo;&mdash; should spend their time blowing up a link between the two parts of the island.  It shows the ultimate perversity and barrenness of their thinking that this is one of the publicity stunts they think of.  I do not believe this organisation will listen to rational argument or that they are concerned with rational argument. This organisation are akin to the Mafia and they will not change their policies as a result of anything said in this House. We have to make sure that this organisation are stopped from doing what they are doing.</P>
    <P>There should be a single ports policy for the island of Ireland.  It probably makes sense for Dublin and Larne to be ports for the export of goods from this <Col N="2002" /> island to Britain.  Rather than trying to go in the opposite direction we should encourage and support people to use the port at Larne.  Equally, we should accept that the port at Waterford should be the port for the entire island of Ireland for direct linkage to Europe.  There should be an investment policy supported by the Governments both North and South to develop Waterford port as the European sea bridge for the entire island.  Dr. Tony Ryan recently suggested that there should be a subsidised air bridge between Ireland and Europe, perhaps located at Shannon, where there would be quick delivery of goods from the island of Ireland to the Continent.  This is something in which the Northern Ireland authorities would also have an interest as a direct route from the island of Ireland via, say, Shannon, to the Continent would be quicker for Northern businesses than routing through London.  We should seek to develop such a route as a common endeavour between the two parts of this island.</P>
    <P>When I was in Northern Ireland I had the opportunity of having discussions with the Ulster Farmers' Union.  I can assure the House that those discussions were very familiar to me from my discussions with the IFA &mdash; the accents were almost the same and the problems were certainly the same.  I was extremely surprised to note that no common research into agricultural problems is being carried out between the authorities north and south of the Border.  Of course, they send one another their learned papers when the results are finalised.  These two administrations are trying to help farmers to survive in difficult circumstances in almost precisely the same climate on the same island with the same geographic distance from sources of supply and the same systems of agriculture.  Yet no joint research is being carried out between the research station in, say, Hillsboro and the research station in Grange or the research station in Hillsboro and the research station in Moor Park.  Complete partitionism rules in the Irish public service mind as far as agricultural research <Col N="2003" /> and almost every other activity is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have an attitude of looking at our State and not looking at the possibility which exists of doing something together with the people on the other side of the Border.  The same applies so far as FÁS are concerned.  How many Northern Ireland trainees are there in FÁS centres? There are FÁS centres and regional colleges dotted along the Border.  How many Northern Ireland students are there in the FÁS centres and regional technical colleges in Dundalk, Letterkenny and other centres along the Border?  I venture to say that there are virtually none.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet we are putting huge sums of money, much of it supplied from outside this jurisdiction, into the development of FÁS centres on the island of Ireland.  We could produce a much better range of courses, more professional and successful courses if we pooled our efforts rather than continuing to operate separate administrations on partitionist lines.</P>
      <P>We should have a common environmental policy.  One of the priorities of the Cohesion Fund will be to clean up the environment.  There is no doubt that we on this side of the Border are pumping untreated sewage into the seas around us.  It is not solely people in territory where the Union Jack flies who are responsible for the putrefication of the Irish Sea.  Untreated sewage is being pumped into the Boyne at Mornington and into the Irish Sea by people on this side of the Border.  There should be a common environmental policy for the island of Ireland because air pollution and water pollution respect no borders. That should be a high priority for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have joint missions overseas to sell Ireland as an investment and tourist location.  I know that Bord Fáilte and the IDA, with whom I had contact as Minister, did not want to touch their <Col N="2004" /> Northern Ireland counterparts with a barge pole.  They were afraid that if they did not sell the Republic entirely separate from Northern Ireland they would lose investment.  Huge sums of money were spent going abroad telling people in America that we are different, that if they invest in the Republic they are not investing in the North, that that is a different place.  Yet our politicians subsequently say it is the same.  They tell these people they want them to take an interest in this island.  The messages being sent out by those concerned with attracting tourism and investment to the Republic are contradictory to the messages being sold, very often by the same people, that the problems on the whole island are inter-related.  We should take our courage in our hands and agree to joint trade missions overseas with the Northern Ireland Development Board. We should at least try it once or twice to see if it works.</P>
    <P>Economic co-operation on its own will not solve all the problems of Ireland. In the past ten years in some respects matters have got worse.  I know of a person who was away from Belfast for ten years and when he returned to the city recently he was shocked at the extent to which there had been a radical reduction in the number of people living in mixed areas.  Protestants are almost exclusively, unless they are from the upper middle class, living in areas where their only neighbours are Protestants, and the same applies to Catholics.  There are 17 or 18 year olds in Northern Ireland who have never had a conversation of more than five minutes with somebody of a different religion.  As long as the separation of the two communities in Northern Ireland continues, it will be very difficult for political settlements, however well constructed, to succeed. Unless people at ground level have a sense of identity and a sense of common citizenship with their neighbours, the activities of politicians at a higher level will be simply theoretical treaties between groups with divergent interests.</P>
    <P>That is one reason the Roman Catholic Church should change its view as regards <Col N="2005" /> integrated education.  It would make much sense in the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland if there was greater support for integrated education. I know there are strong values in denominational education and, in normal circumstances, I would not advocate such a policy change, but when there is effectively no opportunity for the young members of the two communities to meet because they play different codes of football, go to different schools and live in different neighbourhoods, how will we break that logjam other than by educating them together?  I do not believe that by educating these children together we will remove all prejudices, nor do I believe that the separate education they now receive is prejudiced.  Denominational education within its limitations does as much as is humanly possible to promote mutual understanding.  Having visited two denominational schools in Northern Ireland in the last few weeks I know that is the case.  However, it is not the same as sharing the same classroom or the same playground with someone of a different religion or as having a best school friend who is of a different religion.  No matter how much theoretical mutual understanding is taught there is no substitute for direct human contact. There is a need for people other than politicians to give a lead if that position is to be changed.</P>
    <P>I propose this motion not because I have any political agenda in terms of a political settlement on this island or between this island and a neighbouring island.  The finding of a solution to this problem has been bedevilled by people in this House having an agenda to promote. All I ask is that we start working together for our mutual profit in a single economy on this island of Ireland.  There is profit to be made for all of us, but the lead has to come from the Irish Government, and it has to come in the next two to three months.  The last major tranche of Structural Funds Ireland will receive from the European Community will come in the years 1993-97.  After 1997 the priority for European Structural Funds will not be Ireland, Portugal or Spain but Eastern <Col N="2006" /> Europe.  The problems in Eastern Europe are so acute that by that time, following enlargement of the Community, Eastern Europe will have a higher priority for Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In the next few months we will have a last chance in this regard, and we can take that chance in two ways.  We can go to Brussels with our own programme, with the odd consultation, for show, with the people in the North and they can go on a Westminster delegation with their programme, with the odd chat, for show, with people on this side of the Border. Alternatively, the Irish Government can decide in the next few months, instead of going separately to Brussels, to seek to put together a single operational programme for the whole island, with the investments being made on this side of the Border with European funds interlocking with and complementing the investments being made on the other side of the Border.  That decision can be made by an Irish Cabinet in Government Buildings next week regardless of whether the talks proceeding under Sir Patrick Mayhew are a success.</P>
    <P>We can decide to approach the Northern Ireland authorities with a view to agreeing to such a joint programme, as is proposed in the Fine Gael motion.  The Government in their amendment more or less congratulate themselves on what they have done while proposing no change in existing procedures.  In the course of this debate I hope the Government will change their minds and will agree that a joint operational programme for the whole island would make sense.</P>
    <P>As I have ten minutes left and there are other Members who are interested in contribution, I would like if the party spokesman on Border areas, Deputy McGahon was allowed to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy John Bruton for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on this subject which has been dear to my heart since I came in here ten years ago.  I welcome Deputy Bruton aboard the platform of seeking help for the Border region.  The Deputy has sought help very forcibly tonight. <Col N="2007" /> Some of the practical measures Deputy Bruton has enumerated underline his capacity to make a contribution to cross-Border co-operation.  Deputy Bruton has recently demonstrated his realistic approach in his excellent policy on job creation, which is practical rather than bureaucratic.</P>
      <P>The plight of the Border region has been well documented here over the last ten years.  I charge all political parties with a certain amount of indifference to this problem.  There has been a tendency to throw one's hands up in the air and say that while the Border troubles exist there is no effective mechanism for progress in the Border areas.  My native town, the biggest in Ireland, has withered economically over the last 23 years in the shadow of the tragedy of the North of Ireland and the holocaust it has turned into.  The Border area has been literally sent to hell or to Connacht with no recognition of the terrible tale of destruction in manufacturing jobs in the Border region. Dundalk has double the national average unemployment.  That did not materialise over the last two or three years.  It developed at the start of the Ulster troubles in 1968.  Despite that and the signs that were there, no Irish Government recognised the problem because there was a political consensus that if we defined that area as the disaster area it was, other areas would claim parity. Meanwhile my area was left to almost obliteration.  The unemployment figures reveal the lack of attention that was paid by all Governments in the last 23 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Bruton's initiative in recently travelling to the North and looking at the practical ways in which we can have a hands across the Border relationship with the people in that area. The partition of Ireland is unsolvable.  It is like a man and a wife who cannot live together.  In the 70 years in which we have been masters of our own destiny, a partitionist mentality has developed not in the North, but in the South.  We have to live in this State.  There are two states on this island.  The practical way to deal with it is in economic co-operation.  If the <Col N="2008" /> IRA, the most evil terrorist grouping in the world, have the sense to stop their campaign of slaughter, perhaps in many years to come some type of harmony can result in the unification of this country. It will not come in my time nor in the lifetime of anybody on this island.  That is why we must recognise that the difficulties for the moment are insurmountable but that economically we have a lot to gain by working together.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton said, the problems of the farmer in Derry and in Kerry are similar.  In agricultural development we could work together to make meaningful progress.  Recently I was in Copenhagen on a Committee of Public Accounts deputation looking at the methods by which they eradicated bovine TB.  That is the first country in Europe to achieve 100 per cent freedom from that disease. Yet here it has cost us nearly £2 billion and we are not working with our opposite numbers in the North who have to a large extent eliminated that scourge.  There should be joint research in agricultural development, as Deputy Bruton suggested.</P>
    <P>The main development that would benefit my area would be the joint promotion abroad of the Mountains of Mourne region and the Cooley Peninsula. The Mountains of Mourne and the Cooley Peninsula have more in common than the Cooley Peninsula and the mountains of Kerry.  It is one region.  If a bridge was built over the narrow water with EC funding, it would be a tremendous joint development which would probably be benignly received in Brussels.  That is a practical measure which has long been mooted in the County Louth region. Would the Minister bear that in mind, because it is a natural hinterland, one which affords potential tourists delightful scenery on a par with anything in the South of Ireland?</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton touched on the question of the necessity to upgrade the Dublin-Belfast railway line.  Only today I travelled on it and, like many others, I was held up for half-an-hour due to a bomb scare in the Border region.  For a group of people who claim to want to <Col N="2009" /> unite this country, that is a partitionist act and shows them for the arch-hypocrites they are.  They want to sever a link that has been there for 100 years, to prevent the 600,000 people who use the link every year from using it.  That link brings many tourists, business people and students to Queen's University and to centres in Dublin.  That organisation are preventing that happening.  They are also putting men out of work.  How they can claim to be acting in the true Republican fashion defies me, but then, everything about that blood-lust group staggers me.</P>
    <P>The IRA have cemented the partition of Ireland with their excesses over the last 23 years.  Over 4,000 people have been lowered into their graves.  It is a weakness in a democracy that it allows terrorism to flourish to the extent that it does on this island.  The awful tragedy of Beirut has now subsided but the problems go on in Belfast and in Border areas. They impinge directly on my town and on our State.  Dundalk has borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles on behalf of mother Ireland but no compensatory measures have been implemented.  The British Exchequer has pumped unbelievable amounts of money into the towns on the other side of the Border.  They have got swimming pools, leisure centres and libraries.  The money has been pumped in as compensation, but nothing has been given to the Border towns on our side.  It is time for the authorities in the North and here to get together in a meaningful way, rather than having the occasional cup of coffee in the Carrickdale Hotel and an afternoon out for some civil servants and a few politicians. They should get together and devise a cohesive strategy designed to benefit the entire island.  I urge the Minister to recognise the plight of the Border area and the desirability of a joint approach to Ireland's problems.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Government's policy of incorporating a strong co-operative approach with the Northern Ireland Authorities into its planning process for the post-1993 EC Structural Funds, both in the preparation of the respective Development Plans to be submitted to the EC Commission by the Authorities North and South and in the preparation of a new INTERREG Programme to succeed the existing Joint Programme, with the overall aim of encouraging greater co-operation in the economic development of the whole island of Ireland including the promotion of more intensive trade between both parts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to take up some of the points already made and to indicate some of the developments which are already in train, as evidenced in the book entitled <i>Ireland in Europe &mdash; A Shared Challenge,</i> which was launched recently.  I strongly refute the idea that we are ignoring cross-Border trade.  Deputy Bruton referred to the purchase of expensive medical equipment which could be used in a cross-Border way.  During the short period in which I was Minister for Health I formally agreed with my Northern Ireland counterpart for the purchase of equipment costing over £300,000 which was to be used on a North-South basis.  I was very pleased to be part of this undertaking, the first of its type.  It was a very practical expression of co-operation.  The public sector data base which Deputy Bruton referred to is on its way.  Joint research and development within the agricultural sector is also detailed in the book.  Admittedly it is of a modest nature but it has been in train for a number of years on a very successful basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> Deputy McGahon spoke with great passion and obvious conviction.  He talked about the Cooley Peninsula. There is a connection between Cooley Distilleries and Kilbeggan Distilleries. They are interacting in a positive way.  I had the honour some years ago of launching that project and the first tasting is to take place in the middle of July.  What the whiskey will be called I do not know but it is the product of Cooley and Kilbeggan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it will be very potent.  There are programmes already in place between the IDA and the small business firms in Northern Ireland. The Mosaic data base lists Irish manufacturers in both parts of the island. Mosaic is intended to encourage Irish industrial and trade buyers to increase levels of local sourcing.  Bord Tráchtála are now about the business of producing a public purchasing data base which will be capable of being established on an all-Ireland basis.  A joint North-South public purchasing guide by Bord Tráchtála and the Northern Ireland Government Purchasing Service has also been produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there is much more to be done but I would be failing in my duty if I did not put on record the amount of joint research and co-operation which is already going on.  A number of joint agricultural research projects are already under way between Queen's University and Johnstown Castle.  The Teagasc scheme of research grants to universities extends to Queen's University and the University of Ulster.  I do not wish to be &ldquo;one up&rdquo; on anybody but it is correct that these facts be laid before the House lest people will think there is nothing happening in the areas of education, agricultural research, joint co-operation in trade and marketing and co-operation between chambers of commerce, North and South.  Much has already been achieved.  It started in the mid-eighties <Col N="2012" /> but there has been a great acceleration in the past few years.</P>
    <P>I would mention <i>en passant</i> but with great emphasis that I share Deputy Bruton's ideas on integrated education. In my years in the Department of Education I stressed the great urgency of it. I hope that message will go out from us jointly tonight.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity as Minister for Trade and Marketing to have a discussion in the House on this important question.  The Government consider it desirable to look at the question of cross-Border co-operation in the broader context of the overall Community support framework and the preparation of the next development plan for submission to the EC.</P>
    <P>As part of the planning process already underway projects and programmes with a cross-Border aspect are being identified with a view to including a strong cross-Border element in the National Development Plan which will be submitted to the EC Commission as part of the procedure involved in agreeing the Structural Funds in the period 1994 to 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would like to point to the existing joint INTERREG programme under one of the Community Initiatives, though limited to the Border areas.  In discussing the INTERREG programme, I should make the distinction that, whereas Community support frameworks are based on national development plans, the INTERREG programme is a Community Initiative, developed by the Commission to promote the implementation of certain Community policies at regional level.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the areas eligible for assistance under INTERREG are the whole of Northern Ireland, apart from the city of Belfast, and Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo. The allocation for Ireland from 1990 to 1993 is approximately £54 million.  The programme covers five elements: tourism, agriculture/forestry/fisheries, human resource development, environmental protection and regional development. Many of these areas were mentioned by <Col N="2013" /> Deputy Bruton and there is already intense North-South activity.</P>
    <P>The Government favour the continuation of this initiative and the Department of Finance are co-ordinating proposals to further develop and expand the programme.</P>
    <P>Just last week the Government published in book form a series of studies bearing the title, <i>Ireland in Europe &mdash; A Shared Challenge</i>.  The object of this publication was to stimulate further thought and examination of how economic co-operation on the island of Ireland could be further advanced in the context of an integrated Europe.  The areas of actual and potential co-operation dealt with in this book include industry and trade, agriculture and natural resources and other matters.  When launching this publication the Taoiseach said that the building of the European Union will help to strengthen the Community as a core of stability in Europe.</P>
    <P>Very many eminent figures and representatives of the business communities, North and South, have, in recent times, signalled their recognition of the new opportunities.  Amongst these I would cite the chairman of the Ulster Bank, Dr. George Quigley, who at the annual conference of the Confederation of Irish Industry on 28 February 1992, called for the creation of a Belfast-Dublin economic corridor.  On that occasion, Dr. Quigley stated that he found no difficulty with the proposition that Ireland is &mdash; or should be &mdash; an island economy.</P>
    <P>It is indeed very timely now, that the people of Ireland, and in particular the business communities and leaders should vigorously seek out ways to co-operate.</P>
    <P>We have much in common, North and South.  Sharing this island as we do, we are the only members of the European Community who do not have a land bridge to the centre of that market.  From 1 January 1993, this immense market of 340 million people, with a combined purchasing power of over £3,000 billion, will be without barriers or restrictions to trade.  We know that both parts are Objective I regions.  Both parts share common problems and common challenges <Col N="2014" /> and can act in tandem with one another thus deriving much benefit.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for trade and marketing I have been deeply encouraged to see the very real and growing co-operation in recent times between the Chambers of Commerce, North and South, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Confederation of British Industry and between the economic development agencies North and South.</P>
    <P>The Single Market will dismantle the customs border and give Irish firms on both sides an opportunity to increase the volume of business.</P>
    <P>During the intergovernmental talks in March of this year the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I met the then Northern Minister for the Economy, Mr. Richard Needham, MP, to discuss North-South co-operation and the Single Market.  The conference reviewed joint initiatives and made plans for further initiatives.</P>
    <P>The programme of work is now well underway and, indeed, it is in the interests of both sides to develop and strengthen these links.  As a follow on, I visited the North and I look forward to a reciprocal visit from my Northern counterpart in the autumn, to discuss ideas in relation to joint trade promotion programmes for companies North and South.  Since 1987 when Fianna Fáil came into Government either single or in conjunction with another party, all the Ministers, Ministers of State and Deputies have, within our areas of responsibility, moved freely North and South and have received great co-operation from the public service.  I say this because there was an implication in what Deputy Bruton said that the public service were not keen on the idea of economic co-operation or any other kind of co-operation. I should say clearly that the public servants North and South seem imbued with the highest ideals in carrying out the wishes and the stated objectives of the Government in office.</P>
    <P>Separate to the untapped opportunities for business development there is, of course, a much greater opportunity and challenge in the larger Single European <Col N="2015" /> Market and in the new European economic area agreed between the EC and EFTA.</P>
    <P>All this forms the basis of the newly agreed agenda for economic co-operation between Ministers responsible for trade and industry development, North and South.  We know that our firms must develop the capacity to penetrate overseas markets.  We know that this will require enhanced resources, better product research, better design and the achievement of EC product standards at the earliest possible date.  We know that it makes sound economic and business sense to do so.  Much complementary work is in progress between the research bodies, North and South, and between third level colleges, North and South.</P>
    <P>I would like now to situate my remarks with some practical examples of the growing co-operation in trade development. In 1991, North-South trade amounted to £1.3 billion with a £300 million surplus in favour of the South.  Northern Ireland takes 5.3 per cent of our exports and 4 per cent of our imports come from there.</P>
    <P>The respective trade boards, An Bord Tráchtála in the South, and the Industrial Development Board in the North are aware of the need to aggressively defend and build their market positions against external competition and have recently executed a range of joint projects many of which have been assisted by the International Fund for Ireland.  These include the development of a joint North/South Public Procurement Guide; a joint promotion in the US to encourage retailers to stock products from Northern Ireland and Southern Irish manufacturers; co-operation between the Galway and Derry Chambers of Commerce, and in August next 60 companies from the island will be featured in an Ireland exhibition in the Liberty of London Retail Promotion.</P>
    <P>The most ambitious North-South initiative in relation to trade development was recently launched jointly by myself and the newly appointed Northern Minister for the Economy, Mr. Robert Atkins, MP, in Belfast on 30 April last. <Col N="2016" /> This initiative features a series of five subcontract exhibitions &mdash; the objective of which is to increase the level of domestic purchasing by industry in Ireland North and South.</P>
    <P>These exhibitions involve the display, at each of five venues, Belfast &mdash; which we launched jointly &mdash; Galway, Derry, Waterford and Dublin.  The exhibition features a demonstration of components currently being imported into Ireland by more than 100 manufacturers.  The exhibition serves two functions, on the one hand it allows potential local suppliers to view components which they may be able to supply and so displace imports: on the other hand it allows larger manufacturing companies on this island who currently source materials from abroad to view the quality of the components produced by sub suppliers on this island with whom they may not yet have done business.</P>
    <P>I found that exhibition which we launched jointly on 30 April in Belfast to be enormously beneficial in many ways, not only in the economic and financial arenas but in the very obvious enthusiasm with which contractors, sub contractors and suppliers greeted and dealt with one another.  Over the two days of the exhibition firm business liaisons were formed and also firm friendships were formed involving social and economic activity between the people who manned the booths in each of the various components. I have met informally some of those who were present.  They spoke of how much they had developed their own thinking not only in economic terms but also in a social and personal way about North-South relationships.  All sorts of things result from matters such as this.  It is not simply the activity on hand on that day or the following day but rather the human relationships which build up on such occasions.</P>
    <P>These examples of economic co-operation illustrate that there is indeed much ground for progress in matters of economic interest.  On the broader question of the commonality of interests between North and South and between Ireland and Britain, I am tempted to quote from a speech by Eamon de Valera to Seanad <Col N="2017" /> Éireann on 7 February 1939, almost two decades before the Treaty of Rome was signed, and over 30 years before Ireland and the United Kingdom joined that Community.  He said:</P>
    <P>Our situation is that we are two islands off the Continent.  Our very geographical position suggests that there are relations which we have closer to each other than we have with other countries.  The history between the two countries, although it has not been a happy one, has undoubtedly begotten certain relations which make it possible for us to have closer contacts than we would have with other people ...</P>
    <P>Since that time, the map of Europe has changed dramatically and new institutions have opened up new opportunities. If we could focus on the opportunities and challenges which the progress of Community institutions open up to us, we would, I believe, find much common cause.  By working together to resolve common difficulties, is it too much to expect that old barriers may be broken and trust created not only in business spheres but in political spheres also?</P>
    <P>In the light of the existing Government approach we are asking this House to support the amendment from the Government supporting our policy on cooperating with the Northern Ireland authorities in the planning process for the post-1993 Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>That is very kind of junior counsel and it is much appreciated.  He will get two-thirds as usual.  I am happy to avail of the opportunity of this motion to speak on the general question of North-South economic relations and the stepping up of cross-Border economic co-operation across the various areas.</P>
      <P>Arising from the efforts of the Government, and their Departments and agencies on the one hand, and private sector interests on the other there is now a very evident growth and momentum in the development of cross-Border economic co-operation as the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, said.  The impetus for such increased co-operation arises in no small way from an appreciation by industry and trade interests on both sides of the Border of the benefits and, indeed, the necessity of intensifying such co-operation in the Single European Market context.  The debate is appropriately being conducted on the further practical cross-Border economic linkages which must be undertaken if our enterprises are to reap the benefits and adequately meet the challenges which the completion of the Single Market will bring.  A common approach at Community level is essential if our firms are to survive and flourish in the new situation.</P>
      <P>The Government are fully supportive of this growing awareness within industry of the advantages to be derived from greater co-operation at the sectoral and sub-sectoral levels.  Indeed, I would submit that the Government can justly lay claim to a leading role in this overall process through their actions, jointly with the British Government, to promote economic co-operation within the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remit of the conference in the economic area has been considerably widened in the last two years.  In this <Col N="2019" /> period there have been detailed discussions in the conference, with the participation in each case of the responsible Ministers, North and South, in the sectoral areas of tourism, transport, energy, environment, health, agriculture, and education.  Most recently, at the 6 March conference, at which I was present, we discussed the matter of North-South trade and the implications of the Single European Market for the whole island. Deputy O'Rourke's participation at that conference was much appreciated and accepted as being very important.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the economic discussions within the conference are very much action-oriented, directed at putting measures and arrangements in place which will work to the mutual benefit of North and South.  The preparation of the joint INTERREG programme, for instance, was the subject of detailed exchanges within the conference framework.  More recently, the conference served as an important forum for advancing co-operation in the field of gas inter-connection, culminating in the welcome extended by the March conference to the decision by British Gas to join with Bord Gáis Éireann in a pipeline which will link Scotland with both parts of Ireland.  The same was true of the discussions on the project to upgrade the Dublin-Belfast rail link, leading to the announcement, at the 27 April conference, of the decision by the two Governments to proceed with the project.</P>
    <P>In respect of the structures, the March conference put arrangements in place for officials to carry forward the work of promoting North-South trade and business co-operation generally.  As another example, I would mention that the conference last September established a steering committee on cross-Border rural development to deepen co-operation in this area of particular importance for the two economies.</P>
    <P>The conference set the agenda for the carrying forward of co-operation at the level of Government and the official agencies.  Beyond this, the co-operation <Col N="2020" /> being advanced through the conference framework serves, I would suggest, to provide the necessary climate and underlying support for the growing co-operation being undertaken by the private sector and individual agencies and organisations. In this respect I would like to note in particular the important contributions to North-South co-operation being made by the International Fund for Ireland, the joint North-South initiative of the CII/CBI (Northern Ireland), and the work of other professional and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>What has already been achieved in deepening economic co-operation on a North-South basis, whether at official level or otherwise, remains, however, unacceptably small.  The vast potential which exists to expand co-operation across the various areas and sectors remains substantially untapped.  As a contribution to correcting this situation the Taoiseach last week published an indepth study &mdash;&ldquo;Ireland in Europe: A Shared Challenge&rdquo;&mdash; on the prospects for closer North-South economic co-operation against the background of the European Single Market.  The study &mdash; the preparation of which was co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; contains a wide range of proposals and recommendations for joint action by the two parts of Ireland in preparing for the challenges and opportunities facing us in the new Europe.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in launching the study, indicated that he hoped that the wealth of detailed recommendations which it contains will serve as a focus for debate and analysis among policy-makers and public alike in the months ahead.  He also stressed to Ministers and Departments the need to look seriously at the recommendations in the report, and he took the opportunity of making a similar plea to business and to people everywhere in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that, to facilitate the resumption of the political talks, it was agreed that there will be no further meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference before the week beginning 27 July 1992. When the conference next meets, I would <Col N="2021" /> propose to raise with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the joint arrangements which might be put in place to take matters forward, on the basis of the findings and recommendations contained in the study, in relation to a significant deepening of North-South economic relations.  In this context I would also hope to explore with him the ways in which the relevant existing co-operative mechanisms and channels might be reinforced to sustain the new co-operative relationship which I would wish to see come into being.  The overall objective, within the framework of a more comprehensive approach to economic relations on this island, would be to develop a partnership arrangement between North and South, including in the European context in line with the spirit of the present motion.</P>
    <P>The study to which I have referred, a copy of which has been sent to the British Government, should offer a fruitful starting point from which to conduct an in-depth analysis of how North-South economic co-operation might be enhanced.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that, through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference and, indeed, through all other means available, I propose to take every opportunity to strengthen the co-operative approach between North and South, including in the European context.  Given the many shared features and interests of our two economies, it is compellingly clear that it would be to our mutual advantage to pursue joint approaches wherever possible in relation to the development, across the relevant sectoral areas, of Community policies aimed at enabling us to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; with the more favoured regions of the Community. The need, moreover, to develop the cross-Border linkages I referred to earlier is all the more necessary if our enterprises are to compete effectively in the completed Single Market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say that I am glad to follow a positive contribution from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is unfortunate in the context of the <Col N="2022" /> motion that we could not agree on some unity between the parties in this House in view of such a positive contribution. The Labour Party will be supporting this motion.  It is calling basically for a joint approach between Northern Ireland and ourselves in relation to the whole issue of European support for the economy of this island and especially in the context of the Structural Funds which are so much under discussion at present.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps timely that we had an opportunity to have a debate in the House on the economic focus in relation to Northern Ireland.  In past years, particularly in the wake of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, there has been a high level of consensus in the House and thus there has been little debate in some respects because we are all very concerned to ensure that, whatever possibilities and opportunities exist between the parties in Northern Ireland and in keeping with the harmonious relations between the Governments in Dublin and London, the politicians in Ireland be allowed all the scope possible.  We have not had the opportunity in this House of having what I would call a fully fledged debate although many questions, including Private Notice Questions, have been raised in relation to specific issues as they arise.  I compliment the Fine Gael Party on putting down this motion.  As I said at the outset, it is unfortunate that we could not, if there was time for negotiations, have ended up with the kind of consensus achieved between party leaders this morning on the immediate issue of the debate on the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>This motion presents us with an opportunity to open and widen the debate about our relations with the North of Ireland.  That might involve taking a fresh look at our own attitudes and at ourselves. Surely in the middle of the debate on our relationship with Europe that is taking place in the country, perhaps not with the speed or gusto that some of us would desire, it is timely to focus on the relationships of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland with the European Community.  I welcome that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> Everybody in the House, and everybody on the island, is well aware that the four party leaders in the North of Ireland have been involved for several months in a historic effort to resolve differences among themselves, to bring a measure of agreement among the communities that they represent and to begin again to build bridges between the communities that have been battered over the years.</P>
    <P>I think nobody would attempt to under-estimate the difficulties under which the negotiations are taking place. The negotiations are extremely difficult and complex &mdash; perhaps the most difficult and the most complex of negotiations ever undertaken on this island.  The history of past efforts of party leaders in Northern Ireland to find common ground with one another is one of singular failure and unfortunately their attempts have been littered with failures.  On this occasion it is already clear that there is more dividing the parties, unfortunately, than uniting them.</P>
    <P>The burden of history is an extremely heavy one for the leaders in Northern Ireland to carry but they do have a number of things in common.  First, the Unionist detestation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is complemented by a general willingness on the part of nearly everybody else on the island of Ireland to see that agreement transcended by something that will bring the hope of peace. Secondly, all the parties involved share a commitment to a democratic means of progress and absolutely reject violence as a means to solving the difficulties in Northern Ireland.  Thirdly, there is a very substantial commitment to the need to rebuild the economy of Northern Ireland and to enable that unfortunate part of the world to get its full share of the benefits of an integrated Europe.  Finally, there is a sense of urgency, which is increasing daily, particularly against the background of a rising spate of brutal killings. The only way to stop those killings is to replace violence with the hope of a new future for a divided and embittered community. In this connection, the revelation on a recent BBC television programme <Col N="2024" /> of the involvement of British army agents in a spate of assissinations and attempted assassinations represents a most sinister development that will, sadly, form part of the background of distrust and tension between the parties in Northern Ireland as they attempt to get the talks under way.</P>
    <P>Because of the background, it is inevitable that the negotiations now under way will touch on issues that have not occurred to any of us, especially when the negotiations reach their substantive phases.  It is clear that the first issue will have to be the way in which Northern Ireland is governed in the future.  In that context, there is already agreement at the level of the two Governments involved that any method of government that attracts a wide measure of cross-community support will be acceptable in both London and Dublin.  To say that is not to under-estimate the difficulty of finding a new form of government for Northern Ireland.  The second area of negotiation will have to concern the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  In this context, one of the key issues from the Unionist perspective would be the claim in our Constitution on the territory of Northern Ireland, which has been described by our Supreme Court as a legal imperative. Most people in Ireland, I believe, want the Irish Government to take an open and generous stance in relation to the question of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The end result of all our efforts should be a closer and more harmonious relationship between North and South, keeping open the prospect of moving ever closer in the future.  That, in my opinion, should at least be the aim of the parties in these discussions and of the Governments waiting in the wings to participate in the dialogue.  I assume that both Governments are willing to participate in any and all proposals that come forward in relation to the reconstruction of the Northern economy.  It is already apparent, for example, that the North has not done nearly as well as the Republic in obtaining access to the European Structural <Col N="2025" /> Funds.  A common approach by both Governments, backed up by the strong support of all parties in the North of Ireland, would be critically important in turning European goodwill into concrete support for a new deal for the people of Northern Ireland.  I believe that the majority of people in Northern Ireland would welcome that kind of concrete support precisely because the majority want peace and progress.  They are sick and tired of the road blocks that are being put in the way of meaningful dialogue.  They are tired, too, of all of the hypocricy of those who talk about the community as if they cared but spend their time planting bombs and causing untold damage to the population and the economy of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We all run the risk of putting up similar road blocks.  Sometimes with the best will in the world we fall into the trap of old attitudes, old ways of thinking and old ways of expressing ourselves, and that is as true of those of us who have regarded ourselves as Nationalists as it is of those we condemn as intransigent Unionists. That is why I have tried, with some temerity, to introduce a new concept that I have described elsewhere as &ldquo;nationism&rdquo;. James Connolly defined nationism without using the word when he said, &ldquo;Ireland without her people means nothing to me&rdquo;.  The essence of nationism, therefore, is that we cannot build a nation if we forget the people who go to make up that nation.  To talk about nationism is to redefine and clarify our traditional concept of nationalism, to think of the nation more in terms of people and the communities to which they belong and less in terms of a conflict about territories.  Any discussion about nationism would start from the point of citizenship and would progress to the rights of the individual.  It would concern itself with progress and with the border that exists in hearts and minds rather than the physical border that exists across this island.  It would be a process more of giving than taking, more aimed at bringing people together for common purposes rather than using fear and hatred to drive them apart.  Above all, the <Col N="2026" /> underpinning of &ldquo;nationism&rdquo; would be that the nation itself consists of its people.</P>
    <P>We should never allow ourselves to forget that the Provisionals, and other paramilitaries, regard people as expendable, only territory is sacrosanct; there is no other explanation for the callous way in which terrorists can inflict so much pain on people.  No &ldquo;nationist&rdquo; would ever find it acceptable to blow people up or to arbitrarily deprive them of their livelihoods as some so-called Nationalists find it so easy to achieve.  By the same token, an economic &ldquo;nationist&rdquo; would go much further than a joint approach to Structural Funds.  Why not an all-Ireland IDA, for example?  Why not an all-Ireland ESRI?  Why not an all-Ireland approach to promoting foreign trade and to marketing?  It has often struck me, when abroad trying to market this country &mdash; and to assist in marketing it &mdash; that it is ridiculous to have agencies from the South and North trying to put a better gloss on the industrial site in Portadown as opposed to the industrial sites of Munster, for example.  I would have thought it would be to our mutual benefit to attract investment to this island, North and South, rather than competing at the expense of the taxpayers in both parts of the island.  I hope that will be looked at in the context of discussions taking place between the Governments in Dublin and London.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the &ldquo;nationists&rdquo; need to explore these questions across the range of Irish life.  They could consider an all-Ireland theatre company, a national library which is truly national, a national curriculum and a national soccer team &mdash; which has been mooted on many occasions but which has never been achieved; they might even consider a national flag.  From symbols to sport, from culture to foreign trade, from research to politics, there is no aspect of life on this island which would not benefit from asking what I call &ldquo;nationist&rdquo; questions and the development of &ldquo;nationist&rdquo; ideas.  In this context tourism comes very much to the fore.  How can we in the South sell the North until we are prepared to look to the North as somewhere <Col N="2027" /> which we want to visit?  It was Swift who said that the real patriot is a person who can make two ears of corn grow where one has grown previously.  With the kind of co-operation we have been debating in this motion the ears of corn can be made to multiply until they, in turn, make a real contribution to peace and understanding.</P>
    <P>The principle underpinning this motion and debate is the idea that developing the island economy would produce an entity that would be greater than the sum of its parts.  I suspect it is impossible to argue against that proposition and I would have thought that, if the Government had given some consideration to this &mdash; disregarding the fact that it was tabled by an Opposition party &mdash; they could have found an accommodation which would have been acceptable to all sides of the House.  It is regrettable that we will, at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow, divide on an issue on which there has been strong consensus and co-operation with the Government since 1987.  In response, the Government have been extremely responsible and the former and present Taoisigh in relation to Northern Ireland would wish at all times to have consensus because, as I have often said in public, I do not think we can attempt to negotiate, dictate, discuss and to enter dialogue with our fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland until we have a clear picture of what exactly we want to achieve on this island.  Therefore, the division which will take place tomorrow evening is retrograde in that respect.</P>
    <P>According to a recent survey two companies out of every three who sell from Northern Ireland to the Republic have never undertaken market research here or appointed agents or representatives in the South.  They do not have a branch, plant or office in the Republic.  More than half the companies in Northern Ireland have never sold any of their products to the Irish public sector.  I suspect that, if a similar survey was conducted in the Republic, the picture would be similar. In fact I am sure there are companies in the Republic which have spent far more <Col N="2028" /> money in developing the market in Germany, France and other countries in Europe than they ever considered spending in Northern Ireland.  One must ask why we have not focused on our nearest market.  Apart from the odd delay which one might encounter in getting there, it is so accessible compared to the difficulties we have in reaching other markets, one must ask if our thinking has been so clouded that we automatically look to Europe instead of to a market on our own doorstep.</P>
    <P>Denmark, for example, which has been so much in the news in this House and in homes all over the country &mdash; perhaps more so than ever before, and which we know has a similar population to ours &mdash; achieves sales <i>per capita</i> on its home market that are twice as high as those achieved by the combined efforts of the North and South.  That should make commercial people focus on why they are able to do that when we are busily trying to find markets around the world and have not applied our energies and our capabilities to the market of the North. The same applies to the North <i>vis-á-vis</i> the South.  It is obvious that we desperately need to boost economic growth on this island, that we need greater home sales and rates of growth which are well in excess of the European average if we are to make sustained inroads on the unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the prosperity of this island is totally dependent on our capacity to export our goods and services. It is, therefore, necessary to stress that when we talk about the notion of developing this island economy we are not talking about some kind of defensive alliance to repel external borders, we are talking about economic co-operation which must serve two purposes.  It should safeguard and enhance the penetration of the home market and enhance the capacity of industry to compete in export markets.  We need to look at particular sectors where potential within the island, through concerted effort, is greater than the sum of the potential in either part pursued separately.</P>
    <P>As I said, tourism is a very obvious <Col N="2029" /> example, it would make good sense, given current difficulties to market the northern part of this island, for example, including Donegal and the other Border counties as an entity.  We must examine this matter.  There are other examples where co-operation would produce significant results, the Minister for Energy said that progress is now being made after a setback in the mid-eighties in terms of gas facilities.  Transport, agri-business, food and the manufacture and marketing of products on an all Ireland basis have the potential to give rise to economies of scale which neither part of the island can achieve on its own.  These are some areas where I believe there is scope for expansion. However, at this stage we have not even focused on the opportunities which exist for better co-operation between both parts of this island.  Perhaps we could take some of the pressure off ourselves, in the context of the European debate and the difficulties facing working people North and South, if we addressed the economic areas where there are benefits to be gained by both communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned prior to Private Members' time I confirmed that the Labour Party remain committed to the principle of European Union and highlighted the importance of the Cohesion Fund and other funds which had been promised and perhaps secured today at the meeting of the Finance Ministers of the Twelve.  In welcoming the statements of the party leaders of the four main political parties who had come together, in a united front, in this the final week before the referendum to commend a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to the people as the natural way to proceed, I sounded a word of caution that we should not under-estimate those groups who, for various reasons, genuinely believe that somehow or other the Maastricht Treaty will lead us into uncharted waters.  I <Col N="2030" /> would not under-estimate those people, in particular old people, who believe that the Maastricht Treaty is linked to the question of abortion.</P>
      <P>The blame for this rests primarily with the Government &mdash; admittedly, not with the present Taoiseach or Minister for Foreign Affairs but with their predecessors. Without consulting or advising the House they inserted a Protocol in the Treaty to prevent any involvement by the European Community or the Twelve in relation to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. Following the decision of the Supreme Court, however this Protocol gave rise to a major problem and dilemma not only for the Government but for the committed people to whom I have referred.  Because the Supreme Court interpreted Article 40.3.3º as permitting abortion in Ireland in certain circumstances, people linked the two questions.  We therefore have a responsibility to reassure those people.  That is the reason the Labour Party devoted a large proportion of their Private Members' time to the task of addressing some of the problems that have arisen following the decision of the Supreme Court, in particular with regard to the right of women to travel and receive information.  The Government therefore took a risk when they decided to proceed with the referendum on 18 June without first addressing that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are pressure groups, including unemployed action groups, who are campaigning irrespective of the decision of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on behalf of the unemployed. One can readily understand therefore why the unemployed are confused.  When we joined the European Community 20 years ago 60,000 people were unemployed but now to our disgrace the figure is approaching 300,000 at a time when we are about to ratify a new treaty which would lead to common borders and the free movement of capital and people.  I am sure that the unemployed are disenchanted. Despite this, there has not been a proper debate, discussion or dialogue on some of the most important parts of <Col N="2031" /> the Maastricht Treaty which I hope will address some of these problems through the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Government must accept responsibility for this confusion.  The Labour Party have attempted to be responsible in raising questions about the legality of the Treaty.  We have decided, on balance, given that the Government have decided to proceed with the referendum on 18 June and that there is no alternative, that it is our responsibility in spite of our reservations, to call for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Given that the decision of the Danish people to reject the Maastricht Treaty has given rise to confusion and that the Government have refused to postpone the referendum I, and I suspect many others, will have to go to the polls on 18 June with our eyes wide open because, in the final analysis, this is a matter for the people themselves.  If they vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, in effect they will be saying that they want Ireland to be part of a European Union and to ratify the Treaty on European Union if and when that becomes possible.</P>
    <P>As things stand however the European Union that Irish people want cannot come into effect until 1 January next year at the earliest.  Therefore the plans for economic union, including the single currency, cannot come into effect, and neither the Cohesion Fund nor the increase in Structural Funds, on which so many hopes for future economic development are based can be guaranteed.  The Treaty has no legal basis at present and an overwhelming &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will not be enough to establish this.  On the other hand, our voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; would deepen the European crisis, adding to the sense of paralysis prevailing within Europe at present.  That is the risk this Government run by proceeding down that road at present littered with confusion and misinformation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have supported, and will continue to support, European economic and social integration.  We are more than aware of the importance of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We know that even the recent <Col N="2032" /> Common Agricultural Policy reform, with some of its attendant problems, will still lead to the emergence of a dynamic food industry here.  We know how important that can be to rural life and the development of a comprehensive food industry here.  Many people have argued that the manner in which this integration was negotiated was too speedy to take into account the justifiable concerns and apprehension of many European citizens, many of them Irish.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to preface such comments by reviewing the manner in which those negotiations were conducted at the intergovernmental conferences leading to the Maastricht treaty.  Initially there was to be only one such conference dealing with economic and monetary union since that was regarded as a natural corollary to the Single European Act, 1987. The Labour Party would have been content with that pace of development within the European Community.</P>
    <P>However, a second intergovernmental conference arose out of the collapse of the erstwhile Soviet Union and the influence of the East European block which led to the unexpected unification of Germany at a pace few could have foreseen. In effect, German unification meant that the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the European Community without any changes being effected in the existing Treaties.  That development led Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand to request the then Irish Presidency, in April 1990, to place European political union on the agenda via a parallel intergovernmental conference.  That was speedily agreed with the objective of containing a united Germany within a strengthened Community.  As a result, political union appeared on the EC agenda much earlier than had been anticipated, with little prior preparation on the part of any member state.</P>
    <P>The two intergovernmental conferences were conducted in the traditional manner of international diplomacy notwithstanding the fact that they were devising the constitutional framework for a European union.  That meant that those negotiations were conducted <Col N="2033" /> by officials largely in secret, with Ministers being involved only periodically.</P>
    <P>The final shape of the Treaty on European Union was determined by heads of state and governments of the European Council meeting held in Maastricht last December.  Many fundamental issues were only then resolved, such as the irreversible commitment to European Monetary Union, the wording of an ambition to create a Federal Europe and the place of the Social Charter within the new union.</P>
    <P>Some member states had published White Papers outlining their strategic demands to these two intergovernmental conferences in the months leading up to Maastricht.  But in the case of most member states, including our own, there was no such White Paper published.  Parliamentary debates were either not held at all or were very short on detail.  Indeed, we did not allow any committee of this House to examine those proposals in detail.  To some extent those activities offset the secrecy of the intergovernmental conference negotiations. But it cannot be claimed there was any widespread, democratic consultation on the aims of political union, which has led to some of the present confusion in people's minds.  That criticism is particularly relevant to this country where no White Paper was published in advance. We allowed no fundamental debate to take place.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the nature of the negotiations meant there was no scope whatsoever for amending the articles of the Treaty after it had been voluntary signed by the various governments, despite some claims to the contrary.  Any particular concerns of a government are presumed by their partners to have been raised and dealt with satisfactorily during those intergovernmental conferences.  Today our former Minister for Foreign Affairs explained even his dilemma because of the pace of the agreements that led up to the Maastricht Summit.  Those intergovernmental conferences were never intended to work in that fashion; normal practice in their negotiations and procedures <Col N="2034" /> was never followed.  Democratic consultation should have taken place prior to the opening of those intergovernmental conferences and continued throughout their duration which would have allowed us, like other countries, to have an input.  This would have given the electorate an insight into what was being attempted.  The people should have been consulted all along the way which would have eliminated some of the confusion now prevailing.  At the time a broad consensus could have been formed, which would have eliminated some of the present disappointment and frustration.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Danish referendum, taking into account the uncertainty of the decision of our electorate on 18 June, it is imperative that in any future intergovernmental conferences &mdash; and there will be future important conferences, particularly on the question of neutrality &mdash; we be consulted in the process of negotiation, before final signature, before people are forced into another referendum or being told there are no other options available.  The failure of this House to establish a committee which could have dealt with that problem is also the responsibility of Government. I join with the Council for the Status of Women and others who lay the blame fairly and squarely on the Government. If there is a sizeable &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in this forthcoming referendum, the Government must accept some of the responsibility. We in the Opposition parties have endeavoured to assist the Government because we know that is the way the Government and the country should proceed.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that Ireland should actively campaign for a procedure whereby any future treaties on integration should be endorsed democratically by way of referendum in each member state.  In that way Europe would be constructed by its citizens, not merely by officials, governments or political parties. In future, people will want the decision making process on these very fundamental matters in their hands by way of referenda.  It should also be remembered that we involve our people <Col N="2035" /> because we are forced to do so by our Constitution, not out of any commitment to open government or democracy.  Denmark was the only member state that involved its people voluntarily since their Constitution did not so stipulate.  They have taken their decision and should not be condemned but rather facilitated in every possible way to become part of the twelve, which is legally necessary for the signature of any agreement on the Maastricht Treaty.  We are pleased to note also that the French Government have decided to afford their people the democratic right to express their views on the Mastricht Treaty.  All member states should adopt the same democratic mechanism in ratifying any future treaty on European integration.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope there will be a positive, majority &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June.  The Labour Party cannot but be commended for their efforts at being constructive in what has been a most contentious debate, one which has left people very unhappy nationwide.  I have no doubt that there is a sizeable number of our people who remain undecided, who are unhappy, who may even vote against the Treaty because of a lack of commitment, direction or proper debate, which is the responsibility of Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  By and large, the contributions to which I have listened have been objective and constructive with perhaps few exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the commencement of this debate much has been said and written about the Treaty on European Union. <Col N="2036" /> Analysts on both sides of the divide have had a field day.  Yet it is probably true to say that, in the minds of many ordinary people, there remains much doubt and confusion.  For example, I have heard the argument advanced that there has been insufficient information available, that the full text of the Treaty should have been made available for everybody to study.  Having read the full text I am not certain that those who write such texts really want to communicate with ordinary people.  Sometimes those of us whose job it is to understand this European jargon continue to use this mythical European phraseology to the utter confusion of many of our listeners.  Of course the text has been unravelled and rewritten by various interest groups nationwide and is now available in factual, abbreviated form.  In my view those who really want to study the proposals contained in the Maastricht Treaty should not have any difficulty doing so by means of the many simplified forms now available.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of hysteria surrounding this debate which hopefully will disappear in the remaining week before the referendum.  It is important that that hysteria should disappear since the outcome of the forthcoming referendum will have very serious consequences for Ireland and for the entire European Community.  It will have consequences for our future as an economic entity as an island, disadvantaged nation on the periphery of Europe.  It will also have consequences for our young people who are entitled to training to assist them in adapting to the fast changing technological climate in Europe and elsewhere.  The European Community is positively committed to training.  I do not like to refer to the billions of pounds that have been available because this may be confusing and misleading and may lead to comments that we are trying to buy the support of the Irish people for the Maastricht Treaty.  The reality, however, is that between 1989-93 £3 billion will have been made available by the European Community for development works here. By any standard that is not an insignificant amount of money and cannot be <Col N="2037" /> overlooked in the debate on this proposal.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the referendum will have consequences for our young people who expect and are entitled to work in their own country.  We have a frightening and unacceptable level of unemployment. Will we be able to attempt to address that problem if we are economically and socially isolated from the centre of economic growth?  Europe has acknowledged the problem and assisted us in addressing these matters.  The EC has agreed to categorise us with Greece, Spain and Portugal, as nations in need of special developmental assistance.  That assistance will be substantially increased in the years ahead.  I have not heard anybody say that we do not need that level of assistance.  I have however heard criticism of our begging bowl mentality. The people who make such criticism, also say that we should not play our part in full European integration.  They talk about our pride as a nation or sometimes, our absence of pride but yet they expect us to take all and give nothing in return.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty is about economic and monetary union and we are not being asked to surrender anything that would undermine our national identity or interfere with our Christian ethos or with our religious or cultural traditions.  These unique characteristics are deep rooted in the hearts and souls of the Irish people who will take steps to ensure they are never eroded or undermined.</P>
    <P>The more we move towards integration the greater the challenge to retain our individual identities and the greater the social and economic benefits for doing so.  Already there is clear evidence of this trend on mainland Europe as even regions within countries promote and capitalise on their individual characteristics. They are supported in doing that by deliberate and positive EC measures. Indeed, the Leader programme is a classic example of how EC funds are made available for rural development programmes, for which I have some degree of responsibility.  Between now and 1993, £35 million will be made available under that programme.  I have a particular <Col N="2038" /> interest in this aspect of European integration as I face the challenge of implementing rural development programmes which are generously assisted by EC grant schemes.  Doubts are being created in the public mind about the future of European funding post-Maastricht. In my view this again is a deliberate attempt to mislead the public and is without any justification.  What is beyond question is the extent of European funding to date and in my area of responsibility £104 million has been committed to this country up to 1993 under the operational programme for rural development.</P>
    <P>The success of these programmes is a matter for us and, indeed, is a challenge to me as Minister of State with responsibility for rural development.  I assure the House I will take whatever steps necessary to ensure that we get a positive return from this very generous level of European aid.  It will not be the fault of the EC if we do get value for money or if we fail to put in place structures that will be of permanent benefit to our social and economic fabric.  When I recently met with Commissioner MacSharry he assured me of the availability of further funding for Ireland post-1993.  Despite everything that has been said in this House, am I to doubt the Commissioner's assurances?  He has not let us down up to now and I certainly trust his integrity and credibility.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of trust, a significant element in this debate.  The question of trust has been referred to in this House, on television and in the print media.  Those campaigning against the Maastricht Treaty have spoken about their lack of trust in the Government, in individual politicians and even in the European Community.  Which politicians cannot be trusted?  The Maastricht Treaty enjoys the backing of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour parties, as Deputy Ferris so ably demonstrated during his contribution this evening.  Deputies in those parties have given it their backing. We are the elected representatives of the Irish people who made their choice through the ballot box.  We are entitled to <Col N="2039" /> make judgments and recommendations. There is no obligation on the Government to provide funds to promote policies which are contrary to our collective judgment.  The Government are leading from the front and the day we fail to do so is the day we abdicate the responsibility entrusted to us by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Treaty also has the backing of all the major vocational and social groups in the country, the trade union movement, the farming organisations, Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre.  Church leaders have acknowledged the importance and relevance of our role as Europeans and, indeed, our interdependence on each other.  I acknowledge and respect the right of those who are opposed to the Treaty to express their viewpoint.  They are an essential part of the national debate.  However, they tend to concentrate on the more emotional aspects of the issue such as neutrality, the right to travel and to information and the question of abortion.  These are important issues and they will be addressed in accordance with the expressed wishes of the Irish people, but they are not issues to be decided on in the present decision-making process.  It is important that the Irish people recognise that those decisions, important though they are, will be addressed.  Assurances have been given in this House by the Taoiseach and other Members that they will be addressed constructively and positively and in a democratic way in accordance with the wishes of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Between now and polling day, which is just one week away, I appeal to the Irish people to study the merits and demerits of the Maastricht Treaty.  I appeal to the people to exercise their rights and express judgment on these proposals.  The Maastricht Treaty does not provide the answer to all our economic ills.  It is not a question of whether the controversial figure of £6 billion is an exact figure but rather that we should acknowledge the extent to which we have benefited from our membership of the EC and if we can allow ourselves to be <Col N="2040" /> isolated from the centre of the decision-making process in Europe.</P>
    <P>I have addressed in the short time available to me the importance of the Maastricht Treaty and the need for the Irish people to reach a correct decision.  I would like to have had time to refer to the importance of the European Community to the Irish agricultural industry. However, in view of the recent debate in the House on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, I do not think it is necessary for me to reiterate this point tonight.  Irish farmers know that our agricultural industry could not survive without the support and backing of the European Community and that our food industry depends on a prosperous and expanding agricultural industry.  Deputy Ferris referred to this point.  The Government hope to generate additional jobs in this area which will assist us in tackling unemployment, which is the greatest social problem facing us at present.  I call on the Irish people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. T. Kitt) Tom Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for European and Women's Affairs, I wish to focus tonight on the benefits for women of Community membership and participation in the proposed European Union.  However, before I do this I should like to repeat the welcome I have already given to today's statement by the Council for the status of Women, indicating that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June is, on balance and in the long term, in the best interests of Irish women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the benefits gained by men and women since our accession to the European Community in 1973: the European Community has underpinned peace in Europe for two generations, from which Ireland, in common with other member states, benefit; membership provides full and free access to the world's largest and richest internal market &mdash; a vital consideration for Ireland whose dependence on foreign trade is one of the highest in the Community; <Col N="2041" /> net financial flows resulting from membership are nearly 8 per cent of the value of all we produce; the Community is committed, through its cohesion policies, to raising living standards here; industries invest in Ireland because through the community we have full access to a market of more than 340 million people; as a country with a large agricultural sector our farmers derive considerable benefit from the market access, price supports and structural measures available under the Community's Common Agricultural Policy. In particular, our farmers benefit from Community prices which are often twice, or more, what they would get for their produce in the world outside, assuming they could sell it; and because of membership we have a voice in international fora where decisions affecting the future of Ireland are taken.</P>
    <P>Women, in common with men, have benefited from these very positive features of Community membership.  In the same way, they will share in the general benefits which the Treaty on European union will confer.  In essence, the Treaty is designed to give the Community the means to build on what has been achieved to date, to the benefit of the people of this country, the rest of Europe and the wider world.  I wish to make a few specific points: economic and monetary Union, together with the completion of the Single Market, will provide a powerful boost to growth and jobs in member states; the cohesion aspects of the Treaty will help ensure that the benefits of growth are shared by all member states, including Ireland; the social policy aspects, citizenship rights and new competences in education, health and culture will help build a people's Europe; the provisions of a common foreign and security policy will enable the Community to contribute more effectively to the preservation of international peace and security and the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.  This type of language is used throughout the Maastricht Treaty; the Community's capacity to help developing countries will be strengthened; and the <Col N="2042" /> Justice and Home Affairs provisions of the Treaty will provide the means to tackle international problems such as drug trafficking and related crime and fraud.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the general benefits of Community membership for women, but there are particular benefits for them also.  The benefits from Ireland's membership of the Community have included the development of an EC Social Policy as a result of which the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, were passed.  Subsequently, Directives on equal treatment were adopted.  Community law has assisted us greatly in developing such concepts as equal pay, indirect discrimination and positive action.</P>
    <P>The Community's two <i>Medium-term Programmes on Equal Opportunities,</i> covering the years 1982 to 1985 and 1986 to 1990, played a pivotal role in directing action by member states.  These programmes focused attention on the need to shape policies to tackle the effect of new technologies on women's employment, women's unequal access to vocational training, the impact of the achievement of the Single Market on the services sector where female employment is predominant and the growth of temporary and atypical work.</P>
    <P>All these activities have served to increase the participation of women in the Irish labour force and to provide them with national machinery &mdash; in our case, the Employment Equality Agency &mdash; whereby women can be assisted in seeking redress against alleged incidents of discrimination in the workplace.  Since our accession to the Community, the level of women's participation in training has increased every year.  I wish to give some interesting figures in this respect. In 1971 only 5 per cent of trainees in Ireland were women.  By 1986, the participation rate of women had risen to 34 per cent.  By 1991, women represented 42 per cent of all those completing training.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the EC has led to substantial advances in the position of Irish women in our society.  Adoption <Col N="2043" /> of the Treaty on European Union on 18 June will ensure for Irish women that these advances will never be clawed back, regardless of the economic circumstances at a particular time, but rather that they can be built upon and strengthened.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that the clear message for Irish women is that ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union will bring sustained benefits for them.  The post-Maastricht process will increase prosperity from which all the people of Ireland will benefit and it will continue to improve the position of women in Irish society.</P>
    <P>The Government have no hesitation in recommending the Maastricht Treaty for endorsement by the women of Ireland. Ireland has been a member of the Community for about 20 years.  Our experience has been overwhelmingly positive. We know what the Community is about and we know we can trust it as a powerful force for progress and development.  The Treaty on European Union will strengthen the Community's positive influence in our lives.  that is why, like other Deputies, I am calling for a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.</P>

      <P>We are making statements on the Maastricht Treaty this evening primarily because the Danish people rejected it last week.  The Government agreed to allow time for these statements because of the fear which exists within the Government that the Irish people may reject the Treaty.  This is unfortunate, and the Taoiseach has a huge responsibility to try to rectify the current situation.  As far back as February, we on this side of the House strongly warned the Taoiseach about the implications of the High Court and the subsequent Supreme Court judgments. <Col N="2044" /> He has refused to date to act positively in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to request the Taoiseach, if at all possible, to publish the Bill on the right to travel and information before 18 June. I make this request because it is my firm belief that unless this is done there is a grave danger that the women of Ireland will reject the Treaty.  This matter should not be under-estimated on a political level by the Government.  I join with the Minister of State in welcoming the announcement this evening by the Council for the Status of Women in urging support for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum. On balance, the women of Ireland will be best served by closer participation in European Union.</P>
      <P>I join with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, in restating the benefits that will accrue to Irish women if the Maastricht Treaty is passed.  The Minister referred particularly to article 2 which provides that the Community shall support and complement the activities of member states in the area of equality between men and women with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment at work.  Articles 6 states the principle of equal pay and contains a provision in relation to member states' activities in that area.  Overall, it is important that women recognise that issues of great importance to them are being addressed in the Maastricht Treaty. One can only hope that the Government will stand by their word and will hold a referendum in the autumn on the right to travel and to information.  I repeat that it would be most helpful if the Bill on this issue was published prior to 18 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is great confusion across the country in that initially people were told that if the Treaty was not passed by the 12 member states it would fall.  However having been rejected by the Danish people, the public are now being told that the other 11 members can go ahead with the Treaty.  It is important that the Taoiseach clearly state the legal position and not fool the people.  The Irish people do not like to be stampeded, but to date the Taoiseach has adopted a <Col N="2045" /> stampeding policy on the Maastricht issue and has mishandled it.  His original carrot of £6 billion has proven to be an incorrect way of encouraging the people to vote for the Treaty.  It would have been more appropriate for the Taoiseach to explain in detail to the people what the Maastricht Treaty is about.  Instead, he literally asked them to come to the soup kitchen and drink from the soup bowl, but the people reject that type of activity. That is our historical temperament and we should not forget that.  The change of approach at this stage may be helpful to the Treaty.  There is major confusion because of the rejection of the Treaty by the Danes.  I urge the Taoiseach to clearly state the legal position and whether there will have to be another referendum later this year in relation to ratification.  This matter has not been satisfactorily clarified for the electorate and they do not know who is to be believed.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty is not about abortion.  The abortion issue is a matter to be dealt with at national level, and we will have to deal with it.  It is very irresponsible of senior people in our society to adopt a scare-mongering approach in relation to this matter, issuing misinformation and insinuating that Maastricht is about abortion.  All of us have a responsibility to repeat that Maastricht is not about abortion.  We in this House will have to resolve that problem and the sooner we deal with it the better.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is causing confusion is the defence and neutrality issue. The question is constantly asked will we become part of a defence union.  A common foreign security policy, as is clearly stated in the Treaty, will be dealt with in two ways: through systematic co-operation and through joint action.  It must be stated that the joint action procedure extends to foreign policy and security matters but it does not extend to defence.  Decisions on joint action will involve the European Council setting out the general guidelines and the Council of Foreign Ministers deciding on the subject of joint action and defining the scope, objectives and duration of the joint action.  All decisions on common foreign <Col N="2046" /> policy issues, including co-operation and joint action, will be taken by unanimity &mdash; this is clearly stated in Article J8.2 of the Treaty.  Article 34 sets out the role of the common foreign security policy in the area of security and defence.  The common foreign security policy does not establish a common defence policy or a common defence for the union.  The question of common defence and the scope and content of a common defence policy are left to an intergovernmental conference to take place in 1996 &mdash; Article J4 of the Treaty clearly states this position.</P>
    <P>The European Union is not empowered to act in the area of defence. However, the European Union may request the Western European Union to act on defence matters of interest to them.  The Treaty clearly states that a decision by the European Union to refer matters to the Western European Union must be unanimous.  Where a member state disagrees with the proposed request to the Western European Union, no such request can be made.  On defence matters each member state has the right of veto within the union &mdash; this is something the Irish people should be aware of.  It must be recognised that member states who are members of the Western European Union can operate within that organisation in whatever manner they consider suitable provided &mdash; this is stated in the Treaty &mdash; such co-operation does not run counter to or impede that provided for in this title of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>A question that is commonly raised in the course of the campaign is whether Ireland could be forced into a war by qualified majority voting without reference to the Irish people.  This argument is based on a wrong interpretation of Declaration No. 27 of the Treaty which provides that the conference agrees that with regard to Council decisions requiring unanimity member states will, to the extent possible, avoid preventing a unanimous decision where a qualified majority exists in favour of that decision. There was a similar section in the Single European Act which was never invoked. Majority voting is possible for <Col N="2047" /> implementing some decisions but only if this manner of voting is unanimously agreed, and this must be remembered. Decisions of fundamental principle and substance relating to common foreign security policy require unanimity.</P>
    <P>Another question that is regularly asked &mdash; I can understand why the public raise this question &mdash; is whether a referendum will be held on a defence union in the future.  People are concerned that they will be forced into a defence union in the future without consultation.  My belief is that a referendum must be held despite any Government promise that there is a legal binding on the Government to hold a referendum.  The Maastricht Treaty does not contain a mutual defence commitment.  It does not require Ireland to join a military alliance &mdash; this is clearly stated in Articles B, J3, J4 and N of the Treaty.  An amendment to the Maastricht Treaty would require an amendment to the Constitution by way of a referendum.</P>
    <P>Article 28.3.1º of the 1937 Constitution clearly states: &ldquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  Article 46.2 of the Constitution outlines how a referendum has to be held.  It states: &ldquo;Every proposal for an amendment of this Constitution shall be initiated in Dáil Éireann as a Bill, and shall upon having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, be submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the Referendum&rdquo;. In 1987 the European Court decision in the Crotty case established that any amendment to a Treaty previously established in the Constitution requires a further referendum.  The Treaty of Rome has been established in our Constitution since 1972 when it was passed by referendum.  It was amended by the Single European Act in 1987 and now we propose to amend it to deal with the Maastricht Treaty.  Any further Treaties would require further amendment to the founding Treaty, the Treaty <Col N="2048" /> of Rome.  This is a strong argument to legally suggest that a referendum has to be held and that any future Government will be bound to hold a referendum in relation to a common defence and security union within Europe.  The Irish people should be made aware of this.</P>
    <P>Another matter that arises relates to the rights of citizenship.  Do the citizenship rights conferred on us in the Maastricht Treaty oblige us to introduce conscription and serve in a European army?  Conscription is a matter for national law not European law.  A number of member states use conscription although they are being discouraged from adopting that approach. There is no provision in the Maastricht Treaty for conscription or for a common defence union.  To suggest otherwise is misleading.  If we adopt the Maastricht Treaty our people cannot be conscripted either under Irish or European law, nor does the Irish Army become part of a European army.  This will be addressed in 1996 at an intergovernmental conference. If at that time the Irish Government agrees to become part of a defence union they will have to put it to the people by way of a referendum.  We must remember too, that all member states would have to unanimously agree to a defence union and every member state would have a right to veto.  For anybody in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign to suggest that conscription will occur is grossly misleading and irresponsible.  There is an onus on us politicians to ensure between now and voting day that the people are not misled.  I can understand the fears in the minds of parents who are afraid that in the future their children will be conscripted. Most of us here are parents and we would share that fear.  We are not here to fool the people but to tell them honestly what is included in the Treaty. We must recognise our responsibility to our young people.  We must recognise the opportunities the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty will give them, the opportunities for employment, further education, a greater involvement in Europe and so on.  We must recognise that as the world becomes smaller due to <Col N="2049" /> increased communication and travel it is important to become more familiar and more closely associated with Europe from a social, educational and economic point of view.</P>

      <P>This is the most serious decision this country will make since 1973 when we joined the EEC.  If a vote had taken place yesterday or today, unfortunately, we would have had a majority &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  It was only this morning, when the four leaders of the main political parties got together that the tide changed and we will now have a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy John Bruton, Leader of Fine Gael, who has led the way in this debate, for suggesting that all the party leaders come together to try to show the people that there is no hidden agenda, that political and monetary union in a European state is the way forward for this country and that the overall picture of the EC in the future is for a federal united states of Europe.  This picture has not been sold to the people by the Government.  There is total confusion among the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a young person in politics I am aggrieved at the ineptitude of the Taoiseach and the Government and at the way they have taken the electorate for granted.  They think they can use bullying tactics and say that there is £6 billion available and that the electorate will follow like lambs and will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Fortunately, things have changed.  I hope it is not too late.  There are still many issues to be discussed.  People want questions answered.  They want to know the political implications of European union and if Ireland loses its perceived control and ability to take decisions for itself. Will we lose our identity?  Will Germany dominate the union?  How will we preserve or increase our influence in union? What will be the impact on culture and language?  Will social change be forced upon us and will defence and military dimensions mean more than a defensive role?  These questions have been asked but they have not been answered.  The people got a nod and wink answer from <Col N="2050" /> the Government &mdash;&ldquo;trust us, everything will be all right on the day&rdquo;.  The people are entitled to straight answers.  The people are intelligent and hardworking and they want the country to go forward in a progressive way, economically and socially.  They are entitled to better leadership than they have been getting so far.</P>
    <P>Maastricht has not just fallen out of the sky to be discussed now.  It has been going on since 1987.  If Fianna Fáil Governments had decided to set up a foreign affairs committee it would have stimulated discussion on this and it would have alleviated the fears of people.  I hope the young people and many organisations will come out and vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on June 18.  This is the most serious political decision we will be asked to make, and have been asked to make in the last 20 years.  I hope the Government will see the folly of their ways and will at this stage initiate a more constructive debate and that the people will be happy with the decision they are making.</P>

      <P>The developments in Denmark last week were, of course, a shock and a serious disappointment to everyone who is committed to the further development of the European Community and to the specific provisions and advances enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.  However, we in Ireland will make up our own minds.  Regardless of the legal and other complications which the Danish decision has presented and which must of course be resolved, there can be no doubt that Ireland's future lies along the road of increasingly close co-operation and partnership with our European neighbours.  In this regard, it is of paramount importance that we give a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, now, to the agreement painstakingly negotiated and <Col N="2051" /> agreed at Maastricht.  It was not put together suddenly, as Deputy Ferris sought to convey, earlier tonight.</P>
      <P>Whatever way one looks at it, the Maastricht European Union Treaty is a major step along the road to economic, monetary and political union in Europe. Ireland's physical and, it has been said, psychological separation from the European mainland has meant that we have not been as deeply involved in the major political developments in Europe this century as perhaps we should.  Closer union with our Community partners as a whole will provide us with the opportunity to rectify that and to become centrally involved in European and global change.</P>
      <P>A strong Europe is a necessary counterbalance to the economic strength of the US and Japan.  Political union should help to ensure that the rivalries which have riven Europe in the past will be no more because people and nationals will have joined together freely.  The scope for one dominant country to wield power unilaterally over the rest of Europe will be restricted.  European union will provide a powerful base on which to support the development of Eastern Europe and of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</P>
      <P>It would be inconceivable for this country not to want to play a full part in the historic developments now being put into place to build a Europe which will not alone be better able to provide improved living standards for its own people but a Europe that will also be a focus for stability, strength, and peace, in the new international political order which is now evolving from the profound changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Republics.  Ireland as a nation long sought democracy.  We want now to play a positive role in its emgergence in other lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The referendum on the Treaty of the European Union on 18 June will provide an opportunity for the Irish people to reaffirm our commitment to those ideals while making one of the most important and fundamental decisions since the <Col N="2052" /> foundation of the State.  I am confident that there will be a substantial majority in favour of the Maastricht Treaty simply because we recognise that Ireland should, and must, be part of a progressive and outward-looking Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland has gained immeasurably in political, social and economic terms since we joined the European Community in 1973.  The Single Market Programme which will remove trade barriers between the member states of the Community and which will be completed by the end of this year, has already attracted significant investment in manufacturing enterprises in Ireland, particularly from countries such as the United States and Japan, to take advantage of the opportunities which the Single Market will provide across Europe.  This investment has been an important factor in the more than 55,000 increase in employment achieved in the non-agricultural sector over the past five years.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Science and Technology, I particularly welcome the recognition which the Maastricht Treaty gives to the importance of research in strengthening the competitive position of European industry.  The Single European Act adopted in the referendum in 1987 identified research as a priority for the Community, particularly in relation to the development of European industry.  It stated in Article 130f:</P>
    <P>The Community's aim shall be to strengthen the scientific basis of European industry and encourage it to become more competitive at international level.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the Maastricht Treaty will reinforce this and extend the scope of Community research to deal not only with industry but also to promote &ldquo;all the actions deemed necessary by virtue of the other chapters of the Treaty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Community research is organised by means of Framework Programmes covering a wide cross-section of technological areas such as industrial and materials technology, agriculture, environment, energy, marine and the number and quality of researchers in the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> The Community is currently implementing the Third Framework Programme for the period 1990-1994 at a cost of IR£4,275 million.  In the Second Framework Programme 1987-1991, Irish researchers competed very successfully, securing contracts worth over IR£58 million.</P>
    <P>More important, however, are the research linkages which are being set up between Irish laboratories, including those in industry, the third level institutions and the research establishments, with laboratories in other member states and in the EFTA countries.  Projects supported by the community normally have a transational character and involve consortia of researchers from at least two member states coming together to pursue an objective.  Our records show that under the Second Framework Programme over 2,000 research project linkages were established by Irish researchers.  There were almost 500 research linkages with the UK, over 300 with Germany, almost 400 with France and indeed almost 100 with Denmark.</P>
    <P>The research budget has increased from 2.6 per cent in 1988 to 3.8 per cent of the total Community budget in 1990. In the Delors II package, which sets out the means necessary to follow the new Treaty, research expenditure would increase from IR£1,850 million per annum to IR£3,190 million in 1994.  The increase is about 72 per cent.  It is anticipated that in 1997 RTD expenditure will reach approximately 5 per cent of the total Community budget.  The scale of funds available for research is likely to increase following the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty due to the broadening in scope of Community activities.</P>
    <P>Access to Community programmes is vitally important to the research community in Ireland in enabling them to develop working contacts with researchers elsewhere in the Community and this in turn improves our potential to keep abreast of scientific and technological development.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty will reinforce the Community commitment to cohesion. The new text is very clear.  It states in <Col N="2054" /> Article 130b that &ldquo;the formulation and implementation of the Community's policies and actions and the implementation of the internal market shall take into account the objectives set out&rdquo; in relation to cohesion and &ldquo;shall contribute to their achievement&rdquo;.  This emphasis will place an even greater responsibility on Community research programmes to play their part in promoting cohesion.</P>
    <P>I will be particularly anxious that the benefits of Community research will impact on the competitiveness of Irish industry.  I have already stressed to my colleagues at the Council of Research Ministers that Ireland expects the Framework Programme to fulfill its obligation in this regard.  I will be proposing at the next Council of Research Ministers that new initiatives be put in place to maximise the involvement of small and medium-sized industry, particularly those on the periphery of the Community.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Community-wide research measures I have outlined above, I would also like to mention our national programmes for science and technology. The significant increases in expenditure on measures to improve the industry-related S &amp; T measures could not have been contemplated within available public sector financial resources without the co-financing available under the Structural Funds which allows the recovery from the community of 75 per cent of the direct State expenditure involved. The returns from this expenditure will come not just from an immediately welcome, if modest, direct employment effect but, more significantly, by building the foundations in technological competence within Irish industry and its supporting infrastructure which will provide a sound basis for sustainable job creation in future years.</P>
    <P>In 1988 our national expenditure on science and technology was £3.1 million. This year it is £34 million.  Next year it will be of the order of £49 million.  With the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty this will increase substantially in the post-1993 era.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act introduced a <Col N="2055" /> significant change in Community policy with the clear acceptance of the need for cohesion between states and the introduction of the Structural Funds to help bridge the gap.  This Community-wide commitment to the development of less-developed countries, such as Ireland, is strengthened under the Maastricht Treaty.  A new Cohesion Fund is to be established and in addition, the role of the Structural Funds as a principal instrument for transferring resources from richer to poorer areas of the Community is reaffirmed and greater flexibility in using those funds for development purposes has been provided for.</P>
    <P>The new Treaty also provides for Community action to encourage the development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport, energy and telecommunications. These will be of particular importance for the economic and social development of regions such as Ireland which are disadvantaged by their distance from, and difficulty of access to, the main central areas of economic activity.</P>
    <P>The small size of the Irish domestic market means that employment and living standards in this country are highly dependent on our success in international trade.  We already have one of the most open trading economies in Europe. Exports of our goods and services account for over 70 per cent of our GNP and Irish exports are now found in over 120 countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Our most important trading links are with our European Community partners and here the facts speak for themselves. In 1991 over £11 billion of our total exports of £15 billion were to markets within the European Community.  Our future prosperity is clearly linked to our full continuing membership of the EC.</P>
    <P>No one can deny that our recent export record has been impressive.  In 1991, the value of exports grew by 5 per cent to £15 billion &mdash; the highest ever.  However, there is no room for complacency. Nobody owes us a living and competition for markets will intensify in the Single Market.  This is why under the industry <Col N="2056" /> operational programme, which is funded by the EC Structural Funds, the Government highlighted the need to improve the marketing capability of Irish industry as a priority.</P>
    <P>All of the marketing programmes of An Bord Tráchtála are assisted by the European Regional Development Fund and attract the highest support rate available &mdash; 75 per cent of eligible expenditure. Structural Funds support underpins the ability of the Government to get behind and support the marketing efforts of Irish industry.  Since 1989 Exchequer funding for marketing programmes has increased by some 50 per cent, a level of increase which would simply not be possible without EC assistance.</P>
    <P>The Community is, therefore, opening up enlarged and more accessible markets and providing us with the financial support which helps our firms to break into those markets.  We must trade to survive and the movement towards even closer economic and political union can only assist us in these efforts.  It has been said before and I will say it again, European Union should be to the benefit of Ireland above all countries.</P>
    <P>Important as the economic benefits of EC membership have been to Ireland, our participation in the European Communities is based first and foremost on a strongly held belief that the European ideal is right for us and that only within its structures can we grow and develop to our full potential.  It is this conviction which will, I believe, bring the people of Ireland to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; next week.  We will not abandon the achievements of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy M. Ahearn, for sharing his time with me.  In the brief time available to me I would like to appeal to women and young adults to come out and vote enthusiastically for the Maastricht Treaty because this is a treaty that presents the prospect of closer European co-operation and integration.  I would say to young people, particularly those who <Col N="2057" /> have a fluency and a competence in modern European languages &mdash; which I did not have in my day &mdash; and a good standard of education to see in the newly emerging Europe an opportunity to play their part in shaping a powerfully strong, united Europe, a Europe that can be a force for peace and social justice in the very unsettled world in which we live today; a world that presents an enormous number of challenges.  I have faith in the capacity, the will and the idealism of the upcoming generation to play a strong role in a united Europe.</P>
      <P>In relation to women, I am particularly pleased with the statement issued today by the Council for the Status of Women. Their statement is an illustration of a spirit of generosity and &ldquo;States personship&rdquo; because they admit having grave reservations.  Nonetheless, they have shown a spirit of patriotism in putting the overall and the long term good of the country first.  They are deserving of great praise for the statement they made today.  I have no doubt that that statement will have profound influence on women who have not yet made up their minds.  It is in the best interest of women to vote for a continuation and a deepening of involvement in European affairs.  Experience has shown that women have benefited from our membership of the EC.  In the past two decades a range of equality rights &mdash; equality before the law, equality in the workplace &mdash; have been put in place for Irish women, rights that may not, and I suspect would not, have come, certainly not with the same intensity and urgency had we been left to our own devices.  The concept of equal pay for equal work for men and women is not enshrined in our Constitution. That is a concept that derives from the Treaty of Rome.  Irish women have made great advances within Europe.  It is in their overall interest to continue to promote Europe and closer integration between Ireland and the other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are matters of particular concern to women that have been substantially advanced in Ireland because of our membership of the EC.  I refer in particular to <Col N="2058" /> two areas: that of environmental protection and consumer protection and law. Ireland's environmental laws were abysmally archaic, or almost non-existent, until we became members of the EC.  As a result of a range of European Directives we now have laws that protect clean air and clean water, laws that have created an awareness in Ireland of the value of our environment and the crucial value of maintaining a clean and green environment not alone for its own sake and the health and the sense of well-being that that promotes but also for the sake of our economic development.  Our future on the world stage and on the European stage depends on our maintaining and jealously protecting that reputation.  The future of our food industry, our tourist industry and our industry in general depends on how we maintain and care for our environment in the years ahead.  I am convinced that will happen in a much more structured way because of our continuation in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer also to another area of primary concern to women: that of consumer protection and consumer law.  There was little if any emphasis on consumer law or consumer protection before we became a member of the EC. Now we have fine consumer laws, admittedly not as fine-tuned or as developed as they ought to be, nonetheless, we have the basis for consumer protection because of the influence of Europe on Irish affairs.</P>

      <P>There is plenty of concrete evidence &mdash; not hearsay.  Hearsay is the basis of many of those statements made under the banner of &ldquo;Vote No&rdquo;.  Anybody who makes claims for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote can base their arguments on fact.  Everything I have said here this evening is based on fact and on reality.  I acknowledge there is a certain amount of uncertainty in the minds of a number of people. I appeal to the Government to address themselves to a more focused and sharpened campaign to come to terms with a <Col N="2059" /> residue of uncertainty which is still out there among the electorate, uncertainty about the legal basis of the Treaty, uncertainty about certain implications of the Treaty.  It is not beyond the capacity of the Government to listen to the views expressed by people and in the next ten days to answer their questions and to lay their fears to rest.  In the long term our future as a people, men and women, young and old, rests with Europe.  I would hate to see us consigned to what the Cork writer, Frank O'Connor once upon a time, referred to as the backward glance.  I think it is time to look forward and to move forward.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I am very glad to participate in this debate on the Treaty on European Union.  The Treaty is its own best defence.  Unfortunately, this debate got under way without adequate public information.  The Treaty has been obscured by the malicious, uninformed and irrelevent angles put forward largely by those who are opposed to it.  My proposal is that all newspapers should summarise the main contents of this Treaty in the next week or so.  They should not give a commentary but a summary so that the people can read what is in this Treaty.  When read, it becomes a much less terrifying document and becomes what it is, a most limited document with hundreds of compromises, the result of the deliberations of a committee with various interests.  It is a most limited document and it is far from the objectives of those who started out to put it together in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Government, who up to now have done a limited amount because they did not wish to break a national strike, to produce a supplement in the national newspapers for people from every walk of life to read.  When they read it, they will not be intimidated by it but will be quite comfortable with it. They will see that much of the hysteria that has been spread by those who oppose the Treaty is totally unsubstantiated.  An opportunity to read the contents of the <Col N="2060" /> Treaty will confirm the Irish people's support for amending the Treaty of Rome to achieve a deeper union.</P>
    <P>That is what this Treaty is about.  It is written in the form of an amendment to the Treaty of Rome.  Most people have not read either the Treaty of Rome or the Constitution, but both have served us well.  The Treaty on European Union is one further intensification and maturation of that process.  The Government's short guide to the Treaty, which is about to be delivered to homes throughout the country, is acknowledged to be inadequate. Added to that, the Taoiseach's presentation in the debate has been nothing short of disastrous.  It is, therefore, important that this Treaty be allowed to speak for itself.  That is why I argue particularly for a direct presentation of the contents of the Treaty in the national media over the next week.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this debate opened with the Taoiseach issuing a threat to Irish women that if the Treaty was not passed there would be injunctions in the days following as there were, sadly, earlier this year and that if we did not accept the bribe of the £6 billion that money would be lost to the Irish nation.  He should instead have presented it as it is, a few steps further on the road to European Union.  Presented in those terms, I know that the intelligence of the Irish people would have responded as it has on major decisions in the past and agreed to go these few steps further.</P>
    <P>However, with bribery on the one hand and threats on the other the backs of the Irish people were up because of their sense of principle.</P>
    <P>I confess to being seriously concerned about the outcome of this referendum because of how the campaign has gone in recent times.  The only way the retrieve it is to give information to people that they have been denied to date.  They have been fed propaganda from both sides and very limited information up to now. There is nothing as reassuring as the reading of this Treaty which is so cautious in <Col N="2061" /> its objectives because it is the result of the work of a committee with many varied interests.</P>
    <P>I make my plea for special information as a passionate European.  I am excited at the prospect of being a citizen of a new European Union.  I see that as a process that adds to my Irishness rather than diminishing it in any way.  It gives me a wider arena in which to present the unique qualities that make me Irish and that make the Irish identity important and special, and it acknowledges and respects the cultures of many other countries.</P>
    <P>My regret is that the Treaty is a watered down version of the enlightened aspirations of those who led this process. I am glad that much of the leadership came from our party, from Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Professor Jim Dooge and others who established the Single European Act procedure.  In this Treaty on European Union we are amending the Treaty of Rome to take a number of cautious but significant steps towards deeper union.  Especially welcome to me are the provisions on education, a single currency and the Social Charter.  I regret that these are modified and limited by the interaction of the many interests of the Community.</P>
    <P>As a young woman &mdash; although at 39 the claim to youth is a bit tenuous &mdash; I find this Treaty very valuable.  Europe has meant a great deal for women.  At a social event I attended earlier, the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women presented me with a copy of her statement released tonight.  I welcome very much that the Council for the Status of Women have finally said that, despite the problems over the Protocol and the situation in relation to abortion information and the right to travel, Europe has been good for women.  It has been a broader environment that has forced Ireland to accept proper standards in relation to payment of women in the workplace and has provided proper protection for women in the area of social welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2062" /> Broadly speaking, Europe has been good and it has certainly been a leavening influence on more traditional conservatives in Irish society.  It is something that women would wish to see develop.  I understand that despite their deep reservations about the Protocol, the Council for the Status of Women have come out in support of Maastricht.  I have been for the Maastricht Treaty from the beginning and I hope we will have a positive result. I have supported it because I see the problem of the Protocol as something that can be resolved in the short term while the Maastricht Treaty, and the deepening of the European Union is something that will benefit generations of Irish people.</P>
    <P>In regard to defence, the Treaty itself is its own best defence against the various allegations made in relation to defence and the possibility of conscription.  Anybody who reads the relevant section of the Treaty will realise that that is one of its most carefully phrased objectives. Many countries with neutral interests, with pacifist interests and with interests similar to our own, participated in the drafting of that section of the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that I could make a few minutes of my time available for the Deputy and Deputy Garland to share, Members who are always worth listening to.  I rarely agree with the Deputy but I am always willing to listen. I shall try to conclude my contribution at about 10.5 p.m.</P>
      <P>This Treaty is the best defence against the false allegations made in relation to defence and possible conscription.  It is valuable to read the sections of the Treaty that relate to defence.  The commitments in the document in relation to defence are most clearly specified.  They relate to co-operation in the area of defence, co-operation in security policy and the ultimate possibility of co-operation in a direct defence policy.  This section is the most cautiously framed section of the document and acknowledges entirely and with respect the concerns of countries such as Ireland in relation to commitments that we might make in the area of defence and security.</P>
      <P>A reading of the Treaty gives the lie to the notion of the loss of sovereignty, in that everywhere in the document the principle of subsidiarity is affirmed.  It has been my experience of Europe in the context of roads plans in the city council of which I am a member, and which you, Sir, and one of the Deputies opposite are also members, that Europe has been a protection of the individual's rights. Europe has tried to force on the Irish Government a greater acceptance of the rights of regions in the disbursement of substantial expenditure.  In fact, the history of Europe in relation to the protection of sovereignty, at the level of districts and regions, has been much more impressive than that of our own sovereign Government, which others would like to shore up at the expense of Europe.  It is arguable in Irish and British circles that Europe is likely to defend local and regional sovereignty against centralised government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about what I perceive as a growth of nationalism in the context of this debate.  One of the foundation <Col N="2064" /> stones of the Treaty of Rome, the Council of Europe and the Coal and Steel Union was the achievement of peace in Europe.  It is very easy to forget that so many decades on, but when one notes what has happened in Eastern Europe and what is just under the surface in Denmark in relation to the Dane's relationships with Germany, one realises that what we have taken for granted for two decades could be very easily distorted and returned to an unstable, nationalistically based European environment. We have got used to the Europe of common objectives, the Europe that sets a lead in European conservation policies &mdash; and I know that Deputy Garland would support me in that &mdash; and a Europe that is trying to lead the world in that area.</P>
    <P>Somehow our union of very varied and very different interests has freed us to be that force in world politics.  A return to narrow nationalism, from whatever basic instinct, would be a most serious backward movement for Irish politics, for Irish individuals, for me as a woman, for me as a youngish woman and for my children and their future.  I would be very concerned for the peace and prosperity of Europe if there were anything other than a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to the referendum.  I should love to read substantial sections of this incredibly boring document into the record of this House &mdash; an action that would be of value because no one I have heard speaking in this debate has done so &mdash; because most people would then realise that they have nothing to fear from it, that it is a most cautious document. Deputies who would like something much more radical are opposing it. The document represents a few steps down the right road.  With some reservation, I shall give my colleagues an opportunity to make their contributions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2066" /> Listening to Deputy Flaherty emphasising the role of the news media and the newspapers in particular, I found it quite ironic that not a single member of the news media was present in the House to hear her words.  So much for the role of the news media.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty has spoken both at the city council and here tonight about how well the Treaty of Rome and other agreements have served us.  The Treaty of Rome may have served Members of the House well, but I wonder whether the 300,000 unemployed persons and the many thousands of people who have emigrated each year in the past 20 years since Ireland joined the European Community would feel that the Treaty has served them well.  I doubt it very much.  For that reason, if for no other, I shall urge people to vote against ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  I ask them to vote against the Treaty as a protest on behalf of those people who have been forced out of this country, those who have been forced out of employment and the nearly one-third of our population who are forced to exist on social welfare assistance.</P>
    <P>The Irish people should decisively reject the unprecedented panic statement issued today by what I might rather unkindly refer to as the &ldquo;Gang of Four&rdquo;&mdash;the Taoiseach and Deputies Bruton, O'Malley and Spring.  Those four politicians have presided at Government level in the past ten years over the very Administrations that have resulted in the appalling unemployment levels I have referred to and in one-third of our population having to depend on social welfare.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I appeal to the Irish people to give a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on 18 June.  Apart from the actual Treaty itself, there are two subsidiary issues.  The first of those is the question of the existence or otherwise of the Maastricht Treaty.  The fact is that the Treaty ceased to exist on 2 June.</P>
      <P>All the huffing and puffing by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, will not get away from the fact that in reply to a question of mine on 8 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated: &ldquo;If Ireland, or indeed any other member state, should decide not to ratify, then the Treaty will not come into effect for any state&rdquo;.  Today the Taoiseach was disingenuous, to say the least, in stating that the Danes had not irrevocably rejected the Treaty as they had until the end of the year to have a change of heart.  This is clearly nonsensical as there is no way the Danes will change their minds unless there is a renegotiation of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The public are now being asked to buy a very expensive pig in a poke which will cost the taxpayer £600,000 on publicity, plus all the ancillary cost attached to a referendum.  The whole exercise is now an appalling waste of time and money. The second issue is another reason for the referendum not to take place, that is the lack of Government money being provided to the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side in this debate. The Government have clearly acknowledged that they see it as their duty to present a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; case to the public in a partisan fashion.  It is quite clear, from the information booklet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The booklet is a disgrace, it contains at least seven errors of fact which, due to the inadequate resource of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side will not be properly explored.  In any event, the <Col N="2068" /> public should not be asked to make such a major decision on the basis of a slim pamphlet of 16 pages.  The Government are not making the slightest effort to ensure that the public are being given an opportunity to make an informed decision.  What the Government are saying to the public is, in effect, that they and the main Opposition parties have decided &mdash; wrongly &mdash; that Maastricht is good for us; they are asking the public merely to rubber-stamp the treaty.</P>
      <P>This booklet has been distilled from the Treaty itself, which is over 250 pages. Unlike Denmark, where the Treaty was available free of charge to the public our Government, no doubt mindful of their good housekeeping duties, are charging £6.95 for the privilege of reading this vital document.  The public are entitled to better treatment than this and they are very angry at the cavalier way they are being treated by the Government.  Of course Government Ministers and their backbenchers would know nothing about the reaction on the doorsteps because they are basically sitting complacently in their offices waiting for the public to do the needful.  I have news for the Government, Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; they have a shock in store for them on 18 June. The Government negotiated this Treaty behind the backs of the people, they were told that this Treaty had been negotiated in their best interest but not what it contained.</P>

      <P>We have had a good discussion today which has allowed us to consider the crucial issues which will go before the people in the referendum on 18 June.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt about the significance of the referendum for Ireland and for the future of Europe.  The Irish people are being asked to pronounce on whether Europe should continue the process of integration.  The people must decide whether we approve the goals and objectives of the Treaty on European Union.  It is no exaggeration to say that the eyes of Europe will be upon Ireland in nine days' time.  One historian has described the decision facing our people on 18 June as &ldquo;the most significant decision in European history which Ireland has ever been asked to make.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I met my colleagues in Oslo on 4 June we were perfectly clear that the Treaty ratification process would have to continue and that the decision by Denmark would not bring it to a halt.  We were anxious to assure Denmark that the <Col N="2070" /> door for participation in the European Union remains open.  While I respect the democratic decison of the Danish people, there was agreement by all Foreign Ministers, including the Danish Foreign Minister, that the Eleven member states should continue the process that had begun more than two years ago.</P>
    <P>When the ratification procedure in member states has been completed the Twelve will, together, review the situation. It is not possible to predict at this stage the options that will be available to us then.  One thing is clear, our partners are determined that the Treaty on European Union at Maastricht on 7 February 1992, should not be thrown away simply because one member state has decided to reject it.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that if the drafters of the Treaty had provided for the contingency of one member state rejecting the Treaty we would not now be in the uncertain situation in which we find ourselves.  This option was never available. Article 236 of the EEC Treaty, and similar articles in the Community Treaties, require all member states to agree to amendments of the Treaties. The Treaty on European Union, as well as providing new &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; of the Community in justice and home affairs and the common foreign and security policy, is made up largely of amendments to the Community Treaties.  Thus the option of providing for the coming into effect of the Treaty on European Union with a number fewer than 12 was not open to the drafters of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>It has also been argued that with the rejection by Denmark of the Treaty on European Union, the ratification process should cease and that we should abandon the effort to create a European Union. Such an approach would ignore the fact that when the Government decided to sign the Treaty they did so on the clear understanding that they would adhere to the ratification procedure.  This procedure in Ireland involves the referendum which takes place on 18 June and detailed consideration of the Treaties by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Denmark has taken its decision.  I <Col N="2071" /> respect the democratic view of the Danish people.  The Irish people are also entitled to make their judgment on the new Treaty.  The Government will not deny them this right.</P>
    <P>The Treaty on European Union negotiated by the twelve member states of the European Community represents the culmination of a political process involving enormous political will to achieve its goals.  Member states will not lightly throw away what was achieved.  This was made clear by Foreign Ministers in Oslo. If the ratification process continues to finality without Denmark, I believe that the overwhelming interest of the remaining Eleven will ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty on European Union in order that the process of European integration can continue.</P>
    <P>In the view of all major political parties in the House, the economic case is overwhelmingly in favour of the Treaty on European Union from Ireland's point of view.  I will not go over this ground again in detail.  I can do no better than quote from a recently published study of the economic consequences of the Treaty by leading Irish economists for the Institute of European Affairs who concluded as follows:</P>
    <P>The balance of economic advantage lies with voting to ratify the Treaty on European Union.  With sound and prudent management at European level, the Union could yield Ireland real and concrete gains &mdash; in lower interest rates and financial charges, in easier access to the world's largest market, and in larger net income transfers from the Union.</P>
    <P>These benefits, coupled with the reinforced commitment to cohesion, the Cohesion Fund and the provision for regular reviews of the progress towards cohesion objectives, are a sound basis for Ireland's acceptance of the new Treaty. It will be for us to ensure that these benefits are applied to the best economic advantage.  In my view this has to be in the fight against unemployment which, <Col N="2072" /> so far as the Government are concerned, is their first priority.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Treaty on European Union concerning a common foreign and security policy will enable the member states to develop their co-operation on these issues and will permit the European Union to play a fuller and more coherent role in international affairs commensurate with its standing in the world and with its responsibilities. The common foreign and security policy will enhance the capacity of the Union to contribute to stability in Europe, to preserve international peace and security and promote democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</P>
    <P>The international backdrop against which the common foreign and security policy is being developed has changed dramatically in the last three years.  The Cold War has ended and the confrontation between the superpowers is over.  The Warsaw Pact has been dissolved and NATO is transforming itself into an organisation which is working with its former enemies in Eastern Europe for a new and co-operative security order in Europe.  Indeed, when I was in Oslo last week I noted that all these countries were present for a meeting of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council which brings together the members of NATO and the former Warsaw Pact. Now that the Cold War has ended security policies and the attitudes that went with them are being re-examined everywhere. Europe is in the process of building new structures for peace based on dialogue and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Ireland has long advocated these principles. The objectives for the common foreign and security policy which are set out in the Treaty on European Union are ones to which Ireland can readily subscribe: to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests and independence of the Union; to strengthen the security of the Union and its member states; to preserve peace and strengthen international security in accordance with the United Nations charter and the principles of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe; to promote <Col N="2073" /> international co-operation; and to develop and consolidate democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Treaty concerning a common foreign and security policy do not involve any military commitments. The Treaty on European Union provides for discussions and negotiations on a common defence policy and for an intergovernmental conference to discuss such a policy in 1996 but the Treaty on European Union on which the Irish people will be voting on 18 June does not establish a defence policy, let alone involve us in any military commitments.</P>
    <P>I also want to refute suggestions that the Maastricht Treaty will lead to a free trade in arms between the member states and that our traditional policy on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons will be eroded.  Trade in arms is specifically excluded from the scope of both the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act, and this position will not change under the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty.  There cannot be a single market in arms and military equipment in the Community.</P>
    <P>The European Union will be neither a military superpower in itself nor a source of support for countries which might seek to overarm themselves.  On the contrary, the Community is now embracing the policies which Ireland has long advocated in relation to non-proliferation and arms exports.  The declarations adopted by the European Council in Dublin in 1990 and in Luxembourg last year show clearly a growing commonality of view among the Twelve on the need for increased action to prevent the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons and to exercise restraint in the export of conventional weapons.  These have long been central objectives of Irish foreign policy and we will continue to work for these aims in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Those who claim that the Treaty on European Union will allow the establishment of a European army and allow conscription to be foisted upon the Irish people either have not read the Treaty or are deliberately trying to mislead the <Col N="2074" /> people.  I welcome the statement made earlier today by Deputy De Rossa that conscription cannot be introduced into Ireland by this Treaty and that such an argument is a red herring to the real debate.  I urge all those who are concerned about this issue to find out for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is worth considering but I cannot give any promises in that regard.  Certainly, it will be examined. There is one final point that I would like to emphasise here.  The State does not have open-ended authority to agree to future amendments of the Union or EC Treaties without a further amendment of the Constitution.  As the Taoiseach has indicated, the Irish people will be consulted and will have an opportunity <Col N="2075" /> to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to any future Treaty establishing common defence for the European Union.</P>
      <P>Women's issues have played an important part in the debate so far on the new Treaty.  I warmly welcome today's decision by the Council for the Status of Women to urge women to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 18 June.  I have had a number of meetings with members of the council and, together with my colleague the Minister for Women's Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, I have discussed women's concerns in considerable detail.  Our discussions have covered not only European issues but also domestic issues.  I appreciate the concerns of the council and their view that this Treaty, like the existing EC Treaties, should provide a means of reinforcing women's rights.  I am glad that the council have concluded that a no vote would not serve the interests of Irish women in the long run.  In that regard I should say that either tomorrow or the following day I am due to meet the Dublin branch of the Womens Political Association.  I understand that the Cork branch of that association have called for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>A debate on Europe has to be a dialogue and I am happy to engage in a dialogue with the opponents of the Treaty.  The Government have been accused of trying to pressure the Irish people into accepting the Treaty.  That is not the case.  However it is the Government's duty and responsibility to present the facts as we know them before the people.  This we are doing in a non-confrontational, non-hectoring, calm and concerned fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has struck me during recent weeks that the opponents of the Treaty have not spelled out an alternative vision for Ireland or for Europe if the Treaty on European Union is not ratified.  Neither have the opponents of the Treaty spelled out the implications if Ireland were to find itself outside the European Monetary Union but subject to its decisions or on the second tier of a two-tier Europe.  To ask the opponents of the Treaty to spell out the alternative is not being negative.  Why should Ireland give <Col N="2076" /> up its right to influence events in Europe? Why should we stand aside from a process which will affect the interests of the Irish people for many years to come?</P>
    <P>The joint statement issued by the four party leaders this morning gives a clear indication of their common commitment to the Treaty on European Union.  It is a very important statement which makes clear that Ireland will participate positively and actively in the development of European integration.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have been inspired by the vision of those who founded the Community, including Monet, Schuman and all those other great Europeans with the European ideal.  That vision has replaced war with peace, devastation with prosperity and despair with hope. That vision has played a significant role in the collapse of the old communist regimes and their replacement with fledgling democracies.  That vision has inspired a long list of applicants for membership of the Community.  We in Ireland are being asked to keep faith with that vision on 18 June.  I have no doubt that we will do so in a very positive and significant fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of school transport to the post-primary schools in Mohill, County Leitrim has been an ongoing problem for a considerable period of time.  There are, I think, 12 students involved and they wish to have the school bus service extended from Farnaught Post Office to Beihy Bridge, a distance of about two miles. The students have to get the bus at 7.30 each morning to the schools concerned. As one can appreciate, they have to travel an extra three to four miles to Farnaught Post Office.  That means they and their families have a very early morning start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter is that all these students have attended Gortletteragh primary school and happen to live within the catchment area of Newtownforbes, Longford and Moyne <Col N="2077" /> post-primary schools.  The majority of students who attended Gortletteragh school all follow second level education in Mohill, County Leitrim.  It is important that all these students remain together&mdash; and they wish to do so &mdash; in the course of their primary and post-primary education.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch with the chief executive officer of Leitrim Vocational Education Committee in regard to this problem.  He tells me he has received written confirmation from the principal of the post-primary school in Newtownforbes stating that she would have no objection to allowing a bus to go as far as Beihy Bridge to collect students.  I understand also from local parents that they have received verbal confirmation from both Longford and Moyne post-primary schools that they would have no objection to these students being picked up at Beihy Bridge.  I also understand that the majority of students from this area all attend school in Mohill, that no students attend school, unless in a boarding capacity, in any other area</P>
    <P>While understanding that school catchment areas are sacred I would point out to the Minister that there is no objection on the part of any of the other three post-primary schools to the extension of a school bus from Farnaught post office to Beihy Bridge, which would cater for the vast majority of students and their families in this area, a service to which those people are entitled.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to respond positively to my request since this problem has continued over a number of years.  I genuinely feel that the people of the area have been unfairly penalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should thank Deputy Gerry Reynolds for having raised this matter and allowing me to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I should say that the Department of Education have a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 165,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout <Col N="2078" /> the country.  We also have responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the considerable sums it expends on the provision of this service.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's subject relates to eligibility for school transport under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme.  For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its post-primary education centre.  Recognised post-primary pupils, who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside, are eligible, under the post-primary school transport scheme, for transport to that centre. When such a pupil attends a school in another centre, he or she may be allowed transport under the scheme from the nearest pick-up point of the centre attended, if a spare seat is available on the transport service to that centre and provided that there is no extra State cost involved by way of a larger bus or an extension of the route.</P>
    <P>The students to whom the Deputy refers attend Mohill post-primary centre. However, they reside in the Beihy Bridge area which forms part of the Newtownforbes-Longford post-primary catchment area.  Consequently, they are fully eligible, under the terms of my Department's school transport scheme, for transport to Newtownforbes and Longford post-primary centres.  As the area in which they reside is not situated in the Mohill post-primary catchment area, they are not eligible for full school transport to Mohill post-primary centre.</P>
    <P>It is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice but it is not the purpose of the school transport scheme to facilitate them in exercising that choice.  The main object of the scheme is to provide a basic level of service for pupils who live long distances from their appropriate school.  The parents in question have chosen to send their children to a school outside their catchment area.  Accordingly, under the terms of the scheme they may be accommodated only on the school transport <Col N="2079" /> service from the boundary of the Mohill catchment area.  That is why they are collected and set down by the school bus at Farnaught post office.  No extra cost may be incurred by extending the route to accommodate them.</P>
    <P>An extension of the Mohill service from the catchment boundary as far as Beihy Bridge is being requested for these pupils.  This would give rise to extra costs. However, apart from cost considerations, an extension to Beihy Bridge would encroach upon the adjoining New-townforbes-Longford catchment area. This arrangement would not be acceptable for the reasons stated.  I am satisfied that the existing arrangement available to these children is the most my Department can allow under the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Deputy once again for giving me the opportunity to clarify for the House the regulations pertaining to this type of situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter in the House.  I hope the Minister will be able to respond positively to my queries on behalf of the interested people involved.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight what I consider to be the grossly inadequate level of primary education facilities available in Ireland for children who are deaf, hard of hearing, for children with mental or physical handicap and for emotionally disturbed children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that there be a firm decision taken by the Minister for Education to bring about an improvement in the assessment and the teaching of such children.  Certainly it is in the best interests of all children with handicaps to integrate and mix freely with all children and with one another.  For that reason, primary education for those children is a must.  It may prove more expensive in <Col N="2080" /> the short term but, with proper primary education and later post-primary education, all these children will be able to live their lives to their fullest potential.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Laois-Offaly there are about 50 children from birth up to about 18 years who have problems with their hearing.  In the past, children from four years of age attended a special residential school for boys and girls at Cabra in Dublin, which looked after hearing-impaired children.  I would like to pay tribute to the work of the staff in Cabra.  There are also special schools which are mainly non-residential in Cork, Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    <P>Children who were attending the special residential school in Cabra normally travelled on a Sunday evening from their homes by bus or train and were collected in Dublin, returning home again on a Friday evening.  Those children suffered from deafness, in some cases this was profound, in some severe, some had partial hearing and, in some instances, the deafness occurred as a single disability or combined with other disabilities.</P>
    <P>A child who was sent to Cabra, who in many instances could be highly intelligent, was unable to understand why he or she was in fact being sent away from home.  Parents could not justify to a child why he or she was being sent away from home.  One can only ponder what was in that little child's mind &mdash; why it was being sent away from the warmth of its home and being put on a bus on a Sunday evening.  I am certain it caused sadness, trauma and worry to both the children and their parents.  In many instances, the parents and the child missed the warmth of the family environment.</P>
    <P>In the mid-eighties there was a parental demand in the Midlands and in Galway for localised education for such children. I was involved in supporting the parents in the Midlands at the time.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Creed, was very active and supportive as was the Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, in the provision of such special classes in Geashill, County Offaly and in Claddagh, County <Col N="2081" /> Galway.  They have since been provided in a number of other centres.</P>
    <P>The position is that a hearing-impaired child goes to the local national school and is visited by qualified visiting teachers who give support teaching.  The visiting teacher's job consists of visiting the children and their parents in their home. They also advise, counsel and teach the children, support the teachers in the national schools and liaise with the health boards, the Department of Education, the National Rehabilitation Board and other interested parties.  These visiting teachers are involved both with preschool and school-going children.</P>
    <P>I fully support the demand by parents of children with other handicaps and disabilities, such as mental handicap or physical disability, who are demanding the services of a visiting teacher to provide a service of a similar nature to that of the hearing-impaired child.  These parents are demanding that there be localised education provided through the schools in their areas or alternatively through special centralised classes locally.</P>
    <P>At present in Ireland we have 27 visiting teachers of hearing-impaired children and three teachers for children of impaired vision, a total of 30, whereas nationwide there are approximately 2,000 severely and profoundly handicapped children.  The Minister is proposing to provide an additional six teachers bringing the total of visiting teachers to 36 but is demanding that the teachers service all handicapped children. The 30 teachers now available are barely coping with the existing demands of children with impaired hearing and impaired vision.  An enormous burden will be placed on these teachers because of the expansion of numbers under the new scheme.  The number of teachers will have to be increased in order to provide an adequate service to cover all the children who are deaf, blind, emotionally disturbed, physically or mentally handicapped.  I welcome the decision to expand the service to other handicapped children and I further welcome the integration of children with handicaps in education. <Col N="2082" /> However, a consequent expansion in the number of teachers to maintain an adequate pupil-teacher ratio is essential to prevent a dilution of the services which would render the system less effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to provide a solution on the cheap to what is a very serious problem.  The children we are trying to help will suffer in the long run if the number of teachers is not increased. The Minister in effect is trying to ensure that six new teachers will cope with all the additional handicapped children being brought into the system.  I believe the Minister will have to re-assess the situation to ensure that children with mental or physical handicaps are adequately catered for.  He must ensure that the existing services are not rendered ineffective.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to clarify the situation and explain exactly what services the six additional teachers are expected to cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept the Deputy's contention that the level of primary education facilities available for children with disabilities is inadequate. The special needs of such children are addressed in a variety of ways, but particularly through the provision of extra teaching resources and extra funding towards the cost of special equipment.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 101 special schools and more than 170 special classes for children with special educational needs.  All such schools and classes enjoy a favourable pupil-teacher ratio and higher capitation grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is being made to ensure that there is on-going development of the educational services for children with special needs, including those with disabilities. Indeed, as the Deputy may be aware, there have been a number of recent initiatives under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> targeted specifically at the needs of such children.  These initiatives include: 80 additional remedial posts; seven resource teacher posts; six additional posts of visiting teacher; three additional posts of <Col N="2083" /> visiting teacher for traveller children; one new post of national education officer for traveller children; and a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in a range of special schools.</P>
    <P>The 80 additional remedial teachers were appointed in 1991 and in all, 243 schools benefited from the additional allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers to 945 serving approximately 1,400 national schools.</P>
    <P>The creation of the seven new posts of &ldquo;resource teacher&rdquo; to assist schools which have handicapped children in ordinary classes is a recent innovation.  These teachers will provide a backup support to the existing staff of 33 selected schools in dealing with the special needs of handicapped children.</P>
    <P>Six additional visiting teacher posts have been created.  The intention is that these six new teachers plus the 27 visiting teachers of the hearing impaired and the three visiting teachers for the visually impaired will collectively operate a new visiting teacher service.  Initially, the service will focus on the traditional groups of hearing and visually impaired children plus Down's syndrome children.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional resources and the assessment of children with special needs are among the issues at present being addressed by the special education review committee.</P>
    <P>The committee has been asked to report on the identification and assessment of young people with special educational needs; the educational provision best suited to the needs of these children and the arrangements which should be put in place to provide for them; the support services required; and the linkages which should exist between the Department and other Government Departments' provisions.</P>
    <P>The work of the committee will provide recommendations for the detailed implementation of policy.  I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration will be given to the committee's recommendations.</P>

    <Col N="2084" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for affording me the opportunity to raise this very important matter. I am delighted the Minister is present to respond despite the lateness of the hour.</P>
      <P>Kenmare labour exchange has been a focal point for the unemployed in this part of Kerry since the foundation of the State.  It not only serves the needs of the local town population of 1,100 but its catchment area ranges over a rugged mountainous terrain extending to some 20 miles.  At present there are approximately 470 people signing on at this exchange on a weekly basis.  In addition all applications and renewals for medical cards in respect of social welfare recipients have to be stamped at the local exchange.  A very substantial proportion of the population have medical cards and therefore a large number has to attend the labour exchange.</P>
      <P>According to the 1992 provisional census of population, the population of the area has increased from 5,896 in 1986 to 6,164, an increase of 268.  This was only urban or rural area in County Kerry to show an increase in population, and it is indicative of the development of tourism in the Kenmare area which is in its infancy.  The potential for further growth in tourism and the consequent job creation is enormous.  This will place new demands on the labour exchange.</P>
      <P>I am particularly grateful to have the opportunity to raise this matter tonight because there has been no public pronouncement from the Department that the labour exchange is about to close and I now have the opportunity to strongly urge the Minister to rethink this decision.  I wish to stress also that it would be totally counter productive to transfer duties normally performed by the labour exchange to the Garda Síochána as this would restrict the performance of their primary function &mdash; the protection of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of any public service office from a town is a retrograde step but in the light of the developing tourism <Col N="2085" /> industry it would be disastrous for Kenmare as at some future date the service would have to be restored.  I am not aware of the Minister's proposals in the event of the closure of the exchange but I believe that no one else could provide the excellent service which the manager and his staff afford to the unemployed and the general public who seek the assistance of the office, whether for medical cards, school transport or other matters where the Manager's signature of authorisation is required.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider very seriously a continuation of the service at this labour exchange, a service that has been totally satisfactory, which has served the community well in what is a sparsely populated district.  The nearest alternative labour exchanges are in Killarney and Caherciveen but it would be beyond the capacity of many of those now using the Kenmare office to travel the distance to those other towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Moynihan has raised this matter on the Adjournment as it affords me the opportunity of referring to the proposed closure of the Kenmare labour exchange.  Deputy Moynihan has made a good case on behalf of his constituents.  I hope my reply will give the Deputy an assurance that the service which will be provided in the future will be better than the present service.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of May, my Department provided service to the unemployed in the Kenmare area through the agency of a branch employment office.  Offices of this kind are run by private individuals who are contracted by my Department to provide a limited range of services. The manager of the branch employment office recently opted for early retirement on health grounds and advised me that he wished to terminate his contract with my Department at the end of May 1992. The retiring manager had provided an excellent service over the years.  I want to take this opportunity to thank him for his dedication and commitment and to wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, there is a growing need <Col N="2086" /> today for an information service on all social welfare schemes.  In addition, many people want to be able to discuss their business in confidence with officials of my Department locally rather than have to write to Dublin.  Recent advances in information technology have enabled my Department to extend the range of information which can be made available at local level.</P>
    <P>The Kenmare office serves on average 370 unemployed people and, of these, between 80 and 90 attend the office in person each week.  Most of the remaining numbers sign at Garda stations and are paid at their local post offices.  I have arranged that, for the present, staff of my Department will continue to provide the normal service from the branch office premises.  However, this is only an interim arrangement pending the introduction of new procedures to serve the unemployed claimants affected.</P>
    <P>In future, the existing claimants, numbering about 80-90, who are signing-on and being paid at the Kenmare office will be dealt with as postal claimants.  These claimants will sign-on at their local Garda stations and will receive payments at a post office which they will nominate.  It is intended to introduce fortnightly signing shortly for these claimants as a further development of the service in the Kenmare area.  Existing postal claimants, who make up the bulk of those served by office, will not be affected other than the office which deals with their claims being changed.  When these arrangements are in place the current service provided by the Kenmare office will cease.</P>
    <P>Before this takes place a &ldquo;helpdesk&rdquo; will be provided at the office to (a) familiarise claimants with the new procedures, (b) acquaint each other claimant fully with the new arrangement, and (c) inform them of the new office dealing with their claim.  The existing office will be manned for the week following the closure to deal with fresh claims from people who may not be aware of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>In place of the branch office, I intend to provide a broader-based service in Kenmare.  This service will be provided <Col N="2087" /> by experienced staff of my Department and will operate for at least one day per week.  My Department also have another presence in Kenmare on the investigative side and I am examining ways in which this role can be expanded so as to allow the public direct access to my Department on one other day per week.  Computer links to the central social welfare computer system will be available locally enabling inquiries from the public to be dealt with across all social welfare schemes.  The unemployed will be able to submit fresh claims at this new office which will continue to serve as a signing centre on a fortnightly basis.  They will also receive payments at a post office of <Col N="2088" /> their choice.  It is hoped, after a few weeks, that a facility will also be available to enable clients in receipt of disability benefit to present their medical certificates and to have their claims processed quickly and payments generated.</P>
    <P>As a result, people living in Kenmare will be able to avail of an extended service from my Department and will be able to secure details of their entitlements without having to write to Dublin or Sligo.  I am confident that the provision of this expanded service will mean an improved service to the people of Kenmare and its surrounding area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 June 1992.</P>

      <P>The plan for the rejuvenation of Tomnafinnoge Wood in Coolattin is a proper management plan and is not a plan for clearfelling the woods over a 10 year period.  Details of the plan and the way in which it will operate have been widely made available to interested Deputies and other parties and to the Press.  The reason such a plan was issued by my Department was because the owners of the woods applied for a felling licence to fell over 2,000 trees, and my Department are of the view that much more than felling was required.  The general condition of the woodland has been downgraded over many decades and remedial measures, including felling selected over mature trees, clearance of rhododendron and other infestation, retaining all the existing immature trees and a proportion of the older trees for amenity reasons, and above all restocking the wood with an adequate number of new trees &mdash; mainly oak &mdash; was necessary to ensure its continued development as an excellent woodland for the benefit of future generations. The plan provides that felling, remedial work and restocking, where necessary will go hand in hand on a phased basis.  The end result over a period of at least 10 years is that out of 20,000 trees of different ages in the wood at present, some 2,000 would be felled, 18,000 retained and restocking with new <Col N="1813" /> trees will increase the total number of trees to 150,000 varying in age from new plants to trees over 200 years old.  I wish to emphasise that this is a plan for the proper management and rejuvenation of the woods and not simply a licence for clearfelling, which is of course out of the question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 27, 32, 40 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's concerns about expanded reprocessing at Sellafield have been repeatedly conveyed directly to the British authorities.</P>
      <P>I have met the former UK Secretary of State for Energy and raised with him our serious concerns about nuclear power in general and have called for closure of the Sellafield plant.  I have also been in direct communication in similar terms with the former Secretary of State for the Environment &mdash; who now happens to have ministerial responsibility for energy following the recent changes in Government in the UK &mdash; in regard to the Sellafield facilities and who is aware of the Government's views.</P>
      <P>Information requested by Deputy Callely as to the amount of time I have spent on representations to British or European authorities in regard to Sellafield, and in regard to the number of times the question of closure of Sellafield has been brought to my attention in this House, may be obtained by a perusal by him of the record of the proceedings of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the EC, Irish uneasiness and concern about nuclear safety and our insistence on new control measures, notably at EC level, have been raised at <Col N="1821" /> every opportunity.  I raised the matter again at the EC Energy Council Meeting on 29 October 1991 when I said that my concerns were exacerbated by the absence of any move in the direction of independent verification and inspection of nuclear installations which I and my predecessors have been advocating under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty.  In addition, I have put our view on two separate occasions to the European Parliament. Other Government Ministers and officials of my Department have pressed home the message on every possible occasion.</P>
    <P>Pressure of this kind is the only course open to us at present in this matter in the absence of a basis for legal action, a situation on which I have elaborated in reply to other questions.</P>
    <P>I am aware of recent articles in the press regarding reports that Sellafield may not be a suitable location for an underground repository.</P>
    <P>I have received copies of these reports which are of a very detailed technical nature from the relevant UK authorities. They are being closely examined by my Department, including the geological survey, in consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the further announcement by UK NIREX on 2 June that they are delaying for one year the submission of a planning application for the proposed repository.  This delay will give the opportunity for continuing examination of the implications for Ireland of a repository, and for further representation to the UK authorities in relation to the matter.</P>

      <P>A review of the member states' energy policies carried out by the Commission of the European Communities in 1988 concluded that the Community would be unlikely to attain its 1995 objective of <Col N="1822" /> improving the energy intensity of final demand by at least 20 per cent unless the energy efficiency shortfall was to be corrected.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve this objective the European Community is pursuing a concerted programme of action to remedy this situation.  This includes programmes in the efficient use of energy (the SAVE Programme) and a programme aimed at increasing, <i>inter alia</i>, the use of energy efficient technologies in the Community (the THERMIE Programme).</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 39, 43 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently two hundred and eleven licences issued for the importation and/or use and storage of radio active substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> Radioactive material, in both sealed and unsealed form, is imported for use in industrial, medical and laboratory applications under licence from the Radiological Protection Institute.  There is no national waste facility in which this material can be disposed of after use.  All imported sealed radioactive sources must therefore be returned to the original supplier at the end of their useful lives &mdash; this is a precondition imposed by the board prior to the issue of a licence.  All suppliers are located outside the State.</P>
    <P>All activity involving radioactive sources, including storage of radioactive waste, requires a licence from the Radiological Protection Institute.  Stringent conditions are attached to such licences.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the licensing arrangements in place ensure that all sources of radioactivity are currently stored in a manner which does not pose a hazard to people or property.</P>
    <P>In the case of radioactive substances in unsealed form the licensee is obliged to store waste material on his premises until the radioactive content has decayed to levels at which disposal as ordinary domestic waste is permitted.</P>
    <P>The frequency of inspections, a schedule of which is prepared by the Radiological Protection Institute, is dependent on the nature and magnitude of the hazard posed by the materials.</P>
    <P>The decision not to charge for the issue of licences was made following legal advice to the effect that it would not be appropriate to do so under the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute will review the issue of charging a fee for licences and is empowered to do so under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the construction of Ireland's first windfarm by Renewable Energy Ireland Ltd., is currently taking place at Bellacorick County Mayo and both the ESB and Bord na <Col N="1824" /> Móna, together with my Department, are actively involved in this development. The ESB, as well as purchasing all of the electricity to be produced by the windfarm are also carrying out the electrical work associated with the project while Bord na Móna have taken a small preferential shareholding in the company and are undertaking the civil works and part of the ongoing service and maintenance work.  The wind farm will also benefit from the substantial price increase which the ESB introduced for electricity generated from all non-fuel renewable energy sources with effect from June 1991.</P>
      <P>Apart from this project the ESB is also in the process of undertaking its own wind research programme which involves the carrying out of wind energy experiments and data collection at various locations around the country.</P>
      <P>I believe that the future development of wind-power in this country to a considerable degree will be closely related to the outcome of the Bellacorick project. The further participation by semi-State companies in any future developments will be a matter for the companies themselves to decide.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 62 and 64 together.  Oil and gas wells drilled offshore Ireland have been as follows: 1982, 4; 1983, 6; 1984, 7; 1985, 5; 1986, 7; 1987, 3; 1988, 3; 1989, 5; 1990, 4; 1991, 1.</P>
      <P>Two exploration wells are due to be drilled in 1982.  The first well will be drilled on block 48/30 by Marathon Petroleum and will be commenced early in July.  A second well will be drilled on block 48/19 by Bula Oil Limited and is due to be commenced during August.  As with all exploration drilling, these wells are being undertaken in the belief that commercial finds of oil or gas could result.  In the case of any discoveries of oil or gas, the question of assessing commerciality is in the first instance a matter for the company in question.  While I remain optimistic about the prospects for further commercial discoveries of gas and oil in the Irish offshore I think it would serve no purpose if I were to attempt to assess the chances of commercial discoveries resulting from specific wells which have not yet been drilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not engage in the direct activity of acquiring seismic data. Data is acquired by exploration companies licensed by my Department.  At present there are fourteen such licences in force.  A total of 224,213 km of seismic has been acquired over the offshore area to date.  This total includes a quantity <Col N="1826" /> gathered by companies this year.  Further acquisitions by companies are planned. My Department receives copies of all data and causes such data to be made available to exploration companies after a period of confidentiality which is generally five years.  The acquisition and interpretation of seismic data is a vital component of efforts to encourage drilling activity offshore Ireland.  My Department has always afforded interested companies the opportunity of undertaking worthwhile programmes of seismic acquisition and is happy to provide any necessary advice in ensuring that seismic programmes are located and executed to best effect.</P>

      <P>As the domestic sector accounts for about 30 per cent of total final energy consumption in Ireland I attach great importance to the efforts being pursued to achieve energy savings in this sector.  In this regard, measures aimed at promoting and assisting energy conservation in this area have featured prominently in my Department's conservation programme over the years including measures such as a free advisory service for domestic energy consumers operated by Eolas and grant aid for the charitable group &ldquo;Energy Action&rdquo; who are involved in draught-proofing the houses of the needy and elderly.  The ESB are engaged in a major promotional campaign aimed at achieving savings in electricity usage by the domestic sector generally and particularly in relation to lighting, water heating and attic insulation. In addition, Building Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment include improved thermal insulation standards for new buildings constructed after 1st June this year.  The European Commission also recognise the importance of energy conservation actions in the domestic sector and many of the proposals planned under the EC &ldquo;SAVE&rdquo; Programme are targeted at this sector.  My Department is closely involved in the development of these proposals.</P>
      <P>The current overall budgetary situation and the necessary constraints on Exchequer expenditure do not permit of the allocation of funds for financial incentives for energy conservation purposes. In addition the administration cost of such incentives in the domestic sector can be very high.  The thrust of my Department's programme is to heighten awareness among the public of the benefits of improved energy efficiency and to get over the message that it is in householders' own interests to implement conservation measures.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> Bord Gáis Éireann is a commercial State body charged with the statutory obligation to make gas supplies available and to earn a reasonable return on its investments in accordance with Government policy.  The pricing policy of the Board is designed to recover cost and ensure a commercial return through making gas available to customers at a price which is competitive with alternative fuels.  The basis of gas tariffs everywhere is that the higher unit costs for low volume users are reflected in higher charges and for this reason, a billing system such as that described by the Deputy would not be economically sound or commercially viable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Energy conservation policy work is carried out in my Department and I believe that the existing structures are adequate.</P>
      <P>Many of the elements of my Department's energy conservation programme, much of which is carried out on behalf of my Department by the Energy Services Section of Eolas, are targeted at specific sectors and sub-sectors of the economy. Priority areas for action are reviewed from year to year having regard to the perceived potential for energy savings in particular sectors and to the budget available to my Department for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I believe that this approach is the correct one as it facilitates the optimum use of available resources and ensures that such resources are not spread too thinly in any particular year.  The Sectoral Audit Programme which was conducted over the past couple of years is a good example of this targeted approach.</P>
      <P>I presume Deputy Bradford is referring to the Regional Energy Officers appointed by Eolas.  There are three such Officers, one each located in Dublin, Cork and Sligo and their functions include promoting energy management and energy saving in industry, commerce and the public sector as well as providing support to the Maintenance, Energy and Environment Technology Association. In addition, ESB Energy Services staff carry out energy surveys/audits of commercial and industrial concerns and are available to provide advice on all aspects of electrical energy efficiency.</P>

      <P>The international community has, of course, been seriously concerned for some time now that many of the nuclear power reactors in operation in Central and Eastern Europe do not meet international safety standards.  Assistance from the European Community in the area of nuclear safety in these countries is channelled through two programmes of technical and economic assistance &mdash; one specifically in respect of the former USSR and the other under the so-called PHARE programme, covering Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the former Yugoslavia and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic.  Up to the end of 1991, the EC has committed funds to a total of 73 MECU, of which 20 MECU was made available under PHARE and 53 MECU was specifically earmarked for the new Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).  Actual projects based on this funding are expected to begin shortly.</P>
      <P>The EC Commission has established a strategy for co-operation in nuclear safety with these countries, the objective of which is to reinforce their nuclear safety authorities, to strengthen co-operation at plant level, to perform safety reviews and to implement internationally-agreed safety recommendations. The Commission's efforts at this stage are focused on those installations which are a cause of most concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> The EC is not alone in working towards improved safety standards in the nuclear field in order to reduce the risk of another accident of the Chernobyl type.  Other international agencies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the OECD/Nuclear Energy Agency have initiated co-operation programmes geared towards improving the safety status of nuclear installations.  The EC PHARE programme, though managed by the EC Commission, is implemented in close collaboration with the IAEA.  It also fits into the international framework of G-24 aid co-ordination, the purpose of which is to help the countries in Central and Eastern Europe to exercise their specific responsibilities in conformity with the highest standards of safety and the best international practices.  Some of the Scandinavian countries have initiated bilateral programmes and major nuclear States like Japan and the US contribute individually to this work through the IAEA and the G-24 Group.</P>
    <P>In the context of the European Energy Charter to which Central and Eastern European countries are parties, Ireland has pressed for the maximum emphasis on nuclear safety in the Protocol on nuclear energy which is currently being finalised.  The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development has also indicated a readiness to assist with the rehabilitation of existing nuclear power stations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the European Community is fully committed to the international efforts now underway to reduce the dangers posed by nuclear installations in Central and Eastern Europe.  I will continue to avail of every opportunity at EC level and in other international fora to ensure that this question is given the highest priority.  Ireland will support all Community initiatives in this area in co-ordination with other countries and the relevant international Agencies.</P>

      <P>The scope for introducing new taxes on products has been severely curtailed by EC Single Market considerations.  Only tobacco, mineral oil and alcohol products will be covered by the harmonised system agreed for excise duties which is to apply from 1 January next.  Special taxes on other products could be introduced so long as they did not rely on border controls for enforcement purposes.</P>
      <P>However, any unilateral moves by Ireland to impose taxes of the nature specified in the question would have grave competitiveness implications for Irish industry, particularly farming, and would inevitably lead to perfectly legal sourcing of such products outside the State on a widespread basis to the detriment of Irish suppliers.  Given these and other practical considerations, I could only contemplate the introduction of such taxes in a Community-wide context.</P>
      <P>Against that background and, given difficulties involved in producing meaningful estimates of the revenues that might arise from such taxes, it is my view that the production of any such estimates could only be done at inordinate cost. However, in an effort to be helpful to the Deputies, I am including details of the current annual consumption of the products mentioned in so far as statistics are readily available.</P>

      <P>Payments received after the due date give rise to statutory interest charges currently calculated at 1.25 per cent per month or part of a month.</P>
      <P>In the present case, the interest charges paid in 1989 arose from late payment of the PAYE/PRSI due for the months ending on 5 March and 5 April 1989, and were correctly charged.  In the circumstances, the Revenue Commissioners have no authority in law to remit the interest.  The Public Accounts Committee has also adopted the stance that the Revenue Commissioners have no authority to waive or remit interest statutorily imposed.  There can be no question therefore of the interest being refunded now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals to introduce a relief as described by the Deputy.  The State already provides assistance both through the tax system and through the expenditure programmes of the Departments of Social Welfare and Health to elderly people in need of care at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following tax reliefs are available:&mdash; 1.  Under Section 3 of the Finance Act 1969, an allowance of up to £5,000 is available where a taxpayer employs a person to take care of himself or his spouse where either is &ldquo;totally incapacitated <Col N="1844" /> by physical or mental infirmity&rdquo;. 2. Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967 provides for <i>Health expenses relief</i> for incapacitated (and other) taxpayers in respect of the costs of doctors' fees, medical expenses etc., where these are not otherwise reimbursed.</P>
    <P>In addition, in cases of <i>serious illness</i> where <i>qualified nurses</i> are engaged on the advice of a medical practitioner to provide constant nursing care in the patient's home, relief under Section 12 may also be allowed.</P>
    <P>3. Under Section 142 of the Income Tax Act 1967, a <i>Dependent relative allowance</i> of £110 is available to a taxpayer who maintains at his own expense: a relative of himself or of his wife who is incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself; his or his wife's widowed mother whether incapacitated or not; a son or daughter of his who resides with him and on whom he is compelled to depend by reason of old age or infirmity.</P>
    <P>The dependent relative's income must not exceed the maximum rate of the old-age contributory pension for a person over 80 living alone (£75.50 or £3,926 p.a. from July, 1992); the allowance is reduced £ for £ by any excess over this amount.  (The significance of this allowance resides not so much in the £110 itself, but in the fact that a taxpayer entitled to claim it is also entitled to claim (i) mortgage interest relief in respect of mortgage interest paid by him on a residence provided by him for the dependent relative and (ii) health expenses relief under Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967, in respect of certain unreimbursed medical expenses incurred by him in respect of the dependent relative, including maintenance or treatment in a hospital or nursing home).</P>
    <P>In addition to those tax reliefs the Department of Social Welfare also provide a direct carer's allowance which is aimed at people living with and providing full-time care to a Social Welfare pensioner who is so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention or to a person in receipt of Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowance.  A carer can get <Col N="1845" /> up to £50 (£53 from July) a week personal rate and extra amounts for each dependent child.</P>
    <P>Finally, under Section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of a person who, but for the provision of such a service, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
    <P>Health boards are not limited in the categories of persons they can assist at home and may charge for the service. The health boards consider individual cases on the basis of need and in the light of resources available to the scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1846" /> So far, the Office of Public Works has provided premises for five of the six regional offices.  Negotiations in regard to the Tuam office are still proceeding. As a matter of policy, information in regard to individual transactions is not divulged by Office of Public Works but the total annual rental for the five offices is £111,200.  In addition, fitting out costs of approximately £25,000 were incurred. The Deputy should note that accommodation and fitting out costs would also have been incurred had these officers been transferred back to Dublin in accordance with the original proposal.</P>
    <P>In general, the Longford office has responsibility for the North East and North midland areas but mapping for any part of the State may be processed in any of the regional offices as the exigencies of the work of the Ordnance Survey may require.  Sixteen staff are currently assigned to the Longford office.</P>
    <P>No relocation expenses have yet been paid in respect of the Longford office but claims for removal expenses have been received from two officers assigned to Longford and are currently being processed. Since the Longford office was set up on 27 April last, travel and subsistence expenses of approximately £900 have been paid.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of difficulties arising from assignment to local offices, this has been dealt with exhaustively in the House on a number of occasions, most recently by the Minister of State at my Department on the Adjournment Debate on 10 March last. I have nothing further to add to what the Minister of State said on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on the restoration of the Royal Canal for navigation, <Col N="1848" /> fishing and public amenity purposes is being carried out by the Office of Public Works on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>Phase 1 was the restoration of the stretches between Blanchardstown and Mullingar and was completed in 1990.  Phase 2 involving restoration of the stretches between Blanchardstown and the River Liffey at Spenser Dock which includes the areas referred to in the question, commenced in January 1991 and is scheduled for completion early in 1993.  Phase 3 comprising the restoration of the stretches from Mullingar to the Shannon at Clondra, and the Longford Branch is already in progress and will take several years to complete.</P>
      <P>Works on the section of Canal between Liffey Junction and Cross Guns Bridge are almost complete.  The works here involved the construction and fitting of lock gates to the 6th and 7th locks; repairs to the lock chambers; the dredging of the canal to navigational depth; the removal of spoil for dumping off site and the dismantling and removal of a redundant railway bridge.  The 5th lock, at Cross Guns Bridge, will be cleaned out and necessary resurfacing works to the canal towpath will also be carried out.</P>
      <P>The section of canal between Cross Guns Bridge and Binn's Bridge was actually dredged in the latter part of 1988 and aside from relatively minor repairs to the lockgates and chambers no major engineering works are planned as part of the current programme along this section. However, the Office of Public Works have carried out landscaping works on this section in 1991 and have a contract litter removal and grass cutting service in operation which has added to the presentation and appearance of this popular stretch of canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Works on the section of the Royal Canal between Binn's Bridge at Drum-condra Road and Newcomen Bridge at the North Strand together with the replacement of the railway culvert on the canal east of Newcomen Bridge represent the remaining major engineering works required to reopen the navigation between Mullingar and Dublin.  New lockgates have already been installed at <Col N="1849" /> the 1st lock at Newcomen Bridge and work on dredging the canal stretch will begin within the next few months.  When the dredging works are complete new lockgates will be fitted to the 2nd lock at Binn's Bridge and the lock brought back into service.  It will also be necessary to replace the railway culvert at North Strand with a bridge to facilitate boat traffic.  This should be in place by early 1993.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal has been closed to navigation for over thirty years and in that time received little care or attention. The Royal Canal restoration programme undertaken by the Office of Public Works since the transfer of responsibility for the Canals to that Office has effected a dramatic improvement in the presentation and appearance of what is a valuable and under utilised amenity. While the works to date have of necessity concentrated on the heavy engineering works required to restore navigation to this Canal, I am happy to say that the ancillary recreational potential of the canals has not been neglected.  The Office of Public Works has a comprehensive water management and fish restocking programme and has also prepared a detailed ecological survey to assist in the sensitive development of the waterway as an open public amenity, both for local residents and visitors alike.  The works carried out by the Office of Public Works on these stretches of canal and those <Col N="1850" /> which will be undertaken over the next number of months will, I am sure, effect an overall improvement in this area of the city and will also highlight the potential of this waterway as a public amenity.</P>

However, observations indicate that hedgerow removal is a less serious problem in Ireland than in many other countries particularly Great Britain.

      <P>The data requested by the Deputy is not available and its compilation would require a detailed and costly survey of the many different types of domestic and commercial buildings in this State, an exercise which it would be difficult to justify having regard to other demands on public funds.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is considerable potential for energy savings in buildings both domestic and commercial and measures aimed at improving energy efficiency in this area have been a feature of my Department's energy conservation programme.  Many of the planned initiatives under the European community's &lsquo;SAVE&rsquo; Programme are also aimed, directly or indirectly, at improving the energy efficiency of buildings.  The ESB is also engaged in a promotional programme with the aim of improving the efficiency of electricity use in buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment will give effect to improved thermal insulation standards for new buildings constructed after 1 June this year and energy consumption in new buildings is expected to be reduced by up to 20 per cent as a result.  The standards incorporated in the new Building Regulations compare favourably with those in force in other <Col N="1856" /> States when account is taken of our climate.</P>

      <P>The proposal presented by the Commission to Council is for a 50:50 energy: carbon tax.  As nuclear energy has zero carbon content the nuclear industry would be liable under the tax only in respect of the energy element to the obvious benefit of the industry.  I have indicated my concern in regard to this aspect and I will continue to do so in future consideration of the proposal, given the other environmental hazards posed by the nuclear industry.</P>
      <P>Whilst I fully appreciate the issue the Deputy has in mind in raising the question of a similar tax on nuclear energy to cover radioactive waste management, pollution and accident risk, I would have considerable doubts as to the practical feasibility of such a proposal.  It generally is the primary responsibility of the operators of nuclear facilities to make provision in their operating costs for the long term costs of decommissioning plant and the safe storage and disposal of radioactive waste and the provision of compensation for damage in the case of accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to liability for accidents at nuclear plants or in the course of transportation, the Deputy will be aware that discussions, which the Government have encouraged and supported, have been taking place for a number of years under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency, with a view to improving existing <Col N="1857" /> international civil liability regimes in the event of such accidents.</P>

    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> national planting is being expanded to 30,000 ha. per annum for the period 1993 to 2000.  Achievement of this target will raise forest cover to about 10% of the total land area of the country by the turn of the century.  This compares to the national figure of about 5% in 1980.</P>
    <P>Last year 23,390 hectares were planted and I expect planting this year to exceed 24,000 ha.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there have been difficulties regarding the admission of elective patients to St. James's Hospital, including patients awaiting hernia repair operations.  These difficulties have arisen <Col N="1869" /> mainly from the large number of admissions to the hospital in recent times through the accident and emergency department.  This has decreased the number of beds available for elective cases, which has led to the deferral of booked admissions in a number of instances.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that the hospital authorities are taking steps to address this matter and are making an additional eighteen beds available.  This will have the effect of safeguarding the surgical day ward whose beds have recently been occupied by in-patients.</P>
    <P>In relation to patients awaiting hernia repair operations, the hospital proposes to assess each patient on the waiting list with a view to determining whether that patient is suitable for treatment on a day basis.  The hospital is hopeful that two to three patients per week can be treated in this way.  Patients deemed unsuitable for treatment on a day basis will be admitted to the hospital in the norwal way.  The hospital authorities will be in touch with the patient concerned to arrange an assessment of his condition in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 124 to 128, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>During the years in question funding for medical research was made available by the Health Research Board (which operates under the aegis of my Department) as follows: 1989, £1,463,246; 1990, £1,421,764; 1991, £1,503,101.</P>
      <P>The above figures include the cost of research undertaken by the Board itself in addition to research funded by the Board but carried out by other bodies.</P>
      <P>Funding is mainly awarded by the Board on the basis of proposals submitted by research organisations (e.g. universities, teaching hospitals, etc.). The Board did not receive any proposals to research procedures to replace the use of live animals and, accordingly, the question of allocating funding did not arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to funding of research on this topic in 1993, this will be a matter for the Board to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> The returns for animal experimentation carried out in 1991 under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 show that a total of 35,413 animals were involved in a total of 33,966 procedures.</P>
    <P>The balance of medical, scientific and other informed opinion at the present time is that properly controlled animal experimentation contributes to advances which lead to the saving of human life and alleviation of human suffering.  I accept that some animal experimentation will, therefore, continue to be necessary in the public interest subject to proper safeguards but I am anxious to keep the level of experimentation to the absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>All persons wishing to conduct experiments must be licensed under the Cruelty to Animals Act and all applications for a licence are closely scrutinised by inspectors appointed under the Act.  There are twelve (12) inspectors involved in the inspection of registered premises.  Inspections take place with no advance warning to the animal house involved.  Statistics of the number of inspections are not held centrally.  No infringements have been reported to my Department in respect of the years referred to.</P>
    <P>I am at present reviewing the existing statutory controls in the light of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes and the EC Directives 86/609 on the approximation of laws.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the requirements of these instruments I will also be reviewing the statistics published in relation to these experiments.</P>

      <P>I had already requested the Eastern Health Board to investigate this matter and to let me have a report as quickly as possible.  An epidemiological survey by the Board is now under way.  I will be keeping in close touch with the progress of this survey.  However it may be observed in general that where epidemiological surveys related to cancers are concerned, because of the nature of this condition such studies must extend over some period of time.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Energy, is aware of the public concern surrounding electromagnetic fields and is keeping the matter under constant review.  I may say, however, that to date, international research has not established a causal relationship between this form of radiation and cancer.  Furthermore, the Department of Energy has pointed out that power line voltages and concentrations of power lines in Ireland are well below those in most industrialised countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 to 135, inclusive and No. 138 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the questions raised by the Deputy about the future of the Adelaide Hospital, the protection of its ethos and its ongoing revenue funding, I would refer the Deputy to Minister of State Flood's statement on 31 March, 1992 (columns 2474-2490) and my statement on 1 April 1992 (columns 237-244) during <Col N="1875" /> Private Members' time which dealt with these issues.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, the Deputy is well aware of the difficult economic climate which prevails, and which is likely to do so for the foreseeable future.  I know that many health agencies are experiencing difficulties in living within their approved allocations.  The challenge that faces them is enormous, but it is one that must be tackled on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Adelaide Hospital, because of its special teaching role, would like to be in a position to use all of its available beds.  Due to the overall restrictions on resources for the health services, I regret that this has not been possible in the current year.  With regard to the funding of the hospital in 1992, I and my officials have met with the hospital authorities within the past few weeks and have agreed the parameters, including financial, within which the hospital will function for the remainder of the year.  It has been agreed that the hospital will keep 150 beds open and that it will maintain activity at 1991 levels.  A further meeting with the hospital authorities will take place on the 23rd of this month.</P>
    <P>In relation to the report on the Tallaght Hospital Project by the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group chaired by Professor David Kennedy, I would refer the Deputy to my replies in this House on 26 March, 1992 (Columns 1925-1932) and 26 May, 1992.  As stated in my previous reply of 26 May, I have received the report which is being considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The European Social Fund (ESF) provides assistance towards the cost of training people, including people with mental handicap, for employment in the open market.  The Level I training programme under the ESF is of three years duration. Following completion of the Level I course, trainees are assessed as to whether they meet the criteria for admission to the Level II training funded by the ESF.  If they meet these criteria, they may participate in a Level II training programme for a further two years.  The ESF does not aid sheltered work programmes or the training of people with disabilities for sheltered employment.</P>
      <P>The current ESF rules remain in force until the end of 1993.  My Department will be pressing strongly for a broadening of the scope of eligible activities under the post 1993 ESF to include training for sheltered or supported employment. Officials from my Department have already had discussions with the Departments of Finance and Labour and have made our views known to EC Commission officials on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of sheltered work programmes and sheltered employment is an intergral part of the services provided by voluntary and statutory mental handicap agencies.  Expenditure on services for people with mental handicap from the health vote in 1992 will be of the order of £200 million.  The extra £5 million revenue provided this year will enable significant improvements in services to be put in place in 1992.  This will enable 80 residential places, 300 day places, 41 respite places catering for about 500 families, 20 emergency service places, 6 places for people with disturbed behaviour, 3 early intervention teams and 55 <Col N="1878" /> child education and development centre places to be provided this year.</P>
    <P>The mental handicap initiative also includes a home support service to assist families caring for a son or daughter with mental handicap.  The aim of the new home support service is to provide greater support, in as flexible a manner as possible, for these families.  This support could be provided in a number of different ways depending on individual needs. For instance it could take the form of a care relief service to enable parents or carers to have some free time or it could be the involvement of the person with a mental handicap on recreation or leisure activities outside the home.  It is hoped to assist in this manner between 600 and 1,000 families with the burden of caring for a person with mental handicap at home.</P>

The board regard this list as being of manageable proportions.</P>

    <P>¹ As some Community Ophthalmic Physicians are employed by more than one health board, there is an overlap in respect of the data shown for some of the health boards and the tabular statement should be read accordingly.</P>
    <P>Health boards were authorised in August, 1991 to establish the grade of Community Ophthalmic Physician on a permanent basis.  As an exceptional measure, provisions were made to enable the boards to offer permanent appointment, without competition, to certain long term holders of temporary appointments. This process is still on-going.</P>
    <P>In the normal course, following these exceptional appointments, all future permanent appointments to the grade will be made in the usual manner where professional grades are concerned.  That is, by way of open competition organised by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>So far, the boards have been able to meet their service requirements through their existing COPs and no board has as yet applied to recruit through the LAC.</P>

      <P>The inclusion of a new Article on public health in the draft Treaty on European Union is a significant development which has been pursued with success by my Department at European level.  The proposed new Article will provide much needed competence on public health at <Col N="1883" /> EC level particularly as the Treaty of Rome at present contains no formal provision in regard to public health.  Under a new Treaty there will be a specific mandate for action and a more co-ordinated approach to public health policy at EC level.  Community action will be directed towards the protection of health and the prevention of major diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancers, drug dependence, AIDS and alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>It is widely recognised that health protection and health promotion policies of necessity impact on areas outside the health area including environment, trade and industry.  At this country's instigation that draft Treaty recognises such realities and provides that health protection requirements shall form a constituent part of the Community's other policies.</P>
      <P>Other areas which will require a more co-ordinated approach at EC level and will be facilitated by the proposed public health competence include food additives, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, tobacco products and narcotic and psychotropic substances.</P>
      <P>The draft Article also provides for incentive measures to contribute to the achievement of the public health objectives and specific emphasis will be given to education, information and research. In order to facilitate the implementation of the new Article Commissioner Papandreau has established a High Level Committee on Public Health which comprises Departmental Secretaries of Health Departments in all member States.  The objective of the group which will meet again later this month is to put in place an on-going and co-ordinated relationship on public health matters between the Commission and the Council of Ministers.  Such structure facilitates the achievement of the objectives of the new Treaty and represent important developments in public health matters at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country will continue to play an important role in the co-ordination and development of public health policy at EC level and a new Treaty will provide <Col N="1884" /> additional support and impetus for such efforts.</P>

      <P>The article reports on a study carried out on a random sample of 343 patients attending a seizure clinic at the Cork Regional Hospital over a period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>The employment, marital, educational and social status of epileptic patients was assessed and compared with the overall population.  The study found that approximately 40 per cent of patients belonged to social groups five and six compared with 14 per cent of the overall population and that 33 per cent of male patients aged 20 years or more were married, compared with 65 per cent in the community (the corresponding statistics for females were 46 per cent and 73 per cent respectively).</P>
      <P>The study also found that the male unemployment rate in the group assessed was 34 per cent compared with an unemployment rate of 13 per cent for the period during which the study data was collected.</P>
      <P>With regard to educational attainments, the study found that patients with lower educational attainments were significantly more likely to have poor seizure control or require polypharmacy. A similar situation was found between seizure control and social status, with poor seizure control occurring in patients in social group six.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> I have noted this study with interest and in particular its comments on the role of the National Rehabilitation Board.  In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that funding from the EC Horizon programme of approximately £42,000 has been made available through the board to the Irish Epilepsy Association to support a training initiative.  In addition, persons suffering from epilepsy who are registered with the board and who are seeking employment will be considered for vocational advice and guidance.</P>

      <P>The scientific evidence in relation to global warming has recently been reviewed in detail by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body established to advise on such matters.  The broad conclusion is that recent research does not affect the fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse effect and either confirms, or does not justify alteration of, the major conclusions of earlier work by IPCC, including its belief that emissions from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>IPCC developed a number of scenarios for possible trends in emissions of greenhouse gases over the next century in the absence of new control measures beyond those already adopted.  On this basis, IPCC estimates that there could be a consequent global mean temperature increase ranging from 1.5ºC to 3.5ºC by the year 2100 before possible cooling effects of stratospheric ozone depletion and sulphate aerosols are taken into account.  The principal gas implicated in such warming is carbon dioxide followed by chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxide.</P>
      <P>Many uncertainties remain in predictions regarding the timing, magnitude and regional patterns of climate change. Research continues worldwide on global warming and the role of the various gases.  I am satisfied, nevertheless, that the evidence now available justifies precautionary action.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Incineration of hazardous waste</i>
      </P>
      <P>A draft Directive on the incineration of hazardous wastes provides for the licensing of all relevant plant and specifies appropriate operating conditions and emission limit values.  Consideration by the Council of Ministers of the draft Directive is at a preliminary stage and amendments are likely before a Directive can be adopted.  The implications for Ireland are being considered as the draft is processed.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Landfill of waste</i>
      </P>
      <P>The primary objective of the proposal for a Council Directive on the landfill of waste is to harmonize, in all Member States, the environmental and technical standards for the landfill of waste to ensure a high level of protection for the environment and particularly for the soil and groundwater resources.  Consideration by the Council of Ministers of the proposed Directive is at a preliminary stage and amendments are likely before a Directive can be adopted.  The implications for Ireland are being considered as the draft is processed.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Control of shipments of waste</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal for a Council Regulation on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into, and out of the EC is being progressed by the Environment Council.  The draft Regulation would amend and replace existing Community law on the control of movements of hazardous waste and give effect to the <Col N="1893" /> commitments made by the Community under the Basel Convention on transboundary waste movements and the provision of the Fourth Lomé Convention prohibiting exports of Community waste to African, Caribbean and Pacific States.  The proposed Regulation has no major implications for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1991 provide that, with the exception of 100 new taxi licences which were authorised to be granted in respect of the Dublin taximeter area, no small public service vehicle licences may be granted with effect from the date on which those regulations came into effect (viz. 24th October, 1991).  This restriction will be re-examined in the light of the report of the committee which carried out a review of the law applying to the operation of small public service vehicles.  I intend to make early decisions on a number of priority issues arising from that report and I am arranging to have the report printed and published as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Hisbollah militants, supported by Syria and Iran, are being allowed by the UN to set up positions in UN-patrolled areas of South Lebanon to launch attacks into Israel from which comes retaliation attacks to the endangerment of UN troops, and in particular Irish troops, after which protests then follow by the Irish Government and the UN to the Israeli authorities; if any protests have been made to the Governments of Syria and Iran against their State support for the attacks against Israel in the first place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">

      <P>It is not the case that the United Nations permit Hisbollah militants or any other armed elements to set up positions inside the UNIFIL area of deployment in South Lebanon.  It is United Nations policy to prevent attempts by any armed elements to use that area for the purpose of conducting military operations of any kind.  Despite UNIFIL's best efforts, however, armed attacks do occasionally occur there.  Most of these attacks are directed at targets in the Israeli-occupied zone of South Lebanon. These actions in turn result in retaliatory attacks by Israeli forces and the Israeli-sponsored militia operating in South Lebanon.  Any actions which imperil the lives and safety of Irish UNIFIL personnel, by whomsoever carried out, are totally unacceptable to the Government.</P>
      <P>Government practice is to express concern as circumstances warrant to any country with interests or influence in the region, including the countries mentioned in the Deputy's question.  Where it can be clearly established that a country's actions cause or contribute to loss of life or injury to Defence Forces personnel while on UN service in South Lebanon, the Government invariably protest to that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It remains the Government's firm position that Israel should comply with the terms of Security Council Resolution 425 and withdraw fully from South Lebanon. Its continued military occupation of the area has the effect of preventing UNIFIL from discharging its mandate fully and it <Col N="1901" /> is taken as a provocation by local armed elements.</P>

      <P>As part of arrangements made in 1986 for implementing EC Directive 79/7 on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security, the then Government put in place a number of temporary alleviating payments.  The purpose of these payments was to reduce the impact of losses arising where a spouse no longer qualified as an adult dependant.</P>
      <P>These alleviating payments, initially £20 per week for a person whose spouse was receiving a social welfare payment in her own right and £10 per week plus half rate increases for children where the spouse has income of over £50 per week from employment, were made from November 1986 for a period of one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1987, the Government decided to continue the alleviating payments beyond the twelve month period set by the previous Government but they would be phased out over a period of time. Phasing out began in 1988 with the payments being gradually reduced each year <Col N="1908" /> to their present levels of £12 and £6. As announced in context of this year's budget, the Government have approved the introduction of retrospective legislation arising from the delay by the then Government in implementing the 1979 Directive.  Accordingly, married women who were affected by the delay will have equal treatment arrangements applied to them retrospectively from the deadline for implementation of the Directive, December 1984, to the actual dates of implementation in May and November 1986.  £22m have been provided in 1992 for these payments which will be made on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994.</P>
    <P>However, arising from recent decisions of the European Court of Justice, it has emerged that the alleviating payments, which offset the effects of the equal treatment legislation, are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment and cannot be continued.  These payments are being discontinued therefore with effect from 30 July 1992, coinciding with the date of implementation of this year's Budget increases.  Many of the families affected by the discontinuance of these payments will be entitled to payments under the retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>The retrospective legislation which is being provided for by way of statutory instrument under the European Communities Act will be made within the next few days and full details of the overall package will be announced at that time.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to Unemployment Benefit is subject to the condition <i>inter alia</i>, that a person must have at least 39 contributions paid at the <Col N="1911" /> appropriate rate since entry into insurance.  According to the Department's records the person concerned has only 26 contributions paid at the appropriate rate to provide cover for Unemployment Benefit since she entered insurance in June 1989.  She is not entitled, therefore, to Unemployment Benefit in respect of her claim made on 3 December 1991.  Due to an oversight at the Department's Local Office she was not notified that her claim was disallowed. This is regretted.  Arrangements are now being made to issue her with a formal notification of the disallowance.</P>
      <P>She also made an application for Unemployment Assistance on 3 December 1991.  Following investigation a deciding officer assessed her means at £38.62 a week derived from the value of board and lodgings in her parents' home. Accordingly this leaves her entitled to payment of Unemployment Assistance at the weekly rate of £11.30.  Further weekly payments will continue to be made to her as they fall due.</P>
      <P>As it appears from the Deputy's question that the person concerned is dissatisfied with the decision given by a deciding officer in relation to her claim for Unemployment Assistance, I am arranging to have the question accepted as an application to appeal.</P>

      <P>The only provision of the Act under which assistance can be given to a person who is working is Section 213 which allows a Health Board to make special payments, in cases of extremely urgent need.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
      <P>The Lone Parent Allowance scheme which was introduced in 1990, aims at providing income support for all lone parents, irrespective of the circumstances which gave rise to their lone parenthood. Therefore, if a person leaves their spouse or the family home voluntarily, this factor is of no consequence in determining entitlement to Lone Parent Allowance. However, the person must satisfy the other conditions of the scheme.  Applicants for Lone Parent's Allowance are not obliged to provide any information relating to the circumstances which lead to their separation.</P>
      <P>Applicants for Deserted Wife's Benefit or Allowance are obliged to provide evidence relating to the circumstances of the desertion.  If an applicant leaves voluntarily, without establishing a good cause for so doing, she may not satisfy the criterion for desertion.  There is no automatic entitlement to a desertion payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department adjudicates on these matters based mainly on the information supplied by the applicant and her spouse. All claims are decided by a Deciding Officer.  In any case where a client is refused payment, she is advised of her right of appeal.  Appeals are heard by an <Col N="1915" /> Appeals Officer who is a member of the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
