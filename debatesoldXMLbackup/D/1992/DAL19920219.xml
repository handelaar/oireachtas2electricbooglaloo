      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3, 12, 15, 16, 4, 5 and 17.  It is also proposed that No. 12 shall be decided without debate.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 24.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that despite media reports no approaches have been made to me, at least, as one of the leaders of the Opposition parties about any meeting, as suggested by him yesterday, and four approaches were made by the Fine Gael Whip to the Government Whip?  May I ask the Taoiseach if he is proposing to have such a meeting and if he has considered the three proposals I made to him as being prior agreements in advance of the meeting?</P>

      <P>As I understand it the Government Whip was in touch with the Fine Gael Whip yesterday evening to say that my private secretary would be in touch.  I understand from him &mdash; I checked before I came into the House &mdash; that slots have been offered to the various party leaders.</P>

      <P>No.  I should like to inform the Taoiseach that no communication has been made to my office in regard to time slots despite the fact that, obviously, the Government have been briefing the newspapers on the matter which seems to suggest an optics approach to this matter rather than one of substance.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful for the invitation to attend the meeting at 4.45 p.m. today which was communicated to me at about 10 o'clock this morning.  May I ask the Taoiseach if some Government discussion has taken place in relation to a possible referendum because of the statement made by the Minister for Energy?  Is that the result of a discussion between the parties in Government or was the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, making a statement on his own behalf?</P>

      <P>I wish to inquire about proposed legislation in the Programme for Government.  It arises indirectly from a comment by the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday of nods and winks with regard to the implementation of the law by the Attorney General.  The Taoiseach indicated he did not believe the people of the country wanted or deserved a situation of nods and winks in the application of the law.  The Government claimed before the European Court, not too long ago, in the Norris case that the Attorney General would, in fact, ignore the law in regard to the 1861 Act.</P>

In relation to the invitation the Taoiseach extended yesterday, will he be representing at the discussions the full Government interest in the matter or will the Progressive Democrats engage in separate discussions on the issue? In regard to the legislative programme is the Taoiseach aware that the Child Care Act, passed by this House in July 1991, has not yet become operative and that large numbers of children are at risk due to the fact that it has not become operative? Can he indicate when the necessary orders will be placed before this House, a matter of urgency, to enable the Minister for Health to protect children?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 6, but in Part I, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas, the report of any enquiry or investigation which he orders to be conducted under this Act, or other enabling legislation.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me first offer my congratulations to the new Minister for the Marine on his appointment.  In the debate on Second Stage I referred to a number of inquiries which apparently were still under way, the reports of which have not been published. I am referring in particular to some of the inquiries conducted into the tragic deaths of fishermen at sea.  We usually find after each tragedy of this kind that an inquiry of some sort is ordered but very rarely is the report of such an inquiry actually published.  The one exception was the report on the Ballycotton tragedy.  It was widely appreciated that that report was published but the report of the earlier inquiry, which led to the tribunal eventually being established, was not published.  It is a matter of public <Col N="2332" /> importance that such reports be published.</P>
    <P>There is a current inquiry regarding the collision of the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> at the mouth of Dublin Port and so far there has been no indication that the report will be published.  It is important that such reports are published and the formula which I propose in this amendment is that the reports of such inquiries should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If an incident is sufficiently serious to warrant the Minister establishing an inquiry and the investment of public funds in trying to find out what happened, then the report of the inquiry should be brought before the House so that Members can examine it.  It is the very least that should be done regardless of whether the report is subsequently printed for a wider distribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's appointment to the Department of the Marine and I hope to work constructively with him in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Gilmore because it is usually public outcry which causes an inquiry to be held.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the inquiry into the Ballycotton tragedy was set up as a result of an outcry by relatives. The Minister's predecessor said that reports of inquiries would not be made public in order to protect relatives. However, more often than not, it is the relatives who demand an inquiry and reports should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that we can learn from mistakes.  As a result of each inquiry there are lessons to be learned and we should be given an opportunity to discuss reports so that we learn from failures and prevent further accidents at sea.</P>
      <P>Many fishermen feel that inquiries of this nature are necessary and their organisations are very anxious that reports of inquiries are made public or laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that we take precautionary measures in future to avoid accidents.  I will listen attentively to what the Minister says in this regard and I ask him to give it his consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Gilmore for tabling this amendment, which I support, because as Deputies Gilmore and O'Sullivan said, this has been the subject of an ongoing debate between the spokespersons on this side of the House and the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gilmore said, this is not just a matter of public funds being spent but a matter of public interest.  As we have said in the House before, when public inquiries in this area have been aired and debated much has been learned from them.  Nobody wishes to have a public inquiry report published to lay blame but to learn and build from it.  It is only through public debate, particularly in this House, that we can do so. Even more important, as we have also discovered, is that not alone do the recommendations and what we learn from these reports aid and guide the Department, but they allow a monitoring to be set up in which we can all participate and act upon, which is very important.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Woods, to this portfolio.  In my dealings with him in his other ministry he has shown an openness, not just to reform but to discussion, across the Chamber with his Opposition spokesperson.  I look forward to the same participation and sharing in his present ministry.  In that regard, will the Minister let us know whether he can give us a definite decision whether the report of the public inquiry into the tragic events of the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> is being finalised and if it will be published soon so that we can learn and build as a result?  There were many worrying aspects in regard to that accident which we need to know and act upon as quickly as possible.  The former Minister, Deputy Wilson, indicated that he was seriously thinking of allowing the report to be published. This needs to be done as it is a matter of the greatest urgency.</P>
      <P>I should like to think that the Minister, in accepting this amendment tabled by Deputy Gilmore and supported by the rest of the House, would continue his good record of participation across the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their good wishes and I will try to be as frank and open as I can.  I am also anxious to provide as much information as possible as the basis for our progress in the House.  I think Deputies know I rely quite heavily on discussions in the House and use them to the utmost subsequently.</P>
      <P>I should like to say two things in regard to this amendment.  First, there is no provision in this legislation for the conduct of an inquiry or investigation.  The Deputy tabled the amendment because he is interested in having these inquiries made public, which is obviously worthwhile, and I will support him in that in so far as it is possible because there are legal constraints relating to the conduct and information in the inquiry and to any proceedings which may arise from it.  I would be very keen to have a report of any inquiry or investigation made public and laid on the table of the House. Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan mentioned making a report public or laying it on the table of the House but, when it is laid on the table of the House, it is public.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the question of reports, particularly in relation to the tragic accident in which the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> was involved. It is in that connection I wish to make my second point.  At 11 a.m. today I will be issuing a statement in relation to the <i>mv Kilkenny.</i>  I will now read it for the House.  If the debate had commenced earlier I would have read the statement earlier.  The information contained in the statement has been conveyed to the relatives of the deceased in advance.  The statement relates to the collision in Dublin Bay and is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 22nd of November last, the day following the collision between the <i>mv Hasselwerder</i> and the <i>mv Kilkenny</i>, the Tánaiste and the then Minister for the Marine, Mr. John P. Wilson, TD, ordered a Preliminary Inquiry under Section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  This investigation will be completed shortly and a full report will be made to the Minister for the <Col N="2335" /> Marine, Dr. Michael Woods, TD, at that stage.</P>
    <P>The collision between the two vessels resulted in the death of three crew members of the <i>mv Kilkenny.</i>  Preliminary findings indicated that the matter required investigation by the Garda Síochána and the papers have accordingly been referred to the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>When their investigation is completed, the Garda authorities will decide whether or not a file should be sent to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister is advised that it would be inappropriate for him to comment further at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also been legally advised that, in view of the Garda investigation, it would be inappropriate to publish a report based on the inquiry under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, at this stage.  The Minister hopes, subject to legal considerations, to be in a position to publish a report of the Department of the Marine inquiry when the legal processes have been completed.</P>
    <P>That is all I intend to say about the matter here.  I felt that I should make the statement on the present stage of the investigation available to the House this morning.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Barnes about monitoring and the need to act on reports, I will be very anxious, within the resources and powers available to me, to act upon reports as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment proposes to amend the 1894 Act.  It would not be appropriate to include such an amendment in this Bill in any event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the amendment afforded the Minister an opportunity to make a statement to the House on the accident involving the <i>mv Kilkenny.</i>  I thank the Minister for <Col N="2336" /> making that statement.  I appreciate and understand that as the information which is available to him through that report has been sent to the Garda Síochána and the Garda Commissioner and that there is a question about whether it might be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, it would not be appropriate for him or any other Member to comment on it in detail.  I thank the Minister for stating that when the legal side of this affair has been completed he will publish the report of the inquiry because the public want to know how, with all the modern communications and modern technology now available to large vessels, two large vessels collided at the mouth of Dublin Bay.</P>
      <P>There was another collision in Dublin Bay some years ago into which an inquiry was to be conducted.  Ironically, that collision, too, took place in much the same area.  To date, the report of that inquiry has not been made public.  There are matters of general public interest and matters relating to navigation in the Dublin Bay area which we need to know about and which I believe the publication of these reports would make available to us.  I hope the Garda investigation will not take too long and that the Minister will be in a position to publish the report as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to make available the report of any inquiry carried out by his Department. That is a departure from the Department's traditional practice.  As I said previously, it has been the practice that, where inquiries have been conducted, particularly in relation to tragedies involving fishermen, those reports have not been made available.  I understand and appreciate that very often there is a sensitivity, particularly as regards the relatives of the deceased, about making public the circumstances and results of the investigations and so on, however, it has to be said that very often the relatives of the deceased wish the information to be made available.  There is a responsibility on the rest of seafaring population and on the general public to learn from tragedies and the only way those lessons can be learned is if the information made <Col N="2337" /> available to the Minister is also made available to the public so that we will know what happened, why it happened and what steps can be taken to prevent such accidents in the future.  This is a matter of public interest.</P>
    <P>I accept the point that Minister made about my amendment in the sense that there is no specific reference in the Bill to the Minister establishing an inquiry. However, this is a new Merchant Shipping Bill and relates to the existing merchant shipping legislation.  It seems ironic that legislation enacted 100 years ago enables the Minister to establish an inquiry, but 100 years later when we attempt to amend that legislation by providing that the results of any such inquiries be made public, we are told the 1992 version of the legislation does not make provision for carrying out an inquiry.</P>
    <P>In view of the Minister's commitment to publish and make available the results of inquiries, I ask him to give further consideration to my amendment and build it into the legislation.  While I accept the Minister's commitment that he will be willing to make reports available, that may not be as in the case of every Minister. I do not think we can allow a situation where the policy in relation to making reports available varies from Minister to Minister.</P>
    <P>A provision to make reports available should be included in the legislation, even if it has to be qualified by references to legal constraints, to constraints related to the needs of the relatives of the decreased and so on.  That is fair enough. However, the principle of the reports of inquiries being made available should be enshrined in legislation and it should not depend on the Minister of the day whether he is in favour of publishing a report or keeping it private.</P>
    <P>I accept that my amendment may need to be refined.  I would be quite happy if the Minister considered introducing an amendment on Report Stage to meet the qualifications he put on my amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the statement to the House today with regard to the tragic accident in Dublin Bay, to which all <Col N="2338" /> of us have referred.  Like my colleagues, I understand that we shall have to await referral of some of the documents to the Garda.  Because of the worrying aspects of this accident I hope the Minister will ensure that the report is processed as quickly as possible.  I would like to think that legal technicalities or difficulties will not preclude us from having an open debate on the matter, taking all the parameters into consideration.  We all look forward to such a debate.  I welcome the Minister's assurances that the report will be published and laid before the House as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the updating of the safety provisions in the Bill.  The previous Minister in his introduction to the Bill stated that fines for offences have been derisory and out of date.  We commend the Minister and the staff in his Department for updating the provisions in this regard.  A great number of shipping acts are well over a century old and are totally out of date as regards penalties.  We are living in a completely different climate now and these provisions need to be updated.  I welcome the Minister's statement &mdash; and his record shows this &mdash; about his openness and willingness to take on board proposals from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>It is very important that it be mandatory that reports of public inquiries be published and debated.  Perhaps a provision in this regard could be included in this Bill.  Taking into consideration the fact that the Shipping Act, 1894, is almost a century old and we cannot begin to compare shipping then with modern shipping, it is important that the legislation is updated.  Perhaps this amendment could be included in this Bill or alternatively in other legislation which should come before the House as quickly as possible.  With the present climate of open Government and public accountability it is essential that such an important and fundamental amendment be included in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister and his staff would positively consider that matter.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister's approach to this matter and <Col N="2339" /> also his statement on the tragedy of the <i>mv Kilkenny.</i>  This incident is under investigation and that is where the matter should rest.  There has been a traditional reluctance by the Department of the Marine to give information regarding inquiries.  The excuse may be given that they want to protect the relatives of the families involved but nevertheless I feel very strongly that in future we should be given such information.  Our marine and merchant shipping legislation is rather antiquated and should be updated.  Merchant shipping is progressing rapidly and safety measures should be improved. When the Bill was introduced in the House it was welcomed on all sides as being very necessary and it was hoped that it would be put through the House as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's remarks this morning that he will be willing to take a new approach to this matter, commitments have to be entered into when tragedy and loss of life occurs.  In the past, commitments have been made that information would not be divulged and that there would be confidentiality. It may be difficult for a Minister to go back on such a commitment at a later stage, and that is the reason I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  It proposes that the report of any inquiry undertaken be laid before the House. The people who participate in such an inquiry should know that their evidence will be public knowledge.  From that point of view, I welcome the Minister's remarks.  I would like to see this amendment enshrined in legislation.  As the Minister has outlined, this may not be the Bill in which to include it, but it is necessary that it be taken on board.  My party fully support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore has pinpointed the position fairly accurately in that the question of whether or not a report is published is and has been a matter of policy.  In general, I favour the publication of reports.  However, that does not necessarily mean that all the details as supplied should be published <Col N="2340" /> because some information may be sensitive and there may be legalities involved.  In some instances also we may not be able to get information.  Our function is to investigate accidents, to find the reasons for them and how they can be prevented in future.  We are not in the business of allocating blame.  That is totally outside our brief.  We are considering the matter from the point of view of the investigation of accidents.</P>
      <P>In some instances people will not give information unless they are given an undertaking that it will remain confidential. In those circumstances people may be prepared to give information if the matter goes before a court of law, which is a different matter.  Ministers in the past may have been anxious to make information available but were restricted in that they gave certain undertakings in the investigation of an accident.  In that sense the matter is somewhat more complex. If we were to make this a legislative or mandatory matter we would have to consider at some length the different elements involved and decide which procedure would be best.  As the Deputies know, I would be very anxious to reveal the facts and to publish the report of the inquiry but we must respect any undertakings that have to be given in the process.</P>
      <P>Those are the elements involved.  I will certainly do as Deputy Gilmore has suggested and examine the matter further for Report Stage.  However, I think the Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter that would have to be considered at great length and in great detail if such a proposition were to be a mandatory legislative one.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his undertaking to consider the matter before Report Stage.  In the light of that, I intend to withdraw my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that in the conduct of any investigation the confidentiality of persons giving information to the inquiry is guaranteed.  I realise the necessity for such confidentiality.  Nevertheless, the issue needs to be elevated above the area of policy because policy may be changed <Col N="2341" /> unilaterally by a Minister.  If the Minister were to come back with an amendment on Report Stage which committed the Minister for the Marine to the making of a report on such an inquiry, we would all understand that there may be confidential matters and information given to any such inquiry which of necessity could not appear in that report.  If such a report was made available then it would be a matter for Members of the House or the public to comment on the adequacy of the report.</P>
    <P>I await the consideration the Minister proposes to give to the issue before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2) (a), line 21, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan said earlier, the Bill was generally welcomed when it came before the House.  All Members expressed an anxiety to have the Bill enacted as quickly as possible. That attitude is reflected in the limited number of amendments that have been tabled. Amendment No. 3 relates to the level of fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recollect that when the former Minister for the Marine introduced the Bill he indicated that if Members considered the levels of fines were not sufficiently high then he could reconsider that matter.  The amendment relates to the section that deals with the surveying of passenger ships.  The maximum fine proposed on summary conviction is £1,000 and the maximum term of imprisonment is six months.  For conviction on indictment the <Col N="2342" /> maximum fine proposed is £5,000 and the maximum term of imprisonment is two years.  One has to bear in mind that it is the maximum levels of fines that are at issue.  Levels of fines proposed in legislation tend to last for a long time.  Indeed, when introducing the Bill, the former Minister said that the levels of fines contained in the previous legislation had been very much out of date.</P>
    <P>This section deals with passenger ships. I made a lengthy comment on Second Stage about disturbing reports that appeared in consumer magazines in Britain and France about levels of safety. Those magazines described as being inadequate the provisions for escape from passenger ships serving this country.  For example, the French consumer magazine listed some of the passenger ships serving Ireland as ranking among the lowest in safety standards of ships surveyed.  Surveys referred to the method of escape from some vessels as being via rope ladders rather than the dry shod method that is recommended.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about small boats, we are talking about ships that carry large numbers of passengers.  I cannot contemplate that the owners or operators of such ships would not co-operate with the annual survey proposed in the Bill which is designed to try to establish that the ships are safe for passengers travelling on them.  The levels of fines proposed are very small when one considers the size of the ships involved, the numbers of passengers they carry and the phenomenal potential for tragedy on any of those ships if something should go wrong.  I make the point because of the commentary in consumer magazines expressing doubt about the safety standards on passenger ships serving this country.  I am responding to the indication given by the former Minister that if Members were unhappy about the levels of fines proposed they could be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Similar provisions for fines are found in other sections but rather than tortuously list amendments to every measure, I decided to table amendments to the first section in which the levels of fines are mentioned.  I hope a debate on <Col N="2343" /> this section will encourage the Minister to accept the amendments and increase the levels of fines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Gilmore that large passenger ships and ferries should be covered under the Bill is relevant.  The Bill puts emphasis on the safety aspects relating to smaller craft and fishing vessels. However, the measures in the Bill refer to ferries.  My amendment, No. 7, also refers to ferries.</P>
      <P>When one considers the size of ferries and the volume of passengers they carry across the Irish Sea and to the Contintent, the maximum level of fine is derisory.  A maximum fine of £1,000 is adequate in the case of a small boat. However, we are talking about a maximum fine, not a minimum fine and the maximum fine should be increased to take account of the large ferries which in certain instances have been found to have inadequate safety measures.  We have to differentiate between vessels.  A maximum fine of £1,000 may seem adequate for small boats, a greater fine would be necessary for large passenger ships.  I support the amendment because the Bill contains no differentiation between vessels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the commitment by this side of the House to co-operate in the speedy passage of the Bill, I shall not delay the House except to support the amendment.  As Deputies Gilmore and O'Sullivan already said, if this amendment is accepted it could equally apply to other sections without adding unnecessarily to the bureaucracy and the paperwork.  The point has been well made that in providing for all vessels, including passenger ships which can be responsible for huge numbers of people and which have a vast potential for tragedy, the ceiling for penalties should not be too low.  We should at least substitute £5,000 for £1,000 and five years for two years. As Deputy Gilmore said, it is not mandatory to impose the maximum sentence but the ceiling should be raised <Col N="2344" /> so that we can cater for a very serious offence.  I hope the Minister will be able to take these amendments on board and will consider similar amendments for other sections, where relevant.</P>
      <P>When the Tánaiste, Deputy Wilson, spoke on the Second Stage of the Bill he referred particularly to section 30 and said he was open-minded with regard to the size of penalties for offences. I hope Deputies Gilmore and O'Sullivan in their amendments are pushing an open door and that the Minister and his staff have reconsidered the size of penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the objective of the Deputies but there is a difficulty with regard to summary offences where there is already a maximum penalty of £1,000 in a court of summary jurisdiction.  We are also limited to the six month penalty for summary offences.  I have been informed that there is really very little difficulty with the surveys which are generally complied with. If someone defaults on the survey he will not have the certificate and will be potentially liable to two different fines.</P>
      <P>There are 21 different types of offences in the Bill for which penalties are provided. The penalties were fixed having regard to the gravity of the offences.  In section 12, on conviction on indictment, the fine for uncertified passenger ships goes as high as £50,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. If we raised some of these penalties we would create a disparity throughout the 21 different penalties.</P>
      <P>There is an existing limit with regard to summary convictions but I will reconsider the package again before Report Stage. The package is designed to meet the requirements of the different kinds of offences.  In section 22, for instance, there is a forfeiture power.  On reconsideration we may well find that this is a balanced package with legal advice on the fines involved.  However, in view of what the Deputies have said, I am prepared to consider the package further for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It appears that the Minister will have a lot of considering to do, before Report Stage.  There are something like 21 different fines provided for in the Bill.  I simply wanted to put on the agenda the levels of fines that are being proposed and to draw the Minister's attention to our concern that perhaps some of those fines could be increased to make them more prohibitive.  I chose the first section which relates specifically to passenger ships because of the enormous implications of anything going wrong on a passenger ship.  The maximum fine on summary conviction is £1,000 and we are talking here about somebody who fails or refuses to have a passenger ship surveyed, a ship perhaps carrying hundreds of passengers.  It would be grossly irresponsible of the owner of a passenger ship to refuse or fail to comply with this legislation to have the ship surveyed with regard to safety and so on, but, if an owner refused or failed to comply with the requirement, on summary conviction the maximum fine is £1,000.  Very often, the Judiciary do not impose the maximum fine and a ship owner could be fined the equivalent of what it would cost him in beer spillages in one night for failing to comply with the requirement. It is to try to put the matter into proportion that I put down these amendments but I am happy to withdraw them in the light of the Minister's commitment to reconsider the level of fines generally in the Bill between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>We come to amendment No. 7 in the name of Deputy G. O'Sullivan.  Amendment No. 8 is related.  Therefore with the agreement of the House, amendments Nos. 7 and 8 may be discussed together. Is that agreed?  Agreed</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  compliance with international safety requirements and regulations under international agreements and conventions, and with best practice in safety measures currently in use.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to have the Minister's views on this amendment.  Much interest was generated in the subject of safety at sea when the Zeebrugge disaster occurred, when there was a hard look taken at safety standards on our passenger ferries.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gilmore has already remarked, some commentators did touch on the safety standards of our passenger ferries and how they complied with international safety standards.  It was felt by most observers, commentators and experts that our ferries did not fare very well when it came to safety standards. Nonetheless, I have to say that surveys undertaken showed that our ferries complied with the minimum standards. However, we should strive to do a lot better than merely adhere to minimum standards of safety on our ferries which will become even more important in the future.  We have seen the comments of various experts on shipbuilding, surveying and ferry operations to the effect that some ferry designs at present are completely outdated and should be considerably revised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to some reports I have read and studied over a period of time.  One such survey conducted after the Zeebrugge disaster, showed that life rafts on board Irish ferries and B &amp; I passenger-car ferries meet the minimum <Col N="2347" /> national and international legal safety standards but their design is outdated; I do not know whether ferry companies intend carrying out major improvements on their ferries in the future.</P>
    <P>My reason for tabling this amendment was the firm belief that we should strive for the best safety measures to be incorporated into any ferry service for which the Minister and his Department are responsible.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the type of escape chutes installed on continental ferries, similar to those installed on aircraft so that, in the event of an emergency occurring at sea, they can be deployed very quickly &mdash; within a matter of seconds &mdash; when a ship is not listing.  For example, if the type of ferry being used at present is involved in a collision with another vessel, within 30 seconds, there is the frightening prospect that it can capsize and list in such a way that the life rafts and lifeboats on board cannot be launched.  That is the frightening prospect we must consider at all times.  Bearing in mind the volume of passengers using ferry services to and from Britain and the Continent we should, if necessary, legislate to ensure that the best safety standards obtain on all our ferries.  Indeed, I contend that aircraft-type escape chutes should be mandatory on any ferry with a large complement of passengers.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed to read that Irish Ferries fall far behind the safety standards of their British, French and continental counterparts.  While realising that the emphasis within the provisions of this Bill is on small boats, perhaps the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> ferries was overlooked inadvertently.  For example, should we not legislate to change our overall outlook with regard to safety on board passenger ferries?  I travel fairly frequently on the ferry from Cork to Swansea and, nearly always, the passengers have a certain sense of safety, because there is a good crew, and the requisite appliances are installed but, as happened in the case of the Zeebrugge disaster, within a matter of minutes, one can be faced with an emergency or disaster.  Therefore, <Col N="2348" /> unless there is available proper modern safety equipment so that people can be taken off a ship at sea within minutes, we could have a recurrence of that tragedy.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's remarks in regard to this amendment because it would appear that we apply minimum standards on our ferries.  In certain circumstances minimum standards may be adequate but, judging by the reports and surveys undertaken by various independent bodies, it would appear that minimum standards are no longer sufficient and are in need of being improved dramatically. Perhaps the Minister would examine this aspect, ascertaining whether he could devise better standards of safety for our ferry services.  If he maintains that he is satisfied with the standards obtaining, I would have to take issue with him because independent marine surveyors and others have indicated that such is not the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's two amendments are central to this Bill, dealing mainly with increased safety at sea and the standards and criteria that must be deployed to ensure that all passenger carrying vessels-ferries adhere to those safety conditions.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill on Second Stage the Minister had this to say:</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte in seeking to attract tourists to this country place special emphasis on our relatively unpolluted waters and our water leisure activities.</P>
      <P>He continued to say:</P>
      <P>... for them &mdash; that is the tourists we are endeavouring to attract &mdash; safety is of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the guarantee and/or perception of safety on all ferries plying in and out of this country are crucial and form part and parcel of the attraction of this country to potential tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore has already commented that there have been independent surveys and studies undertaken which might lead potential tourists to be fearful of the standards of safety applicable to ferries travelling to and from this <Col N="2349" /> country.  That would be a great pity, first, in human terms but, second, in that even such perception would be enormously damaging to the potential tourism development we are all anxious to encourage.</P>
    <P>In supporting Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments it has to be said that there are overriding considerations for us here, first, because we rely so much on tourism and, second, because, being an island, most of our tourists travel here by sea. When travelling by air sometimes passengers do not want to be overly reminded of safety aspects, but, when an air steward or stewardess stands in the aircraft passageway reminding passengers of emergency exits-chutes and so on, how they should be prepared psychologically and otherwise to use them, the safety standards on board become very relevant indeed.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan said, the Zeebrugge type disaster could recur.  Indeed he drew attention to the speed with which, once a ship lists, passengers at sea can be put at risk.  For all those reasons it is vital that international safety requirements and regulations specified in international agreements be complied with so that the specifications included in Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments not alone form part of our legislation but will enable us to go forward proudly advertising that fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of a different matter which is currently under discussion, when the unforeseen happens people turn to this House to ask why we did not make provision for it.  I have raised the subject of safety on ferries in this House on a number of occasions in the past two years.  I referred to consumer magazines which have cast doubt from time to time on the safety standards of ferries operating in and out of this country. I came in for some criticism for that. I was accused of scaremongering.  I quite understand that ferry companies who are in competition with airlines do not wish for unwelcome attention or to have doubt cast on their operations or their standards of safety.  That would <Col N="2350" /> never be my intention.  My preferred method of travelling is by sea rather than by air.  I do not raise these issues to place the operators of the ferries at a competitive disadvantage with the airlines.</P>
      <P>However, there is a problem which must be addressed.  As I understand it, in the case of an accident occurring, it is not possible for there to be a 100 per cent evacuation from those ferries.  The report in <i>Que Choisir,</i> a French consumer magazine, states that the two ferries operated by Irish Ferries can evacuate just 43 per cent and 38 per cent of their passengers respectively.  A separate report in the British consumer magazine <i>Which</i> makes the point that on the B &amp; I ship <i>Leinster</i> 750 people would, if the ship were full, be left with little alternative but a hair-raising climb to safety.</P>
      <P>This issue was not dreamed up by Members of this House.  It has been raised publicly in reputable consumer magazines.  There is a problem with regard to safety standards and with regard to evacuation on ferries operating in and out of our ports.  First, there is an obligation on this House and upon the Minister to make sure, in the interests of the passengers, that the standards of safety which apply on ferries are such that the sea travelling public is safe.  Second, there is also an obligation to ensure that the ferry companies themselves and their employees are not placed at a disadvantage in competing for passengers by doubt continuing to be cast on their safety.  Third, we have an obligation to the tourist industry to ensure that one of the main methods of access to and from the country, which is by sea, does not have doubt cast on its safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue must be cleared up.  Summer after summer this question is raised. When I raised this matter here before I was told that the copies of the various consumer magazines had been referred to the National Ferry Safety Committee and that they were to make recommendations. I am not sure if that has been done.  Today might be an opportune time for the Minister to indicate that it has been done.  None of us wants to be <Col N="2351" /> back here after the occurrence of an accident asking why it happened, why precautions were not taken and why legislation was not produced to deal with it.  The problem has been highlighted and it must be addressed in the interests of passengers, of the companies themselves, of the tourist industry and the public generally.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us what measures it is proposed to take to make sure that the safety of the operation of ferries in and out of this country is put beyond doubt so that we will not again see consumer magazines abroad ranking Irish ferries at the bottom of the safety league.  If consumer magazines abroad continue to rank Irish ferries at the bottom of the safety league that will have very serious implications for the tourist industry.  This is not something that people ignore.</P>
    <P>The public are now much more safety conscious particularly since the Zeebrugge disaster.  I must confess that until the Zeebrugge disaster it never occurred to me that a car ferry could go down or that it could go down with such rapidity. We now know what can happen and there is an obligation on us to make sure that we get this right.  It is said as a cliché now that after the completion of the channel tunnel we will be the only member of the European Community that will be surrounded by sea.  People will only be able to get in and out of this country by air or by sea.  It is an area that must be addressed very quickly, very urgently because of everything that is at stake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are spelling out clearly their interest in having the best possible standards that can be achieved, and the highest quality generally relating to tourism and the importance to the country of having ferries of such high standards that people coming here on business or on holiday can feel happy about coming to the country and using the facilities.  Of course I agree with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2352" /> In relation to the amendment specifically, while I sympathise with its objective, I have to oppose it.  The amendment provides for compliance with international safety requirements and regulations made under international agreements and conventions and with the best practice and safety measures currently in use.  I would have to oppose it on the following grounds: (a) it does not specify particular agreements but merely refers to international safety requirements and regulations under international agreements and conventions; (b) those international agreements to which Ireland is a party would already have the force of law under domestic legislation, such as lifesaving appliances rules and passenger ship construction rules; the marine surveyor of my Department would have due regard to such legislation in the conduct of any survey of a passenger ship and would issue a declaration of survey indicating compliance with the relevant legislation; and (c) this information which would essentially comprise a list of statutory instruments would not be appropriate on a passenger certificate which is intended for display on a passenger ship.</P>
    <P>The function of the passenger certificate is to allow passengers know the geographical limit in which the vessel may ply and the maximum number of passengers which the vessel may carry.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 seeks the insertion of a further paragraph (d) which states:</P>
    <P>there have been breaches in international safety requirements and regulations under international agreements and conventions, or in failure to implement notified improvements towards best practice in safety measures currently in use,</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this amendment as it does not specify what international safety requirements and regulations or international agreements or conventions are in mind.  Those international agreements, to which Ireland is a party, already have the force of law here under various Acts <Col N="2353" /> and regulations.  Breaches of these Acts or regulations constitute an offence.</P>
    <P>Naturally I would be very concerned about safety on ferries operating into and out of Ireland.  I am satisfied that all such ferries adhere to the international safety standards, including evacuation systems, as laid down by the International Maritime Organisation.  Irish registered ferries are required to undergo an annual inspection by my Department's marine survey office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates.  Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports may be inspected under the terms of the IMO's safety of life at sea convention and also the Memorandum of Understanding on the Ports State Control to which Ireland is a contracting party.</P>
    <P>My Department are working on an ongoing basis to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved on all ferries using Irish ports, both in the context of the International Maritime Organisation at international level, and the national ferry safety committee at domestic level.  New regulations are being introduced on foot of the report of the formal inquiry into the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> disaster.  Further regulations will be introduced as appropriate based on expert advice and recommendations of the marine survey office.  The national ferry safety committee who considered the reports, referred to in the magazines mentioned by the Deputy, and found that we meet the basic minimum standards required&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and those of the International Maritime Organisation.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the Deputies in that we want to have the highest possible standards.  Standards are set internationally by the International Maritime Organisation.  For example, they set minimum standards and these are adhered to by 150 countries.  From a commercial or business point of view, or from a general convenience point of view it is desirable that shipping companies aim for <Col N="2354" /> the highest possible standards and strive to reach standards in excess of the minimum international standards.  There is a question of updating technology, equipment and shipping and that is something we would like to see.</P>
      <P>I am rather like Deputy Gilmore in that I would probably feel safer on a boat &mdash; partly because I am a swimmer, although I might not last very long &mdash; than in a plane.  While I respect the information I get when I am on the plane, there is not very much I can do afterwards as I am very much in the hands of the pilot.  I make my peace with God before I go and after that I enjoy the flight. I know Deputies are concerned about reaching the highest standards and being assured that the standards are at the highest level in our ferries.  The point which struck me while Deputies were discussing these points was that it might be useful to visit the ferries.  I invite the spokespersons to come and visit the ferries wih me and we will discuss the position with them.  My surveyors have advised me that they meet the minimum standards set by the International Maritime Organisation.  I know there are many other aspects to be considered and there is the question of how quickly one can advance to a much higher standard. If Deputies are interested I would be happy to arrange for a visit where we can have discussions with the ferries personnel <i>in situ</i> and look at where things stand at present and where they are going from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points the Minister has made in regard to the two amendments.  I should like to refer to amendment No. 8 which seeks to withdraw the certificate if there has been a breach of the safety requirements.  The Minister is not accepting the amendment, perhaps because it is too broad.  I could have given more detail on international safety requirements but I felt rather than go into to much details about certain standards which should be met that general international safety requirements and regulations would cover the point I <Col N="2355" /> was trying to make.  The Minister indicated that we should have minimum standards &mdash; this is the point with which I take issue &mdash; but I suggest we strive to be much more progressive than merely reaching the minimum standards.  As we all know, minimum standards can be very basic.  If certain proposals are put forward and if new methods and new technology are devised for safety at sea for passengers than we should examine them very closely and see how they can be implemented in law for our ferry services. As Deputy Gilmore said, it is unfair to the ferry services if they just barely comply with the minimum standards; it is not fair to the crews or the companies who are in competition.  We are all in the same boat here in that we feel safer on ferry services than on aircraft.  We should learn from mistakes which have been made in the past.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the safety of passengers and the general public we should look at all aspects of legislation governing safety of ferries.  I will have to stand by my amendment which is sufficiently broad for the Minister to accept as it includes the words &ldquo;best practice in safety measures currently in use&rdquo;.  There have been dramatic developments in safety methods.  Our ferries are fairly old and have been built for a number of years. The standards which prevailed at the time were adequate and were the minimum standards, but with modern-day technology and travelling we should have the best equipment if at all possible.  The point I am making is that the provision of the best safety measures currently in use may require only a small amount of expenditure in order to reach the required level of safety.  The airtight escape chutes in aircraft can be devised for ferries.  So far as I am aware none of our ferries have that type of safety measure.  As Deputy Gilmore said, should an accident or tragedy occur at sea, people will have to climb 40 or 50 feet down a rope ladder to a boat.  In this day and age if there is a better and safer way we should be looking at it.  I will be pressing my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2356" />
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister shares our concerns.  As Deputy Gilmore said, we do no want to come into the House following a tragedy to ask how it happened.  As the Minister is aware from experience, when a tragedy happens the people held responsible are the politicians because they did not bring in the required legislation.  We are asked why we did not foresee that such a tragedy could happen and why did we not put the necessary legislation in place.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has difficulty with the wording of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments or if he considers the wording to be too loose &mdash; they reflect the serious thought that he has put into them &mdash; he should agree to accept what Deputy O'Sullivan proposed, even if he has to refine the wording.  Perhaps I should not try to amend the amendments put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan, but given that the idea behind them is of the utmost importance, the fact that the wording is too loose is no reason for opposing or excluding them.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I get worried when the Minister mentions minimum standards. One hundred and fifty countries are members of the IMO.  I do not know about any of my colleagues, but I have had some very hair raising experiences on ferries in other countries.  I do not want to name them but there are a few I could think of which I am sure are members of the IMO.  However they could probably tell us they enforce the minimum standards.  I recall one particular excursion when my hair nearly turned grey; four or five people almost drowned and it was only the grace of God that saved them.  Yet, I would say that if an inquiry had been conducted it may have been shown that the minimum standards were being adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that we are dealing here with different age groups and passengers of different size.  Given my years and weight, I could not visualise myself evacuating down a rope ladder. We ought to take into account the passengers' needs because we cannot all be Tarzans and Janes.  If this amounts to the minimum standard then I am worried and <Col N="2357" /> I will certainly be looking for a faster way to evacuate from a boat or a ferry.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Department are going to define what safety technology should be used.  I hope the Minister's reply, which I hope will be positive, will indicate whether the National Ferry Safety Committee and his own working group have discovered that the accepted standards are not good enough and that he will in the near future demand, through the Department of the Marine, that the standards be updated and improved.  I am sure that both committees are working along those lines. This makes it all the more important that Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments are included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 14, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;(1) A vessel shall not be used as a passenger boat unless the owner or the person/persons using the boat for the purposes of conveying passengers have passed an approved competency test as specified by the Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister shall by regulation specify the terms and conditions in relation to competency tests and may by order amend such regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment advisedly <Col N="2358" /> because there is now greater awareness and usage of pleasure boats.  This amendment covers both passenger vessels and pleasure boats.  As we are all aware, the master of a registered shipping vessel or a passenger vessel must have a certificate of competence but, in relation to smaller vessels &mdash; any person can purchase such a cabin cruiser or launch and put to sea or take to the river without first receiving a certificate of competence.  I believe that on the Continent one has to hold such a certificate.</P>
    <P>One day last summer in west Cork I came across a very agitated fisherman on the cliffs.  When I asked him what was wrong he told me there was a boat with a number of passengers trying to go around the headland against the tide and he felt they were in danger of being swamped. The person sailing the boat obviously had no experience and was not competent to take the boat around the headland.  The fisherman, as an experienced fisherman and boatman, saw the danger and tried to warn them not to go near the headland.</P>
    <P>About 99 per cent of people who use boats are experienced because they have attended schools run by yachting clubs, etc.  Anyone who loves the sea and wishes to participate in sea activities genuinely fears and respects the sea. One must be competent to take a boat out on the open sea.  However, under the law as it stands, anyone can purchase a boat and put to sea or use our waterways for gain without meeting any standards.  There is obviously a gap in the system.  I do not want to hinder anyone from doing what he or she wants but, in relation to boating, there is a reluctance on the part of the Department to become involved, as it is part of our lifestyle to do what we please. However, we must remember that someone has to rescue those who get into trouble on a boat at sea or on a river.  I have the greatest respect and admiration for any school or club who, over a period train young people in lifesaving and the handling of a boat in various conditions. It is great to see this because, although we are an island nation, we lag far behind other countries in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2359" /> As the law stands there is no prohibition on anyone buying a cabin cruiser or a yacht and taking it out with people on board although not competent to do so.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's reaction because the time has come to set standards.  The vast majority of people using the sea are fishermen who grew up on boats, from the age of four or five years they hung around boats in the harbour and gained experience from going to sea with their families.  There is no problem in regard to them but, with increased leisure time it seems to be the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to buy a boat or cabin cruiser. In that regard there is a glaring omission in the legislation and, without hindering the freedom of the individual, there should be some method whereby a person would receive a competency certificate to use a boat.  I do not want to compare it with a licence to drive a car but something should be done, perhaps through the supplier.  A person must show he is capable of using a boat properly because his life, the lives of his passengers and of the people who engage in rescue operations are put at risk.  We know the vagaries of the weather and an inexperienced sailor may not be able to handle a boat in rough conditions, which could result in loss of life.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I told the former Minister that I would be tabling this amendment and I asked him to consider the matter.  If the new Minister has views on this, I am anxious to hear them because the time has come to look at this aspect of boating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with passenger boats; pleasure craft are dealt with in the next section.  Boats are defined in section 2 as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Passenger boat&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a vessel carrying not more than 12 passengers for reward or having on board for the purposes of carriage for reward not more than 12 passengers, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  a vessel that is carrying not <Col N="2360" /> more than 12 passengers, or has on board for the purposes of carriage not more than 12 passengers, and is on hire pursuant to a contract or other arrangement under which a crew or part of a crew is provided for the vessel by its owner.</P>
    <P>and includes a vessel carrying not more than 12 persons to or from their place of work, or having on board not more than 12 persons for the purposes of such carriage, and owned by or on hire to their employer and a vessel registered outside the State and carrying not more than 12 passengers between places in the State, or having on board not more than 12 passengers for the purposes of such carriage, but does not include such a vessel carrying passengers to or from the State or having on board passengers for the purposes of such carriage, a fishing vessel, a ferry boat working in chains or a vessel in respect of which a certificate is in force.</P>
    <P>The extension of this legislation to cover these boats is a huge step forward, as I am sure the Deputy knows.  Effectively, it brings the licensing of vessels carrying not more than 12 passengers for reward &mdash; which are defined as passenger boats &mdash; within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts for the first time.  It is a huge change as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the repeal of section 94 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, under which such vessels may currently be licensed.  As Deputies know, few local authorities exercise their powers in this regard. Section 14 provides that a vessel shall not be used as a passenger boat unless a licence is in force in relation to it.  It is a major change.  I listened to Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan but I wish to point out that section 18 already confers powers on me to make regulations to ensure the safety of passenger boats, their crews and passengers. Section 18 (2) (e) allows me to ascertain and test the standards of competence of masters and other members of crews at any time I consider it necessary. Therefore, an enabling power is given <Col N="2361" /> which can, if considered necessary, be used having implemented the Act.</P>
    <P>A merchant vessel safety working group is being set up to advise me on the safety procedures and standards required on Irish passenger boats, including those which carry under 12 passengers.  It is not appropriate to require that the owner of a passenger boat has passed a competency test as he or she may not be involved in operating the vessel.  The best thing to do now is to implement all the legislation dealing with the Merchant Shipping Acts in relation to the smaller boats and, at the same time, the safety working group can advise me on the additional procedures to be adopted.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan's views.  I know he has been very concerned about the development of skills related to boating and in running courses for young people.  Of course, this will lead to a higher standard in the future.  I believe it is appropriate for me at this stage to take these powers and introduce the regulations &mdash; they will be very substantial in any event &mdash; and consider how much further I should go in regard to the developments taking place nowadays so as to meet the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan.  In these circumstances, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the spirit of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.  I do so in view of experiences in my constituency of Clare.  On a number of occasions Clare County Council were asked to license boats which ply between Doolin and the Aran Islands.  This was the subject of litigation between Clare County Council and various boat owners for a long time. Several claims were made about overcrowding on small passenger boats and this gave rise to much distress.  Will the Minister say who will administer the regulations and issue the licences?  Will there be a limited number of licences for small boats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister promised that much of the necessary information would be gathered by the working group.  If the Minister is going to set up a working group to <Col N="2362" /> look into these matters I suggest they take into consideration the views of county managers in coastal counties who have to deal with these problems.  He should invite the Clare County Manager, Mr. Michael Noonan, who has been involved in litigation with small boat owners, to be a member of the working group.</P>
    <P>A small boat owner in County Clare who made an application in good faith for a licence is now involved in court proceedings.  This man, whom I believe is a good person, purchased a boat to bring tourists from Doolin to the Aran Islands during the summer.  He has a legitimate case and has engaged the services of highly qualified people.  Clare County Council sought the advice of the Department of the Marine engineer who contradicted the opinion of the marine engineer employed by Clare County Council.  In addition, there are problems about whether Clare County Council can give an opinion on issues arising outside the high water mark.  Will the working group examine such matters?  I hope the Minister, when making the regulations, will eliminate most of the pitfalls and difficulties identified by the working group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred on a number of occasions to litigation.  I should point out to the Deputy that such issues are <i>sub judice.</i> The Deputy needs to be careful about the use of the word &ldquo;litigation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his caution.  I referred to the local authority but not to the person involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I am concerned about the number of passengers allowed on boats, particularly those which travel from Doolin to the Aran Islands.  It does not matter whether these boats can hold one passenger or 24 passengers because once this legislation is enacted they will probably be licences to carry 12 passengers only.  I should like the Minister to say how these licences will be issued.  Will Clare County Council or local authorities have any say in the <Col N="2363" /> issuing of licences or will it be entirely a matter for the Department of the Marine?</P>
    <P>There has been much disquiet about the number involved in the issuing of licences.  Most people would welcome the issuing of licences by the Department of the Marine without reference to the local authorities.  If Clare County Council, or any other local authority, are to act on an agency basis for the Department of the Marine in the issuing of licences, specific guidelines should be set out in section 14. I am very sympathetic to the spirit of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment which proposes that boat owners should undergo a competence test.  He wants to know if marine engineers outside the Department of the Marine can be used in appeals; whether there will be an appeals system and how the licences be allocated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allocation of licences, I should like the Minister to say if there will be a number of licences for Doolin, Galway, Achill, Cape Clear and Baltimore?  How will the licences be distributed? Will the Minister invite applications for licences?  How will these matters be dealt with?  Seafaring people are very protective of the rights they have enjoyed over the centuries and do not like any of them being taken away.  While I agree there has to be some control to prevent tragedies off our coast, I should like the Minister to be specific on how these matters will be dealt with so that the people who apply for licences will fully understand what is involved.</P>

      <P>I assure the House that I will try to find a proper balance between what is proposed by Deputies Carey and O'Sullivan &mdash; one wants me to go further while the other does not want me to go too far.  With regard to the licences, the Deputy need not be concerned about the issue.  Licences will be issued to those who meet the required standard.  Therefore, there is no limit on the number of licences.  Licences will be issued by the Department of the Marine.  This is a change in the power local authorities had <Col N="2364" /> and which they generally choose not to exercise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the problems which occur during the summer season. He may be surprised to learn that during my leaving certificate year I plied boats from a beach and I know what tourists are like when they are getting on boats. Sometimes they almost need to be hit with an oar to get them to have some common sense when in a boat &mdash; they are inclined to forget that boats can rock very easily.  I was quite a good oarsman at that time.</P>
      <P>The experience to which the Deputy referred is particularly valuable.  I will ensure that people who have been involved in such issues in the past, especially the Clare county manager, will be consulted by the safety working group. This working group will get underway in a matter of weeks.  I regard this as an urgent matter as I want to ensure the Bill is enacted for the tourist season.  As Deputies know, the Bill will have to be sent to the Seanad and there will be time gaps.  That is one of the reasons I want the Bill through this House fairly quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the Minister and he has grasped the point I am making.  He indicated that he may refuse a licence to those who do not reach the required standard of competence.  In my amendment I am asking him to go a step further, to lay down a competency standard and require people to pass a test before receiving a licence.  I can understand his reluctance to take such a step, but as Deputy Carey said incompetent people may take out boats with passengers on board &mdash; I am glad the Minister has acknowledged that this sometimes happens.  My concern is that under the legislation as drafted people may be given a licence who are incompetent to use a boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister will decide who should or should not receive a licence.  He said the owner of a boat may not be the person who uses it, and that is a fair point.  I would be willing to withdraw my amendment if he gives an assurance that the competency aspect will <Col N="2365" /> be carefully considered by the Department. It would be unacceptable to learn that an accident has occurred at Doolin or Baltimore in Cork because a person with a licence to take out a boat was incompetent to do so.  If the Minister can assure me that standards of competence will be considered I will certainly withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2), between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  make provision for competency certificates for pleasure boat owners/users, and</P>
      <P>(f)  make provision for rules governing public safety with regard to speedboats, water-skiing and the use of pleasure boats in sporting activities, and any other activities which need to be regulated in the interest of public safety.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat myself, but I will withdraw paragraph (e) of this amendment because the Minister has indicated that he will consider the competency aspect.  The time has come when the registration of yachts, cabin cruisers and so on, must be considered. I am conscious of the fact that any person may purchase a boat or yacht &mdash; I am not talking about such a purchase for profit or for business purposes but as a pleasure craft.  As the Minister is aware, a greater number of people use our beaches, waterways and lakes for leisure activities.  I am sure many Deputies have received complaints from people who go to the seaside or visit our lakes about people on water skis.  People water ski without restriction close to people who are swimming or lying at the waterside.</P>
      <P>In my amendment I propose the introduction of regulations governing the use of speed boats and water skis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spent many hours debating the fisheries legislation and trying to resolve that issue.  Anglers have complained that people, apparently without restriction, <Col N="2367" /> use lakes and rivers for water skiing and speed boat activities.  I am prepared to withdraw the provision in my amendment relating to competency, but I ask the Minister to take on board the measure which relates to regulations.  Provision should be made for the safety of people who use our rivers and lakes for leisure activities.  Anybody who purchases a boat or yacht at present may use it as they wish without restriction.  I do not wish to curtail the freedom of the individual, but there should be some method of registration of boats and yachts, as is the case with cars and trailers.  Boating activities have become a big and, in some cases, lucrative business and people should be obliged to register such craft.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter and I would like to hear his views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy O'Sullivan for putting down this amendment. We all commented on this on Second Stage.  When talking about the increase in water leisure activities, both inland and sea, we made the point that there must be a corresponding increase in responsibilities and standards.  Deputy Gilmore and I are very aware of the difficulties and controversies in the Dún Laoghaire Harbour area.  Some people are denied their rights because others are engaged in water activities.  For instance, people wind surfing have different needs to people who are water skiing.  Water skiing involves very high powered speed boats and can pose a great danger to others</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who go to Brittas Bay for the day &mdash; and they who do not often have such an opportunity &mdash; find their day is ruined by very noisy speed boats.  Not only do those boats take up the water space, which is particularly important when children are concerned, but the noise they create can ruin the day for a family.  I know that that could be a difficult issue to deal with, but perhaps the Minister and his staff could consider the allocation of designated areas and designated times for leisure activities so that <Col N="2368" /> people have the right to their space and to the enjoyment of that space at different times.  Unless standards and conditions are introduced then the proliferation of many different leisure activities could easily lead to the occurrence of a bad accident and to the spoiling of what was a day out at the seaside enjoyed by everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that a message be sent posthaste from the House to the Department of the Marine, where the Pleasurecraft Safety Working Group, set up to advise me on the introduction of &mdash; among other things &mdash; safety regulations under this section of the Bill, are having their first meeting today.  It would be appropriate to send that very relevant commiteee an urgent message so that they do not miss some of the points raised by the Deputies in this debate.</P>
      <P>I accept the points made in relation to the second provision in the amendment. I do not consider that the provision should be passed as an amendment to the Bill at this stage but it is certainly an issue about which something needs to be done. The working group were set up to advise me on just what should be done in that regard.  In any event, I have powers under section 20 and those powers could be exercised on the advice of the committee.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned speedboats, water-skiing and the use of pleasure boats in sporting activities.  I know of the kind of problems experienced with jet skis, for instance, and that is something else that needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barnes mentioned the possibility of the allocation of designated areas and designated times as ways to approach the issue.  Recently I met some fishermen who told me that when local people tried to designate water areas they came into conflict with the fishermen's traditional patterns of small-scale fishing.  It is easy to recognise the way in which complexities arise in that regard.  As speed and technology on the water increase there will certainly be need for greater regulation and more order in the way in which facilities are used. <Col N="2369" /> I am relying on the working group to whom I have referred to provide the advice that they feel appropriate at this stage and I shall certainly act on that advice.  I thank Deputies for making their points in relation to safety, which are very relevant.  I shall certainly give attention to the safety aspect.  Nowadays it is very necessary to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had understood by the section was that if someone had applied for a license and the Department of the Marine did not accept the application then the applicant would have a <Col N="2370" /> right of appeal.  I understood that that would come within the jurisdiction of the District Court and I intended to commend the Minister for using the offices of the District Court in this kind of legislation. First, there is a greater chance that an appeal would be processed quickly and, second, the use of the District Court would not be so expensive for applicants.  A provision for District Court appeal has value and I am not disagreeing with that measure.  However, I am concerned about the format of the appeal. Already the Department of the Marine are not accepting the opinion of independent marine engineers.  That has happened in a case in my constituency.  On what basis will an appeal proceed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the Debate last evening I was about to speak about the appointment of members to the proposed National Roads Authority, dealt with in section 28.  I should like to make two comments of principle on the matter.  The procedure is a little bit curious in the sense that I wonder if the Progress Democrats part of the Government will not ask for or propose an amendment to this to the effect that the chairman and the members of the Authority be appointed by a High Court judge.  It was a very popular formula with them some time ago and I wonder if they are still of that mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other more fundmental question is why no provision is made in this section for the appointment of the chairman or <Col N="2372" /> members of the Authority to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in any shape or form.  The Minister may have a good reason for doing this but it has been a feature of other Bills setting up bodies that the proposals would come before the Houses of the Oireachtas for their approval.</P>
    <P>Section 28 (1) (b) allows the Minister to direct that the chairman perform the functions of the chief executive until such time as the chief executive has been appointed.  I wonder why.  Why is it provided that the Minister may do this?  Why is the provision not simply that the Minister shall do this?</P>
    <P>Section 28 (1) (c) refers to the number of members of the Authority, which shall be not less than ten or more than 14.  That is a simple, straightforward statement. There is no indication here that the Minister or anybody else would have regard to any particular qualifications that people might have for appointment as members of this Authority or as chairman.</P>
    <P>In the Environmental Protection Agency Bill from the same Department a number of bodies are designated to be consulted on their views as to people who would be appointed to be members of that agency.  The work to be done by the National Roads Authority is of sufficient importance to warrant some specification or stipulation as to the qualification of some or all of the members of the National Roads Authority because it has a very important job to do not only from the point of view of its effect on the efficiency on our transport system but from the point of view of the inevitable effects it will have on our environment. Would the Minister be open to considering the specification of some of the qualifications it might be useful to have included among the membership of the board of the Authority?</P>
    <P>Section 28 (5) (b) allows the Minister to remove from office any member of the Authority for stated misbehaviour or if his removal appears to the Minister to be necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the Authority of their functions.  That looks acceptable.  It is the <Col N="2373" /> kind of thing the Minister should be able to do, but why is it necessary to make that statement here?  For what reason would the Minister consider that the removal of a member of the Authority might be desirable for the effective performance of their functions?  We all agree that stated misbehaviour might be a good basis for the removal of a person although the Bill does not say what kind of misbehaviour. This power could be exercised in a rather arbitrary manner, and since there is no involvement of the Oireachtas in any of this I would like to know, before we come to the Committee Stage debate, how the Minister intends to approach this.</P>
    <P>Section 28 (6) provides that the Authority may act notwithstanding a vacancy among its members.  That is a sensible provision but I would sound a warning on this.  I hope the Minister for the Environment will not allow too many vacancies to exist for too long.  I do not suggest that the current Minister will be dilatory in the event of a vacancy arising but there was a time not so long ago when another State agency, the Higher Education Authority were allowed to get into a position where it was almost impossible for them to meet because there were so many vacancies on the Authority which had not been filled that it became difficult for them to get a quorum to have a meeting. I hope the Minister for the Environment will be less dilatory in that matter than the Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, was with regard to the Higher Education Authority.  It is undesirable to have vacancies for too long in an Authority of this kind.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the appointment of the chief executive.  Under subsection (4) the Minister may at any time for stated reasons terminate the employment of the first chief executive.  It is clear that for some time the Minister will have a role if the chief executive is to be appointed before the full Authority has been put in place, but why should the Minister have this function after the Authority have taken office and the chairman has been appointed.  Once a chairman and an authority are in place <Col N="2374" /> they should be given all the functions proper to their position and the Minister should not interfere in this way at any point after they have been appointed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) (b) provides that the Authority may at any time for stated reasons terminate the employment of any subsequent chief executive, but not the first.  Why?  It seems to me that if we set up an authority with a chairman to do a particular job they should take over the running of the organisation and the Minister should not have any further function of the kind proposed in subsection (4) (a) for the first or any other chief executive.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in section 31 for the transfer of staff from public authorities to this new Authority.  That section and sections 33, 34, 35 and 36 deal with the transfer of staff from public authorities, the provision of services, membership of Houses of the Oireachtas, membership of a local authority and superannuation.  There is a series of provisions here.  I took the trouble to look back at similar provisions in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill to see whether the same approach is being adopted here.  To my surprise I found that a rather different approach is being adopted in some cases in this Bill.  They are dealing basically with the same problems, the same kind of personnel issues. All other things being equal, it would have been convenient, since the sponsoring Department is the same Department, to have a degree of commonality between the provisions in this Bill and those in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  Many of the provisions are similar but there are unexplained differences between some of the provisions in this Bill and those in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>
    <P>I might give just one example.  Section 31 (4) is identical to the early part of section 31 (1) of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990.  But there is no provision in this Bill relating to the procedure to be followed in the event of a dispute, whereas a similar provision in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill 1990 contains a provision for the <Col N="2375" /> resolution of disputes.  Since we are talking about the transfer of staff from local authority to this agency it seems to me that if it was felt that disputes could arise in the case of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which would warrant a procedure for dealing with them, similar considerations would apply here.</P>
    <P>Other sections are similar but there are differences between this Bill and the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990.  I wonder is there a particular reason for that.  It would appear to me to have been administratively neater and probably entail somewhat less work for the Department had the appropriate sections simply been lifted from the Environmental Protection Agency Bill holus-bolus and inserted in this one.  Of course, I know I will be told that the <i>mutatis</i> have to be <i>mutandis</i> and all the rest, but the differences here appear to me to be more than that and not readily explicable to an ordinary, common or garden Member of this House.  Incidentially I notice that, since yesterday, we have a new category of people in this House.  Apparently some of us are &ldquo;ordinary Deputies&rdquo;.  I do not know what is the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; of the day.  Perhaps that is something we might pursue at another time.  Of course, I know that the Chair is an extraordinary person but I thought all of the remainder of us here were on the same footing except in so far as some are members of the Government.

      <P>Another difference I have noted, and again I wonder why, is in section 33 dealing with membership of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament by members or staff of the Authority.  This section provides that, where a member of the Authority is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann or, further down, where a person employed by the Authority is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill deals with the same proposition and speaks of persons who accept such nomination.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or is there just an excessive tidiness in my mind?  I hope that all of that is behind Deputy Ferris, that accepting nominations for membership of Seanad Éireann will not be a matter of any concern to him.  I wonder why there are these differences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I would think it might be of convenience to the Minister if he knew what questions would arise.  It would certainly be to my convenience if I could have explained to me why these things are there so that I could decide whether there was any point in tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Another consideration is that the Minister being from Tipperary, is accustomed to anticipation in the sporting field.  Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that he would anticipate quite a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he did spend a fair bit of his life in recent years anticipating things.  Indeed, I am glad they worked <Col N="2377" /> out well for him.  I know he is a man of great anticipation.  It would be useful to have these questions adumbrated at least on Second Stage.  If we receive answers to them we can save ourselves the trouble of tabling unnecessary amendments and devote our entire attention to those appearing to be necessary, for which we need that knowledge.</P>
      <P>I will not go into any more detail on these sections.  I have indicated that sections 33 to 36, inclusive, contain differences from those of the corresponding provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990.  I wonder why. It is as simple as that. If there is good reason, fine; if there is not good reason, perhaps the Minister and his Department could make a little obeisance in the direction of tidiness of mind in these things.</P>
      <P>There is then, in section 39, power for the Minister to issue directions and guidelines to the National Roads Authority. This is the type of section I might call the &ldquo;belt and braces&rdquo; section.  This is to make it clear &mdash; in case the Authority get any ideas otherwise &mdash; that if something is not specifically given to the Minister as a power to intervene, to direct their work, if the drafter of the legislation has not thought of making a specific requirement, then, just in case, there is this general power given to the Minister in section 39.  Having tied up the Authority and supported their breeches all the way through by a proper belt, in terms of the Minister's attentions to them, we put on the braces here by saying that, just in case we have missed something, and the Minister feels there is something more he would like to do in the way of directing or guiding the Authority, this section will afford him power to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with that kind of provision in a Bill.  I know why it is included. It is there specifically to ensure that if a case arises which is not specifically dealt with in the Bill and in respect of which the Minister feels he wants to give a direction, he can invoke the provisions of this section.  It is a fairly common feature of Bills of this kind but one of which Parliament should be suspicious.  I contend the provisions of this Bill give the <Col N="2378" /> Minister sufficient powers to put his fingers into the Authority's pie without giving him this very general power contained in section 39.  I should like the Minister to say just what unspecified powers of interference he would want to contemplate under the provisions of section 39.</P>
    <P>Section 41 and following sections in Part IV deal with motorways, busways and protected roads; a very important Part of the Bill.  There are a few things I should say about motorways.  First, the National Roads Authority will have a central role to play in the building of motorways.  I confess to having a particular and immediate interest in the matter at present, in that plans are well advanced for the construction of a section of motorway to by-pass Kildare town, which will actually pass about halfway between my home and the town.  I do not know whether it will have any effect on property in the area &mdash; I declare that interest immediately &mdash; but certainly it will have a major effect on the environment of the area.  I am not suggesting for a moment that I will object because it has been a well thought-out project. Basically there were three possible routes: one going round to the north of the town which would have had to cross the railway line twice; the one apparently now being contemplated as being the actual project, and one that would have gone in a wide loop further south when there would have been the difficulty of building a long section of it over fairly boggy land.  My view is that the route chosen &mdash; although it will pass within approximately half a mile of my home &mdash; is probably the most sensible from all points of view.  Nonetheless, it has upset many people, as do all such projects.  For example, it has upset our National Stud in that undoubtedly the proposed motorway would interfere with the working of that excellent establishment, but I do not think there is any help for it.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is the problem that it is fair to speculate that, had the designers been given the job of designing a road as one project that would have begun where the Naas by-pass now begins and carried <Col N="2379" /> on to Portlaoise, we would have got a different line of road.  We would not now have the Naas by-pass exactly where it is. We would not have the Newbridge by-pass exactly where it is going and we would not have the Kildare by-pass.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is an inherent problem in the way we set about funding our major road programmes. I am not in any way criticising the Minister, his Department or designers when I say so, but it is a pity that we do not have the kind of planning horizon that would allow us plan a project like that in one go.  Had we begun some 20 or 25 years ago to design a new road from, say, Newlands Cross right down to Portlaoise, we would have had a very different route from the present one. Doing these jobs piecemeal &mdash; which we are fated to do within the kind of financial framework we have adopted &mdash; means we get a whole series of sub-optimal solutions to the planning and other problems obtaining.  Probably it costs us more in the long run.  That is a problem we should consider, one it would behove the National Roads Authority to examine when devising plans and studying the way in which we finance the construction of our roads.</P>
    <P>My own particular concern in relation to the Kildare bypass helps to illustrate a number of the problems that need to be dealt with under the provisions of this Bill.  I am thinking in particular of what I said last night about my unhappiness with the fact that roads are treated as exempt developments and that we have a different procedure for looking at the environmental impact of these projects.</P>
    <P>That Kildare bypass will have a number of different consequences for the environment and for the amenity of the immediate area.  The first is that it is proposed that what is now the normal access route to Kildare town from the area that I live in and further south, will be cut by the motorway.  It is proposed to build a new road from a part of that existing road to the Grey Abbey Road &mdash; we have lovely names around Kildare &mdash; that would cross the motorway, provide access to the motorway and continue on <Col N="2380" /> to the present main road and provide access to the town from that side.  It is proposed to build a bridge over the motorway further east to continue the access to the road from the Japanese Gardens on that side of Kildare town. The current route that my neighbours and I use to get into Kildare town is to be cut.  It will become a <i>cul-de-sac</i> from our side and it will be a <i>cul-de-sac</i> from the other side.  There is, apparently, a proposal to build a pedestrian bridge across it.  That is causing some concern because the alternative routes into the town are a good deal longer than the one that is there at the moment.  The difference is enough to make people worry about the convenience and safety of children going to school and of people walking the mile or so into Kildare town in the evening and in the winter time. There is a concern there that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>At one point, the road will go through the bottom of a fairly wet piece of land and it will require a lot of management and filling in, culverting and diverting of water courses, which is another problem that will clearly affect the drainage of the general surrounding area.  Incidentally, it will, take away one of the areas I most like to go for a walk through the fields, but that is progress and we cannot prevent it.</P>
    <P>It is going to go straight through an area where there is, to my knowledge, one of the highest concentrations of badgers.  Right in the path of the proposed motorway, there is a most magnificent system of badget setts, one of the biggest I have ever seen.  Personally I would be very unhappy to see those badgers being literally uprooted when that road is built.  There will be a lot of pressure on other potential badger habitats in the area as a result.  However, I am not saying that is a reason not to build that road, it is to be built.</P>
    <P>As I said, the route being chosen is the most rational one.  However, it illustrates the kinds of problems that we will meet all along that section of road from the current Newbridge bypass right down to where it will rejoin the current main road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2381" /> This road will go straight through country that is fairly rich in fauna &mdash; I am not an expert on the flora of the area but it is certainly rich in fauna &mdash; and will make a substantial difference to the area.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of things I would like to see being properly and publicly addressed because I have not seen any mention of them in any of the material I have seen &mdash; and I have seen a good deal of material about this motorway.  I have not seen any consideration being given to those issues.  I am not saying nobody is thinking about them other than myself, I am sure there is, but I would like to see consideration being given to these issues so that we would know that these are concerns that our road planners bear in mind and that they know what the other effects of their plans are likely to be.</P>
    <P>I disagree fundamentally with Deputy McEllistrim who came to the conclusion last evening that if they cannot have improvements in the roads in Kerry, which they sorely need and I intend to find out more about that for myself next Friday when I have to travel down to Waterville &mdash; then we should not be having motorways either.  That is letting the best be the enemy of the good.  The funds the Deputy is talking about will be coming from different pockets as far as the Minister is concerned; not, of course, as far as the taxpayer is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 42 deals with busways and we have at least the adumbration of a proposal for a busway; I wonder if the proposal to put a busway on the old Harcourt Street line is not something Minister Brennan rushed out in his last days as Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, when he saw the writing on the wall and decided he would get the last bit of popularity he could out of the job before he was changed.  I do not know whether he will succeed in leaving as his legacy to the people of the southern part of the city of Dublin a new busway along the Harcourt Street line.  It appears there have been second thoughts about that.  There are apparently some &ldquo;guestimates&rdquo; that suggest that the reconstruction of the bridges and the organisation of the surface to make it <Col N="2382" /> suitable for a busway would cost £7 million. I do not know whether that is true. I am not an engineer or a quantity surveyor but to me that looks like a modest figure.  From my own observation I would think that magnificent viaduct at Milltown will need a lot of work before it can be used as a busway and in several places new bridges will have to be built. I can remember &mdash; I was living in Dundrum at the time &mdash; when the old bridge was removed.  Now, there will be the question of building a new bridge at a very busy intersection.  How seriously are we to take this proposal for the busway? Is it a Government proposal or is it a document that occurred to Minister Brennan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is very germane to it and it to the Bill because it is the only project I know of where it is proposed, or half proposed, to build a busway.  It seems to me that I am perfectly on line &mdash; if I can use that particular expression &mdash; with the intention of the Bill in talking about a busway.  I would like to know if we are ever going to see this busway, or was it just one of these ideas the Minister had and threw on to the table before he hiked off to another Department.  Will the current Minister feel obliged to follow up on the busway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that one of the plans is that we would have a whole fleet of new buses with a capacity of up to 100 passengers compared to the 74 or 78 passengers we normally have in doubledeckers.  I look forward to seeing those animals.  They must be what a friend of mine in Germany calls these &ldquo;wormy form&rdquo; buses <Col N="2383" /> that have this accordation part in the centre to articulate them.  I look forward to the day when we see such buses going down the old Harcourt Street line if, indeed, some other Minister does not come along in the meantime and decide we are going to have a light rail system there instead.</P>
    <P>Was that project put forward by the Minister for the sake of popularity or because it seemed to him that that was a use of £7 million plus that should have a higher priority than upgrading the service that is available to Clondalkin, than upgrading, for example, the service that is available to Hazelhatch?  Did the Minister intend to tell us that this project has a higher priority than the others because it ranks more importantly in the scale of public transport improvements?  I am not against a busway, far from it, but I would like to know where it fits in in the scale of priority on the many public transport improvements that are needed in the Dublin area only, to speak of nowhere else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated publicly, the provision of jobs is top of the agenda for this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues and I are currently reviewing the various initiatives which have been taken to deal with the appallingly high level of unemployment.  I may summarise these as follows: the new employment and training schemes aided by the European Social Fund which have the potential to take 25,000 persons off the live register over the next 12 months; the task force on employment under the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> composed of representatives of the social partners, Government Departments and commercial State bodies; the area-based strategy being conducted in 12 pilot areas of high long term unemployment under the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>; the committee of Ministers, chaired by myself, concerned to implement the recommendations of the Culliton report on industry and services; the task force, mainly composed of departmental Secretaries, who will report to the committee of Ministers on the measures to implement the Culliton report and the <Col N="2388" /> recently established task force on the tourist industry composed of industry specialists and representatives of the four commercial banks.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing specific initiatives, the general thrust of Government fiscal policy, as reflected in the revised Programme for Government, is to create the personal taxation climate which is most conducive to the creation of jobs. It is also fundamental to Government jobs policy to continue, in consultation with the social partners, the consensus approach to economic and social policies which in recent years has made our economy a low-inflation cost-competitive one. We have already seen that that general economic climate has resulted in increased employment in recent years which amounted to 41,000 in the four years from April 1987 and to 75,000 in the private non-agricultural sector in the same period.</P>
    <P>The Government are, however, far from satisfied with the rate of success in converting economic growth into increased employment.  For that reason, we will be considering what specific new initiatives we can take.  I, together with the relevant Ministers, will be meeting the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as soon as such a meeting can be arranged.  I am also considering the various suggestions that have been made by Opposition parties, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others, for some kind of forum in which new measures necessary to create employment could be studied and discussed.</P>
    <P>A major influence on job creation throughout the decade will be exerted by the increased Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty.  At the European Council in Lisbon in June, I will be fully supporting President Delors' proposals that the structural and cohesion funding for the four Objective 1 countries be doubled. This increased funding will operate from 1 January 1994 until the end of 1997 and the Government will now begin to develop their proposals to obtain the greatest possible share of that increased <Col N="2389" /> funding.  Our proposals must give the highest priority to assigning job creation since we now, unfortunately, have the highest unemployment rate in the Community.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that whatever new initiatives we take will be practical and successful and take account of the existing special initiatives which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I am not yet, therefore, in a position to say what new initiatives the Government will take or whether there should be any re-organisation among the existing bodies I have mentioned.  The matter is, however, being very actively considered because of the top priority we give to the creation of jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware we face the prospect, between now and the end of the century, that the number entering the workforce will exceed the number reaching retirement age by about 25,000 per year?  If that trend continues we could, without much changing, find ourselves with 500,000 people unemployed here within the next eight years. Would the Taoiseach consider from any point of view &mdash; politically, socially or economically &mdash; that that would be totally unsustainable and that in the true meaning of the word we will face an emergency so far as jobs are concerned over the next eight to ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that if we were to stand still and not be very successful in the creation of jobs we could reach a figure not too far away from that mentioned by the Deputy but that would be to assume a defeatist attitude in relation to job creation and a worse scenario in relation to world trade on which we depend so much here in Ireland, we have to export £2 out of every £3 we produce. The external environment is important in that regard.  I am also well aware that to provide jobs for the number of young people coming into the labour force and given the age structure of our population, would require an increase in job creation of between 3.5 and 4 per cent.  That level of increase is a major challenge for any Government, and I am not aware of any <Col N="2390" /> developed country which creates jobs at that rate in any particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government any projections of their own, based on existing policies being pursued by the Government, as to what the level of unemployment will be, say, three or four years for now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that detail on my file as of now but I can assure the Deputy that I am giving top priority to the weaknesses in our economic structure in relation to job creation.  We are all very familiar with the mismatch in our economy.  In 1990, for example, there was a growth rate of about 7.25 per cent and thousands of jobs were created but not anything like the number we could expect from that level of growth.  I have already been in touch with the European Community and the OECD to organise a major study to find out the reasons and the causes for this mismatch within the economy.  Our linkages are not as good as they should be but we know that these can be improved.  Nevertheless, that does not answer the full question.  There are many questions to be answered to determine what the policy initiatives should be in the future in addition to what I have already mentioned here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that for him to say that a projection as to the level of unemployment just three years from now is just &ldquo;a detail&rdquo; which he does not have on his file is to suggest that he has no appreciation of the seriousness of this social crisis and brings into question whether he should be in the job he is in at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I put it to the Taoiseach that the fiscal policies which were pursued by him on behalf <Col N="2391" /> of the Government when Minister for Finance and which added £2.5 billion to the national debt, reversed the declining trend in the EBR and put upward pressure on interest rates are one of the fundamental causes of the unemployment crisis we now face.  Would he not agree that a reversal of these policies is a prerequisite for creating employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>I think he is talking about the hallucinations that he has in bed at night in relation to this matter.  I would remind the Deputy and the House, and anybody else concerned, that 1989 was my first year as Minister for Finance a year in which public expenditure was lower than in 1987.  Consequently, I reduced the level of expenditure, as a percentage of GNP.  At the same time I reduced the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  There was a world recession in 1990.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Again, would the Taoiseach not agree that while he was Minister for Finance he added £2.5 billion to the national debt, that in <Col N="2392" /> 1991 the EBR, which had been declining since 1987, began to rise again as a result of his budget, that there is upward pressure on interest rates and that these factors are contributing to the highest level of unemployment since the foundation of this State which at present, on the most modest estimate, is 288,000 persons? Would the Taoiseach not take this into account and agree that a change in this fiscal policy, which has been reinforced in the 1992 budget, is a prerequisite for making any dent in this record level of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>I would also remind him that between 1987 and 1991 we reduced the differential between German and Irish interest rates which stood at 9 per cent in 1987 to less than 1 per cent in 1991.  Contrary to what he is claiming this situation has been brought under control. As soon as the position in Germany changes, probably in the middle of this year, it is likely that we will see a reduction in German interest rates and, consequently, a reduction in Irish interest rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, first, after the very lengthy reply he has given, if there is any proposal anywhere that will create a single job? Second, the Taoiseach referred to the success of his own businesses for which I am sure all of us in this House rejoice, but would he not agree that, in the running of his own business, if he went to a meeting to discuss it he would have available to him projections for two to three years ahead?  Yet he came in here to discuss unemployment and, by his own admission, did not have any projections in <Col N="2395" /> respect of employment.  Will the Taoiseach agree that if he proposes to run the country as he would wish to run a business, he should at least equip himself with the necessary information, such as projections about the levels of unemployment, which is the most basic information one would have for a realistic discussion?</P>

The Deputy knows as well as I do, as a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, that you do not issue directives about an industry. The Deputy also asked a petty question about projections: I have no hesitation in providing him with projections if he needs them but one does not expect to go into that kind of detail in an argumentative fashion on the floor of the House.

      <Quest>if he or his Department maintain any reviews of the impact of national lottery funding on the proper planned development of the arts in Ireland; if he will consider such a review on an ongoing basis to ensure that the principle of additional rather than replacement funding is maintained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national lottery funding has enabled a very substantial increase to be made in funding arts and culture.  Total Government funding for the Arts Council and the national cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department in 1986, before the introduction of national lottery funding, was £6.702 million whereas in 1992 it is £13.572 million, of which £8.604 million came from the national lottery.</P>
      <P>Since the inception of national lottery funding, a total of £75 million has been allocated by my Department to arts and culture projects of which £43.85 million was derived from the national lottery. The Arts Council have been a major beneficiary and will receive this year total grants of approximately £10 million, compared to £6 million in 1986, an increase of 67 per cent, well above the cumulative rate of increase in inflation which amounted to less than 17 per cent in this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the national lottery funding has been additional to Exchequer funding.  The impact on arts and culture of Government funding, including national lottery funding, is kept under constant review in conjunction with the Arts Council who are the statutory body mainly charged with funding the arts.  I am satisfied that the increased funding in recent years has been very beneficial in the development of our artistic and cultural life but I am also aware that further <Col N="2398" /> increases in funding are extremely desirable and are considered very necessary in some areas.</P>
    <P>The severe constraints on the public finances, however, makes this very difficult but, subject to those constraints, I will be concerned to ensure that funding of arts and culture receives sympathetic consideration in the allocation of Exchequer resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that when the national lottery legislation went through this House it was on the basis that one-third of the surplus funds would go to arts and culture?  Will he restore that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves.  However, I do not think any Deputy would like to pursue a statistical approach in relation to the arts.  In 1986, before the days of lottery funding, total Government funding for the Arts Council and national cultural institutions under this Department was £6.70 million.  The corresponding figure is now £13.572 million. Most people accept that whether it is lottery or Exchequer funding the significant factor is that there has been an increase in the total allocation.  As I said, the figures speak for themselves and people generally must be pleased that the sum allocated is a very good reflection of the interest shown by this Government &mdash; and by previous Governments &mdash; in the arts and culture.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on Thursday, 13 February, appointed Deputy Tom Kitt, on my nomination, to be Minister of State at my Department with special responsibility for arts and culture and for women's affairs.</P>

      <P>My question asked whether the Taoiseach intends to appoint a Minister of State with specific responsibilities for women's affairs, in other words, with sole responsibility for that area.  I am sure the Taoiseach will acknowledge that it is an area which requires the undivided attention of a Minister of State given that it relates to the business of almost half the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have seen in recent times, particularly in regard to the recent court case, crucial issues need to be dealt with.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, is responsible for arts, culture, European and women's affairs.  Will the Taoiseach agree that, despite the Deputy's obvious abilities, it is too wide a brief and that a <Col N="2400" /> specific Minister should be appointed for women's affairs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is a very good, young and active man who is well able to shoulder the burden of the briefs we have entrusted to him.  All members of the Government have responsibility for the advancement of the status of women in their own areas.  I assure the House that I am fully committed to the advancement of women in all areas as far as it is reasonably possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the appointment of women, which is covered in a later question in my name, is only one aspect of women's affairs?  Given that women account for almost half the population and that they have traditionally been discriminated against in a whole range of areas of life, the Taoiseach would be doing some good if he appointed a Minister of State with sole responsibility in that area.  It would give confidence to Irish women if they saw the Government were finally taking their concerns seriously rather than lumping them in with issues that are equally important.  European affairs, arts and culture are equally important as women's affairs, but I believe a case can be made for the appointment of a separate Minister of State with primary responsibility for that area.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he has considered the possibility of meeting the other Heads of Government, including the British Prime Minister, on the attitude of Governments to the Commission proposals on the financing of the Community which were published during the past week and which assume that the MacSharry proposals will be accepted in full in their budgetary provisions?  A number of Governments have already indicated their objections to these proposals. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he supports the Commission proposals in their present form or believes that the financial ceiling should be raised further?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have set a national framework in place for the achievement of gender balance in top positions, through their acceptance of the recommendations in the First Statement of the Commission on the Status of Women.  The key recommendations in question are: targets for gender-balance between women and men in appointments to the boards of State-sponsored bodies; and a commitment to nominate a woman to the Top Level Appointments Committee which interviews candidates for the highest tier of posts in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The Government are currently working towards the achievement of the targets for the appointment of women to State boards.  I hope to be in a position to appoint a woman to the Top Level Appointments Committee in the Civil Service at an early date.  As for possible new initiatives in this area, I expect that the final report of the Commission on the Status of Women, which is due next June, will address this issue further.  The Government will consider very carefully any additional recommendations the commission may make on this subject.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that there are only about 14 per cent of women on the boards of State-sponsored bodies and that the Government have the right to appoint two-thirds of those positions.  In view of the fact that there are only 69 women holding such position out of a total of 200 places, may I ask the Taoiseach if the Government have a specific timetable for filling vacancies or even replacing some men with women and what that timetable might be?  May I ask him also if there are any vacancies to be filled at present and if he proposes to appoint women to these positions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information in relation to vacancies.  As regards my Department the Commission's recommendation is being observed.  Women have been appointed to two vacancies on the board of the Abbey Theatre; two women have been <Col N="2410" /> appointed to the board of the National Gallery of Ireland and five women to the board of the National Concert Hall. Moreover of the 15 members appointed to the Green 2,000 Advisory Group, six are women.  There are five women on the board of the National Heritage Council out of a total of 14.  I would also mention that a woman has been appointed to the Chair of the Custom House Docks Authority, the first such appointment to a commercial State body.  I hope the Deputy will accept that progress in this area across Government Departments will necessarily take time, and it will be expedited.  Every vacancy that arises will be considered in that regard.  I hope the Deputy will agree that while the commission's recommendation should be implemented as far as possible it should be subject, as the commission have acknowledged, to the need to appoint men where objective criteria so indicate. The Deputy can rest assured that overall the Government will make solid progress in response to the commission's recommendation and that this progress will be sustained.</P>

If it could not be implemented in the foreseeable future the Government should have indicated that, but they did not do so.  Is the Taoiseach aware that, without crudely demanding resignations from people certain members who wish to move over could be relieved of their positions and thus the number of women on boards could be increased?  Despite objective criteria, a positive action programme is operated throughout the western world.  This programme of advancement for women is recognised as the only way, in this century or the next, towards achieving equity for women.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under a Government decision of 28 March 1985 the responsibility for peacetime emergency planning, including any necessary co-ordination with other Departments, rests with the individual Departments for their own areas of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under a further Government decision <Col N="2414" /> taken on 3 September 1986 an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of the Environment and comprising also representatives of the Departments of Health, Defence and Justice were established to monitor and advise on (a) the preparation and testing of emergency plans by local authorities, health boards and the Garda, and (b) the co-ordination arrangements at national level to facilitate the response of agencies to major emergencies.</P>
    <P>The committee are an advisory, not an operational, body.  As the Deputy will therefore appreciate, responsibility for peacetime emergency planning, including any necessary co-ordination with other Departments, has for some time now rested with individual Departments in relation to their own areas of responsibility, and with the bodies responsible for emergency services under the aegis of those Departments.

In view of the Taoiseach's reply that the committee were an advisory body rather than an operational body, would he not agree that in such a capacity the committee do not have the necessary cohesion to put something into operation and that there is a need for one Department to co-ordinate the entire operation and for that procedure to tie in with the <Col N="2416" /> EC emergency services available from the headquarters in Brussels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Arts Report, to which the Deputy refers, was published as recently as 7 February last.  It was commissioned by the Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited, who, together with Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and the Arts Council, provided financial and other support for the compilation of the report. All four bodies were represented on the working group which oversaw the preparation of the report.  The report is, therefore, a matter for detailed consideration in the first instance by the agencies which commissioned it and I understand that they have not yet formally examined the report's proposals. In these circumstances, it would be premature for me to comment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister of State to his new responsibilities and wish him well.  I commend the publication of the report.  Whilst one would not expect a comment from the Minister of State at this stage, could he at least give a commitment that his Department will give active consideration to and support for the major provisions in the report?  I am sure the Minister of State would realise that the report makes profound recommendations for the development of the arts, particularly in Dublin County Council area, which he represents.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that his Department will consider and give practical support to the provisions when that support is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my copy of the <Col N="2418" /> report, which I received as a member of the Dublin County Council.  Deputy McCartan is also a member of the Dublin Corporation culture committee, so I have no doubt that he also has a copy.  I agree with Deputy McCartan that the document is very lengthy.  Much detailed work was carried out by The Dublin Arts Report working group, and I commend them for the detailed work.  The report is very informative on living arts as an essential element of the life of Dublin and its citizens.</P>
      <P>Ninety recommendations are made. From the perspective of Dublin County Council, there is, for example, the recommendation for the establishment of an arts committee and a cultural action plan for the Dublin area.  At this early stage in my Department I wish to give my total support for local initiative in relation to arts.  This is best dealt with at local level.</P>
      <P>As I said, four bodies commissioned this work.  In the interests of democracy, I should wait until I hear of the deliberations of those four agencies &mdash; which include Deputy McCartan's committee &mdash; and then make a detailed response. That would be premature at this stage, but the Deputy may be sure of my continued interest.</P>

      <P>Having welcomed the Minister of State a moment ago, I am now not sure whether I was perhaps a <Col N="2419" /> little previous in that.  Nonetheless, I am profoundly disappointed with the Minister's answer.  When the Minister has settled into office he might take time to review the position.  While the Arts Council might be happy with their remit for the moment, the arts community are certainly very disturbed.  I ask the Minister to at least undertake to review the definition contained in the legislation, which is extremely limiting and excludes the forms presented here.  Does the Minister of State know that the exclusion of dance, for instance, has led the Arts Council not to support that form of cultural and arts activity in recent years &mdash; and that is not to mention the shreds that the film industry is in.</P>

      <P>The questions raised by the Deputies are addressed comprehensively in the Green Paper.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I have a definitive commitment from the Minister in relation to a date for the publication of the Green Paper?  The Culliton report was quite scathing about our over orientation towards academic education to the exclusion of vocational, technical and practical education in many schools.  On foot of that is there not an immediate need to introduce to all second level schools a certain core technical curriculum? Should we not update and monitor all aspects of technical education here?</P>

      <P>With regard to my commitment to the Green Paper, I intend to publish the Reform of Education discussion paper, known as the Green Paper, in the first week in March.  I will not delay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy who has more knowledge of this at this juncture than 1. His philosophy is correct.  There is a need for more technical and vocational input at second level.  The Green Paper supports the Culliton report in its analysis and accepts that too much emphasis has <Col N="2422" /> been placed on the academic leaving certificate. It is not just the Green Paper and the Culliton report which support that view.  There have been other reports from CII, the OECD, the World Bank and so on which concluded that there is an urgent need to put greater emphasis on the non-academic areas in the leaving certificate curriculum.  I will look at whether we can do something about that in the short term, but it might be better to get on with the Green Paper and set a definite time limit to it and get to legislation as soon as possible.  My initial reservation about the Green Paper, which was quoted in some newspapers, was only to the extent of impatience, in that I wondered whether a Green Paper followed by a White Paper, followed by legislation was just too lengthy a process. Having examined it carefully I concluded that given the complexity of this subject, it is probably the wisest way to proceed.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a report on &ldquo;teachers and stress&rdquo; was published last December.  While accepting that teaching is a stressful profession, it must also be said that in recent years many improvements have occurred in teachers' conditions.</P>
      <P>I understand that the report makes recommendations in relation to a number of areas, including reduction in class size, curriculum reform, a code of behaviour, buildings and in-service training.  There have been many developments in these areas in recent times.  Stress is a factor most occupations have to reckon with and I hope that steady progress in these areas will help teachers in coping with the level of stress unavoidable in their profession.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the survey referred to 35 per cent of the 1,500 teachers interviewed showed signs of high levels of psychological stress and low levels of job satisfaction?  Would he agree that, resulting from the huge influx of teachers in the mid-sixties, teaching is now becoming a greying profession, that education is suffering from hardening of the arteries, that there is need to let people out at the top, allow in young highly motivated, trained, unemployed teachers to undertake the task?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's job is stressful, as indeed is mine.  I am afraid stress is something from which none of us can divorce ourselves.  All available medical advice is that a certain level of manageable stress is necessary for us to do our jobs properly, at the edge, as it were.  I have great sympathy for the difficulty in which teachers find themselves. These days they cannot afford to relax in front of classes.  I suppose pupils these days are somewhat less compliant than they used be.  In addition, the curriculum changes constantly and they must cope with those changes.  Also a stressful <Col N="2426" /> aspect for teachers is that quite rightly, parents are now much more demanding than they were in the past.  This report, the Deputy's input and other comments in regard to stress, all add up to the fact that it can be a stressful job.  Having said that, we have made very substantial progress in reducing the pupil/teacher ratio, in reforming the curriculum in some areas helpful to them, revising codes of conduct, updating schools buildings, improving in-service training and a range of items helping to take some pressure off teachers.  I cannot promise to remove it completely but we can endeavour to modernise their working conditions making life somewhat easier for them.</P>

      <P>Nonetheless would the Minister agree it would be good economic as well as educational sense to allow teachers out at the top salary scale of £22,000 per annum, and recruit them from the bottom of the scale, at £11,000 per annum?  Furthermore, would he agree that he should seriously examine the possibility of devising a new, meaningful early retirement scheme?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 44, 52, 57 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>As far as my Department are concerned there is no question of the Department of Education not being involved in the examination, certification and delivery of apprenticeship training programmes.</P>
      <P>These issues will be fully addressed in the forthcoming Green Paper.  I know the Deputy will appreciate it would not be appropriate for me to comment further pending issue of the Green Paper.  Following the publication there will be ample time for those inside and outside the education section to offer their views.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware, of course, that matters such as duration and entry qualifications for apprenticeship training are a matter for FÁS under the Industrial Training Act, 1967.</P>

      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of congratulating the Minister on his appointment.  No doubt it will take us some time to assess his attitude to various aspects of education.  I am not too clear on his reply. What I wanted to ascertain was whether he was aware that a new apprenticeship board was established, with one representative only of the Department of <Col N="2428" /> Education, without any consultation with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee who cater for 5,500 apprentices. They were not informed that that committee had been established or of its membership.  Will the Minister say whether the Department of Education are interested in the education elements of apprenticeship and how much of that education element will remain in the reduced two or three-year apprenticeship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine the point the Deputy made in regard to the apprenticeship board established.  I do not have the relevant information but I will check on it for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If I may be permitted to make this general comment: at this early stage in the Department I am not comfortable with the relationship obtaining, or the demarcation line between the Department and FÁS in that I see a need to tidy it up.  Certainly neither I nor the Minister for Labour will tolerate turf wars between the Department and FÁS which would be negative.  In that respect the Minister for Labour and I will have discussions at ministerial level, to be followed up by our officials, in order to ensure full co-ordination between the Department and FÁS.  However, at the end of the day, it does not matter that much whether it be the Department or FÁS who carry out a particular task. What is important is that the recipients of that service get the best possible service whoever happens to provide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be permitted to follow up some of the points the Minister made.  What I am talking about is the difference between skills training, educational training and craftsmanship.  Will the Minister investigate this aspect?  Is he aware that there are advertisements in London seeking straight wall bricklayers, at a lower rate of pay but that, when there is need for a bricklayer to turn a wall or build a pier, they get Irish &ldquo;brickies&rdquo; to undertake the task at a very high rate of pay because they are craftsmen. That is what the British system has <Col N="2429" /> done to apprenticeship, what I predict the FÁS training scheme will do to apprenticeship.  That is why I ask the Minister to examine this very carefully. We must remember that, generally speaking, apprentices are young people participating in an educational scheme, not merely learning a skill to know how to build one brick on top of another, but rather to be educated so that they can avail of a higher level of education later if they wish, which they do under the provisions of the present scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, it is absolutely essential that we maintain the standards of skill of our crafts people.  There is no question of the Department of Education backing out of this.  Rather they will play a full role in upholding the quality of Irish crafts people.  However, I am determined to sort out these silly turf wars between the Department of Education and FÁS, or between any agencies and Government Departments which, in the end, are negative and do not lead to any progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment of the debate I had reached section 43.  Lest I get myself into trouble with the Chair I wish to say something about protected roads, the title this section bears.  I find this to be a very curious kind of animal.  I looked at the former Minister's introductory remarks on Second Stage to ascertain what he had in mind by the term &ldquo;protected roads&rdquo; and I found the following remarks in the Official Report of 27 November last, at column 1310-11:</P>
      <P>.... the concept of a protected road is being introduced in addition to the re-enactment of legislative provisions for motorways and busways.  The protected road is intended as a &ldquo;halfway house&rdquo; between an ordinary public road, which has very limited access control or traffic restrictions, and a motorway, to which all access from adjoining lands is prohibited....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why there is need for this kind of &ldquo;halfway house&rdquo; between an ordinary public road and a motorway.  For example, am I to conclude that a dual carriageway is a protected road?  To cite the one I know best, is the Naas dual carriageway to be regarded as a protected road?  Is there any particular significance in identifying that class so that the various <Col N="2499" /> conditions that are set out in subsections (2) and (3) of this Bill can be applied to it?  I may be wrong, but as far as I know the conditions set out in subsections (2) and (3) do not actually apply today to the Naas dual carriageway.  Perhaps some of them should, and if it is proposed that they should, then I would like to know.</P>
    <P>I must say the concept of a protected road is a nice little exercise in language. I wonder what other kinds of protections may be envisaged.  When I was speaking earlier about motorways I omitted to mention that I would hope that the Minister and his Department and the proposed new roads Authority would pay particular attention to the need for fencing motorways.  I gather that the Ceann Comhairle has allowed my colleague, Deputy Allen, to talk to the Minister this evening about the problems of wandering horses.  I myself had an encounter with a wandering horse one night some years ago.  Luckily I did not suffer any damage. However, I was Minister for Finance at the time and the State had to put a new roof on the car.  Indeed, shortly after we had hit the horse and killed it, another driver, a lady this time, ran straight over it and injured herself, not too badly, but she was extremely stunned.  However, it was a wandering horse on the Naas dual carriageway at night.  It caused mayhem for a while and luckily no one was killed in that incident.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises with the stretch of dual carriageway that now goes across the Curragh where Kildare County Council have done an extremely effective job of fencing and putting grids on the access roads to that carriageway. However, from time to time fences get broken and sheep wander onto the roads, and that is extremely dangerous.  That is an aspect of motorway planning that should receive very close attention.  Our motorways should be protected roads in a sense different from that envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In section 44 there is provision for all kinds of prohibitions and restrictions of access and so on.  It is provided in subsection (1) (c) that planning permission <Col N="2500" /> or a decision to grant planning permission shall not be regarded as having been given for any development of land where such development would affect materially the exercise by the road authority of the rights proposed to be compulsorily acquired in relation to land under a scheme made by a road authority under section 45 of the Bill.  That seems to envisage the kind of case that we saw for so many years in the Clanbrassil Street area of Dublin where all development was stopped because there was a road plan by the local roads authority which they intended to get around to at some stage, and since development was stopped the area generally decayed.  This has changed quite a lot in recent times but I would hope that our National Roads Authority would not act under this subsection in a way that would replicate that kind of problem to any great extent around the country.</P>
    <P>Again it comes back to both the financial planning framework that we have for road projects and to how they are phased and how they are proceeded with because it is extremely bad that we should have either uncertainty or a freeze on activity for a long period.  It would be dangerous and totally undesirable to have a situation all around the country where development was frozen for a long period in the expectation of a road project coming on-stream and finding that that road project did not go ahead for many years.  We should not encourage such as a situation but should prevent it as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Again, there are interferences which are provided for in section 45 in respect of various planning permissions.  I find another concept in subsection (4) (c) (1) that is a little difficult for me to seize.  It speaks of planning permissions proposed to be revoked or modified under a scheme made under this section and the extent of such revocation or modification. I can understand the concept of the extent of a modification but I am not sure that I can understand the concept of the extent of a revocation.  It seems that something is either revoked or it is not. If it is revoked in part, then it is modified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2501" /> However, I wonder are there degrees of revocation that the Minister and his Department envisage.</P>
    <P>You will be delighted to hear, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that there is a whole swathe of sections here about which I do not propose to say anything because I think they are rather well drafted.  They have to do with the holding of public inquiries, environmental impact statements and environmental impact assessments. The only question I have, Sir &mdash; and I referred to it earlier &mdash; is why do we have this procedure for road plans and developments by public authorities generally when we have a totally different system for developments by private agencies? It seems that this system may be unnecessarily cumbersome, and although it is not peculiar to what is being provided for in this Bill, this Bill does give us an opportunity to look at it.  I would like the Minister to take a little time to outline for us what he believes the advantages of this procedure are over the normal planning procedure that the rest of the world and the private sector generally have to go through.</P>
    <P>Section 51 deals with the control of works by a State authority and so on.  I have only one small quibble with that.  I find that in subsection (2) (c) it is provided that the Authority or the Minister may, at their or his discretion, cause an oral hearing to be heard.  Oral hearings have a very important part to play in all of this procedure because they provide the only forum in which members of the public can feel that they are directly involved in the process.  I know there are entitlements built into this Bill for objection or representation, although I have asked the Minister to specify for us who may object.  Oral hearings have a particular place in the process because they provide the only opportunity for the ordinary public to be involved in a way they can appreciate.  I am not suggesting that I want oral hearings about every single objection, but there are a great many cases where I believe an oral hearing could help to clear the air, allay fears and remove objections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2502" /> My question is, are there any guidelines as to the exercise of this discretion by the Minister or by the Authority, or is it to be another one of all these decisions that are made by the Minister with his advisers without ever having to account for the reasons to anybody else? I do not ask the question in a hostile way but I would like the Minister to indicate if there are any practices or guidelines.  I would like him to indicate also if he would consider, as a general rule, leaning more favourably towards the idea of having oral hearings, especially for the bigger cases.  I know that in all the motorway cases where an inquiry has to be held there is public involvement, although I think it would be fair to say that many people feel those inquiries do not make much difference.  This view may be mistaken in many cases but it is the popular view.  That is not the matter we have to talk about now.  However, a more frequent use of the oral hearing procedure would help to inform the public and assure the public that their concerns are being taken into account.  Since the Taoiseach has recently said he wants to have a more open form of Government, it is a sentiment and an aspiration that could usefully be brought into legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>Section 52 deals with the provision of service areas to motorways and protected roads.  I should like to ask a question about planning principles.  Are there any guidelines as to the frequency of service areas on motorways or on protected roads?  I know there are fairly strong guidelines regarding the number of junctions and the number of access and entry points.  I gather that the general practice is that they should be at least eight kilometres apart.  Are there any guidelines of that kind in relation to the provision of service areas?  It is not, perhaps, so much a problem in this country as it may be in others.  I am sure the Minister has had the experience of driving long distances on motorways in continental Europe and there are times when the pressure of events gets to the point where one wishes there was a service area nearby for one <Col N="2503" /> reason or another.  There appears to be fairly liberal provisions in most of the member states of the Community in relation to the frequency of service areas. Are there any such guidelines here?</P>
    <P>There is a provision here also that allows a road authority, with the consent of the Minister, to provide or operate service areas.  Is that a new power which is being given under the terms of this Bill, or does it already exist?  I do not have any position on principle on it.  If a road authority feel they can make some money out of running a service area then the best of luck to them.  I am sure there will be the usual arguments from people in the private sector.  I suppose on the whole we could expect this is a power that would be very little used by road authorities because they would prefer to have private investment in that area.</P>
    <P>I note that the Authority may, with the consent of the Minister, provide guidelines in relation to the provision or operation of these service areas.  Perhaps that will give the Minister an opportunity to tell us what he has in mind in terms of those guidelines.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with toll roads.  This is an area where it would be helpful to have a much more comprehensive statement of the Minister's policy approach to toll roads because there are a number of things that seem to be overlooked in the argument about tolling.  There have been arguments here about tolling the Naas by-pass.  There was a particularly difficult argument about the tolling of the new high level crossing of the Liffey at Strawberry Beds and there was an argument about tolling other sections of that particular road.  If memory serves me well, a toll plaza was built at one stage, apparently without authorisation, and it had to be removed at some considerable cost to the taxpayer &mdash; something in the region of £100,000 was spent on building and taking away this toll plaza.</P>
    <P>We need a debate here about the policy and the philosophy of tolling to give us some idea of the circumstances in which a toll can reasonably be applied.  I do not know whether the Minister has any ideas <Col N="2504" /> about this because, if so, he has not told us and if his predecessor had such plans he did not tell us either.  It seems there are some simple principles one can set up.  For example, a facility like the East Link bridge or the high level crossing of the Liffey, which saves people much time and a long circuitous route which would be the alternative route, is an obvious case for tolling.  I do not think there is much argument about that.  The argument becomes a little more complex when you look at tolling sections of roads.  There was a fairly extensive debate about a proposal to toll the Naas bypass in my own constituency.  If I appear to make many references to my own constituency it is only because most of the motorways in his country happen to pass through my constituency or most of those which are currently planned, apart from the Dublin ring road.  It does not do us much good in terms of the provision of county roads as we are very badly treated by the Minister in relation to funding for county roads, but the motorways are located there.</P>
    <P>There was a fairly extensive debate about the idea of tolling the Naas bypass. In the end Kildare County Council &mdash; I think quite sensibly &mdash; decided against it on the grounds that the tolling operation would not succeed because the route was too short, the alternative routes were too easily available and did not create a huge time penalty for travellers and there was a desire to have several access points onto that bypass.  That seems to suggest that if we are to apply tolls successfully a number of conditions would have to be met.  First, the toll portion in question would have to be of a reasonable length and I think it should be at least 20 miles long to make it worth while.  Second, alternative routes should be considerably longer or much less convenient.  Third, there should not be high frequency of access points on the route.</P>
    <P>One can see those principles in operation on motorways that are tolled in other countries.  In France, for example, you will find that on all tolled roads there is a considerable distance between access points; they are certainly much further <Col N="2505" /> apart than eight kilometres which is the practice here.  More frequently you will find they are anything from 40 kilometres to 60 kilometres apart.  That means there is a substantial saving in time compared to alternative routes.  Once you are on the motorway and if you pay the toll you will stay on it for quite a while.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration also which has to do with the density of the road network and the density of population. Even though we have a much lower density of population in the country generally than any of the other member states of the European Community, we have a higher density of road network.  We have more roads per square kilometre of land area than almost any other member state in the European Community.  We are used to having a very wide and diverse road network. Those are not the conditions that make for easy agreement on tolling a new road and that is something we will have to bear in mind in looking at proposals for tolls.</P>
    <P>In practical terms it would be worth while to impose a toll on a road if we had the mythical one I talked about earlier which went from Newlands Cross to Portlaoise. That would be a stretch of road that would be well worth tolling and it would be a viable proposition both for the authority providing the road and maintaining it and for people travelling on it.  The proposal to toll the Naas bypass was definitely a loser on all counts, both on policy terms and in terms of practicality. I may be wrong about all these things.  They are the simple observations of an ordinary traveller who also has an interest in getting value for money out of public expenditure.  If I am wrong about that I would like to be told how, where and why I am wrong.  Above all, I would like to hear from the Minister his policy approach to proposals for tolling a facility of this kind.  It is not possible to infer what his policy approach would be from a consideration of the relevant sections in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 59 (3) and (6) give the Minister more power to get his finger into the pie. For example, subsection (3) provides that bylaws &mdash; these are bylaws for tolls&mdash;<Col N="2506" /> shall have no effect unless and until the Minister approves them.  Subsection (6) (a) provides that the Minister may by order&mdash;this is one of those passive orders so far as I can remember&mdash;approve the bylaws with or without modifications, or he may refuse to approve them.  Therefore the relevant authorities, who will consult with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochana and so on in drawing up toll bylaws, may find that the Minister, without telling them the reason can come along and approve the bylaws with or without modifications or that he may refuse to approve them.  It is not stated on what basis the Minister may modify or approve them or indeed refuse to approve them.  Again, no guidelines are given for the edification of the public or the legislator as to what kind of considerations will move the Minister to make any of those decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 61 deals with agreements for financing, maintenance, construction and operation of toll roads.  This area has been the subject of much discussion in the past.  I might add that it is a very vexed area.  I hope I will not break any confidences when I say that I had proposals put to me at one stage for a toll operation.  In effect the proposal amounted to a suggestion that the State would provide 80 per cent of the capital, that private enterprise would provide 20 per cent of the capital but that they would also have access to revenue from the tolls for a period of 30 years.  I should say that that was one of the very early proposals put to me and neither the State nor the private sector had any geat experience of the operation up until then.  Indeed, at that time there was only one toll scheme in operation.</P>
    <P>It seemed to be a very bad deal for the State and that the kind of return the State would get on its money, both in terms of the benefit of the project itself and the financial return that would come from it, did not justify an agreement to the deal put up.  Eventually it was withdrawn because I objected to the terms.  It did not prove possible to have the terms modified to make them acceptable to me.</P>
    <P>I gather that further proposals have <Col N="2507" /> been made in the meantime &mdash; some years have passed since then &mdash; but none of them has become a concrete proposal except one.  Of course, I was under a lot of pressure at the time to agree to what was being put forward as a very creative way of funding part of the public capital programme.  The conclusion I came to at the time was that for what is was going to cost the State it would be cheaper for the State to borrow money directly on the gilt market rather than enter into this type of agreement.  Rightly or wrongly, that always seemed to be a reasonable test of whether we should regard a project as being attractive, because I could not justify either to myself or to anyone else a proposition that in order to have a &ldquo;creative&rdquo; approach to these problems I should end up paying more for the project than I needed to pay when I could have resort to funding through the gilt market.</P>
    <P>All these considerations will apply when we come to look at agreements for financing, maintenance, construction and operation of toll roads.  There will always be a temptation and a great deal of pressure on the Minister to look at innovative proposals for financing these roads and always a temptation for the Government to accept proposals that amount in one way or another to off balance sheet financing of a part of the public capital programme.  It looks nice on the accounting side and it may have a cosmetic effect on the Exchequer borrowing requirement in any given year, but it does not have any real effect for taxpayers because at the end of the day what we have to look at is the bottom line and what it is going to cost the State.</P>
    <P>Some of the ideas and projects which are put forward amount simply to a device for deferring the shouldering of the cost by the State.  I think that they have to be looked at with a great deal of suspicion, because there is usually a very rosy view of the way interest rates and rates of return are going to change in the period between the construction of the project and the time the State has to take it over, typically 20 to 30 years down <Col N="2508" /> the road.  They have to be subjected to rigorous analysis because, wherever the burden may seem to lie in the short term, at the end of the day it falls on the State and there is no way out of this unless of course we find cases where particular pieces of infrastructure or facilities will be provided by private enterprise and constructed and maintained wholly by private enterprise without recourse to the State.  I am not aware of any such proposal. On the face of it such a proposal would seem to be much more attractive than any of the mixed financing proposals that I have seen and read about.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will have plenty of advice which will echo much of what I have to say and that he will get plenty of advice to ignore it, but I hope that he resists it.  Having said that, whatever conclusion he comes to in particular cases, I wonder if the Minister would consider publishing the terms of such agreements. I may have missed it, but it seems there is nothing in the Bill that would require him to do so.  A good deal of the State's financial activities takes place more or less in the background and it is not specifically or explicitly published, but in respect of most of the financial activity of the State there is a way of actually finding out what is going on, how much the State is paying for its money and how it goes about getting it.  Apart from anything else, the financial sector in this country is so small that the word gets around fairly quickly.  In any case the State is such a big operator on the market that it is very difficult for the State to do anything without it being noticed.</P>
    <P>The situation may be a little bit different when we talk about the activities of a roads authority under an agreement made on the lines of the specifications of this Bill.  It would be useful, and certainly helpful in informing public debate, if agreements of the kind envisaged were published.  I see no reason they should not be.  People talk about the need for commercial confidentiality.  That is clearly very important when we reach the stage where a project goes to tender, where people are competing for the work, but once an agreement is made it <Col N="2509" /> is a perfectly legitimate object of public concern and the Minister should consider publishing these.  In case the Minister gets the idea that I would single out himself or his Department or the new National Roads Authority, I can assure him that I would not, because I think the details of the financial dealings of the State, particularly in relation to major infrastructural programmes, should be published far more.  Apart from anything else, the public and this House need to know what the basis of these agreements is so that we can form an idea as to whether policy is getting us good value for the taxpayers' moneys.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill, which is headed &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;, deals with a number of peripheral but nevertheless important issues, the first of which is cycleways.  I am glad that provision is being made for cycleways and I am sure that this will be welcomed all around the country.  I expect to hear one of the spokespersons of the Green Party claiming credit for cycleways because they seem to think they are the only ones who ride bikes. Perhaps if they rode bikes a bit more they would know more about what is going on around them.  However, I am delighted to see that the good sense which has caused councillors of many parties to urge that cycleways be provided has finally arrived and is now incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope cycleways will be provided widely throughout the country, not because I have a romantic idea that cycling is a pleasant activity, is good for us and has nice associations, but rather because it forms a part of traffic planning in towns and cities which has been very much neglected.  If we encouraged people to use bicycles far more we could help to solve some of the problems of congestion and pollution in towns and cities.  Let nobody tell me that we do not have pollution in our towns.  It is not only in Dublin that there is serious pollution from traffic.  If you stand in the main street of Naas on a Saturday afternoon when it is busy you will get a fair amount of what ordinary people call pollution &mdash; it smells like hell &mdash; from traffic going by. <Col N="2510" /> That is pollution, whatever the air quality measurements may say.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see provision for cycleways in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether he will suggest guidelines which might provide, for example, that where possible cycleways will be totally separate from roadways. Obviously, in a city it could be difficult to do that in many areas, but it is a matter at which we should look because motorists and cyclists are a mutual danger to each other a lot of the time and it would help with traffic management and general comfort if cycleways were where possible separated from the roads and carriageway.</P>
    <P>Section 66 deals with temporary dwellings on national roads, etc.  It refers to the protected roads mentioned in section 43.  I have a question in regard to that, largely one of definition.  Does this prohibition of the erection, placing or retention of temporary dwellings on national roads, motorways, busways and protected roads apply before the roads are categorised or afterwards?  I gather that the problem being dealt with here is one we have seen quite frequently, where members of the travelling community see a nice new section of roadway completed but not yet used, move in and occupy the area.  I do not know whether this section of the Bill could apply in that case because it seems to me that until the road is finished it will not be categorised.  I suspect that perhaps the Bill may not deal with the manifestation of the problem most frequently seen and may deal with something else which is less of a problem but which nevertheless should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Section 67 pulled me up with a bit of a start because it seems to provide substantial powers for roads authorities to require owners of land or buildings in the vicinity of roads to do many things. Section 67 (2) (a) provides that the owner or occupier of land shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on the land is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road.  Who decides whether it is a hazard?  My conclusion <Col N="2511" /> from reading the Bill is that the roads authority in question decide whether it is a hazard.  That leads to certain things because subsection (2) (b) provides that where the roads authority have come to this conclusion they may serve a notice in writing on the owner or occupier of the land on which such tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation is situated requiring the preservation, felling, cutting, lopping, trimming or removal of such tree, shrub, etc. on the grounds that they are a traffic hazard.  It seems that the roads authority decide whether these things are hazards and order the owner of the land on which is situated the tree, shrub, etc. to have it lopped, felled or any of the other things proposed in the section.  I wonder if we need to give a roads authority such a substantial power.  I may be wrong, but I do not think they have that power at present.  I can see that hedges by reason of their height might create traffic hazards at bends or corners, but I am not too sure whether that is always the case.</P>
    <P>It is the practice over much of the country &mdash; there is a lot of it in my constituency and in the Minister's constituency of North Tipperary &mdash; for farmers to trim their hedges from time to time.  Some of them do it for practical reasons, some do it for aesthetic reasons &mdash; although these days they cannot afford to do much for aesthetic reasons.  In the course of doing it they destroy the natural habitat of a good many species, particularly birds.  There is enough pressure on the environment already without road authorities coming along and in the name of traffic safety requiring owners or occupiers to carry out all these functions.  I wonder if that power is not excessive.  At the very least, I should like to have some idea of what may lead them to decide that a particular tree, shrub, etc. is a hazard or a potential hazard and, if so, what to do about it.</P>
    <P>Of course, the landowners may object to this and bring a case to the District Court, which is provided for later in the section.  However, subsection (5) (b) provides that no appeal shall lie to the Circuit <Col N="2512" /> Court from a decision of the District Court under this section.  Why?  I do not know whether there is justification for closing an avenue of redress which people normally had.  Are there any precedents for saying that there shall be no further jurisdiction and, if so, what are they? I know that going to court is expensive and tedious and I do not think that people would resort to it often.  However, I wonder if the principle is so important that we should say there is no appeal from a decision of the District Court, particularly since later on in subsections (8), (9), (10) and (11) there are powers for the roads authority to carry out the works themselves or to have them carried out at somebody else's charge where the landowner in question refuses or fails to carry out the work.  Are all those powers needed?  Would a smaller number of powers secure the aim which the Minister has in mind in making these provisions in the Bill?</P>
    <P>Section 68 deals with unauthorised signs, caravans and so on on public roads. I am given to understand that one of the objects of this section is to regulate street trading and markets.  Like many other Members of the House, I have had representations about this from people who like the idea of this section and from those who do not.  I dislike this section. There are a number of places &mdash; not as many as there are elsewhere &mdash; where street trading in various forms has been a long tradition or has grown up in recent years.  Indeed, street trading in Dublin has always been a very vexed question. However, I like street trading and street traders because they bring a bit of colour to our towns and cities which otherwise would be lacking.  They bring character to shopping which otherwise would also be lacking and I cannot for the life of me see that they do any long term damage to settled traders.</P>
    <P>In my own town of Kildare, for example, there is a market every Thursday morning in The Square.  It is a very lively place.  It causes dreadful traffic congestion. People like to park as near to the market as they can get.  The Square is an important parking place in Kildare <Col N="2513" /> and when it is occupied by stalls cars cannot be parked there, leading to more congestion.  Even without the bypass, that extra bit of congestion on a Thursday morning is a small price to pay for the extra life it brings to the town.  I enjoy markets.  The market held in Athy on Tuesdays may be less lively than the one held in Kildare, but nevertheless it adds colour and life to the town.  Although some of my neighbours have spoken to me about it, I am not convinced that a street market of that kind interferes with settled traders or takes any business away from them.  I believe a market is far more likely to increase the amount of business in a town than reduce it.  If the intention of this section is to restrict those markets, then I oppose it; I do not like the idea.</P>
    <P>Markets have many other advantages. People will allege that traders in these markets are trading unfairly and operating in a grey area half way into the black economy.  Quite frankly, I regard that as a problem for the Revenue Commissioners and the other people who are supposed to regulate the way we pay our taxes.  While it may be true, I do not think the allegation that a number of these people have a slightly cavalier attitude to paying their taxes is a good enough reason to interfere with street trading.  I hope the Minister can assure me that it is not the objective of this section to crack down on street trading.  I should like to see street trading encouraged for the sake of the colour and variety it brings into our lives.</P>
    <P>I have to say &mdash; there might be one or two examples of this in the Minister's constituency which he might look at &mdash; that markets are a great place to canvass during elections.  It is a delightful experience to canvass people in a market.  I am not saying that it is worth keeping these markets for this reason only but it is a side benefit.</P>

      <P>No, but their customers are.  That is the point.  One will also meet people from a long distance around a <Col N="2514" /> town.  The market in Kildare is perfectly located and people from all over the county come into it.  Indeed some people from outside the county also come into that market.  Now that the Deputy has reminded me, I ought to say that markets are a great venue for social intercourse. The market held at Brownstown on the Curragh on Sundays &mdash; this has been contested by local people &mdash; has become quite famous.  I have met people from as far afield as County Tipperary at that market.  Some people go to the market four or five times a year, not necessarily to buy things but for the crack.  They like the atmosphere, meeting people and sauntering around looking at what is available and what people are selling and buying.  These markets are an addition to our cultural life.  They do not cost the State anything and I would hate to see this section of the Bill being used to adopt a more restrictive approach to these markets than was the case up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is that you might call an unsolicited testimonial.  I will put it on my election literature.</P>
      <P>This brings me to section 9, which deals with signs.  It contains certain restrictions in this respect.  Section 9 (b) provides that this section shall not apply to a sign which relates to a Presidential election, a general election, a byelection, local election, referendum, etc.  The provisions in relation to signs do not apply to elections. I wonder if the Minister might go a little further and give road authorities the power to designate sites for advertising during the elections as specified here and ban this pole plastering with election posters which takes place.  This would be an excellent idea.  One hesitates to say that this is done in other countries, but it is.  To my knowledge during elections in France and Belgium sites are designated for use by political parties: they can put their posters on these designated sites but not elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This might turn out to be better for parties and the electorate than the present practice where people shin up poles as far as they possibly can so that the other mob will not be able to pull down their posters.  Because they want to make sure that the poster will stay on the pole they put it as high up as they can. Sometimes they wrap two posters back to back around a pole and staple the edges together.  As a result the posters are so far up the pole and so bent and curved that the potential voter cannot read them.  The people who put up these posters go away thinking they have done a great job for their candidate when all they have done is put up the posters so high on the pole that nobody can read them.  The more creative people stick posters on each side of an old bread tray and fix the tray perpendicular to a pole. That is a different job altogether.  Perhaps the Minister will look at the issue of putting up posters during elections.  The Bill will give parties seven days after an election in which to remove posters.  Perhaps the Minister could do something <Col N="2516" /> creative in regard to this issue which would help to tidy up the countryside during the course of elections.</P>
    <P>Section 69 deals with the extinguishment of public rights of way.  The Minister's predecessor when introducing this Bill said nothing at all about this issue. Although I like the &ldquo;extinguishment&rdquo; I am suspicious of the concept. &ldquo;Extinguishment&rdquo; is a grand word; it seems to be very old fashioned and has a great ring to it.  This section proposes that local authorities can decide to extinguish a public right of way for their own good reasons.  I should like to know why local authorities should extinguish public rights of way.  It seems that it would be more in keeping with the duties of local authorities to provide and open up rights of way rather than extinguish them.  I should like the Minister to say why he believes there should be a lengthy and separate section in the Bill dealing with the extinguishment of public rights of way.  As I said, it would seem to be more appropriate for public authorities to open rights of way rather than extinguish them.</P>
    <P>Section 70 deals with road races.  While I am delighted that this section is included in the Bill, it seems to take a rather grudging approach to the organisation of road races.  There are great cyclists in my constituency and people are very fond of cycle races.  From time to time roads are closed to facilitate cycle races, foot races and other kind of races.  Over the past ten or 15 years public roads have rarely been closed for motor racing, apart from rallying.  A year or two ago there was a debate about the possibility of starting an Irish Formula One Grand Prix, which I would dearly love to see.  It was proposed to close some roads in Dún Laoghaire to facilitate the race.  Of course, there were the inevitable local objections to this proposal. People have a perfect right to do this, but I think it is an awful pity.  I must confess to a secret passion for motor racing and I would love to see a Formula One Grand Prix race being held in Ireland.  I hope the residents of Dún Laoghaire who objected to this race will think again.  One thing is sure &mdash; I know Dún Laoghaire very well because I lived <Col N="2517" /> not far from there for a few years &mdash; that no Formula One Grand Prix race could ever be held over any conceivable course around Dún Laoghaire unless the surface of the roads was made the subject of major improvement.  Far from objecting to the idea of holding a Grand Prix there, it would be very much in the interests of the residents of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire to agitate for it to be held because their roads system would be improved to a greater extent than they are likely to be for a long time under present policies. I hope I do not sound frivolous in saying that.  I am quite serious about it because I would like to see a more open approach to the idea of closing roads from time to time in order to hold races of that kind.  The framing of sections 70 and 71 suggest that a restrictive view will be taken of this rather than an open view.</P>
    <P>Section 73 deals with the service of notices in relation to a whole series of matters.  I would like to know how subsection (1) is to apply.  It provides that whenever the Minister is satisfied in relation to a notice required to be served under this Act that reasonable grounds exist for dispensing with the service of the notice, and the dispensing with the service of the notice will not cause injury or damage to any person, he may dispense with it.  I would like to know how the Minister is going to come to that conclusion.  On what basis will he decide that he is going to dispense with the service of a notice?</P>
    <P>As a matter of general principle in all the issues and policy areas that are dealt with in this Bill we should adopt the principle that the more the public knows about it the better.  We should be very reluctant to find a reason for reducing the amount of public information given.  That is probably a principle that should be applied to the activities of agencies such as the Roads Authority and of local authorities generally.  I am glad to be able to say that to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to speak recently in this House about a case which involves local government, although it is not <Col N="2518" /> directly the Minister's business.  It was the case of water contamination in Naas, a problem which has been resolved. Remedial action appears to have been taken and we are being assured that it will not happen again.  However, there is an absolutely inexplicable reluctance on the part of the local authority and the health authority in question to tell the public in any detail what happened, how it happened, why it happened, what the results were and what is being done to prevent it happening again.  I have asked the Minister these questions in the House and I have been told that the Minister has no power to compel a local authority to issue any such report.  The Minister for Health has told me that he does not believe he is entitled to publish a report provided to him on a confidential basis by a local authority.  He may be right, but that flies in the face of the opening of blinds, of the open Government the Taoiseach talks about, and more importantly it flies in the face of common sense.</P>
    <P>In Naas and the surrounding districts people believe that something important is being kept from them.  The longer these reports remain unpublished the more suspicious people will be.  Perhaps they have a right to be suspicious &mdash; we do not know &mdash; but as a matter of general principle for the assurance of the public and for the benefit of public authorities who should be getting good advice from outside, we should adopt the principle of making as much information as possible available to the public rather than taking the view which seems to underlie section 73 of this Bill that we should find reasons for reducing the amount of information given.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister for your patience in listening to these considerations about various aspects of this Bill.  I am not being rude when I say that it is vain to expect the Minister to answer all these questions, but I would like him to address some of the issues of principle in relation to the main sections that I have dealt with.  This whole operation is so important for transport planning, infrastructural planning, economic <Col N="2519" /> development and the environment that we should ensure that on Committee Stage we deal properly with the issues which will have the most intimate affect on our people.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Dukes' very lengthy speech will be the longest speech on the Roads Bill whereas my speech will probably be the shortest. I intend to make only a few points.  First, I congratulate the new Minister for the Environment and wish him every success in his new portfolio.  He has done an excellent job in every portfolio he has held and I am sure he will do the same in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when money from the Structural Fund is being distributed a considerable amount of it will come westward. I welcome the introduction of the Roads Bill, 1991.  It is a step in the right direction.  The Structural Fund from the EC is very important.  In the previous speaker's excellent contribution he referred to the roads, by-passes and motorways in his constituency, but we could do with some of them in my constituency. At present there are plans before the Department for a dual carriageway from Sligo to Collooney.  For the last number of months I have made representations to the Minister for the Environment for the carrying out of an environmental impact study of the area. Perhaps the Minister would ensure that such a study is completed as soon as possible.  It can then be sent to Sligo County Council who will submit it to the Department of the Environment for funding.  The road from Collooney through Ballisodare into Sligo, is a bottlekneck.  The proposed by-pass would improve greatly that part of the <Col N="2520" /> Dublin-Sligo road from Sligo to Collooney. Therefore, I would appreciate it if the Minister would ensure that the environmental impact study is completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Sligo city in my constituency has rightly become the capital and the most important administrative centre in the northwest. It has sea and air links with other Irish cities and with Britain and Europe. There is an urgent need to develop and expand both these facilities.  There has been much talk in recent times about the Sligo railway line which links Sligo with Dublin.  That railway line needs to be upgraded, and thankfully money is being provided for that purpose.  The result will be to take a lot of traffic off our roads. The policy in Europe at the moment is to build railway lines to take more traffic off the roads and to help alleviate pollution of the countryside.</P>
    <P>There is evidence of great need to develop, improve and extend the national primary road that links Sligo with different cities where the major industrial and commercial centres and the major seaports are situated.  The Department have a plan to develop the Curlews bypass, which would link Castlebaldwin in County Sligo with Boyle in County Roscommon.  The present road through the Curlews is narrow and winding. Roscommon County Council rather than Sligo County Council are designing the bypass because most of the road is in County Roscommon.  Drivers of articulated trucks and bus drivers who travel to Dublin every day tell me that negotiation of the Curlews, particularly when the roads are wet or frosty, is almost impossible.  The sooner that the new bypass design reaches the Department and funding is made available for the project, the easier life will be for bus drivers and for the drivers of the articulated trucks that transport products from the meat factories in the industrial centre of Sligo to Dún Laoghaire and other seaports in order that our lamb, for example, arrives in France, Italy and other parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>Those involved in agriculture and <Col N="2521" /> associated industries need modern, well-built, well-serviced and well-maintained roads to transport their product to processing centres and to areas that have a consumer demand.  Those involved in industries other than agriculture need the same high quality roads and ease of access to their markets.  I again ask the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that the necessary funding is provided to carry out the two projects to which I have made particular reference, the Collooney-Sligo bypass and the Boyle bypass.  A massive amount of Structural Fund aid is needed for those projects.</P>
    <P>The bishops are holding meetings all over the west of Ireland, the theme of which is &ldquo;Develop the West Together&rdquo;. Quite recently I attended a meeting of MEPs, TDs and Senators, chaired by Bishop Conway of Elphin.  The meeting discussed the infrastructure and the roads and particular mention was made of the road from Sligo to Collooney and the Curlews bypass.  If our roads have not improved within the next few years it will be very difficult to expect any industry to come to set up business in Sligo.  The meetings on the development of the west of Ireland called by the bishops are extremely valuable.  The bishops are very concerned about the number of people who are leaving the west.  They see the numbers attending rural churches diminishing as the number of people living in rural Ireland gets smaller.  The bishops feel that better roads in the west of Ireland would attract more people to live there and would encourage more people to set up industries.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned several major roads but I should also like to point out that the development, construction, expansion and improvement of county roads is a very vital part of social life in rural Ireland.  We cannot overlook the lesser roads, which are equally important to those who reside in rural areas.  People who live in rural areas have to go to their local town or village, their local school and their local shop and they need better roads.  People who live on county roads are as much entitled to a good road leading to their house as anybody else. <Col N="2522" /> Thankfully, Minister Flynn, some four years ago drew up a plan to improve county roads under the road strengthening grant.  I hope that the new Minister for the Environment will continue to make substantial allocations of moneys for county roads.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes talked about the overgrowth of hedges.  At present our county roads are affected by overgrown hedges. Because of agreement with the unions, local authorities &mdash; the Sligo County Council in my own area &mdash; are able to employ people on the social employment scheme to do the necessary work.  Those people might be farmers in receipt of reduced unemployment assistance and they get very good money for joining that scheme.  I have always praised the setting up of that scheme, which was set up under a Labour Government.  Minister Bertie Ahern continued the work of the scheme when he became Minister for Labour. The social employment scheme enables wonderful work to be done in the villages and towns of rural Ireland.  Some of the unions disagree with work that is being carried out, but those who work under that scheme are very happy to be employed and they earn at least three times as much money per week on that scheme.  They work one week on and one week off and they feel better for being at work during the day.  They have a sense of dignity and they enjoy being able to work.  More money should be made available so that the local authorities can employ increased numbers of people under the social employment scheme. Unfortunately, there are now fewer people employed by the local authorities than ever before.  I feel that that is a result of the derating of all private dwellings some years ago &mdash; perhaps that was a bad decision.  Some Minister and some Government will have to decide to bring back some kind of rate in order to ensure that local authorities are properly funded to maintain our county roads to the required standard.</P>
    <P>Many people come to holiday in rural Ireland and they expect to travel on good county roads.  I say to the Minister <Col N="2523" /> present and also to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications that a considerable amount of money is needed &mdash; from whichever source &mdash; to boost county roads, which are tourist roads leading to our mountains and lakes. I know many of those roads.  The road from Collooney through Coolaney, Cloonacool and on to Ballina by the Ox Mountains is a scenic route along which French, German and other tourists travel.  These roads need to be improved. If the local authorities do not have enough money to improve these roads money should be made available from the tourism budget to upgrade them.  The drive from the Ox Mountains to Lake Easkey and out by Lough Talt and down to the sea at Enniscrone is through one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland. Perhaps I feel like that because I come from that part of the world.  If we put more money into that type of road it would be a step in the right direction and would encourage tourism.  We have a rail link and airports in Sligo and in Knock. All we need is tourists, but to encourage them we need better roads.  If money continues to be made available from road strengthening grants for these areas it will be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section dealing with miscellaneous matters, I fully support the decision to make it an offence for anyone to erect temporary dwellings on our roads.  We are too painfully aware of the disruption caused by these dwellings.  It is disgraceful to see such large dwellings in places where there are no facilities for the people.  Very often the children from these dwellings are a menace to themselves and to other road users when they run out on to the roads.  What makes matters worse are the huge piles of scrap alongside these dwellings on the sides of our roads.  I know of a fatal accident which occurred involving a young travelling child on one of our roads.  It is a pity that had to happen and I would ask the Minister to ensure that these people will not be allowed to live on our roads. <Col N="2524" /> Temporary dwellings should be removed.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that the first ten or 12 miles of the road from Dublin to Sligo has been greatly improved but after that the road has not improved very much. The roads in Meath and Westmeath are quite good, but there is a bottleneck in Mullingar.  When will the Mullingar bypass be started?</P>

The roads are good in County Longford and I compliment Leitrim County Council for the number of miles of national primary roads they have completed in recent times.  I hope that in the next couple of years we will have substantial allocations for roads to make sure the roads I mentioned earlier can be maintained and completed.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to street trading, but I do not agree with him on it.  In Tubbercurry we have street trading the second Wednesday of every month. The whole town is taken over by street traders and the shops could close down for that day.  These people sell everything and anything.  They probably pay their car tax, but I wonder do they pay tax on anything they sell.  Neither do they pay any rates.  They are damaging the shopkeepers. A section of each town should be set aside for traders rather than having them parked all over the place on fair days.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan's identification of the beautiful roads in Sligo only reminds me of the Seanad campaigns. The Minister will know the roads from his escapades on the Seanad trail.  Those roads have been travelled successfully by all of us because there was always generosity from the people of the Sligo area for those of us who are forced to call on them for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the new Minister on his appointment.  In my short intervention last week with regard to the appointment of the Cabinet I identified Deputy <Col N="2525" /> Michael Smith's appointment as one which we welcomed.  Recently on my local radio station Deputy Smith said that this appointment was one of his greatest challenges.  From my experience of Deputy Smith I know he will approach this serious new challenge with a degree of expertise and authority and with a certain style with which he is blessed. His experience as a member of a local authority will stand to his credit in the Department.  The Deputy knows the importance of the major input into our roads structure from county councils since the first county council was established in 1899.</P>
    <P>I would be unhappy if I thought the establishment of this roads Authority was a reflection on the competence or experience of local authorities in how they managed their responsibilities for the provision of national primary, secondary, county and non-route roads.  As a member of a local authority the only fault I found with membership and/or responsibility for roads was that of funding, responsibility for which was always placed firmly on local government but, of late, on the Department of the Environment. People located in Dublin, through Government and the appropriate Department, dictate the level of activity to take place on roads in each constituency.  As the previous speaker said, from the date of derating of property in local authority areas the amount of money made available to local authorities was reduced to such an extent that the only funds now available to them for expenditure on any roadworks within their jurisdiction are those from rates on commercial premises and from local authority charges.  This means very little work can be undertaken on county or minor roads, local authorities being totally dependent on central funds for the allocation of block grants or for any specific proposals to tackle a problem we all encounter in our constituencies, that of maintaining roads at the standard we would wish.</P>
    <P>I hope the establishment of the National Roads Authority will not be <Col N="2526" /> viewed as a reflection on past performances of local authorities.  Once established I hope there will be consultation with local authorities, drawing on their wealth of experience gained over many years by their staff and members, particularly in their communications with landowners on all aspects of land acquisition for the purposes of road construction.</P>
    <P>I hope, within the powers being given them in this Bill, the National Roads Authority will draw on that vast experience all of us gained as members of local authorities and, indeed, that of their staffs.  I am thinking of staff at county engineer level and the engineering structure and the expertise available to local authorities generally.</P>
    <P>I note there is provision in the Bill for the transfer of some categories of local authority staff.  Will the Minister define more clearly the staff he has in mind, what procedure will be followed and the rights of such staff in any transfer from a local authority to the National Roads Authority?  For example, I would like to think there will be consultation with staff representatives with a view to protecting any rights they may have, such as pension, superannuation and so on, or indeed their existing salary structures.</P>
    <P>One reason for the establishment of the National Roads Authority may well be to enable us avail of EC Structural Funds for the development of transport under various EC-designated headings, particularly &ldquo;peripherality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It will clearly be seen that we are placed at a considerable disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other member states, including Britain, who in the near future will be linked to the Continent by the Channel Tunnel leaving us alone, an island State, on the periphery of Europe.  This makes it more important that our roads infrastructure, linking our airports and ports, major towns and cities and industrial areas, are allotted as much money as possible to ensure their efficacy.</P>
    <P>The document published by the National Roads Authority, under the heading of roads infrastructure, estimates that £670 million will be required. <Col N="2527" /> If one adds that amount to the sub-regional development one arrives at a total of £818 million of which 63 per cent will be available from EC funding and the remaining 37 per cent from our own resources.  Of course the latter may not all come from the Exchequer or the public coffers.  We may well be coaxing the private sector to provide self-financing toll roads in which people who have been involved to a limited extent can invest.</P>
    <P>In their document, published almost 12 months ago, the National Roads Authority identified this EC operational programme as constituting the most comprehensive, up-to-date policy statement of the Irish Government in relation to the development of our roads network. This is contained in the document entitled &ldquo;Operational Programme on Peripherality, Roads and Other Transport Infrastructure, Ireland, 1989-1993&rdquo;. I am referring to that document because I intend to identify some aspects of that programme of interest and concern to me representing South Tipperary.  This operational programme, published in 1990, is one of a number submitted by the Government to the EC Commission, constituting part of the National Development Plan 1989-1993, of March 1989.  The operational programmes were contained in the Community Support Framework &mdash; CSF &mdash; agreed between our Government and the Commission on 31st October 1989.  Each operational programme was subsequently negotiated in detail, within the CSF and the EC Commission, on Monday, 13 August 1990 in a press release confirmed approval of this operational programme on peripherality.</P>
    <P>One task to be undertaken by the National Roads Authority, especially in the programme published by Government to which I referred, will be seen clearly from maps Nos. 5 and 6, one of which refers to Euro and national primary routes and the other to motorways, dual carriageways and single carriageways. On those maps the constituency of South Tipperary is identified as an area to be straddled by some of these national primary routes.  Deputy <Col N="2528" /> M. Brennan, who followed Deputy Dukes, commented on the number of roads to be built in County Kildare.  I might remind both Members that South Tipperary, and indeed the Minister's constituency of North Tipperary, contain many national primary roads running from where our boundary joins County Kilkenny, at Urlingford, until it leaves the county of Tipperary on the Mitchelstown/Cork road, all national primary routes as is the portion of road joined at the Limerick border at Oola and Two Mile Bridge at Carrick-on-Suir, also a national primary route, between Waterford and Limerick city.  If my constituency is to survive and prosper it must be well serviced by national primary roads.  It is essential that the National Roads Authority, the Minister and the Department clarifies the new Euro route to be chosen and identified on map No. 6.</P>
    <P>With the assistance of European funding we invested recently approximately £12 million on a by-pass of Cahir a beautiful scenic town, blessed with the Swiss Cottage, Cahir Castle, the river Suir and many other attributes.  The town straddles the two junctions from Waterford to Limerick and Cork to Dublin.  We provided a by-pass of the town to speed up the flow of traffic without doing damage to the town's infrastructure, thereby ensuring people could visit the town and park their cars there without being frustrated by passing traffic such as juggernauts and the like.  Despite the fact that this new by-pass is successful, it could have been more successful if Iarnród Éireann had agreed to allow a wider bridge at the entrance to the roundabout, which has been the scene of many accidents.  If that bridge had been the width of a proper carriageway then one would not approach this roundabout coming from Dublin into what is in effect a tunnel.  This, unfortunately, was foisted on us by Iarnród Éireann who would not allow the width of bridge over the railway that would have allowed a proper view of the roundabout.  The exit on the flyover at the Cashel side of this and, indeed, the new renovated exit and entrance into <Col N="2529" /> Cahir, is now proving successful.  What concerns us is the doubt as to how the road will now proceed.  The Minister in a recent radio interview said that there was some doubt about it.  At the moment we are proceeding through Portlaoise, with the main national primary route dual carriageway identified as far as Portlaoise. We are at present at The Curragh. However, when we get to Portlaoise there is some doubt as to whether we are to proceed with parallel dual carriageways, one leading to Roscrea and Nenagh into Limerick or whether it will proceed to Cork just north of Cashel.  If this is the case we need to know soon because Tipperary town and the town of Cashel are both identified as being in need of being by-passed for the survival of the shops and houses that are on the main streets of these two towns.</P>
    <P>I know that by-passing Tipperary town might be ten, 12 or 15 years down the road because it is on the national primary route between Waterford and Limerick. However, Cashel is on the road between Dubin and Cork and the local authority have taken steps to identify a route and have frozen development in the belief that this would be the route of the continuation of the national primary dual carriageway between Dublin and Cork. Now there is some doubt about this.  The sooner it is cleared up the better for all of us.  If the dual carriageway is to be continued from Portlaoise to just north of Cashel and then diverted towards Tipperary to Limerick, then the Minister's area will be by-passed in that procedure. If the reverse happens, it will mean a disturbance of the normal flow of traffic to Cork.  These are not worries that I have invented.  These are replies that have been given at local authority level to members who are questioning what exactly is happening to these two proposed by-passes in Tipperary town and in Cashel.</P>
    <P>This is one of the first questions this new Authority will have to ask themselves because what I have outlined is not what is identified in this operational programme on peripherality.  It certainly leaves an element of doubt in people's <Col N="2530" /> minds.  I know it will be four or five years before we get to that stage but we need to plan.  We should not freeze areas which are suitable for planning if, in the final analysis, they will not be used.</P>
    <P>That begs the question that if we proceed down this Map 6 Euro route then the Minister's road and the road in my area will be developed to and through Cashel, but the road between Cashel and Tipperary town will be left as a disaster area.  It was the scene of a tragic accident last weekend.  It has been the scene of many tragic accidents over the years and this is a road that has been estimated by our engineers as costing some £14 million to upgrade.  It is a very important and busy link but still it is only a national secondary road.  I doubt that that road will come within the jurisdiction of the National Roads Authority which might confine itself to all these national primary routes.  If that is the case the Minister's decision on the primary roads will affect the final decision that we, as local authority members, will have to make <i>vis-à-vis</i> the link road between Tipperary town and Cashel.</P>
    <P>This brings me to certain sections of the Bill itself.  We state these reservations to be helpful so that the Minister can raise questions in the Department and lay down guidelines for the new roads Authority.  There are certain questions we must ask ourselves as to what consultations will take place in regard to this new roads Authority.  I note with reservation that under section 34 the Minister will preclude members of the local authority from being involved in the roads Authority.  In the past corporation and county council workers were precluded from being members of their own authority.  Fortunately, with some progressive thinking, particularly on the part of the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Tully, some of this prohibition was removed.  We should start from the premise that we should not have to apologise for being elected to local authorities or the Oireachtas, provided that election does not interfere with the discharge of our public duties in a manner seen to be totally impartial.  In section 34 (1) (c) the <Col N="2531" /> Minister may, by order, designate a class description or grade of employment to which the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply.  I am asking the Minister to make that exclusion as liberal as possible so that we will not preclude people who work with the roads Authority from becoming members of their own local authority.  There is nothing incompatible about this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes raised the question of Members of the Oirechtas becoming members of the Authority.  We had this debate in relation to various pieces of legislation.  The parliamentary draftsmen are beginning to learn that one cannot automatically exclude people from membership just because they have been nominated for the Seanad.  They may not necessarily be elected.  We would accept that once they are elected they should be precluded.  In regard to the non-Oireachtas nomination procedure, which can happen in the Seanad, people could be nominated against their will, or without their knowledge or approval and this would preclude them from being on the Authority.  We came up with a wording which would provide that this exclusion would apply only if, on being nominated, they accepted the nomination or if elected.  Otherwise people would be precluded; this has happened on various bodies, for example, An Foras Talúntais, ACOT and other bodies where people who were nominated to those bodies lost their place on the board, but were not elected.  One wondered at times why they were nominated and if there was an ulterior motive.  We just want to protect the rights of certain people to be nominated. If they are elected it is a different story.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Oireachtas would be incompatible with membership of the roads Authority but membership of a local authority would not be.  We should not exclude certain categories of employment. Reference has also been made in section 19 to certain powers which would be conferred on this new Authority. Some of these powers are powers that are already held by local authorities.  Deputy <Col N="2532" /> Dukes obviously was not aware of some of the powers local authorities have, for instance, the power to serve notice on people in regard to cutting hedges, removing trees, and compulsory acquisition of land in the common interest, no alone for housing but for roadworks. Section 19 (1) will give the Authority powers to do any or all of the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  prepare, or arrange for the preparation, of designs for constuction or improvement works,</P>
    <P>I suggest there should be the closest possible consultation between the new Authority and the existing staff of the local authority because many of these designs have already been carried out, unless there are major changes in funding.  They may:</P>
    <P>(b)  prepare, or arrange for the preparation of, programmes of maintenance works,</P>
    <P>Our only problem at present is that we do not have funds to carry out the maintenance works.  I hope when the Authority are set up more funds will be available and that Irish motorists will not be second-class citizens <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European counterparts.  They may also:</P>
    <P>(c)  prepare, or arrange for the preparation of, schemes for the provision of traffic signs,</P>
    <P>(d)  secure the carrying out of construction or maintenance or the provision of traffic signs.</P>
    <P>(e)  allocate moneys and make payments in relation to construction or maintenance works, or in relation to any other function assigned to it by or under this Act,</P>
    <P>(f)  with the approval of the Minister, specify standards in relation to construction or maintenance works.</P>
    <P>These are all wide-ranging powers but they should not be carried out in isolation without consultation with the expertise already available to members and staff of the local authority.</P>
    <P>We already have the power under the <Col N="2533" /> Planning Acts to carry out environmental impact studies.  This matter is dealt with in section 48.  There is always a debate taking place as to whether environmental impact studies are carried out by independent people or people with a vested interest.  I know that the attitude of An Taisce and others who are prescribed bodies, under the planning Acts, is that local authorities and people we employ to carry out environmental impact studies are biased.  To maintain this Authority in the manner in which they will be set up under the terms of this Bill, it is essential that any studies they carry out be seen to be as independent as possible.  Many of these environmental impact studies will be in built-up areas, particularly in Dublin city and elsewhere, where the impact of a motorway on residential property and people living there has a tremendous environmental impact. It is essential that these studies be carried out by independent people.  We have had very competent, independent people in this country over a number of years who are capable of carrying out these studies. The most efficient and economical way is to avoid objections and High Court injunctions which seem to be the norm nowadays for any proposed development in any particular area.  Perhaps the Minister will address this issue in the new Planning Bill.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that people who have no immediate concern with a development or who live many miles away from it, have the constitutional right to object to a development in a particular area simply because they may be part of an environmentalist lobby group or some other such group of people who have designated themselves as the responsible authority for the whole of Ireland.  People can name themselves as objectors and yet live hundreds of miles away from the scene of the development.</P>
    <P>There are many other sections in the Bill which I want to mention briefly.  We have a problem with the movement of uncovered offal trucks on our public roads.  The fact that offal can be transported in uncovered trucks creates an extraordinary environmental problem <Col N="2534" /> from a smell and an animal health point of view and from a human health point of view.  This is an area of responsibility which is not within the remit of the local authority but rather it is within the remit of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In spite of repeated representations from my local authority to the Department of Agriculture and Food identifying the offending lorry no action has been taken by the Department of Agriculture and Food to curtail it despite the fact that we gave assurances to people that if they could identify the offending vehicle we would take action.  The Department of Agriculture and Food have almost to be brought to a public inquiry before they will take action about anything.  That is a fact which can be seen from another location.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem about dangerous trees in regard to which we have certain powers.  We have a major problem in regard to trees which are identified by the local authority as being dangerous. They are marked for the information of the landowner.  Following some extraordinarily difficult winters involving storms and tragedies involving falling trees, we felt obliged to be of assistance to landowners to identify the trees which we considered to be potentially dangerous. That is as far as we can go on the legislation.  We do not have the power to remove the tree: we can identify it and request its removal but the landowner does not have to follow our advice.  The only problem is that if the tree we have identified falls by accident &mdash; God between us and all harm &mdash; on anybody passing by in a storm, it does confer some responsibility on the landowner.</P>
    <P>I would like to see &mdash; with caution &mdash; some powers given to local authorities which would allow them to remove dangerous trees and yet ensure that the tree was dead and was a danger from that point of view.  Unfortunately, we have identified trees which are perfectly healthy.  People have used the mark on the tree to sell and knock down matured trees without any provision for replanting or otherwise.  This is an area we will have to address as part of ensuring that the <Col N="2535" /> national carriage ways are free of obstruction and are safe for people to use.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the provision of cycle lanes in the city and the closing of roads for sporting purposes.  These are all necessary provisions within the Bill.  I accept that we cannot have footpaths on dual carriageways but we can have footpaths on scenic parts of national primary roads.  We have a long tradition where people walk in some of these areas on Sundays.  Funding should be available to us to pipe the drains at the side of national primary roads, cover them in and make footpaths for people who enjoy walking where there is a certain amount of activity and which they want to do in safety.</P>
    <P>Another problem, which is touched on in two sections, is the question of roadside traders and itinerants.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy Brennan, when he said places should be designated in urban areas for street traders.  It is a matter for the local authority to adopt a by-law to ensure that identifiable places are made available for street traders, particularly in marketyards.  They are very successful in Tipperary town and people are expected to pay for the facility of using the space identified for them.  Of course, those people will require a trader's or a hawker's licence.  If they are involved in the sale of fast food or other such provisions which are mentioned in this Bill as being prohibited, they will have to comply with public health authority regulations.  At present they ignore most of those regulations and set up, using a hawker's licence.  However, they do not present us with the biggest problem.  That is presented by itinerants, or by those who are reputed to be itinerants, who trade on the side of the road.  They arrive in an area with the most extraordinary range of products, including farm machinery and farm gates, and set up on the side of a roadway in a dangerous manner.  They interfere with local residents in many ways, which I could not even begin to identify here.  We will have to take action.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to take action under this legislation to ensure that when <Col N="2536" /> the local authority meet their statutory responsibilities to provide serviced halting sites for those who have nowhere to go but who at the same time are not applicants for housing, they do not have their power usurped by itinerants indiscriminately parking their caravans on the periphery of urban areas in zones where parking is prohibited by law.  We have found, even when we take action and go to court in an effort to have these people moved on from public amenity areas or from areas where they pose a danger to passing motorists, that judges are very reluctant to make such an order.  This makes the task of local authorities almost impossible at a time when they are trying to be progressive and provide halting sites for these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>Many of these people do not want to be housed and have not applied for housing. Even where a halting site is provided they tend to move on again.  This is fair enough but they should not be allowed to park indiscriminately on national primary roads, national secondary roads or county roads.  They are a major nuisance. I have always advocated to farmers and others that they should not do business with these people because if there was no business for them they would have no incentive to stay around.  I hope the Minister will confirm that this legislation confers powers on him to ensure that people in this category will not be allowed to misuse our roads, in the interests of road safety, good planning and the proper management of our road network.  It should be said that these people are not homeless and they are not in need of a home because most can be traced back to individual mansions and housing which is adequate both for themselves and their families.  They just want to be able to do business and park wherever they want to.</P>
    <P>Our party spokesperson, Deputy Howlin, will want to debate the Bill section by section on Committee Stage. The Bill is welcome provided it is to be used as an instrument to allow us benefit from the Structural Funds.  I can assure the Minister that members of local authorities and, indeed, their staff at executive and engineering level will want to <Col N="2537" /> be involved and to co-operate with this Authority in making sure that the investment that we have put into our road network during the years will not be forgotten or neglected by any new Authority who may have no responsibility to anyone apart from the Minister.  That would be a pity because hundreds of local authority members have always been available to meet deputations, to make resolutions and bring forward notices of motion to ensure that a proper road structure is provided for our people, including the agricultural community, to make certain that country areas survive and everyone is not shepherded into towns and villages and that there is free movement of traffic between our ports, industrial areas, major cities and airports.</P>
    <P>This is major legislation and it has taken us 12 months to get this far.  We hope when it is finally passed, with amendments, that many of our concerns will have been addressed.  Again, I wish the Minister well in his new Ministry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate Deputy Smith on his recent appointment as Minister for the Environment.  I have no doubt that he will prove to be a very effective, efficient and good Minister.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>The Roads Bill, 1991, is both comprehensive and far-reaching.  I concur with many of the sentiments expressed by many of those who have participated in this debate.  Members expressed the desire that the National Roads Authority should be put on a statutory basis to plan, maintain and develop our road network and outlined the benefits that would accrue as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I became a Member of this House, in my previous employment as a sales representative, I visited each county in Ireland at some stage.  I am very familiar, therefore, with our road network. Each local authority do a good job in their own way but it was easy to recognise when one came to a bridge which marked the county boundary if there was a dispute over who was in charge of the bridge.  Even though the road on either side of the bridge may have been in good <Col N="2538" /> condition the difference in quality could be seen as one crossed the bridge.  Given the cost involved, local authorities argue over who is in charge.  The proposal that the National Roads Authority take over responsibility for our road network is indeed a step in the right direction.  I will take the opportunity on Committee Stage to make various points but at this stage I would like to focus on a number of issues.</P>
    <P>I would first like to deal with the question of road planning, maintenance and construction.  It is usual for people living in our capital city to find that maintenance, repair or construction work can take a number of weeks to complete and that it is carried out during normal working hours with the result that great disturbance can be caused not only for road users but for business houses.  When I travel abroad I am surprised by the amount of work that can be done outside peak hours.  I hope, therefore the National Roads Authority will take on board the suggestion that any maintenance, repair or construction work on our roads in the capital city should be carried out outside normal working hours.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention service areas on motorways.  If we are to build a network of motorways, it is very important to ensure that those who use the motorways do not have to come off them and that service areas be provided.  I am pleased that the section dealing with service areas provides that the local authorities will be able to utilise these service areas or contract them out.  That is a step in the right direction and is to be welcomed.  The port relief road has been the focus of attention by members of the Dublin local authorities, in county and city councils, by members of the Authority and by the general public.  Some people may recall that a route was developed years ago called the Eastern bypass which also received much attention. Recently, when contesting a local election, I met people who wished to see the port relief route being developed and those who objected to it.  When I was canvassing I listened to both arguments. I was aware that a feasibility impact study <Col N="2539" /> was being undertaken at a cost of approximately £400,000 which was paid by the Department of the Environment for Dublin Corporation.  A certain amount of pressure was put on various individuals and political parties.  I believe that if we had spent £400,000, and if we are three-quarters way through the study, it would have been sensible and wise to wait for the results of the study for the port relief route before we made any decisions whether it should go ahead.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have a draft development plan; the last development plan was adopted in 1982.  In the draft development plan for 1987, which has recently been agreed, the port relief route is mentioned. Because of pressures from various political parties in Dublin City Council, at the whim of one motion the port relief route was dropped from the draft development plan.  I am sure that when the Minister gets an opportunity he will be discussing this matter in greater detail and negotiating with Dublin Coropration on the feasibility impact study, its findings and cost.  It is regrettable that a group of people can come in to a meeting of the city council, after four years of work on a draft development plan, and cause one route to be taken out of the plan.  It is regrettable because the taxpayers have paid £400,000 for the feasibility impact study.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we talk about draft development plans, various local authorities around the country will be involved and that the National Roads Authority will work with each and every authority.  I also hope the Minister will ensure that what happened in Dublin City Council will not happen again.  I should also like the Minister to clarify the position in relation to the port relief route for Dublin city port.  As I live on the north side, I am aware of the port's difficulties in trying to attract new business, mainly because of the infrastructure in place at present.  We need a relief route and the one proposed took into consideration green spaces on which there was no development and the existing roads network.  It was designed in a &ldquo;cut <Col N="2540" /> and cover&rdquo; way and there was no demolition of any residence.  The land to be used was undeveloped, green space.  It was an ideal route to bring port traffic direct from the airport motorway to the port and there was a further link from the port to the south side.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, in the interests of development of Dublin Port, that we have a route, agreed by all sides, which will take into consideration the impact study and the environment.  We should also recognise the employment which could be created in the port area. Because we do not have a proper infrastructure to service the capital city there are bottlenecks throughout the city; we have problems with what is termed by local authorities as &ldquo;rat running&rdquo;.  Residents associations are complaining because they want roads blocked or ramps to stop &ldquo;rat running&rdquo;.  Large commercial vehicles take up space and block roads and indeed use roads which are totally unsuitable and not designed for the type of traffic which they must bear, mainly to avoid congestion in the city centre.  Will the Minister clarify the position in relation to the infrastructure necessary to service the capital city and how the recent motion in Dublin City Council on the port relief route will be addressed?</P>
    <P>I should like to see cycle lanes further developed in the capital and in the Dublin City Council area because they have proved extremely successful.  However, we have a chequered approach to cycle lanes; a cycle lane can run for one, two or three miles but then it merges with the road.  I should like to see an overall development which would provide a clear run to the city centre from the north, south and west of the city.  There should be a similar approach in regard to bus lanes; it is farcical to see bus lanes running in certain sections of the road but then merging with the road proper, causing traffic jams.  If we are to encourage people to use public transport we should ensure that the bus lanes have a clear run and that they are free flowing.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister &mdash; although it is not in the Bill &mdash; to look at <Col N="2541" /> the very successful DART in Dublin city. Some of the DART stations cannot cope with the number of people parking because the roads network does not facilitate the level of traffic it is taking. This does not encourage people to use the DART.  The provisions of proper parking facilities and greater accessibility to DART stations for motorists would lead to a big increase in the number of people using the DART.  This would help to reduce the number of motor vehicles which have to travel through the city centre unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  As I said, there are a number of points I wish to raise on Committee Stage.  I should like to refer to section 10 in the hope that the Minister will take up my point when he is replying to the Second Stage debate.  Section 10 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>(a)  The Minister may by order classify any existing public road or any proposed public road as a national road.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Minister may by order classify any existing public road or any proposed public road as a regional road.</P>
    <P>Most of this section indicates that the Minister will make these classifications. What is the point in setting up a National Roads Authority if the Minister can make these classifications?  Will he make these classifications on his own or in conjunction with the roads Authority?  Perhaps the Minister would consider giving this function to the roads Authority?</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome the Bill and hope it has a speedy passage through the House.  Having listened to previous speakers, I believe it will be enacted speedily.  The Bill can only enhance and assist overall development in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, on his appointment. I know he will bring a fresh approach to that Department.  I hope he will move away from the parochial <Col N="2542" /> approach which existed in that Department in the not too distant past.  I do not think there is any need for me to elaborate on that point.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to set up a National Roads Authority on a statutory basis &mdash; I welcome this proposal&mdash; and sets out the functions of the Authority.  One of the most important of these is the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  This brings me to the condition of our roads.  Motorists are often disappointed at the patchwork quality of our national primary roads.  I live in Mullingar, which is 50 miles from Dublin. There is a reasonably good road connecting Mullingar to Dublin.  However, there are some tremendous bottlenecks in various villages and towns along the way.  The bottleneck from Kilcock into Dublin is being relieved at present.  I welcome the commencement of work on the Maynooth bypass.  This is a great development which will greatly enhance the approach roads into Dublin. However, it will only add to the patchwork quality of our national primary routes.  While there are a number of miles of excellent roadway on any route, motorists can suddenly get caught in traffic jams.  Perhaps the National Roads Authority will help to rectify these problems. I hope they will have a reasoned approach to the development of our roads and will continue the work already being undertaken.  I look forward to the development of the dual carriageway from Dublin to Kinnegad, which will ultimately be continued to Mullingar.  This will be a tremendous development for the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of our roads is interlinked with our economy.  A good roads infrastructure is tied very closely to a good economy.  It is particularly important that the roads infrastructure in rural Ireland be of a very high quality.  If we want to keep people living in the country we must provide jobs for them.  In order to attract factories and industry into an area we must be able to compete not only with seaside towns and cities in Ireland but with towns on the European mainland <Col N="2543" /> and in Britain.  The quality of our roads will be crucial in attracting industry into rural areas.</P>
    <P>The preliminary census figures for 1991 show that County Westmeath has the third highest migration rate in the country. I was both startled and frightened to discover that we are third behind Counties Leitrim and Longford because in the past County Westmeath could not have been considered as a county which had a migration problem.  The reality is that people are leaving the area at an alarming rate.  For example, villages in north County Westmeath have become almost ghost towns due to the high rate of emigration. The development of our national roads would help to stem the flow of people from those areas.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the National Roads Authority will not be a national transport authority as I believe our rail network also needs to be developed.  It would make much sense to upgrade the rail link from Dublin to Mullingar which is used by 55 commuters every day. Unfortunately this service is very erratic, to say the least.  For example, those commuters were late arriving in Dublin on six occasions last September.  I imagine that their employers were not too happy when they turned up late for work six times during one month.</P>
    <P>The functions of the National Roads Authority should have been extended to cover our rail network so that roads and the rail network could have been developed together.  Experience in other countries has shown that the wider we make our roads the more traffic we will attract on to them.  The better our roads network, the more heavy goods traffic will use it.  Our railway network could carry much of the heavy goods traffic at competitive rates.  A portion of the money which will be spent on improving our roads could be used to develop our railway system so as to help relieve the traffic on our roads.  If this were done people in rural towns such as Mullingar, Kinnegad, Delvin and Enfield could commute to Dublin on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The development of national roads in <Col N="2544" /> my area to date has been reasonably good.  For example, the Athlone bypass was recently completed at a cost of £35 million.  This is a tremendous development which enables commuters to bypass Athlone, a major bottleneck in the past. Work has recently commenced on the Mullingar bypass.  It is expected that this development will be completed in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration needs to be given to the development of the N52, a very important national secondary route. The volume of heavy goods traffic on this route is particularly high.  The quality of the roads on the Westmeath section of the N52 is appalling.  It is frightening to see schoolchildren walking along narrow roads with such a heavy volume of goods traffic.  I would appreciate if greater importance could be attached to the N52. A tremendous volume of traffic is generated by the industries this route serves, particularly the cement industry, Gysum Industries and so on and therefore it deserves to be upgraded.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the importance of providing service areas along national primary routes.  There is provision for that in the Bill.  I am concerned about this matter particularly when I think of towns such as Kinnegad, a small town on a national primary route which survives entirely from passing trade.  There are 110 employees in one hotel in that town, depending entirely on a passing trade, on buses, cars and tourists that stop in the area.  It is proposed to by-pass that town in the not too distant future.  If we provide service areas on our motorways I wonder whether small villages and towns that are totally dependent on passing trade will survive. That is a question that should be taken into account when the allocation of service areas comes up for consideration.</P>
    <P>Another function of the National Roads Authority is the preparation of road designs.  The Roads Authority will have power to appoint staff for this purpose. What will be the link between this Authority and the present local authorities who design and do the groundwork for roads?  Will local authority staff <Col N="2545" /> be seconded to the Roads Authority for short periods or will permanent staff be assigned to the Roads Authority who will travel the countryside designing and overseeing the development of roads? This is also a cause for concern.  Will we lose some of our best staff from county councils to the Roads Authority?  Will local authorities engineers no longer be involved in the design and building of roads, resulting in the loss of vital local knowledge?</P>
    <P>How will the local authorities fit in with the National Roads Authority?  The Authority will consist of between ten and 14 members.  Will there be representatives from local authorities on that Authority or representatives of the engineering federations, of county engineers or county managers?  Will the various transport associations be represented on the Authority?  The Minister will make the appointments, but to what extent will he include the various interest groups in the membership of the Authority?  It is very important that all the groups be included.  There must be a link between what has happened in the past and what will be done in the future. Because of the importance of the quality of our roads to the infrastructure and the economy, the various transport organisations must also be involved.</P>
    <P>Another function of the Authority will be to secure the carrying out of work on national primary routes.  No doubt most of the work will be allocated to private contractors and grants will be given to carry out the work.  The Authority will also issue directives to local authorities to carry out work that needs to be done. I wonder what will be the consequences of that.  If a local authority decide in their wisdom that a road should take a particular route but the Authority decide otherwise, what will happen?  I know that the Authority may impose their will on a local authority but nonetheless local involvement is very important.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of weeks an announcement was made &mdash; I do not know whether the Minister had a hand in it but I assume he did &mdash; as a result of objections to the route of the proposed <Col N="2546" /> by-pass at Mullingar.  The Minister, having listened to the objections of the local residents, refused the compulsory purchase order for certain sections of property there, and this is to be welcomed. The Minister or his representatives, having come to the area and heard representations from the local authority and the residents in the area, were in a position to decide that the plans were not suitable for the locality.  I hope that the Authority will operate a similar procedure so that people on the ground will have a say in what happens to their environment, which is very important.</P>
    <P>One of my final points relates to the section which provides for the control of temporary dwellings on the sides of roads.  This is a particularly important feature and the sooner it comes into operation the better.  A few months ago a group of travelling traders arrived in the scenic village of Milltownpass, County Westmeath, and took over a stretch along the side of the road, setting up their caravans there.  They had perhaps 25 caravans, not small but highly luxurious ones worth thousands of pounds.  They stayed in the locality for about a week and operated from there into the surrounding countryside.  They were supposedly selling furniture and various goods but to a certain extent they were more involved in intimidating people into buying what was put in front of them, which was quite frightening.  A certain aspect of their method of work is to see what is available in the locality.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the hands of the local authority are somewhat tied in matters such as these.  The cost of getting court injunctions to move these caravans is prohibitive and the time factor is also against them.  Westmeath County Council accrued expenses in the region of £5,000 or £6,000 in an effort to move these people on.  In many such cases they may move a couple of hundred yards down the road, with the result that the local authority have to go through the whole process again, which is very unsatisfactory. After a number of days the caravans moved from Milltownpass to a <Col N="2547" /> village on the northern side of the county, leaving behind them a terrible mess.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section in the Bill which will control temporary dwellings.  I hope the Authority will have power to take immediate action in such circumstances so that the local people do not have to put up with the intimidation, discomfort and worry of an invasion of their areas of the nature I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, although I am disappointed that it does not make provision for rail and that it does not establish a national transport authority rather than just a National Roads Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years there has been growing criticism, extending to the point of derision, about the state of our road network.  Irish motorists are completely frustrated at the delays experienced on our national intercity routes and are outraged at the unacceptable level of potholes throughout the country.  The Republic of Ireland is fast obtaining the reputation among tourists of having the worst roads in Europe.  There is the constant problem of damage to vehicles, and the problem has worsened in the past four years to the extent that frustration has turned to anger.  It is about time that a Bill such as this came before the House so that Members are able to examine the problem and try to find new ways in which to gain additional resources with which our important road network may be built up.</P>
      <P>The road network is one of the most important infrastructural assets of any state as it underpins the effectiveness and efficiency of the transport sector.  In Ireland transport costs represent 9 per cent of total product costs, a cost that is, unfortunately, twice that of the European average.  In order to develop a modern, efficient economy, with vibrant subsectors of agriculture, tourism and forestry as well as thriving rural communities, it is important that our problem of inadequate roads be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of national roads to date has been overtly bureaucratic and politicised. Poor quality roads retard economic development in every sector, which is why this evening the House is about to set up a new authority under this Bill, the National Roads Authority, to seek to deal with the appalling problem.  The interim authority has been established <Col N="2549" /> since 1988, but it is only now that it is about to be put on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>Any analysis of the basis of the problems relating to regional and county roads shows that local authorities have been squeezed in their budgetary provisions since 1979, when domestic rates were abolished.  At that time it was promised that a grant from central Government in the form of a domestic rate support grant in lieu of revenue received from household rates would match the previous level of income from rates. However, in the past 12 years the domestic rate support grant has been eroded in real terms.  Local authorities faced with that concern could not reduce expenditure in every area, as there are often fixed administrative overheads involved in the running of a local authority.  That has meant that elements of discretionary spending, such as expenditure on roads, have suffered greatly.  The Government introduced discretionary grants in 1989 to remedy the serious deterioration of the non-national routes.  Allocations of about £68 million were made in 1991 to rectify some of the difficulties on the regional and county roads.  While those grants are based mostly on mileage of minor roads and while the grant has been increased, the funding has obviously not been adequate to meet the difficulties that have been encountered.</P>
    <P>The problem of the necessary improvement of our roads is essentially one of resources.  Adequate resources for roads must be provided by local councils out of their overall budgets and adequate resources must be given to local authorities in order to carry out the necessary works.  That has not been happening through the years, in spite of an improvement in structural aid from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>From the perspective of the user paying for the service, in no area of expenditure is there a better case for investment than on the roads.  In the Republic of Ireland we have one of the highest rates of VAT and excise duty on petrol and auto diesel.  We have very high VAT and excise duty on the purchase of motor vehicles as well.  In 1990 taxation <Col N="2550" /> from petrol amounted to £473 million, the total taxation on auto diesel was £175 million.  VAT receipts on all motor vehicles was £471 million and road tax &mdash; not to talk about what has happened in the 1992 budget &mdash; came to £161 million. The total amount of revenue from those sources to the State are simply enormous &mdash; a total of £1,280 million in 1990 &mdash; yet there are still inadequate resources for road improvement and road maintenance programmes.</P>
    <P>Another major development in recent years has been the receipt of increased resources from the European Community. Many national primary route developments in the operational programme from 1989-93 received support to the extent of 75 per cent of the cost of works.  When one bears in mind that road development attracts Exchequer revenue on the basis of VAT at the rate of 21 per cent and further taxation from PAYE and PRSI on labour content, it is obvious that for a 25 per cent investment by the Irish Government the Exchequer gets an excellent rate of return, not only in terms of infrastructural improvement but also financially.  It is therefore inexcusable that the Government have reduced their level of support to national and primary development by 19 per cent in this operational programme in comparison to the previous five-year expenditure plan.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment figures show that State expenditure on the improvement of national roads for the period 1988-1993 compared to the 1984-1988 period has increased by a total of 24 per cent.  However, when one takes into account the fact that EC grants increased by 78 per cent in the latter period, it can be proved that the Government have simply substituted Exchequer funding with EC finance.  It is a principle of EC funding that member states operate the principle of additionality whereby their funding would be a stimulus to greater State investment.  The present Government's breach of faith in reducing their own funding will be viewed very seriously by the EC Commission and may result in serious damage being done to the case of Irish road funding after 1993. <Col N="2551" /> It is obvious that if we are to bring our national road network up to EC standards of speed and efficiency, the total cost will be about £3.5 billion.  There is an unavoidable capital investment required in national and non-national roads.  It is patently clear that the existing approach is not adequate and that new measures are now required at a political level to ensure that the problems are resolved.</P>
    <P>From an administrative, engineering and investment point of view, it is essential to clearly separate national roads from non-national roads.  There has been a considerable slippage in investment on the original 1989 roads plan.  The present Government had stated that £687 million would be spent in their 1989-93 plan. That figure was subsequently reduced to £580 million.  Fine Gael believe &mdash; and, indeed, I believe &mdash; that the target date for upgrading the national network should be brought forward to the 2005 to 2010 period so that we can plan for the investment and the improvements required to bring our road network up to European standards.</P>
    <P>In addition to setting up a National Roads Authority, it is about time we decided to establish a better financial basis for local and county roads.  It is clear that we are not getting adequate resources at local level to carry out important work for people living off main roads, people in rural communities who have to depend on minor and county roads to go about their daily business. We should establish a proper roads fund so that we can maintain and improve non-national primary routes.  It is disgraceful that motor taxation collected by the local authorities as agents of the State finds its way back to the Exchequer.  This money could be used by local authorities to improve non-national routes.  In 1991, £161 million was collected in motor taxation but local authorities got nothing from motor taxation or licence fees.  Will the Minister consider setting up for local authorities a national roads fund from the receipts of motor taxation and licence <Col N="2552" /> fees so that they will have adequate funding to maintain non-national roads?</P>
    <P>The impact of political strength on the quality and financing of our roads has been colossal in the past four years.  Since 1987 we had no ministerial representation in counties Wexford, Waterford, Carlow and Kilkenny.  It is worth comparing the financial allocations to counties like Mayo and Westmeath during that period.  The imbalance in the allocation of resources to these areas is disgraceful.  For that reason alone it is no harm to establish an independent National Roads Authority so that resources from European development funds can be evenly spread to develop and improve our roads network.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the new Minister for the Environment, whom I sincerely congratulate on his appointment, to some projects in my constituency. We in Kilkenny have been the Cinderella when it came to funding in recent times, particularly funding for primary routes.  The access routes to ports like New Ross and Waterford can only be described as dirt tracks.  Such standards were adequate in earlier years but are not adequate for routes required for the efficient transportation of our goods to the European Community.  The road out of Kilkenny to the west is equivalent to a county road.  By-passes at Callan and Thomastown are urgently required.  They have been promised for many years but nothing has happened yet.  If something does not happen soon with regard to providing these essential by-passes the buildings in these towns will come under severe pressure.</P>
    <P>The extension to the Kilkenny city ring road is long overdue, in order to open up the industrial estate on the edge of the city and facilitate the development of the Pocock Valley area of the city.  A new inner relief road is urgently required in the city over the River Nore to alleviate traffic problems.  There is an appalling situation in the north of the county where a bridge at Castlecomer has now deteriorated to such an extent that it is on the verge of collapse.  I know the Minister has designs for a new bridge at Castlecomer. <Col N="2553" /> I would urge him to make the money available this year to provide for the new bridge.  If the bridge collapses, the north end of the county would be cut off from routes to Carlow and Dublin.  Some money was spent by the Department in recent years to shore up a structural fault on the bridge but painting over the cracks is no longer the solution.  A new bridge is required.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny County Council have been very patient having regard to their inadequate resources for road improvements. This will have to change if the citizens of Kilkenny are to enjoy the same benefits as their neighbours in Tipperary from now on.</P>
    <P>Under the operational programme from 1989 to 1993, over 60 per cent of funds, or £500 million, has been spent between the local authorities of Dublin and Cork.  I hope the £6 billion investment from the Regional Funds and from Structural aid, which will form the basis of the programme from 1993 to 1997, will lean more towards making provisions to improve the roads network in the southeast, particularly Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill refers to establishing a roads Authority and its functions.  I have difficulty in wholeheartedly supporting this concept of a National Roads Authority.  As a member of Kilkenny County Council, I feel that the role of local representatives is being seriously diminished by this Bill.  We saw the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and now we are establishing a National Roads Authority and the role and power of local representatives, local engineers and planners in relation to these important aspects of life are being seriously curtailed and in many instances are being eliminated. The diminution of the power of local representatives to represent their local communities by giving complete discretion to an Authority which did not have to seek election and which is only answerable to the Minister is a disgrace. Local authority officials will be the agents of the National Roads Authority and the Authority can either accept or reject local <Col N="2554" /> authority proposals in relation to, for instance, road designs.</P>
    <P>We are removing the input of road users to the improvement of roads.  I will illustrate my case.  The Minister will be aware that there is some controversy in the Department about the provision of an overhead bridge and a bridge to carry cattle across a new national route from Waterford to New Ross, the N25.  The Minister will be aware of continual representations going back as far as the public inquiry of 1984 as to how important these bridges would be in facilitating road users, people in the community and members of the agricultural community who were experiencing a difficulty in bringing livestock and heavy machinery across that important route.  Road improvements should not mean that communities are worse off.  In the instance of the improvement of the route from Waterford to New Ross the residents of Glenmore in south Kilkenny are not better off.  Their parish has been cut in half, traffic is faster and they are unable to cross the road safely or bring livestock or machinery across it.  The price paid by the people of Glenmore for progress has been a faster route through their community at the expense of safety.  That is disgraceful.  It is something which a National Roads Authority might not look benevolently upon, apart from the considerations of the engineering section of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister sympathetically consider the provision of an overhead pedestrian bridge at Kill Hill in Glenmore to facilitate people travelling to and from the GAA field, their places of worship and recreation, including students travelling to and from the local national school?  It would ensure they are safe crossing that busy route.  The Minister will be aware that this was the scene of a tragic accident some weeks ago while work was in progress.  I am not saying that was due to negligence on the part of the local authority or of the Department but it was unfortunate an accident should have taken place in the course of construction of that route.  I hate to think that any improvement of this route would <Col N="2555" /> lead to more deaths due to inadequate resources to enable the Garda authorities or others enforce the speed limit at this location.</P>
    <P>I referred to Milltown Bridge at Glenmore which facilitates the movement of animals and agricultural machinery. There are located there six farmers who need to cross the road daily to take their animals from one part of their farms to another.  It is unacceptable that there should be any fragmentation of agricultural holdings that had not obtained before that route passed through that community.  I urge the Minister to consider those two projects sympathetically. I would have great pleasure in supporting the establishment of a new national authority if I felt the input of locally-elected representatives and local authorities would be taken on board by their executive.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one or two other points in relation to our roads generally. I implore the Minister to consider the impact of some measures for the improvement of our environment generally in rural areas in respect of which there is no legislative teeth.  The Minister will be aware, as I am, of the deterioration that has taken place in our rural environment because of the inadequate funding of local authorities to open water tables, cut ditches and compel land owners to do so under existing legislation. The Minister should examine such legislative provisions and ensure that rural areas are rendered more pleasing to the eye by requesting landowners and property owners in general, to cut back hedges and ditches, or be forced to do so.  Dangerous trees sited within local authotities' jurisdictions should be removed to prevent accidents.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy McGrath's call for the implementation of the provisions of the Casual Trading Act to eliminate the huge negative impact illegal parking and trading by some travellers and other so-called traders is having on our roads network. There have been many visits to the Kilkenny ringroad by such illegal traders. Local authorities' powers are inadequate <Col N="2556" /> to tackle this problem.  Despite the fact that Kilkenny County Council acted responsibly by providing halting sites for travellers, they are not in a position to deal with so-called traders who roam our countryside night and day, park illegally on many of our most beautiful scenic routes and do irreparable damage to our environment.  I urge the Minister to effect the necessary legislative changes giving local authorities power to deal effectively and quickly with such matters.</P>
    <P>In spite of the reservations I expressed it would be my hope that the input of local representatives and local authorities will not be diminished as a result of the establishment of the National Roads Authority, rather that the necessary legislative amendments will be implemented in this Bill to so guarantee. The day we remove the input or impact of the local representative, the voice of the local road user, from our legislative provisions, or deny the important contribution they can make in the improvement of local routes, will be a sad one.  It is my earnest hope that local communities will be better off, not worse, after the imlementation of the provisions of this Bill.  I hope also that my fears at the establishment of the National Roads Authority will prove unfounded; rather that the co-ordination this body can achieve will bear fruit in the more efficient transportation of products to ports such as New Ross, Waterford and Rosslare.  My ultimate hope is that citizens of local authority areas will enjoy safer travel on our roads generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend my best wishes to the Minister for the Environment who has now assumed this most responsible portfolio.  I have known him since he entered this House more than 20 years ago and his experience as a member of a local authority in Tipperary qualified him to hold his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity we are not discussing overall transport policy in that our roads network comprises one part only of our general transport problem.  Like other speakers, I was disappointd there was no mention of our railway system.  Many years ago <Col N="2557" /> we had a canal system which, apart from its obvious tourist attraction, does not constitute a viable transport proposition however attractive or viable within the tourism area.  Nontheless our railways could complement, or relieve our roads network of many of the heavy loads carried at present.  They should have been included in the Bill.  The provision and maintenance of a rail network would cost a fraction of the amount needed to provide and maintain a roads network.  I fail to understand, why, for a relatively small investment in our railways, we do not relieve our roads network and its attendant problems.  Obviously that is not to be.</P>
    <P>What bedevils our overall approach to transport is the fact that responsibility is divided among so many Government Departments and agencies, ranging from the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications to the Environment, to Justice.  They all have a say, or some degree of responsibility in relation to how our roads operate, are used, who should use them and their requisite standards.  In fact, one could throw in the Department of Industry and Commerce who are involved in and responsible for the general standards of safety of vehicles, insurance cover and so on.  This fragmented responsibility results in our experiencing difficulty in achieving a unified approach to these problems.</P>
    <P>The potential for employment, so badly needed, in roads is enormous. Indeed the present level of unemployment, approaching the 300,000 mark, constitutes a crisis comparable with that in the post-Famine period when many roadworks were initiated.  We find the origin of most of our roads in works initiated to provide employment and some help for people in the aftermath of the Famine.  When the number of inadequate roads referred to by Members who have spoken here are added up they must amount to an expenditure of billions of pounds.  Apart from that, there is the tremendous potential to put hundreds of thousands of people into useful, gainful employment.  This would be a tremendous investment in the future of this <Col N="2558" /> country, which depends more and more on the efficiency of our road network. The future of the economy depends in many ways on transport both to and from this country.  We can only benefit from European funds if we have a proper road network to quickly get our produce out and our raw materials in.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I will follow the practice that has been apparent in this debate and refer to the problems of my own constituency.  There are many which have been mentioned already here this evening.  I must mention them again because I have lived with them far longer than other Members here.  I have seen the result of putting these problems on the long finger.  Some years ago we got a ring road in Kilkenny.  Again, it is a great help; but its effectiveness has been impaired simply because a short remaining spur of that road has not been built with the result that the roadway is inefficient. It cannot do the job it is supposed to do simply because that short remaining spur has not been completed; it has not even been started.  When that work is completed Kilkenny can reap the full benefit of that road.  To a certain extent it is at present a waste of money until that remaining short spur is completed, when everybody will be able to utilise it to its full potential.  I would urge the Minister to get that done as quickly as possible because he is not getting a good return on the money already invested while the remaining part remains unattended to.</P>
    <P>In addition there is the question of the inner relief road in Kilkenny.  Kilkenny is an ancient city, with narrow streets and old buildings we do our best to preserve. The completion of the inner relief road is badly needed.  At present, because of the partial completion of the road, heavy and fast traffic has been generated in busy and built up areas causing severe anxiety for the safety of adults and children.  The road passes by schools and through residential areas and is a danger.  That work needs to be speeded on.</P>
    <P>I know that you, a Cheann Comhairle, would join with me if you could in calling for the bypassing of Callan to be carried out as quickly as possible because I am <Col N="2559" /> sure you have had many an anxious moment on your journeys here wondering if you would ever get out of Callan.  Again, I would hope that the Minister would speed up the plans on that bypass, which is long overdue, together with the Thomastown bypass, which is on the main Dublin-Waterford route and also on the main route from Rosslare to the midwest and north west.  As the previous speaker mentioned, work needs to be done on the Castlecomer bridge because this is another very important road.  There is also a need for a proper bypass of Carlow town to be carried out. I must compliment all concerned on the Leighlinbridge bypass, which has been a tremendous success and has eased the traffic on that road considerably.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about road development, particularly the national primary routes, is that when it is done in a piecemeal way it creates fast stretches of roadway which suddenly, and without much warning at times, turn into very narrow and winding inadequate stretches of roadway.  Drivers driving along the improved routes increase their speed, because that is what those routes are for, but when they enter the dangerously narrow and winding routes there is an added problem.  There are many areas throughout the country where one goes very quickly from the sublime to the ridiculous in road terms, so these matters will have to be attended to.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the Ceann Comhairle, I am one of the few Members remaining in this House who used to drive to this House on the old Naas-Dublin road many years ago and who saw that road so ridiculously outdated in a very short time.  I suppose nobody foresaw the rapid development of road traffic in that period, because that road was hailed as a modern miracle of dual carriageway in the late sixties when it was finally finished.  However, before it was completed it was out of date.  It needs major upgrading, particularly in regard to the traffic lights on it which, while easy enough to see at night, are very difficult to see on a bright day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2560" /> In regard to section 67 of the Bill, which deals with dangerous structures, trees, etc., will the Minister clarify if that section covers dangerous lighting?  I refer in particular to advertisement lighting and other private lights in houses and dwellings on the side of the road.  Some of these lights are extremely strong at times and can mislead motorists and cause accidents, especially motorists not familiar with a particular area.  I hope they are included under the definition of dangerous structures, trees etc.  The roads Authority should have control over the strength and the positioning of lights on private property.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - ESF Funding for Third Level Education: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy J. Higgins on 18 February 1992:</P>
    <P>In view of the inherently unjust operation of the Higher Education Grants Scheme which discriminates heavily against PAYE taxpayers and places impossible financial burdens on families in the provision of higher education to their children, and in view of his clear lack of planning and vision in the area of third level education, Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to abandon his plans to means test ESF grants from September 1992, and calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P>(a)  retain in full the present ESF funding arrangements for third level courses pending a total review of the finance arrangements for students attending third level education;</P>
    <P>(b)  enter into negotiations with the EC to obtain further ESF funding for other third level courses and institutions; and</P>
    <P>(c)  establish a permanent education secretariat in Brussels for educational monitoring, research and liaison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2561" /> Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;In&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;regard to education, Dáil Éireann commends the Government for its achievements with particular reference to the dramatic expansion in the provision of third level places and measures taken to ensure greater equity in the third level system; notes that the Minister for Education, being conscious of the pressures on families in providing for third level education for their children, intends to complete a full review of the criteria for eligibility for student grants by September 1992; and further commends the Government for its ongoing initiatives in this area, including:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the expansion in the number of places available on ESF supported programmes through the more equitable distribution of available funds,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the targeting of resources to assist the disadvantaged and those from lower income groups in availing of the various education and training programmes at all levels and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the co-ordinated arrangements being made to ensure a major expansion in EC support for education and training programmes in Ireland, including the establishment of a permanent education representative in Brussels.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Labour Party fully support the motion put forward in the name of Deputy Jim Higgins and other Fine Gael members regarding ESF <Col N="2562" /> funding.  What Deputy Higgins is seeking to achieve in paragraph (a) of the motion is a commonsense approach whereby we would retain the present ESF funding arrangement.  This is an extremely sensible approach in that from 1993 onwards Maastricht Structural Funds will be available under a new cohesion fund.  For that reason it is inexplicable that the Minister should, at this juncture, decide to restrict, by means testing, the availability of these funds to people who in the past did not have an opportunity to avail of third level education.  Part and parcel of the problem is that the regional technical colleges have been extremely successful. They opened the door to education to many people who in the past, for various reasons, could not avail of third level education perhaps because they live far from a university or have insufficient family funds to fund education in a third level institution.</P>
      <P>The regional technical colleges and ESF funding have played a major part in making third level education available to children of families who in the past, did not have access to it.  The amount of money mentioned by the Minister in his contribution last night was £10 million. That £10 million is the overall cost rather than the specific cost for the 2,600 students who will be affected which the Irish Government have to fund in total. It takes into account teaching and non-teaching costs.  For that reason, the Minister is being penny wise, bearing in mind that he recognises that post-1994 he will be in a position, by virtue of the fact that there will be more funding available, to again offer places to students.  Effectively, we are discriminating against a generation of students who, in the coming years, will not be able to avail of a place in the regional technical college because they are affected by the means testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister, in keeping with the motion, has established a permanent education secretariat in Brussels.  This is a very wise move <Col N="2563" /> considering that there will be considerable negotiations to provide extra funding for education.</P>
    <P>Germany and Japan are classic examples of the effect which education has on these economies.  Were it not for the fact that they have a very advanced system of education they would not be in the happy position in which they are today of being major world financial powers.  If we are going to cut back on education we are ruining the chance of taking our place amongst the nations in the years ahead and of being a real force in the Europe of the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would simplify the method of entry into the third level institutions by a centralised registry system.  That is poor consolation to anybody who will now be deprived of third level education by virtue of means testing. To say, on the one hand, that he will streamline the method of entry and on the other hand takes the means by which they can avail of third level education is contradictory.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.  I appreciate that a different Minister was involved.  Contrary to what other people have said, the former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, in the short term in which he was in office &mdash; with this one exception &mdash; did impact on that Department.  Having met him as a chairman of a vocational education committee I felt he came to grips with his brief rather quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, it must be said that the motivation behind this measure is certainly not to prevent people from entering the third level sector but rather it is to spread the available income.  The problem in this area is one of success and growing participation numbers in third level education.  That is something we should welcome on all sides of the House. Since the sixties we have witnessed a revolution of participation in second level education and with the growth of the regional technical colleges and the NIHEs and so on, we witnessed a further growth in participation rates in third level colleges.</P>
      <P>Luckily, because of our membership of the European Community, the European Social Fund has come to play a very significant role in enabling many people throughout the country from low income groups to participate in third level education. In my view we have a problem &mdash; it is a good problem &mdash; where more and more people will want to avail of third level education in the future.  The evidence suggests that even though the &ldquo;bulge&rdquo; in our second level figures is on a downward scale, and because of the falling birth rate the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level is declining, nonetheless an increasing percentage of students will attend third level colleges over the next decade.  We have to take a longer-term view of the issue and go about securing long-term funding for what will become a reality in the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the Minister's opening speech that he will carry out an overall review of our grants system.  In his contribution he put on record the fact that he was dissatisfied with that system and certain elements contained in it.  I am always wary of means testing.  The manner in which we means test in Ireland is not adequate or satisfactory and successive Governments have been responsible for that, whether it is in the social welfare code or in education. The thresholds in relation to education for third level grants are much too low.  That is the worry I have in this case. Notwithstanding that, the way to proceed is to review European Social Funding <Col N="2565" /> for training in education in its totality. Considerable ESF funding is being allocated to the whole training area, for example in FÁS, CERT and so on.  A more co-ordinated approach is required of the Department of Education, the Department of Labour and other bodies. In our analysis of the situation we must seek to get value for money and whatever new scheme we introduce should not act as a deterrent to young people entering our third level colleges or our regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by the Maastricht Treaty because for the first time it actually includes a provision for greater funding for education.  That is the way forward.  Commissioner Bruce Millan was here recently and he more or less indicated that we would receive a significant increase in Structural Funds.  The problem as presented to the Minister is that the amount of money we are receiving from Brussels is not adequate to cover the increased number of participants in our colleges.  He is endeavouring to distribute the amount of money at his disposal to as many people as possible.  I suggest that we increase the level of funding, particularly that which we obtain from Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent the constituency of Louth, where there is a very successful regional technical college in Dundalk.  That regional technical college owes its success mainly to the ESF grant, which has been available during the past few years.  There is some disquiet in the locality in relation to the proposal that that grant be means tested.  While I can understand the logic behind this proposal &mdash; one could make the case that all grants should be treated equally &mdash; on the other hand there is a fear that the vast majority of students who are interested in this grant will not be able to avail of it.  Middle income families may suffer as a result. There is also the possibility that some of the spin-offs which accrue when a regional technical college is located in an area will be affected if these grants are means tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the reason the Minister decided to introduce these changes. <Col N="2566" /> There is a number of anomalies in the grants system which have been highlighted for those of us who attend political meetings.  It is important that these are rectified.  It has always been my attitude &mdash; perhaps the Minister will take note of this and respond to it when he comes to reply &mdash; that education grants are of help to a certain section of the population.  However, there is another section of the population who pay their taxes but who are not in a position to avail of these grants due to the size of their incomes.  Yet other grants are made available using the income raised through their taxes.  I am not saying that this is a bad thing; it is a good thing.  But it has been suggested, with some justification, that there is a section of the population who if all things were equal would not receive those grants.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Education &mdash; I would like to congratulate both him and the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, on their appointments &mdash; that he should review the grants system.  I understand that he has given an undertaking to do this.  Perhaps he would also consider the possibility of providing interest free loans or low interest loans to students to help them educate themselves rather than a grant which is not recouped.  This loan could be clawed back in later years when the student is employed.  I know that there would be logistical difficulties in doing this, but that would be a fairer system.  It would not lead to the creation of inequities which exist in the present system which has been tinkered with in recent years.  In effect, a low interest loan, or an interest free loan, would amount to an investment in the education of these people; but there would be a responsibility on them to repay this investment to the State at a later date.</P>
    <P>In relation to this motion, the proposal that all these grants be means-tested can be justified.  I very much welcome the long overdue changes which the Minister made to the Higher Education Authority grants scheme to ensure that the needs of families who have extra children going to college are taken into account.  In conclusion, I ask him to consider the suggestion that the grants system be reviewed <Col N="2567" /> and, if possible, that interest free loans &mdash; perhaps on a sliding scale, taking the incomes of parents into account &mdash; should be offered to students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the other Members for sharing their time with me.  It is a good idea that we should in this House debate third level education and the funding of that sector at frequent intervals because our third level education sector ought to be continually evaluated to make sure that it is responsive to the needs of our time as they emerge and fulfils the functions it was designed to fulfil.</P>
      <P>First, I acknowledge the enormous contribution made by the regional technical colleges to the development of education since their foundation.  They have made an enormous contribution to education and have brought relevant education within the grasp and reach of large numbers of students for whom, and indeed for their parents, third level education would have been little more than a pipe dream.  Anything which would injure that development should not be countenanced or welcomed by anybody in this House.</P>
      <P>It is my clear understanding that any proposed changes to the third level grants system should be made in the context of an overall reassessment and revaluation of the grants system as it applies to all colleges in the third level sector.  I would like to remind the House that what the Minister has proposed is not that the ESF grants to all students attending regional technical colleges be withdrawn but rather that the maintenance element of that grant as it applies to a small number of students attending regional technical colleges be means tested.  To date, students doing degree courses in regional technical colleges are means tested in the same way as students attending the traditional university colleges.  This should be borne in mind.  Therefore what has been proposed will not be as drastic in its impact as has been said in recent times since the change was announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I am disappointed <Col N="2568" /> that this has been brought forward as a single proposal standing in its own right and has not been seen in the context of the overall review of third level grants now taking place within the Department. It is my clear understanding that this two party Government have made a commitment to reform comprehensively the third level grants system with a view to bringing about greater equity and fair play in the distribution of all third level grants.  I am also aware that plans for a radical reorganisation of the present system are well under way and that a better and fairer system will be in place before the start of the next academic year.</P>
    <P>Ask any parent, student or teacher what is wrong with the existing system and the very first thing that they will tell us is that the children of PAYE earners are being penalised harshly within the existing grants system because of the income threshold.  Indeed, the threshold is now set so low that one almost has to be on the dole to be eligible for any kind of third level grant within the university sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Government parties are trying to avoid also.  The present threshold is £10,500, whereas the average industrial wage is about £13,000. That is an indication of how narrow and low the threshold is.  This is unacceptable. I am convinced the Government are looking at this area with a view to effecting significant improvements, which I know will be brought about, as I have already said, before the start of the new academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter which is causing extreme hardship to parents is the delay in the payment of grants.  Parents have told me, time and again, that they fill in application forms and submit them in July but hear nothing about them until October.  Students then gain admission and are registered but very often it is January of the first academic year before grant moneys are paid.  This is causing <Col N="2569" /> enormous hardship to parents, many of whom are forced to go to credit unions or banks to borrow the money to give to their children for maintenance and books.  Sometimes, indeed, it is two or three months into the academic year before the grant moneys are paid.  It is a fundamental flaw in the system which must be remedied.  I appeal to the Minister to take steps in that regard.  I fear that, for cash flow reasons, local authorities are withholding moneys far beyond the time when they should be paid.</P>

      <P>I have nothing against the principle of means testing provided it is applied fairly and squarely among all students and that income is evaluated in a way which will ensure a fair crack of the whip for everyone. It is a well known fact that the way the grants system is administered at present means that well-off farmers, many of whom because they can juggle the figures, are drawing grants for their student children.</P>

      <P>Other students are children of people in the self-employed sector who, because they can organise their figures, are drawing grants while at the same time children of PAYE workers, whose parents are earning much less, are not entitled to grants.  A threshold must be set against a criteria which is fair, just and equitable.  I am satisfied that the Government are moving in that direction, not before time.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that measures already announced by the Government will effect a major improvement.  The income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education, which is an improvement.  Parents who have two, three or more children in third level education at the same time have suffered enormous hardship in the last number of years and, if they are in the PAYE sector, many of them are driven deeply into debt to enable them to send their children to third level education. Some acknowledgment will now be made under the changes proposed by the Government to parents who have more than one child in college at the same time.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, income eligibility will be assessed on current income instead of, as heretofore, on the income in the year in which the student sat the leaving certificate, which is also an improvement which has been sought for some time.  I am very glad that the Government have now acknowledged this and brought about this change which will take effect from the start of the next academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the few countries of the twelve member states where mature students are treated so badly in the education system from the point of view of grants eligibility.  That issue is also being addressed by the Government; mature students who secure a place in a third level institution will automatically be considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant, which is an improvement.  Mature students will be assessed on the basis of their own income <Col N="2571" /> rather than on that of their parents, which was the case heretofore.</P>
    <P>Lone parents' welfare payments under the lone parent's allowance scheme, will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility.  All these provisions will be put in place for the start of the next academic year.  That is a major package of improvements, which I welcome. It is within the context of the overall package that some changes in the ESF grants will be effected.  It gives a false picture to isolate one item of the overall package and not to include all the other benefits which will accrue when the package is in place.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already about the hardships on families because of the delay in making payments.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that issue.  As I said, I do not have an objection to the principle of means testing as it will be a fair test applied right across the board.  I do not think it will have an adverse impact on attendance at third level colleges, it is just the maintenance dimension of an overall grant which will be affected.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on the case he made regarding the changes which have been effected in ESF <Col N="2572" /> funding for regional, technical and similar third level institutions.  I should like to dwell on the logic behind these changes and the benefits which they will bring to many students in third level education.</P>
      <P>It has been an anomaly for some time that two students from the same family could be in a university or an RTC and that one of them has to pay the full fees while the other does not.  This anomaly is now being corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not right that families who could afford to pay a contribution towards their children's education should not do so.  In my constituency I know of a doctor who has a very big GMS practice and he has a child attending a regional technical college who qualifies for full fees, grant assistance and maintenance.  Surely that is not common sense, especially when his neighbour, who is a small farmer with two children attending University College Galway, does not qualify for any grants and does not even get tax relief because he is over the income limit.</P>
      <P>I want to put to the Fine Gael Party that the issue here is whether the income eligibility limit can be increased for all students who qualify for grant aid.  This issue has to be addressed by the Government and the Opposition parties.  The Minister has promised to review the eligibility level for grant aid.  I think we would all agree that the level is too low at present and that many people who should qualify do not.  Consequently, hardship is being experienced by people right across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the eligibility limit and the increase in that limit depends on the amount of resources this or any other Government are prepared to put into third level education.  I put it to the Oppostion that in working out proposals for increased expenditure they should refer to the bedrock of their policy, that is, the cutting of public expenditure as <Col N="2573" /> enunciated on budget day and other days by the Fine Gael Party leader.</P>

      <P>It is hypocritical of the Opposition to come in here time after time and call for more resources to be put into education.  The issue which has to be addressed by the Minister for Education in the review which he has promised is whether he will be in a position to increase the income eligibility limits.  I sincerely hope he will be in a position to increase those limits so that everyone will have access to support from the third level grant system.</P>
      <P>I wish in my remaining minutes to refer to the very good and useful proposals contained in this package which will give many people access to third level education, something they did not have up to now.  I am referring in particular to families who have more than one child attending third level education.  It is totally unfair that a man who pays PAYE and has two, three or four children attending a third level institution at present does not receive any benefit whatsoever, not even the slightest tax relief.  The fact that such families will have their income eligibility increased by £2,000 per child is a very significant step forward.  It is also significant that income eligibility will be assessed on the basis of current income rather than on the income for the year during which the child sat the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant development of all &mdash; I regard this as radical &mdash; is the proposal that mature students be assessed on the basis of their income.  At a time when second chance education is now becoming a very vital part of many people's education, particularly for those <Col N="2574" /> who come from deprived backgrounds or families where it was not possible to contemplate third level education, this is a very welcome development.  Many people who are working and want to enter third level education will now have that opportunity to do so due to the fact that they can now qualify for grants under the higher education grant scheme.  This is a most praiseworthy and welcome development which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I know of thousands of people of 20, 21 and 22 years who are working in low income jobs.  They will now have the opportunity of going to third level institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">

      <P>I fully support this motion.  Having listened to Deputy Fahey's contribution, the arguments in favour of this motion which have been made over and over again need to be repeated.  The Minister's amendment to the motion needs to be clarified.  I do not understand what he means when he says that it is intended to complete a full <Col N="2575" /> review of the criteria for eligibility for student grants by September 1992.  I take it that no review has yet been carried out.  The Minister intends to means test maintenance grants without having carried out any review of the criteria for eligibility for student grants.  I should like the Minister to say what he means by that and when this review will take place. During the course of that review will he also review the proposal to means test maintenance grants?  There may be a hidden meaning in the amendment and perhaps the Minister will change his mind.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for accepting Deputy Higgins's proposal to establish a permanent education secretariat in Brussels.  He said that co-ordinated arrangements are being made to ensure major expansion in EC support, including the establishment of a permanent education representative in Brussels.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is taking the European scene, on which so much of our educational support depends, seriously.  I will refer to this point later.  Deputy Higgins in his motion calls on the Government to enter into negotiations with the EC to obtain further ESF funding.  I think that is available at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed my views on the means testing of educational grants almost immediately the announcement was made.  I issued a statement on the matter. I referred in particular to the creation of a further obstacle to equality of opportunity in third level vocational education. I have referred repeatedly to this issue. During the debate on the Regional Technical Colleges Act the previous Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, agreed to accept an amendment to ensure equality of opportunity in education generally. The Government are taking a step backwards in this whole area.  It is interesting to note the number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers who are opposed to the Minister's proposals.  This is probably a new development among backbenchers. In future, backbenchers may <Col N="2576" /> oppose what Ministers are trying to do in regard to different issues.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quill put forward some good arguments in regard to the low threshold.  I also referred to this point in my statement.  I pointed out that the income threshold levels for university grants were already ridiculously low.  That point was also made by Deputy Quill.  If the same income limits were applied to vocational grants the consequences could be disastrous.  It is a long number of years since the City of Dublin vocational education committee issued a press release.  It is not a common practice among vocational education committees and certainly not for the City of Dublin vocational education committee. I never remember them issuing a press release, but on 9 January this year they issued a press release as a result of their concern about the sudden announcement by the Minister regarding means testing of maintenance grants.  In that press release they make the point that the committee were surprised that such a major change would be introduced without adequate notice and without regard to the particular sensitivity of applicants currently making choices for CAO-CAS places, which they had to do before 1 February.  As these people were making their choices they were told they might not receive a grant.  This is the major point with which the City of Dublin vocational education committee are so concerned.  In their press release they called on the Government to defer any modification of the ESF grant system until 1993 so as to allow time for detailed analysis of the potential effects, particularly on participation rates among lower and middle income families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a major issue within the City of Dublin vocational education committee in regard to Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and within every vocational committee throughout the country in regard to the regional technical colleges.  The Minister did not take <Col N="2577" /> the opportunity to examine the effects of the proposal on participation rates.  The Dublin Institute of Technology at Bolton Street passed a motion on 14 January in which they said that, if this proposal is based on present means tests as they apply to higher education grants and vocational education committee scholarships, it may result in at least two-thirds of the participants in these courses no longer being eligible and that many of them may be unable to pursue any form of third level education.  They pointed out that the system is totally inequitable for those families in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Everybody involved in the area of vocational education, regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges &mdash; staff, principals, teachers and students &mdash; are united in condemning this outrageous off-the-top-of-the-head decision which was made without any reference to the effects it would have on student numbers and participation rates.  The students of the Bolton Street college issued a statement in which they pointed out the beneficial effects of the ESF grant system on the colleges, on participation rates and on the system generally.  They pointed out that in the Dublin area &mdash; I am sure the position is the same in regional technical colleges &mdash; the maintenance grant amounts to £39 a week while the grant for rent amounts to £25 per week.  Even a reduction in maintenance grants would be unacceptable.  Partial maintenance grants would be as bad as no maintenance grant because students would not survive on them.  The effect of this proposal on Bolton Street college would be a reduction in participation rates.  It is estimated that out of 6,300 students who have been in receipt of grants, as many as 3,000 would not be eligible as a result of the means test.</P>
    <P>Through the Clancy report of 1986 the effect of means testing higher education grants is widely known.  It is a pity that an up to date report is not made on this matter because it would be very interesting to compare the position in 1992 with that in 1986.  The position is now much <Col N="2578" /> worse than it was in 1986, and the introduction of this means test will make it even worse still.  The USI have produced figures comparing categories of students in RTCs with those in universities.  They show that 30 per cent of students in universities are from the professional class, whereas in the regional technical colleges only 12.2 per cent are from the professional class; and 13.9 per cent of students in universities are from the manual worker area, whereas 31.4 per cent of students in regional technical colleges are from that area.  This indicates the importance of the whole grants system for increased participation rates from working class families, particularly families of PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Culliton report, which has been widely accepted as a marvellous report.  In the section on education, enterprise and technology that report states that despite its enviable academic standards the Irish education and training system has serious gaps when it comes to technical and vocational education.  Those gaps are caused by a lack of funding down through the years. The report goes on to state that the gap in skills needs to be addressed by industry and by the educational system, with particular attention to practical needs which combine on the job training front with a strong back up from vocational and technical schools.</P>
    <P>This proposal from the Minister will result in the reverse of the Culliton recommendation that funding to the vocational and technical sector be increased in order to increase participation in that area.</P>
    <P>I would refer again to the increased EC Structural Fund which is adverted to in the motion.  As I understand it, the limit of 19,500 students to whom ESF grants are given at present will be reviewed in 1993.  Therefore it is in next year's Estimates that the Minister for Finance will have to provide for the increase. The Minister should be able to draw on the Structural Fund in 1992-93 to provide for at least portion of the extra cost.  I am asking the Minister, as did the City of Dublin vocational education committee, <Col N="2579" /> to defer this proposal to give an opportunity to vocational education committees, RTCs and the Dublin Institute of Technology to carry out assessments, discuss the matter with the Department of Education and realise the effect it will have on student numbers and participation rates.  The places left vacant by people who are most in need of the grants will be taken up by people who can afford third level education.  That is not equality of educational opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that what I have to say will not add very significantly to the volume of information and argument that has been made for this case, but I simply want to support the motion tabled by Fine Gael and to support the comments made by Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>
      <P>The argument being made here tonight that students, whether in university or in colleges of technology, RTCs or other institutions, need an adequate level of funding is not a new argument.  Neither is the argument that without such funding the idea of equality of opportunity to third level education simply cannot be achieved.  There is already a volume of evidence, reports and research that shows very clearly that in this country, because of the inadequacy of student support, the participation rates of young people from less well-off backgrounds in third level education is much lower than elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has already referred to the Clancy report, which clearly indicates that even without our own system those areas of education funded by the ESF system &mdash; which provides not a fabulous method of support for students but a non-means tested level of support &mdash; have higher levels of participation of young people from poorer backgrounds than do those institutions that do not have that support.  Very few people could argue against the case that in order to achieve equality of opportunity in third level education there needs to be a system of student support.  That is not to argue that there are not other factors, going right back down through <Col N="2580" /> the education system, that affect those levels of participation.</P>
    <P>The argument for means testing is not a new argument either.  That argument, basically, is that someone who attends third level education is somehow in a privileged position.  The argument asks why the taxpayer should be expected to pay the fees or the maintenance of children from well-off backgrounds.  Probably it is a reflection of the degree to which our education system is so unequal, but the impression created is that those who attend third level education courses must be the sons and daughters of people on extremely high incomes.</P>
    <P>First of all, the idea that participation in third level education automatically confers privilege on the participant must be due for something of a revision anyway.  Very many graduates of regional technical colleges, Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and universities find themselves in very ordinary jobs.  As a trade union official of many years' standing, I have found repeated evidence of people graduating from third level institutions and then finding themselves working in nominally good jobs at what was, in fact, very often underpaid employment.  Many of those graduates are now emigrating, of course, so that the idea of automatic privilege does need to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The other argument made is that the taxpayer should not fund that education. The last time that that idea surfaced in relation to student support concerned the previous automatic right of third level students to medical cards.  As it happened, only about 20 per cent of third level students at any time ever took up the option of the benefit of a medical card, but a great to-do was made about removing the automatic right to medical cards from students.  It is easy to recognise the result of that action.  Students from very well-heeled backgrounds may still end up having their medical care, such as it is, provided at the Blackrock Clinics of the world.  Those who are disadvantaged are those who came from low to middle-income backgrounds and who <Col N="2581" /> find that because their parents do not qualify for medical cards, they do not quality either.  I have come across repeated instances of students from families in poor circumstances who could not qualify for medical cards.  Instead of hitting those on very high incomes, the means testing of student support very often has the effect of hitting those of low to middle incomes.</P>
    <P>My third argument concerns the idea of dependency.  That needs to be examined. I have never been able to understand why student support is based on parental income.  Most students are over 18 years of age; they have the right to vote and they have all the rights and responsibilities of adulthood, yet their financial support in third-level education is based on parental income.  It is time that we finished with that system.  It is time for us to treat students as adult citizens who are participating in a course of study and whose financial support should be based on the fact that they are adults.</P>
    <P>The budget was presented in the House a few weeks ago.  The budget was marketed as a great deal for the taxpayer.  It was certainly a great deal for the taxpayer on a very high income &mdash; people on high incomes of perhaps £60,000 or £70,000 a year got the benefit of tax cuts of about £50 a week.  I do not understand the way in which a Government can on the one hand say that they are reducing tax for people on very high incomes and can then on the other hand say that they must introduce a means test on student support so that they do not subsidise the children of the well-off when, in fact, that means test will end up hitting the people on low to middle incomes.  That is an inconsistency &mdash; or perhaps it is not an inconsistency at all, perhaps that is the way in which the Government demonstrate their attitude to taxation and to social services. If the Government wanted to say that those who are well-off should finance their children's education then there is already a way in which that can be done, through the taxation system.  The Government should not take the approach of penalising those in the education system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2582" /> My final point relates to those who will be hit by the new measure.  People do not make a decision about the line of study they intend to pursue on the day they sit their leaving certificate examination. There are now many students at senior cycle in second level education who have geared themselves to follow third level courses that are ESF funded.  Those students have given consideration to their future; they have gone through career guidance and they intend to pursue ESF funded third level courses.  Those people will find themselves in a very difficult position if, having made subject choices and having geared themselves to pursue courses of study in the belief that the courses they would follow were ESF funded and in the belief that those courses were non-means tested, the courses they intend to pursue are now means tested and they are not able to attend them.</P>

      <P>The decision by the sacked Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, to introduce the present means testing system for students in regional colleges, who are in receipt of ESF grants, was one of the most controversial, regressive and unjustifiable decisions taken by any Minister for Education for a long time.</P>
      <P>It is unbelievable that during so short a term of office, such an enormous blunder could be made, resulting in stress and anxiety among parents, and despair and hopelessness among students.  The decision has sounded the death knell to the hopes and aspirations to third level education of almost 10,000 students. The results of his misguided and hasty stroke of the pen on Friday, 10 January, are alarming, not only for the students, but for the future of our regional colleges and also for our economy, which depends heavily on these colleges to provide a highly educated, trained and qualified labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision was an indication of the inability of the Government to tackle the real problem of basic injustice and <Col N="2583" /> inequity in the higher education grants system.  The Minister, to console those in Higher Education Authority colleges who suffer under the present unjust system, obviously felt that a trouble shared was a trouble halved.  He decided that they should be joined by students from the regional colleges and together they could shoulder this massive disregard for their future due to their inability to pay for third level education.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that successive Ministers for Education have done nothing to change the present unfair, unsatisfactory and unacceptable system of means testing for higher education grants which results in huge discrimination against PAYE families and the exclusion of people on modest incomes from receiving the higher education grants.</P>
    <P>A blind eye and a deaf ear has been the only response of this Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government to these urgent and compelling needs. Nothing has been done, despite repeated calls from the Fine Gael Party to tackle these injustices urgently.</P>
    <P>Proposals to increase the income thresholds by 33 per cent in order to avoid the elimination from third level grants of people who basically could not afford third level education have been rejected and disregarded.  However, Fine Gael believe that families who cannot afford the cost of university or college education should be entitled to grant assistance and we will continue to use our energies to convince the Government that their policy was misguided and misjudged.</P>
    <P>In announcing the extension of means testing for ESF grants, the Minister said he was pleased to announce a range of improvements.  How could it give any Minister pleasure to shock the population of our regional colleges, to shatter the plans of hopeful entrants and to force parents to accept that they cannot afford to ensure that their children have the chance to achieve their full potential?</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his statement he wanted to have more equity and fairness. <Col N="2584" /> Unfortunately, to the Government fairness means extending the inequity further. How could any Minister hope to achieve equity by extending an inequitable system?  It was illogical to even contemplate extending the present means testing system which in essence is unjust and which in application is unfair and totally unreliable.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Quill that the thresholds are too low.  Deputy Quill pointed out that people, even those on the dole, may not be in a position to receive a higher education grant.  How can she then support a decision that results in people on the dole not getting any ESF grants?  The attitude of those in the Government parties tonight is absolutely unexplainable and unacceptable.</P>

      <P>Our regional colleges have been a major success in the education field, surpassing all expectations, not only in the expansion of student numbers, but also in the quality and excellence of their graduates.  Their success is due in large part to the opportunities they offer to so many highly intelligent and capable students who, because of the ESF grant, could avail of the opportunity to pursue third level courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the plain blunt fact that the income thresholds are unrealistic and so low, unfortunately many of the present leaving certificate students will now be unable to avail of third level education. This is shameful, it is a crime.  The decision must be reversed immediately. This decision has nothing to do with fairness or equity.  It is all about cutting expenditure on third level education, it is about trimming the budget.  That was an appalling decision by the Department who were prepared to spend millions on bricks and mortar to purchase Carysfort, but then, the vendor was a friend.  It would be outrageous if as a result of this decision the students who will sit the <Col N="2585" /> leaving certificate in June will have to pay for this enormous scandal.</P>
    <P>The Minister must re-evaluate the merit of this decision which will deny many students the opportunity of third level education and which will reap little or no financial reward.  The decision has no merit.  The Minister would give an excellent signal of his concern and interest in our students by withdrawing this proposal.  It will be a decision which the Minister will never forget.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the considered contributions to this debate from the Deputies who participated.  I wish to reiterate the statement of the Minister for Education, Deputy Seamus Brennan, yesterday that he would give careful consideration to the many points made which result from concern for students and their families.</P>
      <P>I would, however, like to contradict the contention of some of the Deputies that the amendments to the ESF grants constitute an attack on the lower income groups and the unemployed.  This, most definitely, is not the case.</P>
      <P>In his speech to the House on this debate, the Minister was at pains to point out that the new arrangements were specifically designed to protect students from these very groups.  This is entirely in keeping with the Government's commitment to discriminate positively in favour of the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The measures taken by the Government in education in pursuit of their policy of bettering the lot of the less-well-off is already on the record of the House. A corollary of this policy has been to ensure that added advantage is not conferred on the already privileged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refute, categorically, the suggestions made that the introduction of means-testing for ESF grants would have an adverse effect on regional development and on enrolments in RTCs.  Deputy O'Shea, indeed, suggested that its introduction was part of a strategy to limit the growth of the vocational education committee colleges <Col N="2586" /> and to divert students to the Higher Education Authority sector.  This is clearly not the case.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, in 1992 the allocation of £42 million for vocational education committee student grants and scholarships represents an increase of 16 per cent on the 1991 outturn while the allocation for higher education grants at £32 million represents an increase of 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Projections by the Department of Education suggest that student entry to vocational education committee third level colleges will increase from under 13,000 students in 1991 to about 17,000 by the mid-nineties.</P>
    <P>The Government regard the development of the vocational education committee third level sector as a critical factor in regional economic development.</P>
    <P>A major capital development programme to expand and develop the vocational education committee colleges has been undertaken by Government. The capital allocation in 1992 is almost £21 million compared with £8.5 million in 1990 and will enable facilities in the colleges to be developed and enhanced.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and the Regional Technical Colleges Bill will provide greater authonomy for the institutions and will provide a statutory base to enable them to engage in research, development and consultancy work for business and industry.  The legislation will assist them to increase their interaction with commercial and business interests.  This can only encourage and promote further regional economic development.</P>
    <P>The revised arrangements for ESF maintenance have to be seen in the context of limited ESF support, constraints on Exchequer finances and massive increases in the numbers of third level students achieved over the past few years and projected over the next decade.</P>
    <P>Of the 75,000 students attending third level courses over half receive support for fees and maintenance at a total cost of £72 million.  The average support per student is £1,900 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained the stark <Col N="2587" /> choice that faced the Government in deciding to revise the arrangements for ESF maintenance grants.  The only alternative to the decision taken was to restrict the number of students attending third level courses.  This would have involved denying some 2,600 students their places in college and was obviously, not a viable option.</P>
    <P>The full cost to the State of these extra third level students is £10 million in the current year.  The savings achieved by the revised ESF maintenance grants scheme will fall far short of this amount.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what the Minister stressed last night in the House: there will be no change for students already enrolled on ESF-aided third level courses. For example, students already enrolled on ESF-aided certificate courses in a college who on successful completion of their certificate studies wish to transfer to recognised diploma programmes either in the same college or in another college would not be affected in any way by the changes in the ESF maintenance grants scheme.  They will continue to receive their maintenance grants.  Nor would it apply to those continuing or resuming such courses after gaining work experience.  It will apply only to those students starting their third level studies for the first time in September 1992.  I hope this will be understood by all Members but more importantly, by the many students representing various groups present.</P>
    <P>Furthermore all new students on these ESF third level courses will continue to have their tuition fees paid for them, regardless of income.  What is at issue is means testing for maintenance grants only.  New ESF students will therefore, still have a considerable advantage over other third level students.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the package on third level student grants which the Minister detailed for the House is to achieve absolute equity in the distribution of available funds.</P>
    <P>The total cost to the State of the <Col N="2588" /> improvements made to the higher education grant scheme will amount to £4 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The amendments introduced for ESF maintenance grants will ensure that more students from the lower income families can participate in third level education. The Minister has said that the revised arrangements forced on the Government by limited funds protect students from the lower income groups.  He also accepts that there remains a problem for students from middle income groups.  He is conscious of the financial presssures placed on the families in these groups in providing for third level education for their children.</P>
    <P>I want to confirm the Minister's announcement in the House last evening that he intends to complete a review of the criteria for eligibility for student grants by September 1992, requested by many Members here this evening.  The Minister is not satisfied nor am I that the overall higher education grants scheme, as it applies at present, is a sensible one, rendering this review all the more necessary.  I served for almost 18 years on a higher education grant committee in County Kilkenny during which period I along with my colleagues of all political parties urged constantly on consecutive Ministers for Education the need for these changes.  At long last this worthwhile change is to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The review will be of the entire grants scheme, including recent changes, and will entail a total overhaul.  There have been many excellent suggestions advanced here this evening, such as interest-free loans and various alternatives. I can guarantee Members that every single suggestion will be taken into consideration in the course of that review.</P>
    <P>In the light of some comments of a &ldquo;doubting Thomas&rdquo; nature <i>vis-à-vis</i> this announcement from the Opposition benches, I want to avail myself of this opportunity to explain in full detail the subject of the review which will be comprehensive in its scope and objective, the overall aim being to ensure equity within and between different schemes.  Indeed <Col N="2589" /> it will include the removal of any outstanding barriers which may militate against students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, through a perverse sense of generosity I am sharing my time with Deputy Jim Higgins. Much to my annoyance I will speak for only two or three minutes.  The debate on this motion has infuriated me, particularly having listened to some contributions from the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; is being thrown around here on the far side of the House. I wish Members opposite would look at its meaning in the dictionary because we have the most unjust and unfair system of means testing for third level grants. Members opposite continue to tell us they want to introduce equity into the regional technical colleges, whereas thousands of students will lose grants. What equity can be perceived in dragging down the few with a few pounds in their pockets to the level of those with none? The Minister knows as well as I do that PAYE earners, those in the middle income bracket are utterly deprived of the opportunity of sending their children to third level institutions.  The ESF grants afforded them the opportunity to avail themselves of the provisions of a very <Col N="2590" /> good system while adding to the status of the RTCs.  Now the Government devise and propose this system of depriving them of their grants while maintaining that it is in the interests of equity.  I never heard such rubbish.  I would appeal to the Minister of State and his senior Minister to take the proposals they inherited into their hands, make a ball of them and dump them in the rubbish bin.  Furthermore, in the review to be undertaken, I would appeal to them to use common sense to ensure that justice and equity, in their real sense, prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleague, Deputy Browne, in congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment.</P>
      <P>I want to sincerely thank all those who contributed to this debate, my colleagues, Deputies Deenihan, Creed, McGinley, Flanagan, Therese Ahearn and Browne.  Deputy Deenihan accurately addressed the fact that the proposal would have a direct impact on 21,000 students out of a total of 27,000 attending the 15 RTCs and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.  He also illustrated graphically the effect of a £1 million loss to the revenue of a place like Tralee, demonstrating that Tralee will be very much part and parcel of the sense of deprivation felt right around the provinces where these colleages are located if this measure is implemented.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed raised a very interesting point, that was the constitutional position of the denial of the right to education at all and every level by the Government, something never tested and which will be much tested if the Government implement this most unreasonable, unjust means test.  This was a point well put in principle also by Deputy Gilmore when he spoke of students being adults in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank my colleagues for their well reasoned, constructive, supporting statements, on having underlined in the starkest terms the travesty of justice that will occur if this means testing is effected. Indeed I want to thank them for bringing their personal perspectives to bear on the overall attitude to third level education <Col N="2591" /> here, on having endeavoured to assist the Minister and the Minister of State to see reason and reverse throttle on this educationally damaging proposal.</P>
    <P>I also want to assure Labour Party Deputies O'Shea, Howlin and Toddy O'Sullivan that we appreciated their total support of the motion without amendment or addendum.  In particular I want to thank The Workers' Party, Deputies Mac Giolla and Gilmore, on their wholehearted, trenchant support of the Fine Gael motion as tabled.  I want to thank Deputy Cullimore also for having contributed last evening although he did not mention a word about third level grants, having taken us on a journey down memory lane into the intermediate and junior certificates.  Again it was good that we afforded Members opposite an opportunity to air their views on education, and I would include Deputies F. Fahey and Martin in those remarks.</P>
    <P>I listened with some interest to Deputy Quill, whose contribution was a typical Progressive Democrat exercise, coming into the Chamber, all wind and concern, with a sense of dementia in relation to what is happening out there.  Indeed she spoke almost as if she were an Opposition Deputy.  We were almost about to invite her over to this side of the House.  She talked about the unjust delays in paying out the grants, apart from the basic inequity of the scheme.  What I am saying to Deputy Quill and to her five colleagues is that in about 20 minutes time we will go up those steps and that will be the final test in relation to where the Progressive Democrats stand on this issue.</P>

      <P>If they turn with Fine Gael, Labour and The Workers' Party when they get to the top of those steps then they support the right of the people in the Gallery to education.  If they go in the other direction, then they will pay the cost when they put their names before the electorate again.  That is the crucial test.  It is not rhetoric.  The reality of how <Col N="2592" /> they vote at the end of the day is the acid test.</P>
      <P>I agree with the means testing of certain grants, but I do not agree with the means testing of grants when it comes to the regional technical colleges.  While I welcome the Minister's very generous complimentary remarks and his very detailed reply last evening, I would say to him that when Fine Gael, Labour and The Workers' Party find common cause and all agree to the wording and spirit of a resolution in this Chamber, then the merits and thrust of what we are collectively trying to bring about is something very worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech last night instanced six changes &mdash; these were again alluded to by the Minister of State tonight and by Deputy Máirín Quill &mdash; as being a major reform package of the existing higher education grants scheme.  These were the very measures that were introduced by the former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, much heralded in the newspaper as &ldquo;Davern's Major Initiative on Higher Education Grants&rdquo;. Of course any improvement on the existing higher education grants scheme is welcome, but the six changes announced are literally nothing.  They are only a minuscule tinkering with the existing system.  They will have minimal effect in relation to easing the burden on PAYE families.  To try to portray those as a major remedying of inequity is in fact absurd.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to state that this policy is to achieve absolute equity in the distribution of funds.  What he is doing by means testing ESF grants is spreading the misery around.  He is spreading the inherent inequity in the existing university system into the RTC and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges system. The Minister is not levelling the playing pitch for third-level students but instead is making the playing field more unplayable for all concerned.  He should not pull one group down in order to pull another group up but rather try to get everybody on an equal plane and on a higher tier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern acknowledged that there are anomalies in the scheme <Col N="2593" /> but he went on to defend means testing. I wonder how his defence will go down in Dundalk when it is read next week. One should not go to the lowest common denominator, as is happening in this case. One should aim for the highest denominator possible; and in this case I am talking about additional ESF grants for the universities, both by way of fees and maintenance.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister continue to trot out again former Minister Davern's discredited argument that means testing for ESF maintenance grants will ensure that a greater number of students from lower income families will be enabled to participate in third level education.  How anyone can maintain that is beyond comprehension.  It defies logic.  Is it Government policy to drive out middle income families in order to allow in lower income families even when it has proved that this is not possible?  One of the singular successes of the existing RTC and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges is that you get a very healthy social mix between the lower middle and the middle income families.  This will not create additional places for lower income families.</P>
    <P>The college managements, vocational education committees, students themselves from their own hands-on involvement all concur that seven out of every ten students who enrol for admission to RTCs and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges next year will be debarred and disqualified.  This is an accurate figure which has not been disputed by the Minister, the Minister of State or anybody on the other side of the House. Where are the Minister's figures to validate his argument that he is going to bring more people into the colleges?  It is not possible because the colleges are bursting at the seams already.  I will be quite blunt, and I am not alone in my suspicion in his regard.  I honestly believe there is a hidden agenda here and that the motive behind this measure is to cut back on third level places, that it has been decided that third level education is too expensive, that there is a definite Government policy decision that this country will no <Col N="2594" /> longer be the educational conveyor belt for technology and manpower for Europe.  If that is the situation, it is an extremely regressive, negative and dog-in-the-manger attitude.</P>
    <P>I accept that Europe is not a bottomless pit, but we are part of an integrated Europe consisting of 360 million people. We are well on the way to a common monetary policy.  We have mutual recognition of our degrees, diplomas, technical and professional qualifications.  We are suffering the consequences of our peripherality in terms of loss of jobs in the industrial, commerical and agricultural sectors.  One of the kernel philosophies of our participation in the greater Europen Community, if the word &ldquo;Community&rdquo; means anything at all, is that we should be able to guarantee to all our citizens without exception a level of education appropriate to their abilities and attainments. Top quality education and training is a basic social entitlement.  Because of economic circumstances our young people are therefore entitled to this and are entitled to ply their wares abroad if they cannot ply them at home.  However, there is also the compelling and proven statistical argument from the point of view of the home market that the longer you keep people in mainstream education the greater you enhance their chances of employment.</P>
    <P>I would again draw the Minister's attention, just as Deputy MacGiolla has done, to the Culliton report, which tells us that it is essential to redress our academic imbalance by &ldquo;improving the incentives and facilities for students opting for technical and vocational training&rdquo;. What the Culliton report is telling the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government is that in the national interest, and in the interest of driving our economy forward, he should discriminate positively in favour of technical and vocational education.  This is the type and quality of education being given to the RTCs and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and the vocational schools.  These colleges must be put on a special plane of their own and they must get priority treatment.  The Culliton <Col N="2595" /> report states that we should keep the existing ESF arrangement in place for all students because these colleges have a special function and a special relevance of their own.</P>
    <P>Last night in the House, and again today at Question Time, the Minister undertook to review the higher education grants scheme by September.  May I say that a review without reform is not worth a whit?  Furthermore, the Minister's promise has been rendered meaningless by an unscripted statement which he made in the House last night and again at Question Time today, and I quote: &ldquo;The same rules must apply for all&rdquo;.  The Minister has prejudiced the review before he has even embarked on it.  What the Minister has said is that we will go through the motions of a review but that there is absolutely no possibility whatever in any circumstances of special treatment for the RTCs or the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges as recommended by the Culliton report.  I urge the Minister to lift his review proposal to a new and meaningful plane and to do as I suggested last night &mdash; to establish a reform, not a review committee, involving the main participants in higher education, the universities, the RTCs and <Col N="2596" /> Dublin Institute of Technology colleges, the IVEA, the students, together with the official from the Department of Education and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of his speech the Minister stated that the existing ESF fund arrangements expire in December 1993 and that he was confident that the new Community support framework will result in substantially more EC aid for programmes in third level colleges.  That is extremely welcome news.  I urge the Minister by all means to go for this money, to assign the bulk of these additional resources to the university sector and to use the secretariat in Brussels &mdash; I welcome this as a very worthwhile initiative and I am glad that he has taken our suggestion on board in this regard &mdash; to impress the worthiness of this suggestion on the people in Brussels but in the meantime I say to him sincerely: hands off the ESF maintenance grants; hands off the lower and middle income PAYE families for whom this funding presents their only chance of getting into third level education and, in particular, hands off the young people of Ireland.  This motion may be beaten tonight, but this is not the end, only the beginning.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Swinford (Mayo) Land Flooding.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. This is a very simple case.  It relates to a new primary school which has been built in Killasser, Swinford, County Mayo. This is a very welcome development which is long overdue.  The problem relates to a ten-foot-deep ravine adjacent to the new school yard.  This has been a major bone of contention for a considerable time.  The problem is that two bridges on the ravine cause a back-up of water thereby flooding, on an ongoing basis, almost since the beginning of time, 150 acres of arable but scarce land.</P>
      <P>We are asking for a joint venture between the Office of Public Works and Mayo County Council to solve this problem. I have managed to obtain agreement from Mayo County Council that they will fund, under the local improvements scheme, 50 per cent of the cost of this operation.  The operation would involve the deepening of the ravine in order to enable it to take away the water, deepening of the two bridges in question, laying of pipes where the drain and bridges are at present and completing the work to everybody's satisfaction.  If the Office of Public Works proceed as is envisaged an unsatisfactory arrangement would be put in place.  The current level of water would be maintained and flooding would continue <i>ad infinitum,</i> resulting in an irreversible position.  Now that the work is being done I ask for a little sanity, co-operation and a joint venture between the Office of Public Works and Mayo County Council.  I hope children will be safer and everybody will be happier as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Higgins and myself will be able to create the necessary sanity for the people of the area.  The channel in question is situated in the townland of Listernane and forms the boundary between Killasser Church and the site of the new national school which is under construction at the moment.  This open channel is a scheduled channel of the completed works of the Moy catchment drainage scheme. This scheme was carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works during the period 1960-71 under powers derived from the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. The purpose of this drainage scheme was to provide improved outfall for aricultural lands and to reduce the incidence of flooding in the area.  As the House will appreciate total immunity from flooding can never be guaranteed.  Indeed, the Moy catchment drainage scheme provided considerable benefit to approximately 61,000 acres of land in counties Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maintenance of the completed works of this drainage scheme is the statutory responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works under sections 37 and 38 of the 1945 Act.  The channels are regularly <Col N="2603" /> inspected and the necessary work is carried out as and when required, depending on the availability of resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister carry out the inspections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, my top professionals do that.  It is important to note that sections 37 and 38 of the 1945 Act confine the Commissioners of Public Works to the maintenance of the scheme to the original design.</P>
      <P>When the new school was being built at Killasser, the Commissioner of Public Works gave their approval and clearly stipulated certain conditions for the section of drain to be piped.  The reason for the &ldquo;piping&rdquo; request was twofold; first safety for children in the school and secondly, in order to facilitate the extension of the playground.  The pipes have now been laid over a 77 metre stretch in accordance with the commissioners specifications and in compliance with the design depth.  Local landowners have complained that the original drain, unpiped, was not sufficiently deep to adequately convey the required volumes of water.  The Commissioners of Public Works advise me that they do not accept this; the drain has been regularly inspected and has always been maintained to the scheme design depth.  The piping of this drain will not adversely affect the ability of the channel to convey water.  In the circumstances, the commissioners advise me that they do not propose to undertake any further works. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the tremendous co-operation the commissioners have given in ensuring that this drain was piped.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Wandering Horses.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of wandering horses has not been tackled.  It should have been tackled many years ago by successive administrations.  Suburbs of Cork city such as Ballyvolane, Hollyhill and Bishopstown have been devastated <Col N="2604" /> by wandering horses owned by itinerants who camp in the area.  The problem in Cork is similar to that in most cities and towns around the country.  Parents are sometimes afraid to send their childen to school because of the danger from horses racing around the streets.  Much lip-service has been given to the question of the control of wandering animals.  I will deal specifically with horses tonight, but wandering donkeys and cattle cause problems. The problem of wandering horses must be tackled especially in view of the recent appalling accident in Cork involving a truck which, I understand, swerved to avoid a wandering horse and hit a car. The accident resulted in the death of one man and another is critically ill in hospital in Cork.  This accident brought home to us all the need to introduce legislation as quickly as possible to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, when gardaí went to investigate this accident, the owner of the horse had disappeared.  The Minister has a responbility to introduce legislation to deal with this problem.  It is ridiculous that while one needs a licence to own a dog no licence is required to own a horse. I ask the Minister to include in legislation provision for the licensing and tagging of all horses and the registration of all owners, with a requirement, that the authorities be notified of change of ownership.  That is the minimum that is required.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this is cruelty to animals.  If I had more time I would deal with this issue which also needs to be addressed.  There is an abundance of evidence of extreme cruelty to horses, donkeys and other animals.  This is highlighted from time to time but nothing is done about it.  If the Minister does not introduce legislation to deal with it quickly I intend to introduce a Bill to do so.  I ask the Minister to do something before more lives are lost and further property is damaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the case to which Deputy Allen has adverted. <Col N="2605" /> I would like to convey my sincerest sympathy to the bereaved family and to everyone involved in this tragic accident. An investigation by the Garda is under way and, in view of the possibility of legal proceedings being instituted, I do not think it would be proper for me to make any further comment on the matter.</P>
      <P>I understand the accident arose because of a lack of effective control over the animal rather than the fact that it was wandering in the accepted sense.  I will address the subject matter as raised by the Deputy and speak about the general question of wandering horses.  The question of how to deal with this matter has been debated several times in this House in recent times and I welcome this opportunity to make clear my position on it.</P>
      <P>Most people, if the issue was put to them, would say that the control of horses &mdash; any more than the control of dogs &mdash; has nothing to do with the Minister for Justice, his Department or the Garda and essentially they would be right.  However, the legal issues and the effect of wandering horses, with their potential for human tragedy, damage to property and resulting civil liability, could not be ignored by any Minister for Justice.  My Department have in the past, therefore, sponsored legislation to enable wandering animals, including horses, to be impounded.  The most recent statute is the Animals Act, 1985, which up-dated and improved the law in this area.  First, and very importantly, it gave new, wide powers to local authorities and the Garda to impound wandering animals.  Second, it gave new powers to local authorities regarding the sale, disposal or destruction of impounded animals.  Thirdly, it provided for increased fines for such offences as allowing animals to wander onto public property.  The Act also abolished the then immunity of occupiers of land adjoining the public road in relation to danger caused by animals straying onto the road.  That is the old common law rule known as the rule of Searle <i>v.</i> Wallbank.  As a result of that legislation the ordinary laws of negligence apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Deputies, including <Col N="2606" /> Deputy Allen and many Deputies from my party, have been concerned in recent times to see if a more fundamental solution can be found which will address the source of this problem, the ownership and control of horses, particularly in urban areas.  While such an approach is outside the sphere of responsibility of the Minister for Justice it is not unreasonable to say that there is a problem and some solution will have to found to it.  Incidentally, I understand that several solutions, including proposals along the lines referred to by Deputy Allen, are being considered at the moment by another Government Department.</P>
    <P>The limited employment of the gardaí in impounding wandering horses, while important in itself, is nevertheless only treating an acute symptom of a deep-seated, fundamental problem.  As far as the Minister's responsibilities are concerned, the existing legislative powers are probably as strong as they can reasonably be expected to be and I am sure that the Garda for their part will continue to give the highest possible degree of priority to their functions in this matter in line with the other onerous demands made on them in the areas of crime and security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter of the difficulties faced by Tralee General Hospital.  There are two aspects to the matter.  First, there is the question of the overall level of expenditure within the conditions of the Southern Health Board and, second the inadequate level of service available to persons in County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several problems have been highlighted recently by the staff of the hospital.  Some of them are very physical <Col N="2607" /> problems in that they relate to the equipment required.  I urge the Minister to consider the issue on a personal basis, because in Tralee we have what I would describe as a very fine hospital &mdash; I am sure that the Minister is fully aware of the facilities available there.  Regrettably, one-third of the hospital is not in service because of financial difficulties; but we do have a tremendous facility.  The staff are coping in very difficult times but, unfortunately, they are now being confronted with inadequate funding from the health board itself.  I am always conscious of the level of funding provided to the regional hospital in Cork, which obviously has a much wider range of services available.  I do point out to the Minister, however, that several areas put considerable strain on the level of health services available.</P>
    <P>The citizens of County Kerry have helped out in no uncertain way in fundraising to help the hospital but, unfortunately, the contributions raised have not been reciprocated by either the health board or the State.  The most recent example of that attitude occurred when laparoscopic equipment was required by the hospital and was funded by public contributions and fundraising activities in the town of Tralee and the county at large.</P>
    <P>There are shortages in other areas. There is a tremendous shortage of minor surgical staff, there is inadequate stomach and mastectomy care and there is a big question about the care of dangerous drugs.</P>
    <P>The issue of junior anaesthetic staff has been a problem in the hospital for several years.  Hospital consultants advise that there is a danger of disaster in that area because the staff in the anaesthesia department cover all kinds of situations, there is no back-up service and there is the danger that when someone is on duty he or she will be required in another part of the hospital.</P>
    <P>The position is serious, if not verging on alarming, and I ask the new Minister for Health to consider the issue and to have discussions with the health board <Col N="2608" /> about the proper funding of what is a very valuable service to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring has outlined the basis of the concern and the complaints of the hospital staff.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the new Minister is in the Chamber tonight.  I wish him well. It is pleasing to note that he has professional expertise, training and knowlege that will enable him to perhaps make a better judgment on medical matters than would a lay person.</P>
      <P>To say that the issue is of very deep concern is to understate the case both in relation to the inadequacy of equipment and in relation to the inadequate levels of staff.  The matter is very serious when it comes to a hospital the size of Tralee General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to come to Tralee to meet the hospital consultants.  They are most anxious to make a direct case to him and portray their problems and the problems of the patients they are endeavouring to serve.  Such a gesture would create a most harmonious relationship between the Minister, hospital staff and the hospital patients, who are so dependent on the staff.</P>
      <P>It is felt that there has been inadequate health board funding over a long period. Not only is it considered that Kerry receives inadequate funding, but also that we are not getting a fair share of funding.  The Minister should thoroughly satisfy himself on that matter.  It is felt by the people of Tralee that our hospital does not get a fair share of funding in comparison to the Cork Regional Hospital in terms of the volume of work done.</P>
      <P>I appeal urgently to the Minister to come to Kerry and meet the consultants, who would be delighted to sincerely bring this serious matter to his attention with a view to some rectification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am glad to have a chance to address the House on the question of health funding so soon after taking up my responsibilities in the Department of Health.  I am very pleased <Col N="2609" /> that the Deputies have brought the matter to my attention because it is only in that way that I am becoming more fully aware of what is happening.  The Deputies serve a very good cause in doing so.</P>
      <P>As Members will know, there has been much debate in recent years about the appropriate level of resources that can be committed to the health services.  I have clear views on the way in which the Government should go about getting the best value possible from the very large investment made by the State in health services.  The current health budget exceeds £1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>The Deputies referred to what they feel is an inadequate level of funding for Tralee General Hospital.  I must confess that I was writing about that issue for a long time.  I am well aware of the inadequacies and I do know that part of the hospital is not in use.</P>
      <P>For the Deputies' benefit, I shall give a few details.  The Southern Health Board's allocation for non-capital expenditure in 1992 is £166.8 million.  It will be agreed that that is not an inconsiderable sum by any measure.  The allocation represents an increase of 11.9 per cent over the original allocation for 1991.  The original allocation and the outturn are very different, I do have to admit that.</P>

As well as the £166.8 million, another sum of £350,000 has been allowed for specific service developments, including the establishment of an ENT service at Tralee General Hospital, which has been identified as a priority by the health board and the consultants at Tralee General Hospital.  Discussions on the start-up date for that service will be finalised with officials of my Department in the immediate future and I shall certainly stress the need for urgency.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board were notified of their 1992 revenue allocation by my predecessor.  The board and their management team are currently drawing up a comprehensive service plan that will show the way in which they intend to spend their allocation, with priorities within the budget to be determined according to local needs.</P>
      <P>I say this because of what Deputy Spring has said: I feel that Kerry must be represented and must get its fair share. It is very important to realise that the money is not just for one Cork area, there are other areas.  I should hope that Kerry representatives on the health board would press that point.  I also feel that the board have to manage their affairs to bring budgetary expenditure in line with their allocation.  The board have been established to do that and the local representatives on the health board are the best placed people to decide just how the money should be spent.  I would not have the power to direct the health board on the way in which they should spend their money.  The Deputies know that health boards jealously guard their powers.  I was on the Eastern Health Board and I understand it has not been the practice of any Minister for Health to interfere in the budgetary priorities of health boards. I have not the right to do so now, or I would have you all on my back.</P>

      <P>Expenditure of Tralee <Col N="2611" /> General Hospital in 1990 was £10.3 million and the latest projected expenditure for 1991 is £11.6 million, which represents an increase of 12.6 per cent over 1990.  I understand that funding for the current year will be in excess of £12 million. The Southern Health Board have not yet determined their service plans for the current year.  I will study what Deputy Spring and my friend have said and I will see what we can do.  There are some aspects which I had forgotten about, and I hope to look at them again and contact the Deputies.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear a two minute statement on a matter appropriate to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. I now call on Deputy Nealon to make his two minute statement which will be followed immediately by a two minute reply from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, on her long overdue restoration to Cabinet rank.  I wish her well.</P>
      <P>The best known rail line in the country is now the Sligo-Dublin line.  Unfortunately, for all the wrong reasons.  Conditions on the service had reached such depths that all the communities, from Sligo to Mullingar, banded together in protest, led by Sligo Chamber of Commerce and Sligo Corporation.  Delegations were received by the former Minister for Transport and by Irish Rail. Special funding for track renewal in 1992 was clearly indicated and was confidently expected, but now we find that the demands for proper funding have been thrown back in the face of the protesters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have learned that a sum of just £2 million, from a total of £45 million, has been designated for track renewal on the Sligo-Dublin line in 1992.  There is nothing very special about that when one considers that in 1991 a total of £2.5 <Col N="2612" /> million was allocated before any campaign was started for the line.  But when Irish Rail ran short of money they took back £2 million of that and diverted it to more favoured areas.  So now, what we are getting for 1992 is just the return of the £2 million taken away the previous year; not one penny for 1992 in its own right.  What we are getting will do just seven miles of track renewal this year.  At that rate it will take 20 years to do the whole line.  In the meantime, trains are limited, for safety reasons, to 40 miles an hour on long stretches and it will be 30 miles per hour next year.  That is not the way to run a railway service.</P>
    <P>After a great campaign by a community demanding its rights, the Government have fobbed us off with just what was taken away in 1991.  It is no use saying that this is a matter for Iarnród Éireann. The Government could have provided the funds if they had the will to do so.</P>
    <P>What we are now looking for is a clear, unequivocal plan from the Government, with a timetable, for bringing the Sligo-Dublin rail up to a decent standard.  We are not willing to remain second-class passengers for another 20 years.  I know the new Minister from Galway will be very sympathetic towards our cause.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch den Teachta gur ardaigh sé an cheist seo agus tá súil agam freagra a thabhairt tráthnóna ar chuid de na ceisteanna atá ardaithe aige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer subvention to Córas Iompair Éireann in 1992 in respect of essential public services will amount to £108 million of which approximately £90 million is being allocated to the railways. In addition, the public capital programme for 1992 provides for capital expenditure by CIE of £45 million of which £17.8 million has been allocated for expenditure on railway signalling and other rail related infrastructure.  The allocation of these resources to individual capital programmes and projects, including track renewal on the Dublin-Sligo line, is a matter for Irish Rail.  However, <Col N="2613" /> I have been informed by the chief executive of Irish Rail that the Deputy is correct when he says that the company propose to spend £2 million on upgrading seven miles of track on the Dublin-Sligo line this year and I understand that the relevant works have already commenced.</P>
    <P>At the request of Deputy Mattie Brennan I recently met a delegation from Sligo Borough Council and listened to their concerns regarding the future of the Dublin-Sligo line.  Senior officials of my Department also met the delegation for a detailed discussion.  The delegation was assured, and I would like to take this opportunity to confirm again that there are no proposals before me or my Department for the closure or downgrading of the Sligo line.  Indeed, I would like to mention that Sligo rail station has recently been upgraded as part of Irish Rail's Transtrack freight reorganisation and now caters for groupage and sundry freight traffic for the north-west region. Irish Rail intend, with assistance from the EC, to replace and upgrade the existing freight gantry in Sligo.  The replacement gantry will be capable of lifting larger containers and shorter freight loading <Col N="2614" /> and unloading times will also be possible with this new equipment.  These developments will expedite the movement of heavy cargo through Sligo station and thereby facilitate traders in the north-west region.</P>
    <P>In relation to the medium and long term future of the Sligo line and, indeed, the mainline network as a whole, a full and urgent strategic study of the future investment needs and resources required for our railway system is underway.  Over £1 billion has been put into the railway network since 1980, both by the Exchequer and by CIE from their own resources.  We should explore all possibilities for funding future railway investment needs, including that of assistance from EC sources.  I have asked that the strategic study, which will, of course, include the Sligo line, should be completed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 30, 32, 64, 87 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have initiated a programme of education for parents for 20 post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas in Dublin.  The programme aims at facilitating effective participation and involvement by parents in supporting their children's educational development. The programme also incorporates opportunities for the parents' own self-development and skills enhancement. The combined total enrolment of the schools concerned is just over 11,000. The extension of the programme to more schools will be considered following an evaluation of the present programme.</P>
      <P>The home/school liaison programme initiated by my Department in respect of a number of primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas involves a high degree of consultation with parents. Home visitation and meetings with groups of parents are organised and programmes in parenting and self-development are conducted as a necessary part of the programme.</P>
      <P>Parenting courses are also provided in some areas in an out-of-school context under schemes funded by my Department for disadvantaged youths and disadvantaged adults.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 31, 41, 76, 116 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The deputies' questions suggest that no post-primary school has guidance provision for students.  In fact, all second level schools with an enrolment of 500 pupils or more qualify for an ex-quota guidance teacher and some schools whose enrolment may have fallen below that also have such provision.  In addition, it is open to the authorities in post-primary schools to appoint guidance teachers within quota and many do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need for career guidance and to ensure that greater numbers of pupils have access to it.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the recognition on an ex-quota basis of 0.5 of a <Col N="2434" /> wholetime post for guidance in post-primary schools in the 350-499 enrolment category.  This concession will be phased in over the next three years and will mean that over 180 additional schools will benefit from guidance provision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 75, 85, 93, 96, 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the vast bulk of EC funding received by my Department for training activities at second and third level of the education system is obtained through the Structural Funds.  The Department expect to draw down £130 million in 1992 and £133 million in 1993 from these funds.</P>
      <P>The main effect of the changes in the EC Treaty agreed in Maastricht which concern education will be a broadening of the range of education/training activities eligible for support from the European Social Fund.  This, in the context of increased Structural Funds after 1993, will represent a substantial benefit to Ireland.  EC support will be sought for a wider range of educational/training activities than at present, including support for expanded vocational training programmes and for undergraduate degree programmes.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the next agreement for support from the Structural Funds will begin during 1992.</P>

      <P>There are currently 19,600 students in receipt of ESF grants attending courses in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of <Col N="2436" /> Technology Colleges.  A further 2,600 students are attending these same courses. However, as the approved limit of ESF support was reached with an enrolment of 19,600 students the full cost of these 2,600 students are met by the State at a cost of approximately £9.8 million.</P>
      <P>The improvements in the higher education grants scheme recently announced by my predecessor will not result in any savings for the Exchequer.  On the contrary while there are no cost implications for 1992, improvements will cost £1.01 million in 1993 rising to £4 million approximately by 1996.</P>
      <P>As already announced, the following improvements on income limits are being introduced: (a) the income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education; (b) income eligibility will be assessed on income and income limits in the year of entering to third level rather than as heretofore, on the income limits in the year in which the student sat the leaving certificate; (c) mature students may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes, and, if married, their spouses' incomes, rather than on their parents' income which has been the case up to now; (d) lone parents welfare payments under the lone parents allowance scheme will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility and (f) income limits and maintenance grants will be index linked in 1992.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's view that the provision of educational opportunity must be an essential part of any solution to the difficulties faced by the north Clondalkin area.</P>
      <P>Indeed, my Department have already taken a number of initiatives in this regard.  A total of ten primary schools in the area, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, are already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and as such have each been allocated an ex-quota teaching post to supplement normal staffing levels.  In addition, the schools in question are given special extra grants assistance to meet their operating, materials and equipment needs.  A total of £83,674 in extra grants was paid to these schools in 1991.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, all of these schools are included in the home/school/community liaison programme and thereby benefit from the locally based services of special home/school/community liaison teachers who work with parents of pupils and local interests to achieve greater awareness of and involvement in the children's education.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a special inter-departmental committee was established by the Minister for Justice to consider the needs of the area and the question of educational provision will form an important part of this consideration. I can assure the Deputy that any recommendations for further action in the education field which the committee may suggest will be given urgent and sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>The running cost of primary schools are not budgeted for individually by my Department.  It would not be feasible to grant aid over 3,000 schools in this way.  As the Deputy knows, the running costs of the schools are discharged by making funds available through the Department's capitation grant scheme and the contribution from local sources.</P>
      <P>In the case of schools in disadvantaged areas, the normal capitation grant is supplemented by grants under the scheme for schools in such areas.  The school in question received a substantial supplemental grant under this head in 1991.</P>
      <P>In addition, a programme will commence this year on a phased basis under which the capitation grant will be further augmented in order to expand the provision for caretaking and clerical services in national schools with 100 pupils upwards.  The school referred to will benefit under this arrangement in the course of the phasing in of the programme.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the adequacy of the capitation grant generally, my Department are currently undertaking a review of the recurrent study on the costs of schools generally.  I will be considering the existing rates of capitation grants to schools in the light of the results of this study.</P>

      <P>The figures in the Clancy report referred to by the Deputy were in respect to rates of admission to third level education in 1986.  Since then the overall admission rate has increased from 16,800 to about 26,000 for the current academic year which is an increase of almost 55 per cent.  This current intake represents approximately 39 per cent of the relevant age group.  As the additional student places planned by the Government come on stream this figure is likely to increase in the not too distant future to 45 per cent of the age group.</P>
      <P>The significance of such an achievement can be seen from the fact that in 1980 and 1986 the proportion of the relevant age group entering third level education were 20 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.  I am confident that these increases reflect higher participation rates in all counties in the interim including those counties with the lowest participation rates in 1986.</P>

      <P>The Irish short story is not being down-graded in the new junior certificate English course.  This is an open course, with no specifically prescribed texts.  Teachers of this course are required to select suitable texts for their own pupils and to ensure that over the three years of the course they will encounter all the literary genres including short stories.  With regard to the latter, teachers are perfectly free to choose Irish short stories in preference to others. There is no reason to believe that they are likely to neglect Irish short stories, <Col N="2443" /> given the excellence of Irish writers in this field and given their special relevance and suitability for Irish pupils.</P>

      <P>The question of whether it would be more profitable to replace the fleet rather than to maintain and repair existing buses is one for Bus Éireann and in which my Department would have no competence. I understand that, over the past number of years Bus Éireann have and still are carrying out a school bus vehicle replacement programme by introducing ex-service buses from their mainline operation and also suitable second hand buses imported from England and Northern Ireland.</P>

The Primary Curriculum Review Body made recommendations on the teaching of Irish in the curriculum. These have been taken up by the National Council of Curriculum and Assessment which has been given a result to submit proposals for new courses.  The new junior certificate course with its new syllabus in Irish will be examined for the first time this year while significant revisions have been made in the leaving certificate syllabus in Irish.</P>
      <P>I cannot say that I am satisfied with the level of competency in spoken Irish generally but I would have to point out that oral proficiency in any language is achieved only through sustained practice in speaking the language for communicative purposes in real life situations.

      <P>Over the past two years a total of 120 teaching posts have been allocated to post-primary schools under this scheme. Schools were ranked in order of merit on the basis of agreed criteria and the available posts were allocated to schools accordingly.  Tralee community college did not rank sufficiently highly on the list for the allocation of a post.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to allocate posts under a similar scheme in the current year.  However, it is open to the school authorities to assign a teacher from within the authorised teacher allocation to home/school liaison duties or other duties of this kind linked to the needs of pupils from disadvantaged homes.

In addition, the arrangements to be phased in over three years for the recognition on an ex-quota basis, of vice-principals in post-primary schools with enrolments in excess of 499 and 0.5 of a full-time post in respect of guidance in <Col N="2455" /> schools in the 350-499 enrolment category, will result in a further 118 posts being created in 1992-93.  As a result the pupil-teacher ratio overall will fall to approximately 16.8:1 in the post primary sector.  It will be of the order of 15.3:1 in vocational schools, 17.6:1 in secondary schools and 16.3:1 in community-comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>The additional financial provision in 1992 for the post-primary sector in respect of the measures outlined above is £1.35 million.</P>
    <P>I consider this to be a satisfactory position in present circumstances.  The position will, of course, be improved still further in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 school years with the further provisions agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in regard to vice-principal and guidance teachers.</P>

      <P>My Department keep under constant review the matter of the accommodation requirements of national schools generally and particularly the situation in schools with increasing or declining pupil populations.</P>

    <P>My Department are open and receptive to proposals from boards of management for the rationalisation of school facilities and for co-operation arrangements between schools.  The initiative in that respect would, however, normally rest with the individual school authorities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that national schools are not State schools but operate under the control of local boards of management.  Trustees hold the school premises under a standard form of lease and undertake to conduct a national school thereon.  State grants represent only part of the cost of providing the building and are not payable in respect of the acquisition of the school site.</P>

      <P>I understand that some parents in the general area in question propose to send their children to Clane post-primary centre which is not their appropriate centre for transport purposes.  The most that can be offered to such children in respect of their attendance at Clane is concessionary transport from the catchment boundary of their appropriate school.</P>
      <P>This concession would apply only to basically eligible pupils and is subject to spare seats being available on existing services and no extra cost.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy would care to give the names and addresses of the children in question, their eligibility will be confirmed by the local transport liaison officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules for school transport preclude <Col N="2457" /> the extension of bus services into adjacent catchment areas.  The reason for this is to avoid unnecessary duplication of services.</P>
    <P>I might add that even where children are availing themselves of school transport to their local post-primary centre they may have farther to travel to a pickup point than the mile and a half mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the 1992 Law Enforcement Package which was published in December 1991 and in which the measures that would be taken this year in preserving law and order and protecting the community against crime were outlined.  In relation to urban crime there will be an increased emphasis by all the relevant agencies, but in particular the Garda, on practical measures to deal with crime problems being experienced in certain urban areas.  A multi-disciplinary approach will be taken to the underlying problems of certain areas under particular pressure and this approach will be based in part on the <Col N="2466" /> advice of a recently established interdepartmental group of senior officials and gardaí which have already commenced their examination of the issues involved.  In addition, the Garda assessment of policing requirements in areas of greatest difficulty will be updated on a continuing basis so that effective responses can be provided as and when required.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that a specific plan of action has been drawn up to deal with the crime problems being experienced in the Cork area.  This plan includes the closer co-ordination and use of foot and mobile patrols, frequent use of checkpoints at various locations at unpredictable intervals, the surveillance of suspects and the targeting of Garda resources to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, plain clothes gardaí are now being deployed throughout the area in an operation designed to tackle the problem of burglaries and larcenies while special attention is also being focused on schools and other vulnerable locations.</P>
      <P>Regional crime conferences are being held regularly between officers of the Munster Division to co-ordinate anti-crime activity in the area.  Certain other specific measures have been taken also by the Garda authorities but it would not be in the interest of effective crime prevention or detection to provide any details in relation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role to be played by the community is of course vital also.  The Garda authorities in the Cork divisions have stepped up their promotion of crime prevention measures, using all available opportunities, including local radio, to advise the public on sensible crime prevention precautions which they can take. There are ten community policing schemes in operation in the area.  These schemes are working extremely well with very encouraging co-operation from the public.  The public are also very actively involved with neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes which are being promoted and developed on an on-going basis by the Garda.  There are now 76 neighbourhood watch schemes in the <Col N="2467" /> Cork area and 55 community alert schemes.  There are seven Garda juvenile liaison officers active in Cork and, indeed, this is one of the most successful juvenile liaison officer programmes in this jurisdiction.  Later this year the Garda schools programme is being extended to Cork.  This programme helps to remind primary school children of the dangers of substance abuse and raises their consciousness of road safety and discourages vandalism and juvenile offending generally.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service of my Department is also highly active in the Cork area.  Three senior probation officers and 16 probation officers are based in Cork and are supervising several hundred offenders there under probation orders and community service orders.  I should stress that the offenders in question are all being dealt with by the probation service under the orders of the court.  The probation service use all the community based facilities in Cork for young people and runs a probation Hostel on Patrick's Hill.  The success rate of community service orders in terms of completing the task given and not re-offending during the period of the order is at present computed at about 86 per cent.  Probation orders, which can be for up to three years, have also proven highly effective in treating offenders and avoiding their re-offending.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the action by my Department, the courts and the Garda to deal with crime in Cork will meet with success and I can assure the House that the situation is being kept under constant review by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 137 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to convictions for drug related crimes in Cork city in each of the years 1988 to 1990 is as follows: 1988, 85; 1989, 138; 1990, 182.  Figures for 1991 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware that drug dealing activities, mostly cannabis, are taking place in the Cork area, that unfortunately young people including school going teenagers are being involved in drug abuse and that they are giving this problem every attention.  However, I am also informed that the evidence available does not support the suggestion that drugs are being sold to younger school children.  I am very concerned at this suggestion and I would ask the Deputy, or anyone who might have evidence in this matter, to bring it immediately to the attention of the Garda authorities so that it can be fully investigated.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that the drugs problem is continuing to receive priority attention from a law enforcement point of view.  The Garda authorities have informed me that they monitor very carefully the situation in Cork and elsewhere and that they constantly review and adapt their strategies to deal with the drug problem.  These strategies include close liaisons with customs authorities and continuous international co-operation with police forces abroad so as to curb the supply of illicit drugs to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda in Cork have received and will continue to receive a very high level of training in drug law enforcement and they place a strong emphasis on countering illegal drug activity.  They are <Col N="2471" /> assisted in this by the Cork, Limerick and Dublin drug units and other specialists units as required.  Specific measures employed to deal with the problem in Cork include the use of Garda patrols and specialist units, intelligence gathering and analysis, surveillance, as well as targeting and monitoring the activities of suspects.  The Garda authorities have informed me that these measures are very often directed at activities and locations where young people may be exposed to illegal drug dealing.  These measures have resulted in some important detections for drug-related offences.</P>
    <P>While the Garda in Cork continue to give this problem priority attention I must emphasise that the problem of drug abuse cannot be solved by law enforcement on its own.  Drug abuse causes major problems in society and the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for young people is as important as the Garda response.  In regard to warning young people at school of the dangers of substance abuse, I should stress that this issue is being dealt with by the Garda schools' programme which is being extended to Cork later this year.</P>
    <P>The need for a national drug strategy to tackle the drug problem on every front has been recognised by the Government. My colleague, the Minister for Health, last year launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  This strategy sets realistic and achievable objectives for reduction both in the supply of and the demand for drugs.</P>

      <P>Scholarships are made available by different interested parties for children who wish to attend three week courses in the Gaeltacht.  While some are provided by the unions there are many others which would be open to children of unemployed parents.

      <P>I have no plans to allocate additional resources specifically to departments in infant national schools. As the Deputy will be aware, provision was made in the 1992 budget for the retention of 300 posts in national schools where teacher numbers would otherwise decline due to following enrolments.  This will reduce the pupil teacher ratio from 25.8:1 in the 1991-92 school year to 25.2:1 in the 1992-93 school year.</P>

      <P>I consider that there are sufficient textbooks available at present for the teaching of Irish.  In relation to Irish in the curriculum I wish to inform the Deputy that the primary curriculum review body made certain recommendations in this regard.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) are examining the recommendations of this report with a view to advising on the formulation of a future primary schools curriculum in Irish.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, a new syllabus in Irish was introduced for the junior certificate in 1989 and will be examined for the first time this year.  Revisions have also been made in the leaving certificate Irish syllabus and the NCCA propose to review the matter in depth and to make recommendations on the future provision for Irish at senior cycle.</P>

      <P>The major improvement projects to be brought to construction stage on national primary roads in the period 1989 to 1993 are listed in the Operational Programme on Perhiperality.  These were selected having regard to the overall level of funds available for such schemes in the period and their priority rating in the context of the general criteria for selection outlined in paragraph 4.34 of the programme.  On that basis, it was not possible to include the Swinford by-pass in the present programme but the project will be considered in the preparation of road plans for the period after 1993.</P>

Housing authorities will be notified in the near future of the 1992 capital allocations for the programme.

      <P>Association agreements linking Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to the European Community were signed on 16 December last in Brussels.  These agreements respond to the desire to strengthen relations between the community and the new democracies.  They provide for phased movement towards free trade over a ten year period, for comprehensive economic co-operation and for regular and institutionalised political dialogue.</P>
      <P>The agreements, to which the individual member states are parties, contain a reference, in their preambular paragraphs, to the final objective for Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia of becoming members of the Community and to the part the association agreements can play in helping to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>Formal applications for membership of the Community have not been made by the countries referred to.  The procedure by which the Council considers accession applications, having consulted the Commission, is set down in the Treaty.  The Council's consideration of a membership application takes as its starting point the Commission's opinion on the merits of the accession application.</P>
      <P>The overall question of enlargement of the Community is currently receiving specific attention.  At Maastricht in December the European Council asked the Commission to examine the issues involved including the implications for the European Union's future development, and to report to the Lisbon European Council in June.</P>
      <P>Ireland looks forward to the Commission's examination and will participate positively in the debate which will take place on the basis of its report at the European Council.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that his Department refuses to pay unemployment assistance to persons who because they decide to live in isolated rural areas where the possibilities of gaining employment are slim are deemed to be unavailable for work and are consequently deemed to be ineligible for unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Among the statutory conditions to be satisfied by applicants for receipt of an unemployment payment is that they must be available for work and they must make genuine efforts to obtain it.  The entitlement of all claimants is reviewed from time to time to determine whether they continue to satisfy these conditions which apply equally to all categories of claimants irrespective of where they reside.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the legislation, claimants are required to make reasonable efforts to make themselves available for and seek work for which they are qualified by reference to their skills, education and previous work experience. This can only be determined by reference to the circumstances of each particular claimant.</P>
      <P>In relation to place of residence it has from time to time come to the notice of the Department that certain claimants with considerable levels of education and work experience are opting to transfer residence, often from urban to remote rural areas, where the opportunities for them to obtain employment for which they are best qualified are very poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving from a more likely area to a less likely area of employment, having regard to the individual's background, has always been one of the considerations in relation to the question of a person's availability for work.  Each case is dealt <Col N="2495" /> with on its own merits and it is a matter for decision by deciding officers and appeals officers where a person is not satisfied with the decision.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the normal procedures are being followed in such cases and there is no general disallowance imposed on any category of claimant.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have arrangements made so that a person (details supplied) in County Dublin, who is in the process of being changed from unemployment assistance, via disability benefit, to invalidity pension will be granted a free fuel allowance on the grounds of hardship.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 18 September 1991.  He is also in receipt of disablement pension of £120 a month. He claimed smokeless fuel allowance on 5 December 1991.  A condition for payment of the allowance is that means must not exceed £5 weekly.  Because of his disablement pension, his means exceeded this weekly limit and his claim was, accordingly, disallowed.  The national fuel allowance is not payable with disability benefit.</P>
      <P>In order for a person to be considered for an invalidity pension, it is necessary for him or her to have been continuously incapable of work and claiming disability benefit for a minimum period of one year. He does not satisfy this condition at present.  If he is still claiming disability benefit in August 1992, he can then be considered for invalidity pension.</P>

      <P>Credited contributions are awarded to persons who, having been in insurable employment and having paid PRSI contributions are certified as incapable of work or as unemployed. Where a person has no contributions paid or credited for two full tax years credits cannot be awarded until he returns to work and pays PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks.  Only a recipient of disabled person's maintenance allowance who has previously been in insurable employment or in receipt of benefit could be awarded credited contributions subject to the normal conditions and to my Department receiving continuing medical evidence of incapacity for work.</P>
