      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring and I had tabled an amendment to section 1 which I think has been ruled out of order.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of the amendment which we had tabled was to establish in the Constitution an unambiguous and clearly stated right to travel.  Clearly what is required is not the implicit right which the Minister says exists, but an explicit right.  We agree that there is an implicit right to travel.  Many of the Supreme Court justices said that existed, but there is not a clear explicit right to travel from this state to other states. Although the Minister laid great store on quoting the views of members of the Supreme Court, stating that such an implicit right existed, clearly the Supreme Court is not a fixed entity and the views of the five individuals or a majority of the five individuals could change at some future stage.  We would be on much firmer ground if we stated not that nothing shall diminish the right, but established it clearly and explicitly in our Constitution.  It is regrettable that the attitude of the Government to the amendment is simply not to prohibit or deny that right which does not exist explicitly.  I would have preferred to have inserted our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the right to travel, on Second Stage I raised an issue which the Minister did not have time to deal with except in a general way. I would like to know if it is the Minister's intention in the wording he proposes to insert to provide for an absolute and unfettered right to travel free from any interference under any of the other subsections in Article 40 or by any interpretation that might be provided by the <Col N="404" /> Supreme Court in attempting to give effect not only to this subsection with regard to travel but to the general propositons contained in Article 40.3.3º.  On Second Stage I instanced a hypothetical case which I will again put to the Minister in the hope that he can throw some light on the extent to which the Government or indeed any Government can provide for the right of a pregnant women to travel from Ireland.</P>
      <P>Supposing we have a healthy pregnant single or married woman who is pregnant against her will and she confides in her husband or boyfriend that she intends to leave Ireland to go to another country for an abortion, either because the pregnancy is unwanted or because she has been advised, for example, that the child were irreparably damaged in some way.  If the husband or boyfriend is aggrieved and wishes the event not to occur, he can go to the court.  The scenario I am suggesting is not such an unlikely one, because in the wake of the X case wider newspaper coverage was given to an incident involving a man from Derry city who presented himself at a city centre police station attempting to make a similar case. In any event the aggrieved man proceeds to court to try to stop the woman leaving. On the one hand he is seeking to prevent the termination of life in another State by preventing the women from leaving. On the other hand he is seeking an affirmation of his parental rights as provided for under the Constitution.  Will that person be granted an injunction or not? I worry that the courts would have to deal with confliciting rights &mdash; the right to life of the foetus, the father's parental rights to the extent that these are provided for under Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and the proposed Twelfth Amendment, and the right of the women to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the X case and in a number of other cases that have been quoted here, the Supreme Court indicated that the Constitution must be taken as a whole, that there is a hierarchy of rights with that Constitution and that the courts, in trying to balance one conflicting right against another, will simply weigh one against <Col N="405" /> the other.  It is clear that the courts would give priority to the right to life of the foetus and the parental right of a father as opposed to the mere right of the woman to travel.  I believe that irrespective of the wording proposed by the Government there will not be an absolute gurantee of women's right to travel in all circumstances after the passing of this referendum.  I would like to hear the Minister's view of this.</P>
    <P>It is also important to put on record the position of the Attorney General as the custodian of the Constitution in discharging his functions in this regard.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether or not the Attorney General would or would not take an active role, as he did in the X case, by going unilaterally of his own motion to court to seek an injunction. The Minister will recall that in the wake of the X case and in the context of the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty the Attorney General seemed to give certain public assurances that his office would not again act in the way it did in the X case.</P>
    <P>If there is substance in my concerns about this legislative proposal in the context of the Constitution, then the Attorney General will have a very real role to play.  I wonder if the Minister in any way shares my concerns about the non-absoluteness of this provision and whether he intends to secure any further public commitments from the Attorney General with regard to his role in interpreting and implementing this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the amendment was ruled out of order.  However it might be useful if I were to make a few comments on the substance of that amendment.  It might help to clarify matters because the suggested amendment seemed to assume that there was no general right to travel under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unable to agree with that point of view that there is no existing Constitutional right to travel.  On a reading of the judgments of each of the five <Col N="406" /> judges of the Supreme Court in the X case it is clear that such a right does exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Implicitly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I would refer the Deputies to some of the following statements of the judges which might be useful. The Chief Justice, for instance, spoke of &ldquo;the very fundamental nature of the right to travel and its particular importance in relation to the characteristics of a free society&rdquo;.  That particular reference is important.  He did so in the context of harmonising interacting constitutional rights.  Judge Hederman referred to &ldquo;the exercise of the Constitutional right to travel&rdquo;.  That is pretty explicit too.  Judge McCarthy referred to the right to travel having been identified as one of the unenumerated rights guaranteed under Article 40 of the Constitution and that would seem to be quite indicative in what it is attempting to convey.  Judges Egan and O'Flaherty also referred to the right to travel.</P>
      <P>In the face of those statements it seems unarguable that there is a right to travel under the Constitution.  Moreover, the judge made those statements without reference to EC law.  In fact it was made clear that no decision on any question of European law was necessary for the court to give its judgment.  If EC law is taken into account in considering the travel issue, since travel is of fundamental importance under the EC Treaties and since those Treaties are part of our constitutional law, it is inconceivable that travel could be regarded as other than a fundamental right of persons in this country.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that the wording of the Bill is correct. It is correct in assuming that there is an existing constitutional right to travel, and the Bill removes the restriction imposed in the X case by reference to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposed by the Deputies has not been allowed but, at the same time, let me give an idea of what my thinking would be if it had been allowed.  The exercise of the right to travel is, of necessity, subject to restrictions <Col N="407" /> in certain circumstances, for example, if the law imposes conditions to be imposed by the court when granting bail, including a requirement that the person concerned would have to surrender his or her passport and report at frequent intervals to a Garda station. Persons who are wards of court as well cannot be taken out of the jurisdiction without the express permission of the court.  If a positive affirmation of the right to travel were to be written into the Constitution as is suggested, that affirmation would have to be couched in such a way as to allow for the exceptions represented by the types of cases that I have just referred to, and the Deputy will appreciate that.  That would take us into the area of addressing issues which there is no need for us to address under this Bill.  All it is necessary for us to do is to remove the restriction on freedom to travel which was imposed by the decision in the X case by reason of Article 40.3.3º.  That is what the proposed amendment to the Constitution does.  It would be unnecessary and it would not be sensible to try to do any more.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan spoke about a hypothetical case.  I know that can be useful to try to establish a principle. At the same time the Deputy would not do well to pursue the Belfast case too far, not knowing the full details.  Obviously we cannot talk about that case here but I can tell the Deputy that I have some extra information on that; it is not exactly as it was portrayed elsewhere.  Perhaps we could leave it at that except to say that the amendment makes no exception and I cannot see how someone could be adjudged other than under the terms of the amendment we are discussing.  As I have stated on previous occasions any pregnant woman, indeed anybody, has the fundamental right to go to any other country and it has been established and understood like that, not just by the Supreme Court judges but also under EC law.  Obviously anybody can take a court action; people can go into court to seek a decision on any particular aspect of any <Col N="408" /> law, be it constitutional or general law, but it is my understanding that the amendment makes no exceptions and this amendment could not and would not be used to stop someone leaving the country for whatever purpose they wish.</P>
    <P>It is only right to say, as Deputies will remember, that the Attorney General made remarks about the question of injunctions following the Maastricht Treaty referendum result.  That position still stands.  I do not foresee any situation arising where the Attorney General, in the circumstances set out by the Deputy, will seek an injunction to stop anyone travelling for any particular purpose as contemplated by Article 40.3.3º, as it will be amended.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party are anxious to ensure that on this issue the imposition as regards the right of women to travel which was impeded by the judgment in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case is removed. We are also anxious to ensure that when the referenda are held there will be minimal confusion.  We have taken the view that the amendments relating to both travel and information are largely in order although we could engage in a degree of nit-picking in trying to take out one word and replacing it with another. However, we are of the view that it is of essential importance that the referenda on these two issues succeed.  I am therefore anxious to ensure that I say nothing in this House which would give rise to confusion to raise doubts as to the desirability of these two referenda succeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this discussion I will raise certain questions in the context of the substance and it is important that the Minister's replies to those questions are put on the record of the House.  In relation to the right to travel, I broadly agree with the Minister.  We find ourselves in a rather unusual situation, Sir, because I recall that when I normally table an amendment to a Bill that is out of order I am shot down within ten seconds.  I therefore appreciate the fact that you are allowing us some latitude because effectively we are discussing the <Col N="409" /> broad sweep of the issue under the guise of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is a constitutional right to travel.  I suppose I should make a declaration of interest because I was one of the lawyers involved in the first case in which it was decided that such a right existed in a substantive way.  That case was determined by the then President of the High Court, the present Chief Justice, in 1978, and it was related to the right of a child to get a passport.  It is important to say that this right was given an implicit recognition by Mr. Justice Kenny as long ago as 1963 in the case of Ryan <i>v.</i> the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>There is one quotation which is particularly apposite because it emphasises the need to ensure that the referendum on the right to travel is successful.  I think there is a general consensus on all sides of the House that this issue must be addressed.  Indeed, I raised a query about this issue in the 1983 debate whether a woman's right to travel would be impeded.  To some extent the events of the X case could be described by me as fact following fiction, because in a novel I wrote which had some success in this country some years ago there was a TD, who happily never occupied the benches of this House, by the name of Brannigan&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>Is the Deputy reissuing it for the Christmas trade because if he is I want a signed copy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is not a commercial. In the story that character pronounced himself, like so many people in this House, as pro-life.  Of course we are all pro-life; I have yet to see anyone put their hand up in the air to say they are pro-death.  This particular TD, the fictional Deputy Brannigan, was giving out about Irish women having abortions in England and rather than deciding that we should have proper counselling, family support and family planning services and all the other things that we need in the area of education so that people could come to terms with their own sexuality <Col N="410" /> his proposal was that we should enact laws which would allow the Garda to stop pregnant women at exit points from the State and prevent them leaving the country. He argued that they should be restrained and prevented from leaving during the course of the pregnancy.</P>
      <P>When I wrote that novel in 1988 some people might have thought that this was extreme until of course we saw what happened in the X case after proceedings had been initiated by the Attorney General.  I do not want to see any more X cases nor I am sure does any other Member of this House.  It is important therefore that I make the point that the right to travel in the X case was impeded by the Supreme Court on the idea that there is a hierarchy of rights and, in the context of protecting the life of the unborn where a mother's life was not at risk, that a pregnant woman could be injuncted and prevented from leaving the State.</P>
      <P>This decision gave rise to a widespread outcry.  Indeed, it is interesting to quote the words of Mr. Justice Finlay in the case of M <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, in which I was involved, as reported at page 81 of the 1979 Irish Reports:</P>
      <P>One of the hallmarks which is commonly accepted as dividing states which are categorised as authoritarian from those which are categorised as free and democratic is the inability of the citizens of or residents in the former to travel outside their country except at what is usually considered to be the whim of the Executive Power. Therefore I have no doubt that a right to travel outside the State exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that it existed in a limited form in the context of the State being entitled to restrain people who are awaiting trial on criminal charges from leaving the State and the right of the State in certain circumstances to withhold passports.  In general, the right to travel was referred to as the right to freedom of movement by Mr. Justice Kenny in 1963, and in the case which came before the then President of the High Court in 1978, and to which I have referred, it was pronounced upon again.  Passing references <Col N="411" /> have been made to it in other cases. Indeed, the Supreme Court confirmed that the right exists, so the only difficulty that we have as a result of the X case arises from the Supreme Court judgment.  The only way to deal with this issue is to make a specific amendment to Article 40.3.3º as suggested.</P>
    <P>To be fair to Deputy Howlin, the purpose of his proposal in the House is to tease out a position where there would be a general explicit right to travel.  He meant well by it but of course at this stage the courts have declared that more implicit rights than explicit rights exist in the Constitution and they are said to be based largely on Articles 40 and 41 and on the Christian and democratic nature of this State.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to misrepresent what Deputy Howlin is proposing &mdash; he is not suggesting this &mdash; if we simply took on board a general right to travel as proposed in the amendment which has been ruled out of order and did not amend Article 40.3.3º, we would be back to the possibility of a hierarchy of rights and a differentiation between rights and a problem whereby pregnant women could be injuncted and prevented from leaving the country which is something I believe no one wants to see.</P>
    <P>If we want to reduce the number of Irish women going to England for abortions, which should be one of the aims of our social policy; it is frequently genuflected to in rhetoric while absolutely nothing is done about it by way of social action or practice on the part of the Government &mdash; we should do so by way of social action and not by way of injuncting women at our borders, ports and airports and preventing them from leaving the country.  It is important that the equal right of men and women to travel should not be impeded.  It was probably worth while for Deputy Howlin to raise this issue but in the jurisprudence of our courts there can be no doubt that a right to travel exists and the problem we have to resolve arises directly from the decision in the X case.  It has to be resolved in the context of the specific sub-Article <Col N="412" /> of Article 40 which was inserted in the Constitution in 1983.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to stick to fact and not fiction and to refrain from nit-picking.  The Labour Party's aim is to tease out the meaning of words and have clarity.  That is why, unlike other parties, we did not seek to amend the Bill on Second Stage.  We agreed with the principle discussed on Second Stage. However, we would like to tease out the implications of the enactment of this proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>I am still not convinced by the Minister's case &mdash; although I accept his sincerity &mdash; in regard to the two points he put to me, that such a provision would not be explicitly stated.  In relation to the declaration that such a right exists in EC law, I do not believe that case has yet been proven.  What appears to exist in EC law is the right to travel for economic purposes, but the general right to travel will not be explicitly stated until such time as the Maastricht Treaty becomes operable and I assume that will be when all 12 EC states enact that Treaty which, at the earliest, will be next year.  As of now, we have no guarantee that such a general EC right exists.</P>
      <P>In regard to exceptions, to which the Minister referred, there are a number of rights specifically spelled out in Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution which do not spell out the exceptions to those fundamental principles of right.  Those exceptions are inherent and I do not believe one needs at this stage to insert what would obviously be exceptions to the general principle of rights.  The Constitution spells out fundamental rights and that is what is required in relation to this specific right, the right of citizens to travel from this State to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was minded to raise this matter by the attitude of the Progressive Democrats, the Minister's partners in Government. They stated in their policy document that they sought to have these words included as a new Article 40.3.2º. They stated:  &ldquo;The State shall, in particular by its laws, protect as best it may from unjust attack and in the case of <Col N="413" /> injustice done vindicate the life, good name and property rights and the right to travel both within and outside the State of every citizen&rdquo;.  The form of words tabled in my name and that of Deputy Spring was sought to be inserted by the Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in Government.  In their commentary which they attached to their policy statement requiring those words to be inserted in the Constitution they stated:</P>
    <P>At present, the right to travel is not expressly protected by the Constitution. The right is, of course, implicitly protected by Article 40.3.1º (see The State (M) v. Minister for Foreign Affairs [1979]), but we thought it desirable to take this opportunity to insert a general and express right to travel in Article 40.3.2º, along with the right to life, person, good name and property.  Such a right is already recognised in the 4th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights which Ireland has ratified.  It was also included in the Progressive Democrats' Draft Constitution for a New Republic in 1988.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is considerable support for the notion that an explicit right to travel should be numbered among those already specifically stated in the Constitution. It is spurious to suggest that once those explicit rights are inserted in the Constitution there would be a requirement to table exceptions and write those into the Constitution as well. It is equally spurious to suggest that EC law, as of now, absolutely and clearly vindicates the right of citizens to move between states.  Of course, the other issue will be the right of citizens to move from this State to jurisdictions outside the European Community.  For all those reasons I am not convinced by the Minister's assertion that there is no need for an explicit statement of the kind I seek.</P>
    <P>I agree with other speakers that there is a fairly unanimous view on all sides in this House that the right to travel is most desirable.  We want to put a form of words before the people that we can all wholeheartedly <Col N="414" /> endorse and support.  For that reason there is a Committee Stage of this Bill.  As a legislator, I am required to enact to the best of my ability the best form of words to be put before the people, but I am still not convinced by the Minister's assertion that there is no need to expressly state this fundamental right.</P>

      <P>I would like to elaborate on the communication which I conveyed to Deputies Spring and Howlin in regard to ruling their amendment out of order.  Amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Spring and Howlin, was ruled out of order by the Chair as it contains a proposal which is outside the scope of the Bill.  The Bill, as read a Second Time, addresses the issue of the right to travel in the context of the right to life as provided for in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.  The amendment, however, seeks to include in Article 40.3.2º the issue of the right to travel in the more general sense.  Accordingly, since it addresses the broader issue of the general right to travel the amendment is deemed outside the scope of the Bill and I had no option, therefore, but to rule it out of order.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is correct.  Although it is not specified in clear language in this amendment, <Col N="415" /> what is being aimed at is to guarantee the right of women in Ireland to travel to Britain primarily for abortions.  That is what the amendment seek to do, but it does not say that.  The amendment states that this subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and other State.  It appears, therefore, that the amendment is deficient.  My understanding &mdash; again in a lay person's terms &mdash; is that the Supreme Court decision in the X case found, that it was unlawful to go to Britain for an abortion except in a case where the woman concerned was shown to be suicidal.  The other amendment here seeks to rule out that provision.</P>
      <P>The Government's amendment in regard to abortion also seeks to provide for what is euphemistically described as direct abortion in circumstances where there is a real and substantive threat to the life of a woman.  On the one hand, the amendment in regard to the substantive issue seeks to rule out suicide as a case for abortion, the grounds on which the Supreme Court found a young woman was entitled to an abortion and, on the other hand, it seeks to introduce new grounds for abortion in Irish law.  This amendment seeks to guarantee women the right to travel to Britain for abortion, presumably in any other circumstances. The Supreme Court found that it is unlawful to travel to Britain for an abortion in any circumstances other than those which are lawful here.  That is my understanding of the Supreme Court's findings in the X case, but if I am wrong I would like the Minister to clarify that. My understanding is that they found that it was unlawful to go to England for an abortion in circumstances which were unlawful here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point Deputy McCartan seeks to clarify regarding the concrete or hypothetical cases is how a woman who wishes to travel to Britain for an abortion which would be unlawful here &mdash; almost 5,000 women travelled to Britain last year for this purpose &mdash; can be guaranteed this right under the amendment when the Supreme Court in the X case found that <Col N="416" /> it was unlawful, and that she could not travel to Britain for that purpose?  Unless we explicitly write into this Article of the Constitution that women do have that right to travel for an abortion, I do not see how such a right can be established in the Supreme Court.  The right of the foetus established in this Article will always be regarded as superior to that of the mother's right to travel.  That is the situation as I understand it.</P>
    <P>The discussion here clearly indicates that regardless of what is agreed by the Oireachtas and what the people subsequently decide in a referendum, it is as inevitable as day follows night that there will be a challenge in the Supreme Court at some stage to establish the points I am making today.  That indicates that the approach of trying to deal with these matters by way of referendum is totally wrong and should be abandoned.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  It is significant to acknowledge, and repeat for the record, that the Minister has said that he does not envisage the Attorney General playing any role in any injunction-type cases in the future once this referendum is passed.  That is a significant acknowledgement, if I understood the Minister correctly, in respect of his interpretation of the effect of this legislation. The points I have raised with him &mdash; hypothetically but, I believe very realistically in view of the strong views of the community on this matter &mdash; need to be further addressed.  I acknowledge that there is a general right to liberty contained in Article 40.4.1º.  In that regard we can accommodate restrictions on persons charged with criminal offences or, indeed, persons of unsound mind or minors.  A woman who is pregnant does not fit into any of those categories.  It is regrettable that we would bring up issues relating to criminals or, indeed, lunatics in this context.  I am concerned about the issue raised, by Mr. Hogan, a law lecturer in Trinity College, in his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 8 August 1992, and I would like to hear the Minister's response to it.  Mr. Hogan's article stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the Attorney General still feels debarred by that undertaking from seeking a travel injunction, yesterday's events &mdash; this refers to the ruling of Mr. Justice Morris in the SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan case &mdash; show that private citizens (such as, for example, a husband who sought to restrain his wife from having a &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; abortion) can still enforce Article 40.3.3º.  When pressed on this very question at the launch of the Maastricht White Paper, the Taoiseach was quoted (<i>The Irish Times</i> April 24th 1992), as doubting whether any private injunction of this kind would succeed after June 18th adding that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote would have to be taken into account <Col N="418" /> by the courts.  That assurance (such as it was) in relation to private enforcement actions has also been shown to have been based on fairly specious legal assumptions.</P>
    <P>The event on 18 June was the affirmation by the Irish people of the Maastricht Treaty.  There is an acknowledgment that a private citizen can bring an injunction or seek legal redress under the Constitution and I want to know the view of the Government, and their advisers, in regard to their interpretation of the workability of the sections.  Does the Minister anticipate that a court could grant an injunction against a woman who may wish to travel to England for an abortion, whatever her reasons may be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance regarding the scenario painted by the Deputy that a woman could be injuncted, perhaps on her way back from Britain?  I would also like the Minister to clarify whether there is any risk of an injunction being taken out against a person who stays in Ireland but assists a girl or a woman to travel abroad to have an abortion?  That person would not have left the jurisdiction, but would they be in breach of our Constitution by assisting in an act that is unlawful here but lawful elsewhere?  Could a person who may have provided an airline ticket, the financial resources required, or the actual information be subject to criminal prosecution. The Minister used the words &ldquo;referral information&rdquo; as opposed to factual information, and there appears to be a distinction made in regard to these words by the Ministers for Justice and Health which we will try to tease out on the next Bill.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that this amendment cannot be used as a backdoor method to prosecute a person who assists a woman to travel to England or elsewhere for an abortion.</P>

Deputy Shatter summarised the issue quite neatly at the <Col N="419" /> start of his contribution when he stated we were all trying to establish the right to travel in all circumstances.  That is what is being attempted here and we want the Irish people to support and endorse that on 3 December.  I thought it was quite fair of Deputy Shatter to state that he did not wish to raise any doubts in regard to this issue, because we are all agreed on this and we all have the same objective. I do not believe that any doubts have been raised but some points may require further clarification and elaboration.

It was our wish that this decision would have been otherwise.  This is a genuine attempt to put the matter right so that a further decision of that kind cannot be made by the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the whole question of the fundamental right to travel.  That is relevant, but it must be remembered that this right is already well established in a European context and was agreed in the original founding Treaties of the EC.

      <P>The Maastricht Treaty reconfirms this matter as distinct from restating it, and it is important that that be made clear.  What we are seeking to achieve here is to put beyond doubt the right to travel and to make it clear that it cannot be restricted by reason of Article 40.3.3º.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa made an interesting point, but maybe I mistook him, on the question of travel between Ireland and the UK.  The amendment explicitly refers to travel to all states.  We deliberately inserted this clause because we did no want a restriction applied in a subsequent Supreme Court case to travel to some other country that might not be incorported within the Community states &mdash; we are dealing with all states, not just member states of the EC.</P>

    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that, unfortunately, a number of people choose to go to the United Kingdom and other places for the purpose of terminating pregnancies, and certainly that is a challenge to us all.  It is everybody's wish that very few people, if anyone at all, would go abroad for this purpose. There is much to be done in this regard, but we are not talking about that matter this morning.  We are talking about the right of individuals to seek whatever service <Col N="421" /> is lawfully available in any state to which they wish to travel.  I take the Deputy's point that what we do here may be challenged at a future date.  I do not foresee a challenge in the Supreme Court on what we are seeking to accomplish in this amendment, but it could happen.  As the Deputy suggested, somebody may seek to have a matter clarified by way of an interpretative decision in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Freedom of travel cannot be achieved beyond doubt without having a referendum. What we were concerned about was to find the right words to put everything beyond doubt.  We considered many words suggested by people in the past, but nobody said this is not a good wording.  They just want to be absolutely sure that it achieves what everybody wishes it to achieve.  We believe that we have done that in finding the simplest words possible, stating that freedom would not be restricted between the State and any other state by Article 40.3.3º. We must not forget that the Supreme Court decision and the interpretation given by the judges was based on Article 40.3.3º.  The amendment states quite explicitly that Article 40.3.3º cannot be used to deny freedom to travel.  That is the key point and it was on that ground that freedom was denied.</P>

      <P>That is right.  This is the Article that had to be addressed because, as Deputy Owen rightly says, it was the Article addressed by the Supreme Court. The right to travel was restricted because of a clause in Article 40.3.3º and we are now removing that clause.</P>

      <P>Yes, we are satisfied that that will not arise.  I do not have the details of the Hogan case referred to by Deputy McCartan, but the answer to his question is no.  Deputy De Rossa also said that a matter can be referred for judicial consideration and I cannot deny that, but we do not foresee it happening. The wording is so tight that we feel that it could not be challenged again.  If we had not felt strongly enough in that regard we would have had to consider an entirely different formula of words.  Some time was spent considering that matter and our advice is that this wording will satisfy what we wish to achieve.  I do not foresee any case going to the court on the basis of freedom to travel, and before the X case nobody contemplated that it was a possibility.</P>

      <P>Maybe it was.  The whole question of the 1983 amendment was argued yesterday, but nobody suggested that the whole amendment should be repealed in its entirety.  The Irish people decided on the matter and in good faith they voted on a certain understanding. They never contemplated that somebody would be denied the right to travel out of the country.  Neither did we contemplate that this would happen, and we certainly do not contemplate it now.  We believe that this wording makes it abundantly clear that Article 40.3.3º cannot be used again in any circumstance to allow an injunction to be placed.  Cases are sometimes referred to courts but we want to ensure that in regard to the element of travel the issue will be disposed of in a satisfactory way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen raised the question of assisting a person.  This is an important matter which I considered at some <Col N="423" /> length.  Once it has been agreed that there is a constitutional right to travel in any circumstance for a service that is available in another state, anybody who assists a person, in doing so cannot be judged as having committed a wrong.  The whole question of freedom to travel relates to going abroad to seek a service that is lawfully available in another jurisdiction.</P>

    <P>I hope I will not be accused of nitpicking, but we are trying to devise a form of words which is suitable.  As we have discovered, single words have great importance in this debate.  The intention of the amendment to delete the word &ldquo;state&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; is in the interests of clarity.  I will be interested in hearing the Minister's view because I am advised that a great number of places are not states &mdash; they are territories, dependancies, colonies or jurisdictions. We are trying to confer a general right on people &mdash; women in particular &mdash; to move wheresoever they choose from this State.  To ensure absolute clarity on this issue I am advised that the word &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; is preferable to the word &ldquo;state&rdquo; so that there will not be any ambiguity about travelling to certain areas of the world.  For example, Hong Kong is not a state, it is a crown colony, and numerous other places have a different legal status apart from being an independent state. We are trying to establish the right of free movement of Irish citizens in relation to where they wish to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty with the intent of the Schedule, that the subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between this and another state.  However, I query its necessity, either arising from the decision of the <Col N="425" /> Supreme Court or because of the fundamental rights which attach to any democratic state.  The Minister said that there was a need for it on the basis that the Supreme Court had decided by a three-two majority that while an injunction will not be given to restrain a woman from travelling abroad to obtain an abortion where there is a real and substantial risk to her life, obviously such an injunction can be given to restrain travel abroad to obtain an abortion where there is no such risk.</P>
      <P>I have copies of the judgment with me; they are the only copies available in the Houses of the Oireacthas.  I want to quote from them because if we purport to amend our Constitution to include what has always been there &mdash; and what has not been changed by the Supreme Court decision &mdash; we are doing something unnecessary.  I will start with the judgment of Chief Justice Finlay.  He dealt first with what is called the substantive issue and he said at the end:</P>
      <P>It is for this reason that, in my view, the defendants were entitled to succeed in this appeal and the orders made in the High Court&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will anticipate the Deputy.  I was about to suggest to Deputy O'Kennedy that, if we disposed of the amendment initially, we could then come to the subject proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is valid and relevant when talking about a &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; or the &ldquo;state&rdquo;.  It does not change my submission.  The Supreme Court decided on the substantive issues and the Chief Justice said:</P>
      <P>It is for this reason that, in my view, the defendants were entitled to succeed in this appeal and the orders made in the High Court have been set aside.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the remaining issues are matters of some considerable interest.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These issues, however, having been <Col N="426" /> fully argued and being matters of considerable public interest, it seems to me that I should express my views upon them even though those views may fall as a matter of law within the character of <i>Obiter dicta.</i></P>
    <P>In that case the Chief Justice did not make a judicial decision.</P>
    <P>I do not want to lecture the House but anyone who has any legal experience knows that <i>obiter dicta,</i> literally translated, means things said otherwise that are not related to the core of the judgment.  Therefore, even taking the views expressed by the Chief Justice, which said that you could put the right to travel as a lower order than the right to life, it was just an opinion; he did not make a decision.  Mr. Justice Egan followed that position.  Each of the other three judges pointed out the opposite.  I will quote from some of the judgments. The late Mr. Justice McCarthy said in relation to the right to travel:</P>
    <P>Such a right has been identified in <i>The State v. the Minister for Foreign Affairs</i> as one of the unenumerated rights, all of which enjoy the same guarantee as contained for those expressed in Article 40º.  If the purpose of exercising the right to travel is to avail of a service lawful in its location but unlawful in Ireland, is the right curtailed or abolished because of that local illegality and/or because of the guarantee in the amendment?</P>
    <P>This is where the question of jurisdiction comes in.  He went to say:</P>
    <P>In my view, it is not a question of balancing the right to travel against the right to life; it is a question as to whether or not an individual has a right to travel, which she has.  It cannot be curtailed because of a particular intent.</P>
    <P>He went on to give very graphic illustrations. He said:</P>
    <P>If one travels from the jurisdiction of the State to another, one, temporarily, becomes subject to the laws of the other State.  An agreement, commonly <Col N="427" /> called a conspiracy, to go to another State to do something lawfully done there cannot, in my opinion, permit of a restraining order.  Treason is thought to be the gravest of crimes.  If I proclaim my intent to go to another country &mdash; there to plot against the Government here &mdash; I may, by some extension of the law against sedition, be prosecuted and, consequently, subject to detention here but I cannot be lawfully prevented from travelling to the other country, there to plot the overthrow, since that would not be a crime in the other country.  I go further. Even if it were a crime in the other country, if I proclaim my intent to explode a bomb or to shoot an individual in another country.  I cannot lawfully be prevented from leaving my own country for that purpose.  The reality is that each nation governs itself and enforces its own criminal law.  A court in one State cannot enjoin an individual leaving it from wrongdoing outside it in another state or states.  It follows that I agree with Hederman, J. that, in so far as the order interferes with the right to travel, there is no jurisdiction to make such an order.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Hederman J. clearly agrees with Mr. Justice McCarthy's interpretation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the judgment of Mr. Justice Hederman on this issue because it was said that it was a three-two majority decision in relation to restraining the right to travel.  However, it is very clear from the copy I have, initialled by Hederman, J., that he upheld the order of the Court at paragraphs (a) and (c) and that he did not make an order in respect of paragraph (b), the part of the order relating to the right to travel.  He said very specifically:</P>
    <P>Therefore, this Court should not grant the injunction at (b) in the terms now sought by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Whatever views we have on the Supreme Court, it is important that we at least deal with the matter on the basis of the <Col N="428" /> reported judgments.  It is clear that Judge O'Flaherty was of the same opinion:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the principles of interpretation that in my judgment should apply, the further question to be asked is whether officers of the State are obliged to invoke what may be called the police power of the State to interfere with the freedom of the individual, especially the individual's freedom of movement in and out of the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I leave aside the entitlement of the Oireachtas to enact legislation in regard to the provision and take it as self-executing in the absence of such legislation.  I believe that its positive thrust is that the State should provide every practical assistance to pregnant women.</P>
    <P>The judge went on to say:</P>
    <P>The State's role in such a case should be a positive rather than a negative one.  In particular, I do not believe that the Court should grant an injunction to interfere to this extraordinary degree with the individual's freedom of movement.</P>
    <P>In this instance, a negative role would be restraint on the right to travel.  He also pointed out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In this case the injunction granted also involves, in my judgment, an unwarranted interference with the authority of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court did not decide to interfere with the right to travel.  Quite the opposite.  There was one opinion from the Chief Justice, and he said it was <Col N="429" /><i>obiter dictum,</i> and that was supported by Judge Egan.  Unless my interpretation of words in their normal meaning is incorrect, the views of the other three judges as expressed in the judgments available in the Oireachtas Library are the opposite.  I do not recognise the necessity for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not recognise the need for this measure.  If this measure were being introduced in a totalitarian state, in one of the former communist states in which the characteristic &mdash; as distinct from the characteristic of a democratic state &mdash; was that one was not free to travel, there would be good reason for introducing such an amendment.  If this measure had been introduced in Russia, Bulgaria, East Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Albania or China there would be good reason for introducing an amendment to whatever constitution they had, because the characteristic of those states was that people were literally imprisoned within them; there was no freedom of travel. We, however, live in a democracy and countless millions of Irish people have consistently exercised that right.  It is for that reason that I do not acknowledge the necessity for this amendment.  Neither do I consider that such necessity arises from the Supreme Court judgment.</P>

One does not have to agree with every Deputy's point of view; many people disagreed with different points of view expressed in the House yesterday and the same could apply to today's debate.</P>
      <P>I should, however, like to put it to Deputy O'Kennedy that the vast majority of those in the House wish to have this matter dealt with and dealt with in the only perfectly satisfactory and safe way, by referendum.  The holding of a referendum will put beyond doubt any question in so far as the right of freedom to travel is concerned for pregnant women or for women or men in general who wish to leave this country under any circumstances.  That is the reason that the matter is being pursued by way of referendum, and that was agreed earlier this year between the leaders of the parties, who recognised that the issue was one that should be attended to.  It was unanimously agreed by them, and I think it is virtually unanimously agreed by everyone in the House, that the issue should be dealt with by way of referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about that. Deputy O'Kennedy may feel that it is not as necessary to deal with the issue in this manner as Deputy Howlin feels or as I feel.  Deputy O'Kennedy may feel that there is a grey area which might mean that the measure need not be attended to at all, and perhaps he would get support for that view if it were canvassed outside. However, that would certainly run counter to much of what has been said in the House in trying to reach a decision which would make sure that we did not face any further tests in the matter when somebody referred a case to the Supreme Court or to any other court or when an injunction was sought for any other reason.</P>
      <P>That leads me back neatly to the point made by Deputy Owen.  We are trying to establish that nobody can be injuncted from going to seek a service anywhere outside the State and that anybody who would assist that person in any regard could not be prevented from doing so. That is what the Government are seeking to achieve in the proposed wording.  We are trying to put beyond any doubt that Article 40.3.3º or any other Article could be used to stop anybody from travelling in a free democratic way to avail of a service that is provided outside of the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin moved an amendment in relation to the State.  I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands will ensure that a woman who wishes to travel to another jurisdiction to avail of a service that is unlawful here but is lawful in the other jurisdiction will have the right to do so in the sure knowledge that an injunction may not be taken against her to stop her travelling.  We unanimously agreed that that was the key objective we should seek to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made to the fact that the courts have held that the unborn is implicitly protected by provisions of the Constitution apart from Article 40.3.3º so that those other provisions could be relied on in a travel injunction case since the proposed amendment relates only to the limiting of the scope of Article 40.3.3º.  It is true that before the enactment <Col N="432" /> of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which inserted that Article in the Constitution, it had been pointed out by Judge Walshe in the Magee case that Article 40, Section 3, of the Constitution as it then stood, could be invoked to protect unborn life.  However, as was stated by Judge Hederman in the X case, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was quite clearly designed to prevent any dispute or confusion about the application to unborn life of Article 40 as it stood before the passage of the Eighth Amendment, under which unborn life had a guarantee of protection and which went further and expressly guaranteed equal protection to the life of the mother of the unborn life.  The right to life of the unborn is now explicitly recognised and guaranteed by Article 40.3.3º and that explicit guarantee has been held to take precedence over the right of a mother to travel when she intends to leave the State to have an abortion and there is not a real and substantial risk to her life.</P>
    <P>If the people, by referendum, now decide that that express guarantee is not to limit freedom to travel outside the State, surely it is fanciful to suggest that the courts would circumvent that expression of the will of the people by reverting to a possible implicit guarantee of the right to life of the unborn that has been referred to in a case prior to the creation of the express guarantee of Article 40.3.3º.  I am advised that reference to Article 40.3.3º in the proposed Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is sufficient to achieve the aims of that Bill.  Deputy Howlin referred to the question of the State as against jurisdiction. We do not see any difficulty there, so far as matters referred to in the Constitution would refer to the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; in the circumstances of our arrangements internationally on behalf of the State.  Article 29 refers to the executive power of the State.  We do not see that it would cause any difficulty.</P>

The Minister is beginning to satisfy me that there is no other Article under which somebody can assist a person to travel to have an abortion which is illegal in this country but which would be legal in the state to which they are travelling.  He said that under Article 40.3.3º we are giving precedence to the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which will supersede the right to life if somebody claims that a person cannot travel for an abortion.  The right to travel would be the overriding principle on which somebody would be able to travel and not the fact that they were going to have an abortion. Am I correct in that assessment?</P>

      <P>Under Article 40.3.2º what is the position of the boyfriend, husband or father of a potential child who decides to vindicate the right to life of the unborn in this State by saying that he is convinced that the woman carrying <Col N="434" /> the child is going to abort that child?  That is what happened after the X case where a man was known to have sought an injunction to prevent his girlfriend from having an abortion &mdash; she wanted it but he did not.  We do not know what happened in that case because publicity about it faded away and we do not know whether it was pursued.  That is another scenario where we could end up in court. I should like to read a comment from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 19 October 1992 by a senior lecturer, Mr. J. Paul McCutcheon of the University of Limerick in which he stated:</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the authoritative interpretation of constitutional provisions is that of the courts and any attempt to explain the meaning of the proposals is an exercise in legal futurology.</P>
      <P>Obviously, even in what we are doing today we have to be careful not to use words such as &ldquo;certain&rdquo;, &ldquo;certitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;absolute&rdquo;, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We did in fact consider that issue.  The idea of futurology comes down to the fact that any citizen can take himself or herself off to the courts and seek to get an interpretation on any aspect attached to this legislation whether in ordinary legislation or constitutional law. Without seeking to be short with the Deputy, we did discuss this issue and considered the very points the Deputy has raised, where there was a question of assistance for somebody seeking to prevent somebody from doing something they wanted to do.  That is the whole purpose of the amendment as it is now framed.  The amendment makes no exception &mdash; that is the key phrase.  In other words, as the Deputy suggested, if somebody wishes to travel abroad for whatever service is lawfully available <Col N="435" /> they are free to do so irrespective of what anybody else would wish the person to do.  We are satisfied about that.  As I said previously, if that had not been the case it would have required an enormously different type of amendment and I would not have shirked from it if I felt that was the case.  We feel this covers it neatly and we have been so advised.</P>

I want that assurance from the Minister as I believe we all share that objective.

Can the Minister assure me in plain simple terms, in so far as he can, that when we vote on the referendum and have this wording inserted in the Constitution that if a third party such as that suggested by my colleague Deputy Owen &mdash; a father &mdash; wanted to injunct a woman who was pregnant and who had expressed the clear wish and intention to go away, could she be arrested or stopped in the interim &mdash; cases take some time to come to court &mdash; from going off on the plane immediately or how would she be affected until the case is heard?</P>

The amendment does not seek to tolerate any interference in that regard and it supports Deputy O'Kennedy's point of view.  It cannot be achieved in any event.  He sees it from a different angle but it is already there as something fundamental one way or the other.  His point is that this amendment is not necessary at all.  What I am saying is that agreed wisdom and virtually the unanimous position of the House is that this amendment is necessary to put the matter beyond doubt.  As Deputy Fennell said, people cannot and will not be restricted in any way.  Deputy Howlin's point is well taken.  This situation did not happen before.

    <P Just="Center">and</P>
    <P>In Part II, page 6, line 7, after &ldquo;state&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or freedom to receive a service lawful in such other jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates very much to the point made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  As he rightly said in the essence of his contribution, only two judges would have been prepared to give an injunction in relation to travel.  If one reads the judgments in detail, that seems to be the import of them.  Only two judges out of the five, a minority, would have been prepared to give an injunction against travel while three judges would have made an order to prevent the woman or girl from having an abortion.  This amendment seeks to clarify a very important point.  Characteristic of the debate which has been taking place outside this House for a long time are the euphemisms used &mdash; we speak about &ldquo;the right to travel&rdquo; when we mean the right of women to travel abroad for abortions and &ldquo;the substantive issue&rdquo; when we mean abortion.  We should talk in specifics, not generalities.</P>
    <P>It should be clear at the end of this debate that there is no possibility of an injunction being taken against somebody who travels abroad for the purpose of procuring an abortion which is lawful in another member state.  That is the import of this amendment.  It seeks to include the words &ldquo;or freedom to receive a service lawful in such other jurisdiction&rdquo; in Part II of the Schedule.  There has been much comment about this issue.  The essential point in the original judgment in the X case, is that Mr. Justice Costello granted an order giving an injunction against the person concerned leaving the State and also against the person procuring an abortion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That judgment is dead; it has no relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal with the issue step by step.  That is the case which initiated these amendments.  There is <Col N="440" /> every possibility that that injunction could still be made under the wording before us.  I am afraid that this might be the case.  I am not sure that the Supreme Court set aside every aspect of the Costello judgment.  I wish to have the position clearly stated so that people who vote on the issue of travel will be clear in their minds that no Irish woman or girl who travels abroad for the purpose of obtaining a legal abortion in another jurisdiction can be injuncted or prosecuted for doing that.</P>
      <P>In this regard it is salient to quote the comments made by Mr. Anthony Whelan, a senior Trinity College law lecturer, in an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 11 October.  The article states:</P>
      <P>Whelan said that part of the Supreme Court's ruling in the X case was that under Irish law a woman was only permitted to terminate her pregnancy outside of the jurisdiction, where it did not conflict with Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution guaranteeing the equal right to life of the mother and unborn child.</P>
      <P>This means that abortions in England are lawful only in circumstances which would be deemed lawful in this country, rendering the right-to-travel amendment irrelevant to the legality of foreign abortions.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By travelling abroad to have an abortion which you weren't entitled to get here, you will still be committing an unlawful act,&rdquo; said Whelan.</P>
      <P>Those are the comments made by a senior law lecturer on the wording before us. The Labour Party are seeking in this amendment to remove any ambiguity in relation to this matter so that we can state explicitly that the right exists for any Irish woman to travel abroad to avail of abortion services which are lawful in another member state.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's comments on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address my remarks to amendment No. 4, the intent of which is the same as amendment <Col N="441" /> No. 3.  To a significant extent we have already referred to the issues we want to raise under this amendment and the protections we are seeking.  We are seeking to guarantee women living in Ireland, whether they are Irish women or foreign women &mdash; many women living in Ireland are not citizens of this State &mdash; the right to travel to Britain primarily.  I take the Minister's point that the amendment provides for travel to any other state, but it has to be acknowledged that the vast bulk, if not all, of women who travel abroad for an abortion go to Britain.  We are seeking to guarantee women the right to travel for an abortion.  However, the Minister's amendment does not specify this.</P>
      <P>We are afraid that Article 40.3.3º could be read as giving a superior right to the foetus over that of the right to travel.  As Deputy McCartan said, Article 40.3.2º has a relevance in this case.  Article 40.3.3º gives the foetus an equal right to the right of the woman.  The right of the woman derives from Article 40.3.2º which states:</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3.3º gives the foetus an equal right to the woman in relation to that Article.  It seems to me that the right to travel could be regarded as less important to that right.  It is for that reason we are seeking to incorporate wording which says that the right should be specifically for an abortion, for the services &mdash; the euphemism being used in the debate and the amendments &mdash; of abortion in another state.  Despite the wishes the Minister and we may have, unless we copperfasten our intention the wording will be open to challenge and different interpretations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not believe that after a referendum a woman against whom an injunction would be sought could be legally restrained from travelling from the State.  I wonder on what <Col N="442" /> he bases that assurance.  If a person goes to court and obtains an injuction, temporary or otherwise, against a person travelling to Britain for an abortion, surely the State has an obligation to restrain that person from travelling and to take whatever steps are necessary, particularly if the person who obtained the injunction has made it clear to the court that the person against whom the injunction is granted intends to travel on the 8 a.m. flight to Heathrow the following morning.  In such circumstances the State would have an obligation to enforce the court's injunction by restraining that person.  I question the Minister's categorical assurance that persons could not be interfered with in that way. Regardless of the final outcome of the court case, a person could be restrained on an interim basis.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to guarantee the right of women to go to Britain to seek an abortion even where that abortion may be unlawful in this State.  That is the crux of the matter.  The reason we are here is that the Supreme Court found that they could in certain circumstances prevent a person from travelling to another jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity to repeat the point that in his reading of the judgment the Supreme Court have not made a ruling, but the Attorney General did bring a case and the persons concerned returned to this country on being assured that if they did not they would be liable to penalties for being in breach of an injunction.  We are trying to rule out that risk.  On that basis the Minister should consider the wording we are putting forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other reason we are here is that the Government, in their wisdom or otherwise, incorporated a Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty which sought to exclude Article 40.3.3º from the consideration of the European Court.  That also has a bearing on the case we are making.  Even still it is not clear what effect that Protocol will have on what we <Col N="443" /> are doing and on the outcome of the referendum.  Regardless of our decision, will women not have recourse to the European Court because of the Protocol? It is another angle of the uncertainty that surrounds this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin has reservations as to whether the judgment of Mr. Justice Costello was set aside entirely.  That would be a matter of reasonable concern.  The Chief Justice clearly states at the end of his decision that the orders made in the High Court have been set aside.</P>

      <P>We are putting in a constitutional amendment to put beyond doubt what in my view is already beyond doubt.  This is not good practice.  When we debate the need for introducing something that is already quite clear, we are raising a doubt that is not there.  I gave my reasons earlier.  I have heard allegations of ambiguity and requests for the Minister to clarify.  It is clear that he does not need to.  Anything he or any other Minister says will not change the law, regardless of the best intentions.</P>

      <P>I do not want to confuse matters.  An injunction was taken and that injunction arose out of Article 40.3.3º and an interpretation thereof. This amendment simply provides that Article 40.3.3º cannot be used to pursue an injunction again.  That is important. The general understanding is that to prevent such a thing happening again in any circumstances it should be specifically laid down.  The best way to do that is to put a provision into the Constitution in a simple way providing that the Constitution gives unrestricted freedom to travel in any and every circumstances. That will achieve what Deputy O'Kennedy <Col N="445" /> says is already there.  The people are anxious to have it stated in that way.</P>

      <P>No.  The subcommittee considered the subject of the amendment in that regard.  We recommended to the Government in that regard that it was not necessary.  It seemed inconceivable to us that a court would give an injunction against a woman having an abortion when it cannot prevent her from travelling by invoking Article 40.3.3º.  Why would anybody be injuncted when nothing can take precedence over the right to travel as laid down in this amendment? It is not a question of being beyond reasonable doubt.  We are simply satisfied that the right to travel supersedes everything in so far as Article 40.3.3º or any other Articles of our Constitution are concerned.  It is a good reassurance to be able to give.</P>

    <P>My amendment seeks to insert after &ldquo;information&rdquo; the words &ldquo;counselling or assistance&rdquo; in order to seek clarity in relation to what will be lawful in the State.  In relation to the whole issue of abortion there will be unanimous acceptance of the need for counselling for somebody involved in a crisis pregnancy.  It should be explicitly stated that counsellers involved in that activity would have the protection of law.  We have already had some discussion on the word &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;.  Deputy Owen raised it in relation to the previous Bill.  I have in mind, for instance, a child who is pregnant being assisted by parents.  Would they and those involved in arranging travel be above possible legal action in relation to the assistance they would afford the child in procuring an abortion? We want to ensure that no third party involved in counselling or in giving assistance would be subject to prosecution as a result.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to insert after &ldquo;services&rdquo; the words &ldquo;drugs or preparations&rdquo;.  In relation to the question of information, when amendment 40.3.3º was proposed in this House and when it was campaigned for outside of this House we were assured that it was not intended to change anything, that nothing would change in relation to medical practice or with regard to the current position in Ireland at that time in 1983.  We were assured that the only purpose was to make sure that at no point in the future could abortion be legalised in this State without the matter being referred to the people.  We know that since 1983 quite a lot has changed, that students have been hounded through the courts of this State and they had to go to the European Court <Col N="448" /> in order to try to establish the right to provide information on abortion.  We know that books have been removed from our library shelves as a result of complaints that they contained information relating to abortion.  We know that there have been complaints about various magazines which contained information about abortion.  I know that quite a number of magazines in Britain which circulate in this State censor themselves in relation to various matters that they publish.  I am thinking specifically of magazines aimed at women, in some cases young women, which run articles on the health of women.  I have examples where these magazines excised sections of the magazines for sale in Ireland.  The fact is that Article 40.3.3º has changed quite a considerable amount of practice in this State.  The Open Door counselling service was closed down as a result of actions by SPUC in court.  <i>The Guardian</i> was stopped at our national airport and was refused distribution by Easons, the people who normally distribute it, because they feared that they would be prosecuted because it contained an advertisement for the Marie Stopes clinic.  The need to establish the right to information is an important one which is probably supported broadly in this House.</P>
      <P>I have to draw the attention of the House to the underlying hypocrisy of our position as a society.  We are quite prepared to ban abortion in virtually every case where the need may arise and to specifically ban suicide as a ground for abortion, but we are prepared almost unanimously to agree that a woman will have the freedom to travel anywhere she likes to have an abortion and that she may have information, albeit in fairly restricted circumstances, on where those abortions may be had.  Providing abortion in this State is regarded as impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to a question which I put to the Minister for Health on 21 October.  I asked the Minister for Health the number of women in this jurisdiction who had pregnancy terminations in Britain in the <Col N="449" /> latest year for which figures were available, the services, if any, which are provided by the health boards in this country for post-termination health care or counselling where this is required, and if he would make a statement on the matter. The reply, I received is interesting.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>In 1991, the most recent year in respect of which data are available, 4,152 women resident in the State had pregnancy terminations in Britain.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health and welfare needs of such women a broad range of services are currently provided by each health board.  In the case of medical needs, obstetric and gynaecology services are available in public general hospitals which can be availed of where necessary.</P>
    <P>As regards psychological and counselling services, the necessary support services are provided in each health board area by multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, community psychiatric nurses and social workers. Additionally, valuable support services and counselling are provided by voluntary agencies which are in receipt of specific funding in that regard from my Department.</P>
    <P>The only comment I can make on that reply is that apart from the statistical fact that there are 4,152 women resident in the State who had pregnancy terminations in Britain in 1991, the reply is a load of nonsense.  I have been in touch with health board officials and there are no such services available for women. What I have been told is that if by chance a social worker comes across a woman who has had an abortion she will be referred to the Rape Crisis Centre.  For the Minister for Health to try to cod us into thinking that there is already in place a range of services that will counsel women on the question of abortion, or even on alternative options, is to mislead this House in a grievous way.</P>
    <P>I have to question the bona fides of the proposal here which is seeking to make it constitutional that information will be <Col N="450" /> provided with certain legal restrictions.  I do not want to get into the issue of whether or not there is a difference of opinion between the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health on the issue of the provision of information.  That is not a worthwhile avenue to go down. However, it is worthwhile to question what precisely is being proposed.  Statistically, in 1991 4,152 women had abortions and everyone of them needed counselling before she stepped on a plane, weeks before she stepped on a plane, and certainly every single one of them needed counselling when she stepped off that plane again.  From my information not a single one of them got counselling or help from the health services on which we spend hundreds of millions of pounds.  It is left, broadly speaking, to groups who provide it on a voluntary basis.  It seems that the health boards themselves use such services and refer people with such needs to those services.</P>
    <P>That is the first point I wanted to make. There is a large question mark over the seriousness with which the Government are addressing the issue of pregnancy termination in this State.  We have a serious abortion problem in this country. The official figures are certainly understated because of the numbers of women who go to Britain and do not give their correct address but use addresses of relatives and friends resident in Britain.  The figure is certainly understated.  We are talking about at least 5,000 women this year who will have travelled to Britain for a pregnancy termination.  We have an abortion problem in Ireland and we will have to deal with it.  It is not sufficient simply to say that we will tell a woman where the abortion clinic is, that we will not allow the information to be put on bill-boards, that nobody will be allowed to distribute leaflets and so on.  That is an entirely restrictive approach to the question of information and counselling. It is a narrow approach.  I am not suggesting for a minute that there should be widespread advertising of abortion and abortion services in this country.  I am not arguing for that at all.  I am simply <Col N="451" /> saying that the mindset that sees the question of information solely on the basis of how it can be restricted rather than how it can be provided is starting from the wrong end of the spectrum of this problem.</P>
    <P>The Women's Information Network which, for obvious reasons, is based at a box number &mdash; they provide abortion information and if those involved in that work were to become known to the agents of the State they could be prosecuted as things stand &mdash; have provided Deputies in this House &mdash; I am sure I am not privileged in any way to get this information &mdash; with the results of a study which they carried out involving 2,000 women who contacted them about crisis pregnancies.  It is clear from the information they got from the women who contacted them that the range of reasons women have for seeking an abortion are as many as there are women who seek an abortion.  One of the most striking things to emerge from this information that the network provides is the almost universal terror women face when they are in this situation and the need for counselling of a compassionate kind to be available at the time they need it and not when a person may be reached at the end of a queue perhaps two or three months after the time when an abortion may be no longer possible.</P>
    <P>We have to address this issue not just from the legalistic point of view but from the point of view of what services the Government are actually going to provide at the end of the day, assuming unanimity in this House in relation to carrying the information provision and to judge by the opinion polls in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today it will be carried overwhelmingly. What services will then be provided by this State for the women who need this counselling before they get on the plane, and what services will be provided when they get off the plane? Having decided that we are going to shift this problem to Britain for the foreseeable future, the least we can do is to try to provide a caring service for women <Col N="452" /> who are faced with this appalling dilemma.</P>
    <P>Let me come to the amendment which I am seeking to move.  It relates to including information on drugs and preparations as well as services.  The reason I am proposing it is that it is generally understood that services refer to abortion and that, generally, is thought of as a surgical procedure.  I am no expert in this area but certainly it requires hospitalisation for a period both before and after.  It seems that this could certainly be regarded or classified as a service.</P>
    <P>There is now a new drug on the market; I understand it is referred to as the R4U8 pill.  This has been developed in France and is widely available there.  I also understand that it is available on a limited basis in the United Kingdom at the moment but it is about to become widely available there.  Quite simply, the R4U8 pill is an abortifacient.  If a woman who wishes to terminate a pregnancy takes this pill up to six weeks into the pregnancy, the pregnancy will be terminated without the need for hospitalisation or surgical intervention.  This will result in a major change in attitudes towards abortion and a huge drop in the statistics for abortions in France and elsewhere.  I understand that this is occurring already in France.  I understand also from material that I have read that the number of abortions in Europe is beginning to decline, but that is a separate argument.</P>
    <P>The reason I am seeking to have the words &ldquo;drugs and preparations&rdquo; included in the amendment is that it is important, if women are to be counselled in relation to the services available, that they should equally be entitled to know that there is a pill available which would obviate the necessity to go to a hospital or clinic &mdash; in other words, there are different ways by which a termination can be carried out.  It seems that the use of the R4U8 pill in the vast majority of cases would reduce dramatically the trauma for women who for whatever reason must go through the process of a pregnancy termination.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to guarantee in my amendment that women will be entitled <Col N="453" /> to receive all possible information so that they will be able to make a free choice, based on their health needs, social situation and so on.  We should not get involved in the business of accusing each other of being in favour of abortion on demand, or of this, that or the other, because this House agrees that we should send our women to Britain for abortions &mdash; we may not have it here but we can send them to Britain.  If we are going to allow them have the information and to travel, they should be entitled to receive all possible information about the options open to them.</P>
    <P>It is only a matter of time before this new preparation will be widely available in Britain and I am quite certain that it will be widely used there.  I am seeking to guarantee that the amendment we are passing here will guarantee that women will be entitled to receive all such information and that it will not be restricted to the question of where the nearest clinic is in Manchester or London.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this amendment there is a number of issues that we need to tease out.  Having studied their speeches I believe that there are some discrepancies and differences of interpretation between the statement made by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and the speech made by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell.  We are dealing with semantics here.  It seems the terminology used in their speeches &mdash; words such as &ldquo;directive&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-directive&rdquo;, &ldquo;information&rdquo;, &ldquo;all available options&rdquo;&mdash; does not gel together.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us where the line can be drawn between the giving of information and referral.  Let me give a simple example.  For instance, I could say to a person that there are many shops on Grafton Street.  That amounts to information.  I could say that Switzers on Grafton Street have a great line in men's coats.  Does this amount to a referral and will I not be able to give this information to a person?  Does this not come within the meaning of the concept of giving information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> The Minister stated in his speech on Second Stage:</P>
    <P>Directive counselling, as I understand it, is systematic guidance and advice and involves abortion referral. Non-directive counselling on the other hand, consists of the provision of information and does not involve abortion referral. </P>
    <P>According to the Minister for Health, non-directive counselling means &ldquo;setting out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision for herself&rdquo;.  Is that not what Deputy De Rossa said?  For instance, when this new drug becomes available should it not be included among the available options to be made known to a woman in non-directive counselling?  Therefore there are discrepancies between what the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, consider to be directive and non-directive counselling.</P>
    <P>I prefer to think that Deputy O'Connell's description is more in keeping with what the people want.  He went on to say in his speech to hammer the point home that the proposed legislation will not only resolve the uncertainty surrounding the 1988 Supreme Court decision about doctors being unsure of the legal position but will go further in a positive way by linking the provision of abortion information in crisis pregnancies with the provision of full non-directive counselling.</P>
    <P>Let us take as an example a pregnant woman who goes to her doctor or an advice clinic to find out the full range of options that are available to her in relation to her unwanted pregnancy. What would the position be if, having been counselled by the doctor as regards her health and told of all the options, including adoption, carrying the child to full term and abortion, the woman decides that she wishes to avail of the option of abortion?  Prior to 1983 some doctors said to women that abortion was available and gave them the name of a reputable clinic.  Will a doctor now, in providing full information and non-directive counselling, have to say to a pregnant <Col N="455" /> woman that she will have to go out and buy a certain magazine or publication to get the names of some clinics, be they reputable or disreputable, where she will be able to have an abortion carried out? Are we not splitting hairs too finely?  I am not saying that the doctor is referring the patient to a clinic but rather giving her information.  I am not saying that he will telephone the clinic on her behalf to make an appointment, because this could be construed as a referral, but rather that he is giving information.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not say to people outside the House who do not want to see information being made available that the amendment will be so restrictive that nobody will be able to find out through the counselling system where they can go to have an abortion carried out.  I would like the two Ministers to clarify what appears to be a difference of interpretation in regard to non-directive counselling.</P>
    <P>In the Minister for Health's speech he gave a list of multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, community psychiatric nurses and social workers.  In the report of the Commission on Health Funding it is virtually impossible to find any mention of the psychological services health boards will need to implement the provisions of this amendment.  It is my understanding from the Eastern Health Board, that there are no counselling psychologists, as opposed to clinical psychologists, who may be able to provide this service.  Has the Minister for Health considered how this amendment will be implemented when it becomes law?  If a woman walks into her local health centre and requests counselling the day after it becomes law, what will happen?  Will a team of properly trained people be available to give such counselling?  Will resources be made available for this counselling?  We all know that there is a lack of resources in this area, particularly for the more select services required by a small percentage of our population. They are the poor relations in the health <Col N="456" /> services and I do not believe the structures are in place to implement the provisions of this amendment.  We can say from the roof tops that such services are available but I do not believe that will be the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to doctors and advice clinics.  Will doctors provide free counselling services to medical card holders and private patients or will only private patients who can afford to pay for the service be able to avail of it?  Will there be extra pressure on doctors who carry out this service?  Has any research been carried out in that regard?  Will a suicidal pregnant woman have to visit a doctor's surgery and wait with ten to 15 other people to see the doctor while he deals with patients who have an ingrown toe nail or some other minor complaint? When her turn comes will the doctor have to act as a counsellor?  Those matters have not been dealt with in this legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the advice clinics and services the Minister referred to &mdash; but did not elaborate on &mdash; will these be new services financed by the Government or existing groups, such as marriage guidance counselling services, the rape crisis centres, and so on?  We should be mindful of the lengths the Rape Crisis Centre had to go in order to get the Government to recognise the importance of their role. They had to go to great lengths to highlight the fact that their services were needed and that Government support was vital if the Government were not prepared to fund a direct public service in that area.  We must have answers to those questions before this legislation is passed.  If particular clinics are asked to provide these services will such services be free of charge and will the costs to such clinics be recouped from the Department?</P>
    <P>It is clear from the reply to a Priority Question put to the Minister yesterday that vast areas of our health services are grossly under-funded and put to the pin of their collar to provide even a minimal service.  Many of those questions referred to orthodontic services and the fact that 15,000 people are waiting for treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> Our public health services will not be available to react to the terms of this amendment if it becomes law.</P>
    <P>If the clause regarding the risk to the mother's life because of self-destruction is removed, the Government must ensure that suicidal pregnant women can get immediate and urgent counselling to prevent them committing suicide or taking the boat to England.  A few weeks ago I listened to a radio programme on which a spokesperson from a group, which I think call themselves &ldquo;Life Rescue&rdquo;, in a sort of boastful manner said that members of that group travel to England and stand outside abortion clinics.  He stated that they had saved ten girls from the trauma of abortion in that way.  Why were they there if counselling would have stopped those women from going to England to have an abortion? That makes a case for counselling here which might prevent women who are psychologically traumatised by an unwanted pregnancy going to England to have an abortion.  In order to minimise the number of women who go to England to have abortions this service must be properly structured, properly funded and available at community level.  Otherwise we are wasting our time and passing legislation that will be cosmetic and of no benefit.  I do not believe that is what the Minister wants.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the article I quoted from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> by the lecturer J. Paul McCutcheon.  What will be the position following 29 October when the European Court makes this decision?  Obviously, the Minister does not know what the final decision will be, but it appears that the reason the students did not win their case was based on the fact that they did not have a commercial link with an abortion clinic.  What will the position be if the Minister says today that a doctor must stop short of naming certain reputable clinics in the centre of London where patients will get good care?  If that doctor has a commercial link with a particular clinic, will he be allowed to promote that clinic?  If that is the outcome on 29 October a doctor need only create some type of commercial link with <Col N="458" /> a clinic, such as a small investment of, say, £10 or £100, and refuse what the Minister referred to as directive counselling. If the decision on 29 October allows for that commercial link, how does the Minister propose to handle it if he says that a doctor cannot refer people?</P>

      <P>By passing all stages of the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the House has put in place the principle that we as a nation will facilitate Irish women who are pregnant and wish to have an abortion, for whatever reason, travelling to a neighbouring country &mdash; which in most cases is England &mdash; for the purposes of terminating the pregnancy without restriction.  That is the essence of the Bill which has been passed by the House.  Obviously, such women will be subject to the rules and regulations laid down in England with regard to the termination of a pregnancy.  We have agreed an English solution to an Irish problem.  If we agreed that in principle, surely the logic must be to follow it by putting in place all available information, counselling and assistance in this State to help women who want to avail of such a provision.  That is the purpose in part of the Government's proposal now contained in this Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  It seeks to set down, in principle, that because we will allow women to travel to England to have an abortion, that we should at least make available to them basic information relating to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fairly clear at this stage that the motive force behind the Government in introducing this amendment in the first instance is, in fact, rulings that are pend ing from the European Court, and which are at such an advanced stage that I have no doubt that lawyers representing the State and the Attorney General are we <Col N="459" /> advised as to what those rulings will be. Therefore, we have no option but to at least provide information on services available in another State, particularly a member state of the EC.</P>
    <P>Although we are absolutely clear on the right of women to travel &mdash; and the Minister for Justice has been unequivocal about that &mdash; when it comes to providing information, the Government are indecisive. It is impossible to get a clear indication from any Minister or, indeed, any spokesperson for the Government, as to what they legislatively intend with regard to this provision once it is in place and that is regrettable.  There is provision for the making available of information, but the Minister for Justice has a view on it, the Minister for Health has another and other commentators are indicating what it will mean or, unfortunately, what it will not mean.  That is why I believe the amendments put forward by the Labour Party and by ourselves in Democratic Left are worthy of consideration in order to give some teeth to this provision.</P>
    <P>Regrettably we do not have for the purposes of debate the draft legislation that the Government promises will be available by the time the Irish people vote on 3 December.  It seems remarkable that a sub-committee of Government has been agitating over this matter for over six months and could not make available basic draft legislation or outline what is intended to be included in the legislation once this amendment is agreed to.  It does seem that as with everything else in this debate the Government are trying to have it both ways.  They say that information will be available but then introduce restrictions that the Minister for Health heralded in the Family Planning legislation earlier in the year.  These restrictions were designed to placate a very fundamental, reactionary view in the community, but had the effect at the end of the day of rendering ineffective &mdash; if not ridiculous &mdash; the particular legislation that he is trying to promote in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health appears to be the person who will have the greatest <Col N="460" /> input into this aspect of the legislation as to the type of counselling or information that can be made available to women who want it in the tragic circumstances of crisis pregnancy.  Therefore, I would ask him not to repeat the exercise that he foisted upon us in this House regarding the family planning legislation when he adopted an illogically narrow approach and virtually rendered that legislation ineffective.  In allowing condoms to be widely available in retail outlets but not in vending machines where people could purchase the items themselves, the Minister has, in the light of the decision by major supermarkets and retail outlets not to stock these items, virtually rendered that legislation pointless.  I hope the Minister has learned from that experience and when he draws up the final terms of the legislation in regard to information that he will not have introduced so many unrealistic restrictions as to render the legislation ineffective.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that is absolutely clear from the European experience and that is where adequate counselling, advice and assistance exist, the number of abortions decreases.  In circumstances where women can be given assistance, information, advice and assurance, they can make decisions and will, I believe, opt not to have an abortion in Ireland or, indeed, in England in whatever circumstances may prevail.</P>
    <P>The request to amplify the term &ldquo;information&rdquo; to include &ldquo;counselling&rdquo;, is made in order to help women address a crisis in the first instance, and I believe it will also have the effect that appears to be the Government's aim, to avoid abortion whenever possible.</P>
    <P>The issue also arises in regard to practical assistance.  Anyone following the debate so far, and the various attempts by the Minister for Health to explain in the media, inside and outside the Chamber the provisions of this legislation will have a problem trying to understand exactly where the duties or entitlements of the public lie.  The problem that may arise for people who provide airline or boat tickets is not an unreal proposition, given the uncertainty surrounding this <Col N="461" /> legislation.  Information does not include the activities of people who make arrangements or provide a contact telephone number.  It is difficult, as a previous speaker has said, to understand where information ends and referral begins.  If I understand the Minister correctly, he does not want a referral service to be established in this State under this Article.  I cannot see why he has difficulty with that, given the fact that the Government have made a decision that pregnant women in Ireland can travel to England to have an abortion in any circumstances, subject only to the restrictions they might encounter under the English regime on arrival there.</P>
    <P>That being the position and the unanimous view of this House, what is wrong, in principle, in providing a system whereby contact on behalf of the woman who is travelling can be made in advance. It would certainly help women to find the right service, the most clinically safe service and would allow for liaison between the services in regard to pre-counselling, obtaining advice from the English clinic as to what they require and in terms of liaison with the other counselling and support services in Ireland that are needed when she comes home.</P>
    <P>The Women's Information Network, that Deputy De Rossa has already mentioned, makes this point very clearly in the report compiled by them over the last four years of their work.  I quote from the section on information in that report:</P>
    <P>British abortion clinics have commented that the lack of information has had direct negative medical consequences for Irish women.  Often Irish women travel later in their pregnancy than would have been the case if the information was readily available to them.  They are ill-prepared for the operation, often fearing they will be &ldquo;cut open&rdquo;.  This makes the procedure even more traumatic for them than it already is.  Ironically, the lack of information also means that some Irish women arrive in Britain too early in their pregnancy for the operation to be <Col N="462" /> successful and put themselves at risk of an incomplete abortion.</P>
    <P>There is a great need not simply to provide basic information but also to allow that information to have meaning and support in the medical sense for women who we agree can and should not be hindered in travelling to Britain to have an abortion.  That must involve liaison, counselling, referral and assistance in travelling.  The point about people travelling too late is borne out in the figures of the National Statistics Office in Britain, published in September of this year.  They state that of the women who attended for abortion in 1991, 12 per cent of those whose pregnancy was 20 weeks or longer were non-resident &mdash; not all of them were from Ireland &mdash; whereas 1.3 per cent were resident in Britain.  This is clearly related to the lack of direct contact and easy referral as well as lack of information. On health grounds the Minister, in a Government that agree in principle to allow women to travel to Britain for abortion, has a duty to provide for proper counselling for these women and to ensure that they travel to a location which is clinically safe.  They should be given all the information necessary.  The Government cannot have it both ways.  Since we are sticking to the English solution of our problem, there is a duty on us to do the second best honourable thing and ensure that women are helped in this crisis.</P>
    <P>I hope that two other things will emerge as a result of agreeing to this amendment.  First, a stop should be put to the pursuit of students through the courts who blaze the trail on information rights.  I appeal to SPUC and other reactionary elements in our community who try to censure and deny information to women to stop persecuting people who simply want to disseminate basic information to women in crisis.  An end should be put to these legal actions.  I hope that the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice will join with me in congratulating our students for blazing the trail on this issue.  We are now doing what they argued for, many of them doing so with the prospect of being brought before <Col N="463" /> the courts and subjected to huge legal costs arising from the actions they took.</P>
    <P>I hope that the chief librarian of Dublin city and county will return to the bookshelves of the city basic books on women's health and education with regard to fertility, particularly <i>Every-woman's Lifeguide</i> by Dr. Miriam Stoppard. That book was ignominiously withdrawn from the shelves of public libraries in Dublin by the chief librarian, who issued a memo to the district libraries stating: &ldquo;Please withdraw all editions of the above book [Dr. Stoppard's book] from stock and send to the Circulations Office with a worn-out Memo&rdquo;.  This ignominious act suggests not that women should not read the book but that it should not remain on the bookshelves because it is worn out.  The public librarian was forced to go through that charade to meet the reservation of one member of the public who said there was something wrong with this book.  Actions such as these must be stopped.  The Minister should not heap more ridicule on us by trying to split hairs on such an issue. Information never hurts; it can only help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that we are at the point of legislating to allow adult people to have information about very important and serious issues relating to health.  Since 1983 various court cases have resulted in the withdrawal of information, as has been described by Deputy McCartan.  My first reaction to these was bewilderment that in a civilised, sophisticated democracy the machinery of the State would deny to adult women specific information or books.  For example, <i>The Guardian</i> was withdrawn on a certain day because it contained an advertisement relating to this matter.  For women like myself who have always striven for equal rights, the right to free speech and so on, it is unacceptable to have to tolerate and be subject to those restrictions.  I am very pleased that at last we are taking measures to change this despicable situation which has existed for far too long. In my quiet moments I wonder what the position would be if the X case had not <Col N="464" /> arisen.  Would we continue to put up with the position as it existed?</P>
      <P>We are at a disadvantage in that we do not know what will be in the legislation &mdash; I appreciate that it can only be a draft &mdash; but from listening to the contribution of the Minister for Health and statements made by him on a television programme I am reasonably happy that the making available of information will be unrestricted. I hope that a stop will be put to the Messianic campaign by many groups &mdash; I have no doubt they were well intentioned and they believed that what they did was correct &mdash; of pursuing students and other groups and organisations through the courts to stop them from providing necessary information to people in a crisis.</P>
      <P>I hope that the forthcoming referendum, which I have no doubt will be passed, will result in many people in pro-life groups becoming redundant and that they will be allowed to retire peacefully and happily.  I hope that it will put an end to the setting of traps &mdash; most people in this House will know what I am talking about &mdash; one of which was set for me on the phone.  Traps have also been set for a number of doctors in that a person impersonating a desperate pregnant woman visited or phoned the doctor saying that she was at the point of killing herself and asking for an address or information on abortion.  I would not break the law but I certainly would help a person in this position.  However, I hope that a stop will be put to the setting of these traps, that there will be no subterfuge involved and that proper information will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been well made by Deputy Owen about the need to make available to women a range of services of professionals such as psychologists, social workers and counsellors.  In this context I am not very hopeful because we all know that women looking for basic contraceptive advice and information are ill served here; we are far down the league in European countries in regard to making advice and information about contraception available.  I hope, if the referendum is passed and legislation <Col N="465" /> enshrined, that the Minister will follow it up with realistic information outlets which will ensure that the women about whom we are talking &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, said that 20 or 30 women had gone to England for an abortion since we started this debate &mdash;will be helped.</P>
    <P>Women can very easily find out whether they are pregnant; I am amazed when I see advertisements in this regard. In my day, when I wanted to know if I was pregnant, I had to go to a doctor and bring a specimen for testing.  It was not as clinical and cold as it is today when one buys a pack in a chemist shop and can find out very quickly if one is pregnant.  I am not sure how the test operates but the result is known in 12 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Women nowadays know they are pregnant almost before they miss a period.  It can be a very cold, lonely exercise discovering that you are pregnant at 17 or 18 years of age, or at 44 years of age when you do not really want another child.  There should be a point of contact for women in regard to which they feel comfortable, to which they will readily go and which will give them all the information they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress the need for real information to be available.  We should examine the position in Northern Ireland because it is not dissimilar to what we will have here. Of course it will be far more limited but I have a leaflet brought out by the Ulster Pregnancy Advisory Association which provides telephone numbers.  It is readily available in doctors' surgeries and hospitals and it lists all the organisations, it deals with abortion and the law, how an organisation can help, what is involved in an abortion &mdash; which everybody should know well in advance &mdash; the practical situation with regard to the circumstances in which one would have an abortion, and travelling to England.  It is very important to give the numbers of clinics because women will need to be directed <Col N="466" /> to reputable ones which will do a proper job and not overcharge.</P>
    <P>What will happen if a doctor has a conscientious objection in this regard? We would be very foolish to think that everybody will warmly welcome what we are doing.  I have no doubt that there are very large pockets of resistance and I should like the Minister to indicate what will happen outside Dublin, Cork or Galway, in areas where a doctor will not become involved in imparting information and addresses.  Does the Minister have a plan to deal with that point?  Will women be referred to a central point and get information?  I can see there could be great difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on removing the total ban and censorship on information.  I am sure that the Minister also welcomes it because no one was comfortable with the fact that Ireland had reached the stage &mdash; because of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Eight Amendment &mdash; where magazines could not come into this country without containing blank pages and a little note to the effect that, because this was the Irish edition, it could not be the complete magazine available to other women &mdash; and indeed men &mdash; who read, say, <i>Cosmopolitan</i> to raise their consciousness in regard to these matters.  It caused grave embarrassment and shame that a basic right to information had been removed because of the interpretation. We are doing something very positive in regard to the rights and freedoms of our people by reinstating the right to information. Other Members on this side of the House raised certain questions.  I thought that we might have had to tease out &ldquo;directive and non-directive counselling&rdquo; referred to in the speech of the Minister for Justice who said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive counselling, as I understand it, is systematic guidance and advice and involves abortion referral. Non-directive counselling, on the other hand, consists of the provision of information and does not involve abortion referral.  Non-directive counselling <Col N="467" /> would clearly be covered by the right to obtain or make available information which is provided for in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Before the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty people gave non-directive counselling which included abortion.  The point skilled professional counsellors made is that they would never involve themselves in directive counselling, of just referring people for abortion.  They said that when they counselled women in regard to pregnancy they would make it very clear that they were not in any way influencing the person to opt for any particular choice.  In an impartial way they left the options to the person, with support, but did not exert undue influence. In fairness to the counsellors, they have assured us that it would be totally unethical and unprofessional if they just advocated abortion.  It would be a total negation of everything their skills and professionalism stood for.</P>
    <P>There is no need to be confused in regard to directive counselling.  I should like to feel that there would never be crude, directive counselling which would be just another abortion referral.  We all welcome the fact that we will now be able to restore to women in crisis pregnancies the opportunity to consult an impartial, skilled, professional person who will give them information from which they will be able to get enough knowledge and support to stop them choosing the option of abortion.  All of us would hope for that.  I want to point out the need for this kind of counselling, especially in Ireland. In a paper prepared by Professor Anthony Clare and Dr. J. Tyrell, <i>Psychiatric Indications for Abortion</i>&mdash;<i>Are There Any?</i>, it was stated:</P>
    <P>Certain groups do appear especially at risk from the adverse effects of abortion. Negative religious or cultural attitudes to abortion are associated with higher levels of post-abortion psychopathology.  For example, Roman Catholics experience more guilt than Protestants and Protestants more guilt than Jews.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> I am delighted to say that that statement is based on research.  It is certainly not my personal observation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was hearing things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall continue that quotation:</P>
      <P>Membership of a cultural group which is antagonistic towards abortion and sexuality is also identified as loading for poor outcome in a number of studies.  Such findings are highly relevant to the Irish situation.</P>
      <P>Another statement made in that paper reads:</P>
      <P>Given the circumstances that surround the abortions undergone by Irish women &mdash; the fact that they have to be surreptitious, have to be performed in a foreign land and are regularly categorised as murder by religious and political critics &mdash; it is highly likely that many Irish women do experience profound, persistent and disabling psychiatric symptomatology following the terminations of their pregnancies in the UK.  The implications in terms of the provision of appropriate pregnancy counselling and support... would point to a particular need for Irish women.</P>
      <P>I quote those statements to demonstrate that there is a real need certainly for counselling before a women chooses what option she will take in a crisis pregnancy and also, because of the special circumstances in Ireland, for counselling after an abortion for women who would feel the guilt and the isolation to which they are subject as a result of the situation in Ireland up to now.  One of the fervent hopes that all of us would have is that resulting from counselling there would be a lower rate of abortion, much greater support and removal of the very grave and persistent feelings of guilt, isolation and secrecy experienced by Irish women at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What recognition and funding will be given immediately to clinics already skilled and experienced in carrying out the <Col N="469" /> kind of counselling we are talking about? So far as I know, at the moment those clinics get no State funding.  They rely on contributions, which has an impact on the provision of counselling for poorer women and women who cannot afford high consultation fees.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Health to tell the House the way in which we are going to provide regional counselling as quickly and as effectively as possible.  I know that there are several professional and well served clinics in Dublin that have a long experience and a code of ethics in this counselling, but we have to be concerned about women in rural areas.  For rural women caught in crisis pregnancies not only time but also accessibility would be terribly important. We must ensure that regional advice and counselling are available so that women do not have to travel long distances or draw attention to themselves by having to take a whole day off work, for example, at a time when they may prefer to take advantge of that advice and counselling without the knowledge of the community and perhaps even the family.</P>
    <P>The concept of a total, supportive, psychological counselling service has to be taken into consideration.  We will need skilled people in that area.  The medical profession, who may feel that they have neither the skills nor the time to enter into this kind of counselling, should be able to refer easily and quickly women who would need that counselling immediately.</P>
    <P>Minister Flynn said that he would like the thrust of the measure we are introducing to be affirmative for women, not negative.  I make a plea that the information and counselling also be affirmative rather than negative.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague has raised a point that I wanted to bring to the attention of the House: I hope that the Government will not consider that they can fulfil their obligation by providing a centre in Dublin and expecting everybody to fall into line. If a woman sets out with the idea of having an abortion she will not want to go for advice to a church advice centre because she will feel &mdash; perhaps wrongly &mdash; that she will not be treated properly. If the same woman could go to another advice centre she might very easily, having heard the options, change her mind &mdash; as we have been told.  It is important that centres be provided <Col N="471" /> throughout the country and it is important that the Government do not fall back on the churches, who are doing marvellous work in their own way, because that would be a cop-out for the Government. I would hate to think that once the legislation has been passed we will, because of other financial commitments, finish up with the same lack of services as experienced in other areas of health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few words to say but I think that perhaps Members would prefer to hear from the Minister for Health on some of these issues. However, the Minister and I are <i>ad unum</i> in what we wish to happen in this regard.</P>
      <P>I thank those who have made initial contributions to the debate.  I note that Deputy Howlin is back in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy initially raised a question about the chance of people being prosecuted if they were assisting in any way.  Certainly that is not contemplated. That aspect was dealt with effectively in relation to the proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The same applies in this instance, and I am of the opinion that Deputy Howlin would wish it to be that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa spoke at some length about the needs of pregnant women and particularly their need for counselling services.  I was pleased to hear him say he is opposed to widespread advertising of abortion services, a point that has been re-echoed by many speakers.  Many of the contributions, which centred around what will happen after the Amendment has been passed, were supportive.  It is still only a Bill and the people have to decide on this matter.  We are taking it for granted that they will give us an affirmative in this matter and that is something we hope for in all three referenda. In so far as this particular one is concerned there appears to be a great desire in the House that it would be recommended to the people in general <Col N="472" /> that they give us an endorsement of this Amendment.  No objection has been raised in regard to the thrust of this Amendment.  I am pleased to acknowledge that from the Deputies who have contributed.</P>
    <P>We cannot &mdash; and this has been recognised by the Deputies who contributed &mdash; have the legislation published for the obvious reason that one has to await the decision of the people.  They have to decide that this is the way they wish to proceed and that this is what they want the Constitution to allow.  It was in that manner we discussed it at the sub-committee and it was decided to recommend that a summary of the draft proposals would be made known, and that may be helpful.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, has been helpful in that regard.  I was particularly pleased to hear Deputy Fennell say she supports that in a broad way.  In fact, everybody has agreed that it is the right thing to do but what we are really talking about is the kind of contribution they may well make on Second Stage or some other Stage when the proposals are actually published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  I am talking about the summary of what we <Col N="473" /> would consider appropriate to put into those heads even though it is somewhat in advance of the agreement of the people to accept the amendment.  That point must be borne in mind.  It is a rather critical point and we would be very hopeful that Deputies would apply their minds to supporting the Amendment in a positive way outside so that an alternative view does not gain a grip that would not wish it to be endorsed by the people.</P>
      <P>We have heard much about what Deputies would wish to see happen following the publication and agreement by the House of legislation, following endorsement of the amendment and I know we will hear much more as time goes on.  We were speaking about amendments Nos. 1 and 2 which are being taken together.  I am opposed to amendment No. 1.  It is slightly different from what we discussed for the past hour in so far as we dealt with services that may be provided &mdash; and hopefully will be provided &mdash; following the successful endorsement of the amendment and followed by the publication and agreement of the necessary legislation in so far as the House deems it necessary.</P>
      <P>This amendment to the Schedule of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill is being opposed.  Both the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, and myself made it very clear in our contributions on Second Stage that the Bill permits non-directive counselling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but does not permit directive counselling.  Directive counselling involves abortion referral.  The intention of the Bill is to preclude that kind of counselling from being allowed in the jurisdiction.  The Minister for Health has outlined the details of the legislation he proposes to bring forward for controls on the supply of information in the event of the Amendment to the Constitution, that is provided for in the Bill, being accepted by the people in the forthcoming referendum.  I think we have all been taking that slightly for granted.  I do <Col N="474" /> not take anything for granted in political life but I am hopeful, from what I have heard in the House today, there will be a positive result and it will require the legislation about which we have spoken.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health made it clear that information will include that provided by a doctor or an advice agency to a pregnant woman who seeks the advice concerning her own specific circumstances. He also said it will be a requirement that in such circumstances information must be given in the context of non-directive counselling and the full range of alternative options available to the person concerned.  That is the important issue to which Deputy Barnes referred.  Let us be clear that there is no difference of opinion.  The Minister for Health said non-directive counselling means setting out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision.  It is important that a complete range of options be made available to them so that they know precisely what they were getting into.  They would then be in a position to make an educated and informed decision.  Freedom to obtain information regarding services lawfully in another state, which the Government's wording protects, clearly allows non-directive counselling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague pointed out that following the 1988 Supreme Court decision concerning information, doctors had been unsure of their legal position regarding counselling in a crisis pregnancy. In order to get around that difficulty and to put it in a way that everybody understands precisely what is proper in accordance with the law this legislation will be published in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view of the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, is that the proposed legislation will not only resolve the uncertainty but will link the provision of abortion information in crisis pregnancies with the provision of full, non-directive counselling.  The amendment proposed <Col N="475" /> by Deputies Spring and Howlin, which seeks to insert the words &ldquo;counselling and assistance&rdquo; into the Bill would clearly allow directive counselling and abortion referral.  The Government are of the view that a provision of that kind is unacceptable. That would not be in the public interest or in accord with the provisions of the Constitution.  I would ask Deputy Owen to take it for what it is worth that there is no difference of opinion between what the Minister for Health stated in his contribution last evening and what I stated in the course of my brief reference to the matter in my earlier speech.  My view, as expressed, is entirely consistent with what the Minister for Health said yesterday but I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify it further if that is necessary.  From what I have heard Deputies on the opposite side say, there is no difference of opinion between us on basic fundamental matters in this regard.</P>
    <P>The EC court's decision was raised. The effect of the EC court's decision is that while lawful abortion in a state constitutes a service within the meaning of Article 59 of the EC Treaty, it is not contrary to Community law for a member state, in which abortion is forbidden, to prohibit the distribution of information about abortion services available in another member state where there is no economic link between the abortion service and the distribution of the information provided.</P>
    <P>The court did not make a specific decision but there was an implication that if there was such a link the distribution of the information would be permissible under community law.  It is not so much a question of interpretation but of the way people understand EC law to operate in so far as commercial links are concerned.  To put it in colloquial terminology, the students did not have the commercial link.  Had it been formulated in a different way, they might have had by acting as agents for the commercial concern.  Under EC law the provision of this service is a commercial concern.  The provision of a particular service, which is <Col N="476" /> available and allowable under EC legislation, is regarded as a profitable business. It is proper and necessary that information would be provided in this way.  One has to have a commercial link and, as I understand it, that is the reason the matter was adjudged in the way it was.</P>
    <P>The matter is not straightforward and it is recognised that member states have a margin of discretion within which to decide what should be permissible under national law.  That is written into EC law. The EC Court has consistently held that Article 59 of the EC Treaty requires the abolition of any restriction which has the aim or effect of treating a provider of services established in a member state other than the member state where the service is provided less favourably on account of his nationality or place of establishment than a provider of services who is established in the particular member state.  Article 59 is the key Article.  It also requires the abolition of any restrictions which the recipient of services might encounter on account of his nationality or the fact that he is established in a member state other than that to which he goes in order to receive the services.</P>
    <P>It follows from the case law in the EC Court of Justice that not only the providers of services, who do so by way of trade or profession, derive rights from the Treaty provisions on freedom to provide services, but also Community citizens who wish to receive services.  Of course, the question arises as to whether the right of Community citizens to receive services in another member state encompasses the right to receive unimpeded information in one's own member state about the provider of services in another member state.  It appears that a prohibition on the distribution to persons resident in a member state of specific information designed to promote activities which are contrary to the legitimate public policy of that state, if performed there, may be applied even where the information invites persons to make use of those activities in another member state where the likely or intended result <Col N="477" /> of the provision of such information is to undermine that public policy.  That is the general understanding in so far as Article 59 of the Treaty is concerned.</P>

      <P>It is important to point out that even in the Grogan case, which was dealt with in the European Court of Justice, there is no absolute right to information. The provision of information has to be subject to appropriate conditions laid down in national law.  That is the <Col N="478" /> point I am getting at here today.  Following the endorsement of the Fourteenth Amendment by the Irish people legislation will be needed.  Our freedom to set down our position in national law remains with us.  We can do this in certain circumstances.  This issue will be covered in the legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Health.  Certainly, circumstances will change; they will change quite dramatically following the expected endorsement of the Fourteenth Amendment. So far as information was concerned things changed quite dramatically after the X case and the Supreme Court judgment.  The parameters of this have not yet been outlined, and this legislation will attend to the matter.  That is the important point.  As I said, there is no difference of opinion between the Minister for Health and myself as to how this should be done.  We are simply saying that referrals will not be permitted but all options will be made available in so far as information is concerned.  It will then be a matter for individuals to make up their minds.  The Minister for Health has indicated that he wishes to contribute later.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, they did not necessarily decide that this should be the case in all circumstances. For example, if I want to provide information on the availability of tractors in Britain, there is no obligation on me to have a commercial link with a company in Britain in order to provide that information. Their decision related only to the specific case of abortion information as it related to Article 40.3.3º &mdash; they have no automatic right to provide this information without a commercial link.  I wonder whether a similar decision would <Col N="479" /> have been made if the case had been brought to the European Court of Human Rights.  Of course, that was not done, and I do not know whether it might have been done.  Will the Minister clarify &mdash; this point has not been clarified to date &mdash; if the Government's proposal on information goes through, will the necessity for a commercial link so far as the European Court is concerned still apply in relation to abortion information or will it be overcome by the current proposal?  To put it another way, the proposal we are discussing does not oblige a commercial link to exist; it just says information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem with the entire debate on this proposal &mdash; this has been well illustrated by the contributions made on it &mdash; is that none of us really knows what we are talking about in the sense that we do not know what legislation the Government intend to produce.  We are talking around the problem, not dealing with the substance of it. There is general agreement in this House that a woman who becomes pregnant is entitled to have made available to her information on the options that exist. We are talking about directive and non-directive counselling in a somewhat confined way.  My view of what constitutes directive or non-directive counselling may differ from somebody else's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that if the abortion issue is raised, counselling must be non-directive. There are many organisations on different sides of this debate and with different views about abortion who <Col N="480" /> engage to some extent in counselling. Even those organisations which take the view that ultimately the woman must make the choice as to the options she follows would generally be of the view that they engage in some degree of directive counselling in the sense that they ensure women are fully aware of the alternatives to abortion.  If somebody has an unwanted pregnancy, she cannot be forced to stay in Ireland and have the baby.  If she gets on a plane, we have no involvement in what then happens.  Some people would be of the view, perhaps rightly, that a woman can be encouraged not to have an abortion by having explained to her the relevant support and social welfare services available and so on.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a decline in the number of Irish women having abortions in Britain.  I do not have a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude to this.  I dislike the hypocrisy of pretending we do not have a problem, simply because pregnancies are not terminated here.  About 4,000 women who state they live in Ireland go to Britain every year for abortions.  They are the official figures; there are probably more. The Minister might be of the view that those who are counselling have an objective role to encourage people thinking of abortion not to follow that road.  I would be very surprised if the Minister for Health or the Minister for Justice were of the view that one should not at least try to encourage women thinking of abortion not to proceed.  Most of us would be of the view that one should try to encourage them not to have an abortion, but the ultimate decision will be made by the woman.  If I as a counsellor discuss all the options and encourage a woman not to have an abortion, that is directive counselling. Is that illegal?  Do the Government envisage putting legislation in place which will make it contrary to law, having provided people with options, to encourage them not to take the option of the plane to England for an abortion?  If that is what the Government are saying, it is extraordinary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the problem in regard to directive and non-directive counselling.  There is a view that somewhere outside this House there is a group of people involved in a conspiracy to send as many Irish women as possible to England to have abortions.  It is total nonsense that a group of people who want to be directive are pushing people into having abortions.  I do not know of any group who have that view.  I know there are groups who have provided voluntary services for women faced with crisis pregnancies and who have told them that if they cannot complete their pregnancies the option is to go to Britain and have them terminated.  I am unaware of any group who do that without also giving the other options available, telling women that if they can complete their pregnancy adoption is an option and indicating the support services which would allow a person to remain here and keep the child.  We have supports such as the unmarried mother's allowance, but we do not have the coherent social action programme we need.</P>
      <P>I am a member of Dublin County Council.  Until the housing crisis reached its present state under this Government, we were able in 1986-87 to offer reasonable housing accommodation to unmarried mothers.  They were not left at the bottom of the list, isolated in bedsitters with no social supports and paying exorbitant rents.  It is no longer possible to provide for such people.  Some local authorities cannot provide housing for married couples with three or four children.</P>
      <P>We must not get hung up on the question of directive and non-directive counselling. I do not want people to be encouraged to have abortions.  Neither do I want a law which is so oddly phrased that a counsellor who tries to provide encouragement not to terminate a pregnancy is out of line because such encouragement constitutes directive counselling. That is a very odd way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that we do not know what will be in the legislation.  I can parse and analyse the speeches of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health <Col N="482" /> and suggest there is a difference between the two speeches.  There did seem to be a degree of difference and confusion between the two Ministers, but that may be unfair.  The difficulty is born of the fact that we do not have the legislation. We do not know the specifics of what the Minister intends to produce.</P>
    <P>If somebody has a crisis pregnancy, information means not only explaining how to keep the child, the supports which are available and the option of adoption or abortion; it also includes giving some information to the person who opts for abortion about reputable places in Britain, as opposed to allowing that person to travel to England and go to a place which is not reputable, with the attendant risk to health.</P>
    <P>I am greatly confused about what the Minister for Justice is saying.  He has said that people engaged in counselling can go as far as presenting the options but cannot give the woman the name and address of a reputable place if she has to opt for abortion.  Is that the giving of information or is it a &ldquo;referral&rdquo;?  The Minister for Health was more comprehensive in that he seemed to say that if a person opts for abortion a counsellor can tell her where she should go.  The Minister for Justice seems to say that this cannot be done because it is a sort of referral.  I want to see a rapid decline in the number of Irish women having abortions in England.  For those people who take those options, I would rather they were referred by responsible agencies or medical practitioners to somewhere that deals properly with women and properly engages in further counselling before a termination takes place, than that they be simply left to their own devices to pick up some glossy magazine and get an address of some clinic which might not be the right place to go at all. We need to clarify this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has a problem. We keep talking about &ldquo;referral&rdquo; which is supposed to strike horror into the heart. What does &ldquo;referral&rdquo; mean?  It may simply mean giving a name and address but it may mean something more than that.  The only other meaning referral can <Col N="483" /> have in the medical context as Deputy O'Connell will know is that a GP, as is usual when referring a patient to a specialist, does one or two things.  He either gives the patient a letter or gives him a letter and rings the specialist out of concern for his patient, in order to make the specialist aware of a particular medical condition which may be of relevance. That is what referral normally means and there are sound reasons for it.  The reason is that the GP has perhaps been caring for the person for a number of years and is aware of the general medical history and believes it is something the specialist must know in determining what type of treatment might be appropriate. The referral may contain basic information, for example with regard to allergies to particular drugs.  If the doctor knows that a person reacts badly to penicillin, he will give that information as well as perhaps information on the patient's blood grouping.  If someone is a haemophiliac requiring particular treatment the GP will certainly say that in a referral letter.</P>
    <P>If a pregnant woman makes that awful choice of going to England to terminate a pregnancy, what function will referral have in addition to giving a name and address?  Its only function will be so that a medical practitioner in Ireland can ensure that the doctor from whom she will seek help in England will also know the woman's medical history in so far as it is relevant.  Are we saying that it will be against the law here, not under this amendment but ultimately under the legislation, for a general practitioner whose patient opts for a pregnancy temination in England, to give a letter of referral or to make a phone call of referral so as to ensure that the hospital, clinic or doctor with whom the patient consults in England is aware of the relevant medical history?  That is the only thing I can see as a referral.  We need to clarify that.</P>

      <P>I have made the point and it is something the Minister for Health may wish to respond to.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Grogan case, in the area of information, I am at one with something the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, said last night, and which the Fine Gael Party said, and as I pointed out in a particular way last March when we were pressing the Government to hold referenda on the travel and information issues.  We said that the sort of amendment the Minister is proposing &mdash; and we support the constitutional amendment &mdash; was the type of thing that was necessary, an amendment that would allow for the giving and obtaining of information and allow the Oireachtas to legislate.  I agree with the Minister for Health that we do not want great big advertisement hoardings encouraging people to have abortions.  Nobody wants that.  The Minister is right &mdash; this area must be legislated for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of obtaining information the Minister has explained to the House generally the current position in relation to the law as a result of SPUC <i>v.</i>  Grogan, but what he has not been explicit about is that as a direct result of the SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan case, under European law since the judgment in that case was delivered in October 1991, any commercial agency terminating pregnancies in any state in the EC has been able to advertise their services in this country.  The Minister has not fully explained how the result of the SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan case will interact with the constitutional amendment he is proposing, taken together with the legislation that is being talked about.  There is one very express piece in the report of the SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan case in the 1991 3 <Col N="485" /> Common Law Reports at page 1990 where it says:</P>
    <P>The reply to the national court's second and third questions must therefore be that it is not contrary to Community law for a member-state in which medical termination of pregnancy is forbidden to prohibit students associations from distributing information about the identity and location of clinics in another member-state where voluntary termination of pregnancy is lawfully carried out and the means of communicating with those clinics, where the clinics in question have no involvement in the distribution of the said information.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear as a result of that case &mdash; and my colleague Deputy Owen when she interrupted the Minister raised this &mdash; that an agency that has a commercial interest can advertise here under European law and, it appears, can promote abortion services.  That seems to be the direct result of the SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan case and nothing we put into our Constitution can disrupt that.  Our legislation can properly delimit the manner of promotion. I would like the Minister to tell the House how he sees the constitutional provision and the legislation working if the information change is approved by referendum, which I hope it is, in the light of the judgment in SPUC <i>v.</i>  Grogan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 54 together.  My Department have invited proposals from interested parties for the provision of a site and for the design, construction, financing and management of a national 50-metre swimming pool complex.

No submissions have as yet been received.  A decision on submissions received will be taken as soon as the evaluation process has been completed.

That competition is well under way at the moment and there is a large number of submissions already coming into the Department. The brief called for the successful promoter to identify a site and to identify a form of funding to provide a national, full Olympic sized swimming pool with all that that implies.  Once that process is complete we will be able to announce how we are proceeding.  In the advertisement we indicated that lottery funding would be available towards the cost of the project.  The amount of the funding will be detemined only after we receive the proposals.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>My meeting with the publishers of school text books on 17 August 1992 followed on an earlier meeting of 13 August between officials of my Department and representatives of the publishers.  At these meetings a range of issues in regard to school text books was discussed including cost, supply and quality of the books. Following on those meetings I issued a statement specifying a number of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost to parents of school text books.  One of the 11 initiatives in this action programme was a discount of up to 20 per cent which the publishers had offered in both meetings for bulk purchasing of text books by schools.</P>
      <P>I am aware that many schools benefit from varying levels of discount through bulk purchase from publishers or retailers, but I do not have any information in relation to the number of schools which may have participated in such arrangements in the current school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the people who were at the meeting &mdash; and I have spoken to them &mdash; said that it was merely a throwaway remark by the Minister at the end of the meeting and that they did not agree to it.  I put it to the Minister that he must realise that dealing with education is not like dealing with some of the Minister's previous portfolios. It is dealing with people and with children.  The Minister should stop flying kites and balloons during the summer season because many people have been left in the lurch as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a great believer in working during the summer season.  I think those headlines are excellent.  I do not dispute them at all.  The official note taken by senior civil servants says that 20 per cent discount will be allowed to schools if large orders are received, that is, from three to four schools, with prompt payment.  That note was taken officially on 13 August at a meeting which I did not attend between the secretary of my Department, senior officials and the publishers.  At a meeting four days later which I did attend, also attended by the secretary of the Department and senior officials this was confirmed again with the rider that the order must be big enough.</P>
      <P>The final point I want to make is that I launched an 11-point programme to do with renting schoolbooks, standardising schoolbooks and also pointing out that it was a complex problem and not just a question of the discount I was suggesting. I launched an 11-point programme which is an integrated programme to try to get down the cost of schoolbooks which are too high.  We simply have to get them down and I think the Deputy would agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that as a result of this public <Col N="490" /> relations exercise we have had letters and telephone calls from parents who took the announcement at face value?  They believed that there would be a 20 per cent cut and were driven into the arms of moneylenders so that they could buy the books in September.  Does the Minister not agree that what we need is standardised texts for a ten year period so that people will know where they stand?  What is needed is the putting in place of a proper loans scheme, giving the schools seed capital to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence at all that hardship was incurred by virtue of this announcement.  It was a genuine attempt to put pressure on the book world to get down the cost of books.  I make no apology for that and I reject any notion that it was a public relations exercise.  If the Deputy would read the press release he will see that this was one of 11 items designed to get down the costs.  One of the 11 items is a proposal to have consultants look at the possible standardisation of textbooks and that will proceed shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 3 and Questions Nos. 34 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the figures on which the OECD report is based refer to the year 1988.  Since then, spending on primary education has increased by 28 per cent.  The OECD report also shows that we invest more of our wealth in education than the OECD average &mdash; 6.2 per cent of GDP as against an OECD average of 5.7 per cent.  The need to ensure that as many young people as possible are provided with the facilities to complete a second-level education and, particularly in view of the employment situation, to build up the provision for third-level education and training has placed an enormous burden on our resources.  The extraordinary measure of success which has attended the efforts made in these two sectors must be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to pupil-teacher ratio, there has been a number of improvements in the ratio in recent years. It now stands at 25.2:1 at primary level for the current school-year and will be further reduced to 25:1 in 1993-94, down from 27.5:1 in 1988-89.  The pupil-teacher ratio at second level has also been reduced in recent years.</P>
      <P>I agree that there is a measure of balance to be redressed and priority will need to be given to the primary sector in the provision of resources in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the level of expenditure as a percentage of GDP and total public <Col N="492" /> expenditure is not at issue; that we owe the OECD a debt of gratitude for dispensing with global figures and concentrating on expenditure per student; that compared with the position in Northern Ireland we lag hopelessly behind in terms of school transport, school meals, library services and the quality of school buildings?  We should acknowledge this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will never have the amount of money that both the Deputy and I would like to spend on education; I acknowledge that we will always need more resources.  While much work remains to be done in the primary sector expenditure has increased by 28 per cent in four years.  I should like to quote an interesting figure so that the public will be aware of it.  We now spend £1.7 billion on education which is equivalent to half the entire tax take of the State.  Compared to other countries, we do very well.  So far as any Minister for Education or Opposition spokesperson on Education is concerned obviously this is not enough and we will have to continue to try to do better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, in terms of priorities, that the sixties and seventies were the eras of second-level education; that the eighties and the nineties were the eras of third-level education; that at this stage we have to go back to providing the basic tools of education and personal development and that there is a need for reorientation and greater expenditure on primary education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention in the immediate future to give priority to primary education.  However, the Deputy should remember that we are looking at an additional 25,000 students at third-level and that there has been a virtual explosion of interest in third-level education which is enormously expensive. Having visited many primary schools, I am aware of their pressing problems, particularly in relation to construction work.  I am attempting to address this problem.</P>

      <Quest>where decisions on the number admitted to teacher training colleges are made; the reason the number admitted in 1992 showed no increase despite the projected shortage of teachers; and whether he has satisfied himself that there are sufficient teachers to ensure that only qualified teachers work in classrooms in future years.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 4 and Question No. 55 together.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made over the past few years in reducing the pupil-teacher ratio.  This has been possible through the decline in pupil numbers which have dropped from 567,000 in 1986-87 to an estimated 520,000 in the current year.  It is projected that the numbers will drop by a further 84,000 by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, my Department do not consider that the number of students entering training colleges must be significantly increased at this point to enable the question of further reducing the pupil-teacher ratio to be considered. The matter is, however, kept under constant review in the light of developments in the demand-supply position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, having regard to known demographic trends, that if we are to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in our primary schools from 25.1:1 to 22.5:1 that a further 5,000 teachers will be required by the year 1996 and that approximately another 1,000 teachers would be required if the two-thirds of our national schools <Col N="494" /> with no remedial teacher at present were to have one assigned to them?  These are not the full targets that should be put before us.  How we can meet those two targets given that the current intake into our colleges of education is 250 students per year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that there is a dispute about these numbers.  I am aware that the INTO, through their general secretary, take the view that the sums are different.  However, all the evidence available to me suggests that the demographic trends are as I have outlined.  It is my earnest hope that this decline will lead to resources being freed which I could then use in attacking the pupil-teacher ratio with priority being given to disadvantaged schools.</P>

However, as the Deputy said, its contents are widely known.  They are an excellent consultancy firm and have done a very fine job.  They have indicated and acknowledged that Bus Éireann provide a cost-effective service.  However, they did not address the question of devolution fully and how this should be married with the bus system.

While it addressed and reached a conclusion on the question of whether the service was cost-effective I do not have to accept its conclusions.  I had difficulty in accepting some of them. However, I particularly want to study the question of devolution.  The Deputy has to understand that we now spend £37.5 million on this service and I have to be absolutely certain that it is cost-effective in getting our children to school safely and on time.  If the findings of the new study support this that will probably be the end of the argument.</P>

      <P>In the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology additional library facilities have been provided at Sligo, Dundalk, Galway, Letterkenny, Waterford regional technical colleges and in colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology.

      <P>The submission is at an early stage of preparation.  It has to go through a lengthy process in that it has to be discussed in the Department of Finance, it then goes to Government and finally it will take its place with programmes in other Departments and will be part of our overall submission to the European Community.  The projected increase in third level figures will be reflected in the submission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 32, 63 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a recent study in regard to performance at the certificate examinations of students in single sex schools as against those in co-educational schools.  The study in question was based on pupil performance in 17 schools in the Limerick city and county area involving 1,242 pupils.  It dealt, therefore, with a very small sample and acknowledged a number of factors, other than type of school attended, which influence examination performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are at present examining the study and propose, in addition, to carry out their own analysis of student performance in co-educational and single-sex schools with a view to arriving at more definitive conclusions in the matter. <Col N="500" /> Pending a more detailed analysis, I would not be satisfied that any conclusion can be drawn at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister who in the Department of Education will carry out this analysis or will the Minister engage the services of outside experts? Does he believe that it is desirable to have in the composition of such a study group people from both sides of the spectrum? On the one hand there is a considerable body of research which seems to point to the lack of attainment on the part of girls in co-educational schools, while on the other hand there is conflicting evidence in relation to the social advantage of educating boys and girls together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The study will be carried out under the auspices of senior officials in the Department, perhaps at assistant secretary level.  I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion and ensure that the Department are provided with the best possible professional expertise on a consultancy basis.  In regard to co-education, virtually all our national schools are co-educational. Some 60 per cent of pupils at second level and all third level pupils attend co-educational schools.  Therefore, virtually 80 per cent of all students are in co-educational establishments.  We are well on the way to having a complete co-educational structure throughout the State and I believe we should continue to press ahead with this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the analysis shows that girls are victimised and penalised by being in co-educational schools would the Minister consider providing a better pupil-teacher ratio for co-educational schools to offset that disadvantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The jury is out on the question of whether or not there is disadvantage in attending co-educational schools.  There is an equal amount of evidence to suggest that there is no such disadvantage.  I would not favour having a different pupil-teacher ratio for co-educational <Col N="501" /> schools from that which applies to other schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a survey by the University of Limerick of 70 schools showed that principals in single sex schools report fewer discipline problems than those in co-educational schools, will that matter be examined by the study group?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 12, 21, 22 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need for continuing investment in the stock of national school premises.  There has been a considerable investment in recent years in providing additional classrooms needed for the growing number of pupils and in the enhancement of existing accommodation. However much more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>In the period 1987-91 a total of 216 major projects involving the provision of new schools or the extension-renovation of existing schools were completed.  In the current year 52 projects are under construction and a further 147 are at various stages of planning.  In addition, a very large number of improvement schemes have been completed, e.g. the provision of new toilets, heating and lighting, hard play areas and improvements to roofs, doors and windows.  The total capital outlay in the last four years amounts to £95.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the recent statement by the secretary of the INTO that primary education is disintegrating because of the quality of school buildings?  Is he concerned that one out of every ten schools is over 100 years old?  Will he also agree that the recent tendency is to provide schools which do not have a GP room? <Col N="504" /> Will he agree that this will have an adverse effect on the quality of education in our primary system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether I agreed with statements made by the secretary of the INTO; some days I do and on others I do not.  I recognise that one school in ten is over 100 years old.  However, it means that 90 per cent are not that old.  In regard to a GP room, our priority is to provide classrooms and I am particularly concerned and interested in trying to rid the system of prefabricated buildings.  A very high percentage of schools throughout the country are still prefabricated buildings which are ten, 15 or 20 years old &mdash; I think the average is about 15 years old.  I visited a large number and my priority in building terms is to try to remove on a phased basis the older prefabricated buildings and to get on with it as quickly as I can because it is an urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept there is a serious problem in regard to the standard of many school buildings? Will he indicate to the House if he uses any standard to determine whether a building is regarded as substandard?  Is there a programme within his Department for the elimination of substandard primary school buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we are working on a programme on which we spent £95.5 million in four years.  The standards are professionally assessed and they give priority to safety and sanitary facilities &mdash; what would be regarded by any sensible person as the basic requirements in a primary school &mdash; before I spend money on what might be regarded as enhancements or additional non-basic facilities. The programme will continue urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying is of cold comfort to many parents whose children are attending substandard schools.  Many primary schools, for example, Killawalla, on which there was a report on television on Monday evening; Kinvara, which featured very <Col N="505" /> prominently in the INTO report; and Kenagh, near Crossmolina, are so ramshackle and substandard that they would be condemned by the Department of Agriculture and Food for housing animals. They would not pass EC regulations for grant purposes as farm buildings.  They contravene practically every regulation in terms of the levels expected for human habitation.  A special submission will have to be made (a) to the Cabinet and (b) to Brussels for additional ESF money so that there can be a massive campaign to replace substandard buildings immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the European Community does not grant-aid first level education.  It is a matter for the Irish taxpayer and I have already explained that there has been a 28 per cent increase in funding in four years.  I have instructed my Department to prepare a strong, detailed priority listing to tackle buildings in order of priority. The odd hard case pops up now and then and receives substantial attention, but there is an ongoing programme and hundreds of schools all over the country are attended to every year.  Every effort is being made to meet the legitimate demands of schools which, I accept, need urgent attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer was very vague, because he did not mention a timeframe or target.  Do the Department have a target date for the elimination of all substandard school accommodation in the primary sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £95 million is not vague.  The trouble is that we must have a rolling programme, because by the time some schools have been completed others are in a dilapidated condition.  It is a continuous programme of improving the primary school year in, year out.  It is an uphill battle because, as I pointed out already, there are one million people in the education system and we are spending the equivalent amount of half of all taxpayers' income tax on the system.  I accept the legitimate demands for more <Col N="506" /> spending and we will have to do the best we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 75, 76 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer Deputies to the section in the Green Paper on <i>Education for a Changing World</i> dealing with a variety of initiatives related to modern continental languages at post-primary level.  The <Col N="508" /> position has now been reached where the great majority of students follow at least one modern continental language, mainly either French or German or both.</P>
    <P>The language chosen is a matter for the individual school and its pupils, but I will be seeking to support schools in every way possible in extending their provision for the minority languages of German, Spanish and Italian.  The provision of part-time teaching hours over quota for a second continental language will be continued and will be facilitated through the more flexible arrangements for the introduction of additional languages as proposed in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I also expect a new momentum in the teaching of modern continental languages through the various initiatives in the Green Paper related to focusing on improving communications skills.  These include the allocation of 60 per cent of the marks in examinations to oral and aural skills.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also be aware that I propose to introduce an awareness programme for modern continental languages into the primary school curriculum so as to provide orientation to such languages at the earliest possible stage.  This should provide a further boost to the take-up of such languages at the post-primary level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent very welcome publication of the NCCA report on the 1991 leaving certificate results provides us with evidence that there is a huge imbalance in favour of French: 14,374 learn French as against 2,804 learning German, 646 learning Spanish and 66 learning Italian.  Will the Minister agree that there is a need for a pro-active campaign to sell those all important minority languages?  We need to get away from our total hang-up with French.  The way to do this is to train additional teachers and the easiest way to train them is to put them in an environment where they can learn the language as part of their teacher training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The French language became <Col N="509" /> very fashionable for a while and everyone wanted to learn it.  Teachers were provided and that fed on itself.  There was an enormous growth in the number of students who wanted to study French.  As the Deputy knows, the Government are providing a part-time teaching hours over the quota for a second continental language.  I propose to continue that provision and to support schools in every way I can to bring up the standing of the minority languages of German, Spanish and Italian.  I take this opportunity to encourage a movement towards those languages in order that a better balance may be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because German is becoming more the European language of commerce and because one of the main aims of the Green Paper is to create an enterprise culture, would it not be advisable to put more emphasis on German than any other foreign language and for the Government to provide incentives to ensure that German is taught?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should be teaching German numeracy instead of German literacy, in view of the currency implications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>About 4,000 students took German for their leaving certificate this year, which was slightly less than 10 per cent of the total number of students taking leaving certificate.  That level needs to be improved.  About 60 per cent of students took French for their leaving certificate so it is clear that an imbalance does exist.  The provision of part-time teaching hours over the quota for the teaching of German is a measure taken by the Government and it is hoped that we will be able to continue to expand that provision.  It is also a matter of what the pupils and the schools are interested in. I encourage them to aim for a better balance between French and the other continental languages.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>Drawings and specifications have been completed for a permanent national school for Scoil Dún Gharbháin, County Waterford.  This proposed school will then replace the present accommodation occupied by the school.  The question of preceeding to the next stage, that is, the invitation of tenders, will be considered in due course in the light of the financial allocation for 1993, when determined, and other commitments and priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not a very satisfactory answer.  Does the Minister know that at present the school caters for 100 students together with nine preschool children and that they are housed in completely unsuitable premises?  The school provides only two toilets for 109 children. This is the fifth time that the school has had to move in recent years.  Would the Minister ensure that a great deal of <Col N="511" /> urgency is brought to bear on this case because the school is losing numbers as a result of the unsatisfactory nature of the premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is a very serious case.  My own research indicates the urgency of the case.  The question of when I will be able to proceed with the proposed school will very much depend on the final figure arrived at after the preparation of the 1993 Estimates, which, as the Deputy will know, are being prepared in time for the January budget. I shall make every effort to ensure that the new school can be proceeded with in 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the school bus scheme, however desirable, is extremely expensive and that there are perhaps other ways of dealing with the transportation of children to school?  For example, an overall subsidy could be given to each child living within the normal catchment area of the school bus service and it would then be up to students, either on a communal basis or on an individual basis, to make their own arrangements for getting to school.  Would such a scheme not be much more economical and could that not be provided without there being a reduction in the quality of service in getting children to school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, the scheme constitutes an investment of £37.5 million and I am determined that we obtain good value for that investment. That is why consultants are currently reviewing the scheme.  I have given the consultants a specific brief in relation to <Col N="513" /> devolution but I have left their examination open-ended in order that they can make any other recommendations they deem to be relevant.

      <P>Devolution runs throughout the Green Paper.  The Deputy spoke very well on devolution last week.  Devolution is the proposal to cede authority and responsibility from the Department of Education down to the boards of management.  If and when we decide on other structures consideration will be given to the question of whether the bus service could be provided at that level also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned problems experienced in urban areas.  We have to try to address some of the problems that are emerging on the edges of the cities.  I <Col N="514" /> am aware of a few problems that have been encountered in relation to places where city and county merge.  In those particular cases the Department try to be as sympathetic as possible to ensure the provision of a proper bus service.  The scheme does not, however, provide for the city proper or built-up areas.  Neither do I intend to extend the scheme to urban areas other than to address the problems experienced on the margins.</P>

It is up to them to provide the Department with buses that are safe and that meet the required standards.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of establishing a Teaching Council, with functions to include all teachers, is being considered at present by a committee representative of all concerned interests.  Certain legal issues have <Col N="516" /> been raised by the committee and an opinion has been sought.  The work of the committee has been adjourned pending receipt of this opinion.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to resolve these outstanding legal issues so that the work of the committee can recommence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us some indication of how long he expects it will take to establish a Teaching Council? Does he expect to make firm proposals on the matter in the White Paper and does he expect it to form part of any education legislation which he will bring before the House following publication of the White Paper?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that it will be in the White Paper and that it will be the subject of regulation and/or legislation depending on which is appropriate. It is dealt with in the Green Paper.

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not concede that this is the kind of standalone issue that need not be longfingered until such time as the White Paper and the Education Bill are published in due course?  This is an urgent requirement in view of the fact that we have only 81 primary teacher inspectors for 3,400 schools and 65 post primary inspectors for 1,100 schools.  Would the Minister not concede that we need a self-regulatory body?  The legal and medical professions have their own self regulatory bodies. There is no reason we cannot get teachers, teachers' unions, parents, as well as other interested groups, to set up a self-monitoring regulatory body.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware, for example, that a full analysis of the 1991 Leaving Certificate results undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment at the request of my Department was published recently.

If individual school results were published it would be grossly unfair, because it is almost impossible to compare like with like and some schools would be victimised because results may be misconstrued and misunderstood.

    <P>This allocation of additional resources forms part of a proposal whereby the existing visiting teacher service is being expanded to enable it to address a wider range of disabilities.  As an initial step in this process, the expanded service will <Col N="522" /> provide support for children with Downs Syndrome.</P>

Primary teachers in rural schools are glad to have these children in their schools despite the fact that they need extra attention.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a handicapped person (details supplied) in County Donegal has not attended school for more than a year because of the inadequate level of school transport services; and if he will have immediate arrangements made to provide a proper and adequate standard of transport.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties associated with the provision of transport for the child in question.</P>
      <P>The child in question resides 8.9 miles from an ordinary national school which has a special class attached.  From my Department's records the child attended that school up to the end of the 1990-91 school year.  Up to that time, I understand that transport had been provided by a local voluntary organisation and my Department paid a grant to the parents in respect of the private transport arrangement.</P>
      <P>At the end of the 1990-91 school year, the voluntary organisation was no longer in a position to continue the transport service.  An extension of an existing service to Killymard national school was sanctioned by my Department to facilitate the child.  However, this gave rise to the serious disruption in the standard of service to 80 other pupils using the service and the full extension could not be implemented.</P>
      <P>As an alternative, my Department have offered the child's parents an annual grant of £260 in respect of private transport arrangements between her home and a pick-up point 2.7 miles away.  This is the maximum grant permissible in the circumstances and I would recommend that the parents should further consider this offer.</P>

This girl lives approximately three miles from the nearest pick-up <Col N="525" /> point.  Does he consider it reasonable to offer her parents £260 to walk 12 miles a day to deliver her to the pick-up point in the morning and collect her in the evening?  Can the Minister not come up with any more constructive proposal?  As I said, this moderately handicapped child has had no schooling for more than a year.

      <P>The Deputy politely referred to the measures taken this year as &ldquo;changes&rdquo;.  It should be pointed out that there was a very substantial increase in the eligibility limit.  For example, the figure of £10,000 was increase to £15,000.  There were increases of up to 50 per cent in the grants limits.  This meant that thousands of students thought they might qualify for a grant &mdash; in previous years the figures were too low.  The figure was increased so that it was on a par with the average industrial wage.  This <Col N="527" /> meant that there was an enormous number of applicants this year, which clogged up the system very substantially. The grants are being paid this year around the same time as they were paid last year.  I wish to remind the House that I have ordered a full review and streamlining of the administration of the grants system.  We need to iron out many of the difficulties in the day-to-day administration of the scheme.  In fairness to the very fine officials administering the scheme, this year they were absolutely swamped because we were offering grants to thousands more students. Because of that we managed to take in a few extra thousand students to third level this year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this decision was taken by his immediate predecessor last December and announced in January and that eight months elapsed before the special staff were assigned to the vocational education committees, that the majority of staff were not trained in this complex area and that it is signalled that it will be at least Christmas before these people get their grants?  What about the reform promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Programme for Government and by the Minister in this House in relation to the whole area of third level grants?</P>

      <P>This year saw the most dramatic and historic increases in student grants, with up to 40 per cent and in some cases 50 per cent increases in eligibility limits, which brought thousands more students into the system. The cost will amount to many millions. A large number of public officials have been struggling with the additional demand and doing the best they can. We will get the grants paid as soon as possible, certainly well before Christmas.</P>

I heard one county manager say recently that paying the grants at the earliest possible time and waiting for recoupment, which may not come from the Department until May, could cause a local authority to incur loan service charges of as much as £100,000?</P>

      <P>I do not make any apology for trying to get more information before awarding grants.  We will try to streamline the form and make it somewhat simpler in future.  This year I made some changes because I was determined that no one would get a grant who did not deserve it and that justice would be seen to be done.  We needed the extra information to get rid of a perception that grants were being given in some quarters when perhaps they should not.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Did the Minister take any notice of my suggestion that applications for grants should be made in June when matters are quite?  Qualification is based on the means of parents, not on leaving certificate results.  The old excuse that one had to wait for the results does not apply.  The number of changes to be made after June will be minimal.  There is also a delay in dealing with appeals from county councils.  When I objected to the delay, <Col N="529" /> I was told there are only two people dealing with these appeals in the Department. If true, it is an absolute scandal. Can the Minister refute it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I had started to tease out further the whole question of what exactly <Col N="607" /> the Minister for Justice means by the term &ldquo;referral&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;information&rdquo;. He seems very coy &mdash; a term I would not normally attach to the Minister &mdash; about tackling the question which is being put to ensure that this amendment, if passed, will mean what it says and nothing else.  The amendment would not permit directive counselling but would permit non-directive counselling. However, the wording of the amendment would not make that distinction.  That will be done in the legislation.  The words &ldquo;directive&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-directive&rdquo; do not appear in the amendment.  Therefore the amendment <i>per se</i> will not distinguish between directive and non-directive counselling.</P>
      <P>With the greatest respect, we may end up allowing people to have information, counselling and support in a crisis pregnancy under a system which will finish up in a puff of smoke.  That is why it is necessary for us to tease out the use of words in one speech or another.  The Minister for Health got nearer to what we are trying to avoid, that is clinics in which the only information and advice a woman with a crisis pregnancy gets is to go abroad for an abortion.  We do not want to see that sort of advice clinic.  The Minister for Health when talking about books, magazines, radio and television said that such information will only be permitted in so far as it is factual in nature, and instead of leaving it there he went on &ldquo;and does not seek to promote abortion in preference to alternative courses of action.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;promote&rdquo; should be looked at carefully with regard to the legislation. It is a more meaningful word than &ldquo;referral&rdquo;. The Minister should get his advisers to look at this.  The use of the word &ldquo;promote&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;referral&rdquo; which is open to a number of interpretations would be much safer.  For example, I can tell the Minister that there are lots of shops in Grafton Street and that is factual, but I can also say that one of them is called such-and-such and that it is great for men's overcoats, and that seems to be referral, but in fact it is just <Col N="608" /> further elaboration of the same information that there are lots of shops in Grafton Street.</P>
    <P>If, on the one hand, the law will permit factual information to be published in books or magazines, the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, said on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, the programme we shared on television, that would mean the names and addresses without any indication as to which is good or bad.  Where does one draw the line in the doctor's surgery or in the advice clinic?  A doctor may give a woman all the options he can and a woman may go away and think about it and then come back and thank the doctor for the names and addresses of CURA, the Rape Crisis Centre and so on, which were given because the person was pregnant due to rape in order to assist her to make a decision not to have an abortion. The woman may say that having considered all the advice she wants to have an abortion and wants the names and addresses of clinics which the doctor thinks would look after her properly in the circumstances in which she finds herself; the doctor would refuse because he cannot go any further, although he can tell her to sit in his waiting room for ten minutes and read through <i>Woman's Way</i> magazine, or whatever, or some leaflets that are there.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary to put that onus on advice clinics so that they cannot actually say &ldquo;Here is a leaflet&rdquo; such as the one Deputy Fennell showed us from Northern Ireland?  When the Ministers are answering I want them to understand what we are trying to tease out.  We are trying to make sure that a non-directive counselling service that becomes available with all the necessary resources will not be just some kind of a talking shop. I am not saying that it must refer people or promote anything but it must be useful.  It must be of some benefit to the traumatised person seeking it.  In most cases people will be happy to complete their pregnancies and deliver their babies safely.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the word &ldquo;promote&rdquo; because the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, got closer to what we are trying to avoid <Col N="609" /> than the Minister for Justice did in the way he described non-directive counselling. Perhaps the Ministers would take a look at those issues.</P>

      <P>Before calling Deputy De Rossa, I would again remind the House of the time constraint. We must adhere to the requirements of Committee Stage debate.  We refer to what is in the Schedule and the amendments proposed which would alter that.  If we are to indulge in projecting ourselves into legislation that has not yet appeared, or if we indulge too much in historical fact we are avoiding the opportunity we have of exchanging our views in relation to the present.  That is what we should be doing.  The Minister for Health to whom the Deputy addressed the questions has not yet addressed them here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we are trying to tease out the implications of what information will be available is because the Minister for Health very kindly outlined in the Second Stage speech the parameters within which he expects information will be available and the restrictions that will be placed on it. I have one brief question on that to which the Minister might reply.  When the Minister makes a distinction between directive and non-directive counselling he is obviously saying to us on the one hand that no provider of information or counselling may direct someone solely in the direction of abortion, but is he also saying that no organisation such as CURA may ignore the option of abortion?  If a person with a crisis pregnancy goes to CURA, a Roman Catholic organisation, will that organisation be obliged to outline all the options including abortion?  That is a fairly straightforward question and I would appreciate it if the Minister would deal with it.</P>
      <P>I have not yet heard an answer to the query as to the definition of &ldquo;referral&rdquo;. What is &ldquo;abortion referral&rdquo;?  What precisely do we mean by that and how do we distinguish between information and referral?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke earlier I referred to an <Col N="610" /> abortion pill which is available in France and Britain and I gave it the incorrect title.  It is actually RU486, and I understand there is a similar pill called the MIFEGYNE pill.  My amendment seeks to ensure that services include that kind of service and would not exclude information on the range of abortion procedures that are available.  As I understand it, the RU486 and the MIFEGYNE procedure is much less traumatic, primarily because it is administered in the early stages, within the first seven weeks in France and within the first nine weeks in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>An tAire. The Minister will notice that I am making the distinction because there has been a fusion of two Ministers.  I hear people saying &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; and I do not want to be accused of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of items to which I would like to refer.  The Deputies really want the Minister for Health to say some other things.  What we are really talking about and getting at the moment is advice as to how we would consider framing the legislation which has not yet been drafted.  We have only indicated a summary of what the draft proposals might be and all of that is contingent on the endorsement of the Amendment to the Constitution which comes first.  The legislation will be subsequent to that.  It is useful all the same because &ldquo;information&rdquo; is the key word here.  For that reason I think the latitude is understood and, thankfully, understood by you too, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a couple of comments and then the Minister for Health might like to expand.  The amendment we are talking about now will open up the right to provide and receive information concerning services available in other countries not merely in those cases where termination of a pregnancy is lawful in <Col N="611" /> the State but concerning all services lawfully available outside the State.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that the Government are prepared to permit non-directive counselling but are not prepared to permit directive counselling.  I am advised that the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; in this Bill is sufficient, without any reference to counselling, to achieve that purpose.  That explains the reference on Second Stage which Deputy Owen mentioned. In line with the Government's objective, the legislation which the Minister for Health proposes to initiate, should the people accept the proposal in the amendment, will provide for non-directive counselling and prohibit directive counselling.  Under the legislation non-directive counselling will set out all the available options in order to let the person make the informed decision for herself.  The Minister for Health and I are at one in our views on this approach. There is no divergence of view whatever between us on the matter, as appears to be suggested in a previous intervention by Deputy Owen.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to a matter that was raised by Deputy Shatter.  He suggested that the amendment Bill could inhibit the counselling of a pregnant woman not to have an abortion.  I want to reject that argument without hesitation.  The implication that Article 40.3.º3 could be used to inhibit advice to a woman that she should not have an abortion is clearly wrong because it would fly in the face of the whole tenor of Article 40.3.º3 which is framed to protect the life of the unborn. The precise form of the non-directive counselling would be set out in the legislation.</P>
    <P>There was a point made about the commercial link.  Deputy De Rossa made this point as well.  The question of the commercial link was only relevant when people were claiming that they had rights under EC law to provide information. The question of commercial link becomes irrelevant once the amendment is made. Such a link was only relevant when the question of freedom of information under EC law was in question.  Since the <Col N="612" /> proposed amendment will make information available under Irish law the question of whether or not there is a commercial link no longer applies.  I think that is the point that Deputy De Rossa was making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It must also be remembered that freedom of information under EC law is not unlimited.  That is another key point.  That is where the legislation comes in.  States may impose restrictions to suit their own particular culture; and quite a number of EC states have restrictions &mdash; and some of the restrictions are quite severe &mdash; on the supply of information about abortion.  All of the other talk we have had then is following the amendment, the legislation, the areas of restriction and anything else one wishes to apply.  For example, we do not want advertising on bill boards.  That is certainly out.  There are other areas which can be gone into when the legislation is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one final point to put to the Minister on that.  Am I right in thinking that what the Minister is saying is that the counselling has to be non-directive in so far as it refers to anything to do with abortion but can actually be directive in so far as it has to do with any other option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used the word &ldquo;factual&rdquo; previously.  It was mentioned by the Minister for Health that it had to be factual but not advocating abortion <i>per se.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly all the range of options would be available and it would be for the individual then to decide what she herself wished to do.  One particular option would not be advocated deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's point was that if the term &ldquo;non-directive&rdquo; is <Col N="613" /> used one has to be non-directive right across the board.  The Minister has said now that counselling can be non-directive only with regard to abortion but it can be directive with regard to advising someone to go to CURA or any of those organisations. The Minister is mixing directive and non-directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it will be allowed in practice to use directive counselling to prevent a woman from having an abortion. Is that not essentially what the Minister is saying?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that we will not be using the words &ldquo;directive&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-directive&rdquo; in the legislation because they are not legal terms.  There will be guidance and advice to a woman on continuing her pregnancy but there will be no question of advocating abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be talking about advice and guidance to a woman on continuing with her pregnancy, but we would not allow advocating abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points that were mentioned by a number of Deputies here on the question of referral or advocating. Factual information will be provided on the various options available to the person.  Deputy Owen mentioned the possible role of health boards and other State agencies in providing information on abortion services.  It is very important to make it clear that the proposed amendment relates to permitting people or agencies who wish to do so to provide such information within the legislative conditions that the Oireachtas may <Col N="614" /> decide.  It does not imply that the State agencies will be providing the abortion information.  I think Deputies would agree with me that it would not be appropriate that the State itself should provide information on services which are prohibited in this country, so it would not be State agencies that would be providing the abortion information.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue, the need to make sure that adequate support services are available for people undergoing psychiatric or psychological crises whether related to pregnancy or not, this is of course the ongoing responsibility of the statutory services.</P>
    <P>Counselling is something very private between a doctor and a patient.  They do not need all these very learned and trained counsellors.  There are neighbours, friends, families and so on who give this advice to the girl about having her baby, keeping her baby, giving it for adoption.  I am reading about the psychological service that is available and how we must have specially trained personnel to do this.  I am perhaps a little simplistic in my way, but I found some very good people who could advise a girl very well about continuing with her pregnancy, having her baby, helping and providing the support services for her &mdash; I seem to have alarmed one Deputy there with what I am saying.  I do say that services have been given for a number of years to girls having babies and giving them for adoption etc.  Girls have made an informed decision themselves having been given information about all the services that are available.  This has been going on for many years.  It is not something that will suddenly happen after the legislation comes into effect.</P>
    <P>One would get the impression from some of the current debate that as soon as this law is passed there will be a sudden rush of women looking for information on abortion.  During my years in medical practice I dealt with hundreds of girls who were contemplating abortion.  While some may have talked with a clergyman I did not meet one who consulted a psychiatrist. While some, in their emotional turmoil, seriously contemplated disposing <Col N="615" /> of the foetus, but none ever contemplated taking their own lives.  Very few such cases are recorded, and indeed the documentation in relation to those is not reliable.</P>
    <P>I make those points because I get the impression that some people seem to think that once the amendment is agreed to we will be setting up clinics and providing a counselling service on a regional basis for pregnant girls and that suddenly we will have all these girls contemplating abortion.</P>

While one can inquire about when it will come I do not think it was ever given to anyone of us to presume to anticipate that which is not before us. Could we concentrate, as we are required to do on Commitee Stage, on the Schedule and stay with what is in the amendments to the Bill?</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to do that if the Minister would make an announcement today that the public should also ignore his announced intention in relation to legislation dealing with the question of information because what we are trying to do is to tease out what he is proposing to do with legislation after <Col N="617" /> the amendment to the Constitution is carried.</P>
      <P>We were provided with information by the Minister in his Second Stage speech as to the kind of restrictions he would place on information once the amendment was carried.  What we are trying to do now is to tease out exactly what this means.  It is important that people would know, given that they will have to make up their minds on the amendment, what precisely the Government are proposing in this regard.  During his speech the other night the Minister said that non-directive counselling means &ldquo;setting out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision for herself.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems from what the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health have said that it will be in order and legal for some clinics &mdash; I instance the CURA Clinic which is anti-abortion and which therefore will not advise on all the options &mdash; not to provide information on all the options but only on the options they think are valid for the woman concerned, to the exclusion of abortion.  It seems that we have drawn out a number of crucial contradictions as regard what the Government and the Minister are proposing on this question of information.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Minister's statement that the health services will not have a role in the matter of information, because to a significant extent, the people who will be seeking to avail of such information are the people who avail of the public health services.  I would like to know precisely what distinction the Minister is making.  He is saying that it probably would be better if people received information from their neighbours and friends but it is an unfortunate fact of life that in many cases women have been pressured by friends and relations into having abortions because of what was perceived as the shame attaching to the pregnancy.</P>

      <P>I am not a doctor and I can only tell the Minister of what I come up against as a public representative in my advice centres, I know that there have been cases where women have been advised by their friends to have an abortion because it is the quickest, cleanest and handiest way out.  Sometimes it is the man responsible for the pregnancy who puts pressure on the woman to have an abortion.  If we are going to leave women in that situation we are doing them a disservice.  As the Minister said, we will have to provide non-directive counselling but it will have to be professional counselling, otherwise, as legislators, we would be derelict in our duty towards these women to ensure they make the best choice for themselves, not for their husband, their financee, their mother or their father.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy De Rossa, I have to express grave concern about the indication which has just been given by the Minister for Health that State agencies, the health boards and so on, will be washing their hands of this whole affair and will not be involved in giving information. That is a most remarkable statement because what we are talking about here is an activity that will be legal &mdash; the giving of information that people will need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister telling the House that he, as a representative of the health agencies of the State, is going to walk away and say that we will leave it to the voluntary agencies to supply the information? If so, this is an indication of the attitude and approach that has been adopted by the Minister and the Government on this issue &mdash; they do not want to be involved; they want to do the minimum and to let somebody else do the <Col N="619" /> rest.  They want this information to be given by everyone, except themselves.</P>
    <P>Much valuable and important work has been done across a wide field of activity by voluntary agencies.  One wonders to what extent such work would be done if these agencies did not exist but there comes a time when the State has to face up to its responsibilities.  Given that we have reached the point where we accept that it will be lawful and in order to provide information on abortion services why should the State not accept that, like any other agency it is involved and must make that information available through State institutions?  People should be entitled to go to these institutions to get information about their health because that is what the health boards and health agencies are for.  It is horrific to think that they would run away from that aspect of their responsibility.  I was amazed to hear the Minister indicate that that was what he had in mind in relation to the legislation that is to come.  I urge him strongly to rethink that matter.</P>
    <P>In his comments the Minister for Justice mentioned that advice will be given within the parameters laid down in this amendment.  As a person who has always advocated that the detail must be provided for in legislation rather than by way of referendum I support the concept but the purpose of the Labour Party amendment to the Bill is to give the Minister, when he comes to frame the legislation, the widest possible choice because we do not want him to be restrained or constrained by the amendment.  However, that is precisely what will happen if he limits the power he is taking to the single word &ldquo;information&rdquo;, that is a limitation which he may well find later to be a constraining and limiting factor.</P>
    <P>When drafting this legislation the Minister may find that his powers are limited. When he gets down to dealing with the nitty gritty of the legislation he may want to extend his powers but will be unable to do so as that would be <i>ultra vires</i> with regard to the wording of this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason the Labour Party want to expand the Minister's powers to <Col N="620" /> provide not only information but counselling and assistance for women seeking an abortion.  Of course, it would be up to the Minister to decide to what extent he avails of that right.  He may limit it in whatever way he wishes, that is the purpose of this legislation.  If he accepts the Labour Party amendment, at least, he will have the broadest possible powers in this regard.  The Minister may decline to accept our amendment, which proposes to give him those broad powers, only to discover later that he would like to have the power to legislate for more than mere information.</P>
    <P>The funnelling of people to England, through directive counselling, to have an abortion is not the answer to this problem. However, other types of counselling could be appropriate such as that suggested by Deputy De Rossa.  There are various methods of abortion, such as surgical abortion, abortion by means of an abortifacient drug, and so on.  A woman seeking an abortion will not know what type of abortion is most suited to her needs or is appropriate for her medical or psychiatric condition.  Therefore, it is not sufficient for the adviser &mdash; a State or voluntary agency, a doctor or whoever &mdash; to simply tell the woman the alternatives and let her decide.  She may ask the doctor to advise her on whether she should have her abortion by surgical means, by taking an abortifacient drug or by some other means.  As he would have examined her she would expect him to take account of her medical condition and state of mind.  If doctors or advisers counsel women as to what they feel would be an appropriate method of abortion for them they would be in breach of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be going beyond the giving of information.  The Minister should consider that point carefully when drafting the legislation.  He should not close that door on himself but rather address the problem in the legislation by leaving all options open. The essential difference between dealing <Col N="621" /> with this matter by way of legislation rather than by consitutional referenda is that more time would be available to address the issues involved.  If the Minister closes the door now he may regret it.  At some future date, he may regret not including a provision for counselling and assistance when drafting the legislation. The Minister should not put himself in that position.</P>
      <P>The same applies in regard to assistance. The legislation provides that information on abortion services in other countries may be provided here; it leaves it open for a girl or woman to avail of those services.  Are we leaving it at that? Is that not a cold-blooded provision? That may be all some people might want, not every one will need counselling or assistance.  However, some will need counselling of the types I referred to and others will need assistance, perhaps financial assistance.  What will be the position of a person who cannot afford to go to England to avail of the services there?  Some voluntary agencies may be willing to provide funding for a girl or woman in that position if it was lawful for them to do so, but under the legislation the giving of financial assistance, in this regard would be illegal.  It does not come under the description of &ldquo;information&rdquo; and that is why we propose to insert the word &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; in addition to counselling.  That may need further consideration and control under the legislation, but, again, the Minister should consider including some provision in that regard.  He should ensure that he has the power to do that if, following consideration, he thinks it appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to what the Minister for Health said, none of us underestimates the support, advice and solidarity that family and friends could <Col N="622" /> give to a woman faced with an unplanned pregnancy.  However, in reality, the last people a woman wishes to find out about her unwanted pregnancy are her family and friends.  At times, there is a tendency for a boyfriend or, indeed, families who do not like the stigma attached to an unmarried mother to offer to pay the woman involved to go to England to have an abortion.  In rural districts, where there is not the same anonymity as in urban areas, there is sometimes greater pressure on women to have an abortion. Therefore, women in rural areas need to have access to skilled counselling.</P>
      <P>Dr. Anthony Clare and Dr. J. Tyrell when referring to the circumstances that pertain to Irish women Stated: &ldquo;The implications in terms of the provision of appropriate pregnancy counselling and support including the provision of information relating to adoption, abortion and the successful negotiation of a full-term pregnancy would appear obvious&rdquo;.  They were referring to non-directive counselling. The Psychologists for Freedom of Information here wrote to me stating, &ldquo;We are of the opinion that proper legislation be enacted to provide for the provision of non-directive pregnancy counselling.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not believe we are at cross purposes here but, as Deputy Taylor so eloquently stated, the Minister should not close any doors in this regard.  The last thing any of us would wish would be for the Minister to be prevented from doing what he believes is correct because of wording in the legislation that could instigate court cases on its interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We depend very much on voluntary groups and agencies to provide health services, and from a health point of view, this work requires skilled professionals, trained people who must be funded from the health services.  That is the plea that we make here.  The high risk area of drug users is another area which should be given attention.  The Minister for Health has provided clean needles for drug users.  Similar measures have been provided in other States, and this constructive health measure has been applauded.  We know drug abuse is illegal <Col N="623" /> but the provision of clean needles is necessary for the health of the individual drug user and the community.  We would ask the Minister to address the needs of this area in an open and constructive manner in the legislation that is to follow.</P>

      <P>The contribution's from Deputies Barnes and Owen are very helpful.  We had reached a point in the debate where we were in agreement and introducing other issues at this stage will cause confusion.  We are all presupposing that the Amendment to the Constitution will be endorsed and that legislation will be enacted.  That legislation will be framed in the manner outlined by the Minister for Health in his summary last night.  His summary outlining the proposed legislation was broad, it covered many areas and was well received by Deputies.  Some of the interpretations of the language have to be clarified, though they will not appear in the Bill, and this will result in the legislation being acceptable to all Deputies.  I am pleased that we have now gone some way towards achieving this end.  I will not be responsible for framing the legislation, this will be undertaken by the Minister for Health, but I will, le cúnamh Dé, be at the table and I will make my contribution as well.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to hear the Deputies' views on how we should proceed in this matter in so far as providing all the options and information that is necessary so that people can make an informed and correct decision.  We are all nearing agreement in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to respond to a point made by Deputy Taylor in regard to his view that the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; may be too restrictive.  I referred to this matter before Deputy Taylor came into the Chamber as it had already been raised by Deputy Owen.  I have already told the House that the Government's purpose was to provide for non-directive counselling, but my legal advice in regard to non-directive counselling is that the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the Bill is sufficient, without any reference to counselling to <Col N="624" /> achieve that purpose.  In other words, it is catered for in the legislation and it is clearly understood that the Amendment as it is now framed can stand and it adequately incorporates the matters raised by Deputy Barnes.  We are not restricted in that way.  The word &ldquo;information&rdquo; is broad enough to cater for non-directive counselling and that view is also endorsed by Deputy O'Connell.  Where and when such non-directive counselling may be provided can be considered when the legislation is before the House.  I am sure the legislation will be very broad and voluminous to incorporate all the matters that have been referred to by the individual Deputies, and that is the way we will be proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barnes is quite right there.  Any legislation that we might <Col N="625" /> contemplate cannot be guaranteed either.  The amendment to the Bill proposed by Deputy De Rossa and his colleagues protects the freedom to obtain or make available in this State information about services lawfully available in anothere state.  It does not attempt to specify the types of services beyond requiring that they should be lawfully available in another state.  It would be pointless, in fact it would be impossible, to attempt to itemise all the various services which are lawfully available in other states and which, accordingly, would become within the scope of the amendment proposed to the Bill.  There is no need to carry out such an exercise and I do not believe it would be practical.  The Bill does not mention the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; although information about that service service was clearly in mind when the amendment proposed to the Bill was first mooted, in line with the commitment that was entered into with all the party Leaders. That was clearly understood at the time and is being honoured in this amendment. Deputy De Rossa's amendment is opposed.  The Bill provides for information about services lawfully available in other states in line with ten commitment entered into by party Leaders and I am not prepared and do not see any real need to depart from that wording. In those circumstances, of course, the amendment is opposed.  There is a genuine and general acceptance of what we are seeking to achieve here and this is a good way to achieve it.  Hopefully the legislation will receive unanimous support.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister may be surprised but I am not concerned that my amendment is opposed. I put it down to try to tease out precisely what services were being provided.  As the Minister stated, the clear intention is to provide for information and presumably counselling for abortion services. That is not specifically stated in the constitutional amendment that has been proposed.  Just as we had this debate in relation to travel, that amendment does <Col N="626" /> not refer to the travel rights being proposed specifically for abortion.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go into the extraordinary double-think in regard to people who, on the one hand, are opposed to abortion and on the other, say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the right of people to travel to Britain for an abortion, and that we will provide information services and so on.  I am sure we will have that debate again next week. If the Minister is giving me a categoric assurance that what could, in shorthand, be described as pharmacological abortion, would not be excluded in the advice, counselling or information that will be provided under this amendment or under the legislation that is being proposed, then I would be satisfied to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do think it is necessary to go through the list of services that need to be attended to in regard to services. The Government's objective is quite clear on this matter in regard to non-directive counselling.  The Bill is sufficient to cater for that without including extra words.  When the legislation comes to be teased out in greater detail at another time that area can then be considered.</P>

      <P>I did not receive a direct answer to the other question I asked and now the discussion has tended to collapse into a consensus of some kind. However, I do not believe that consensus on this particular point exists.  The question is in relation to directive counselling and the definition that the Minister is giving it.  The Minister for Health said that non-directive counselling means &mdash; and this is his definition &mdash; setting out all the available options in order to let the woman make an informed decision herself. Will it then be necessary for any organisations, voluntary or public, to make information available on all the options?  If organisations are obliged to do so will Cura, for example, a Roman Catholic organisation who are, in principle, against abortion, be obliged to provide information on abortion?</P>

      <P>The position will be similar to that under all legislation that provides for a service.  Some organisations may decide to proceed differently from others, and obviously organisations will not be mandated to proceed in a certain way.  The legislation will be wide enough to cover all organisations regardless of which option they take.  We are not involved in the dictating business.  The freedom available to organisations will be covered in the legislation and can be teased out when the legislation is before the House.  I do not think the Deputy would suggest that in advance of the legislation we set down proposals as to who will be dictated to, what they will do and how they will do it.  That is not what this amendment is about and it would be wrong for us to get into that area of conversation, even today.  We are purely considering the amendment of the Constitution as it relates to information. However, the Deputy should feel free to raise that matter again, as I am sure he will, when the legislation is before the House.  It is not my intention to give a direction as to what Cura or any other organisation will or will not do.  The legislation will be framed in such a way that the information we are talking about will be there, and any organisation who wishes to avail of the legislative frame work may do so.  If they choose not to avail of it, so be it.</P>

      <P>I cannot comment on that, but in my Second Stage Contribution I was quite explicit in setting out the Government's position.  The Minister for Health has already given an outline of the draft proposals in this regard.  It would be inappropriate to publish legislation in advance of a decision being made by the people on this matter.  We all seem to pre-empt the outcome of the referendum, and happily I go along with the vibes, but it is only after the referendum has been held, that we can publish the legislation.</P>

      <P>Surely there is nothing wrong with publishing a proposal that the Government assumes the people will support.  The Government should convince people of their arguments.  I understood the Taoiseach to say last week that the draft legislation would be published in conjunction with the referendum proposals to show the Government's thinking on the matter.  However, if the referendum is rejected the Government will have to think again.  It is important to reflect on this aspect of the matter because the people deserves the widest possible information in advance of the question being put to them for a definitive reply.</P>

      <P>County Kildare vocational education committee have been running the VTOS for the long term unemployed for the past two years.  During that period a lot of time and effort has been spent in promoting the belief that adult and second chance education offered a real choice for many unemployed adults.  This intervention has been recognised widely as one of the most creative and significant educational initiatives of recent years. Currently County Kildare have 72 people on the programme, a solid testimony to the attractiveness and integrity of the programme among unemployed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the initial group of 15 who have finished up this September three have obtained places in third level colleges. The academic progress of these three individuals has been phenomenal and they now have a unique opportunity of obtaining a qualification which in time will enable them to seek new jobs and make a new life for themselves.  As things stand at present they will only receive their social welfare entitlements and their core tuition fees will be paid via the third level grants scheme.  They will be expected to meet all other costs e.g. <Col N="630" /> travel, books, field trips from their dole money.</P>
    <P>In essence none of the individuals can take up the offers unless further financial support is forthcoming.  Take, for example, the travel costs involved in attending college.  All three are living over 24 miles from the relevant college and there is no direct public transport service linking home and college.  The following will illustrate the financial consequences of attending.</P>

    <P>If you add all the other ancillary costs such as books, which amount to a minimum of £100, then you will realise that attending college for these people is simply not on.  To demonstrate the commitment of the individuals concerned, two of them who live in Kilcullen leave home at 7.35 each morning and return at 7.10 each evening.</P>
    <P>The initiative to allow people drawing social welfare to attend college has been welcomed on all sides.  However people living in urban centres close to colleges have a distinct advantage over people living in more rural and provincial areas where access is much more costly and difficult.  To continue this scheme without some financial support for travel and other ancillary costs will effectively put the opportunity beyond the reach of most unemployed people.  In the last two years we have encouraged these people to improve their educational standards and qualifications in order to improve their job prospects but the Minister is effectively saying to them &ldquo;so far and no further&rdquo;. In effect, the principle of equal access does not apply in their case.  An ironic aspect of the situation is the fact that travel costs are paid to attend the VTOS locally, but not when they have to <Col N="631" /> travel further.  At the beginning of the year there were strong indications that a strong supportive package would be forthcoming to enable people to go on to third level education.  A number of submissions was made pointing out that the cost involved would be minimal and that it would be very easy to administer. We were also led to believe that money was available to cover these costs.  Given our optimism, we encouraged students who were academically capable to achieve standards to gain entry to third level institutions.</P>
    <P>There is now a deep sense of disappointment and frustration because the proposed supportive package has disappeared. This was only conveyed to me on Wednesday, 21 October.  The Minister has betrayed these people and the vocational education committee authorities who run the schemes.  Furthermore, for future students coming through the VTOS the possibility of attending third level education is no longer a realistic option.</P>
    <P>At a time when there are high levels of unemployment, every effort should be made to smooth the educational path of those who are able and committed to doing something about their situation. Instead, we put barriers in their way, which would cost very little to remove.  It is as if we opened the door, showed them what the future might hold and then slammed the door in their face.  The present urgent crisis for the three individuals concerned is that they will have no option but to leave college by Wednesday, 28 October &mdash; the final date for late registration. The sadness and heartache created by this is unbelievable.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to pay the travel costs involved, which are very small, but which will rescue these three individuals under the VTOS scheme or through the vocational education committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department do not operate a vocational education opportunity scheme for third level students.  The vocational training opportunity <Col N="632" /> scheme is a particular scheme operated by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare under which long term unemployed persons may attend full time second level education and training courses without losing their social welfare entitlements.  Participants in the scheme are removed from the live register and receive allowances from the Department of Education in lieu of their social welfare payments.  They receive additional assistance in respect of travel, meals, examination fees, etc.</P>
      <P>The scheme was started in 1989 after a pilot phase in Limerick and Tallaght. There were 260 places available on the scheme then.  The number of places now is 2,060 which includes an additional 1,000 places this year.  A further substantial expansion of the scheme is under consideration.</P>
      <P>The scheme has proved itself to be a great success.  It meets in a flexible and effective way the needs of people who are unemployed.  Those who are involved in the scheme &mdash; and here I must pay tribute to the vocational education committees through whom the scheme is operated &mdash; consider it as one of the most important educational initiatives in recent years.  The reaction of the participants is also very positive.</P>
      <P>The VTOS does not currently extend to those following third level courses. The position in relation to long term unemployed and third level education is that the Department of Social Welfare have separate arrangements which allows long term unemployed people to attend approved third level courses while retaining their social welfare entitlements.  In order to be eligible one must be 23 years and over, long term unemployed and in receipt of unemployment assistance. Priority is given to those with little or no means and those who have successfully completed a course under the VTOS. There were some 200 places available under this scheme in the 1991-92 academic year and an additional 100 places have been approved for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assistance from my Department to <Col N="633" /> students pursuing third level education is channelled through the higher education grants scheme and analogous schemes. Among the substantial changes made recently to these schemes were ones specifically aimed at mature students. These changes not alone provided for a substantial increase in the income eligibility limits but also allowed for the assessment of mature students, who are independent of their parents, on their own incomes and that of their spouses. If accepted for an approved third level course they will be deemed to have satisfied the academic requirements for the higher education grant scheme.  This brings greater equity and fairness into the system of meanstesting for student support and in the allocation of resources for mature students.  These grants cover course fees and the maintenance element is intended to provide help towards the cost of general expenses, including books, travel, etc.</P>
    <P>Aspects of the interlinking of these grants schemes with the Department of Social Welfare scheme for long term unemployed are being considered in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise the important issue of the construction of Tallaght Regional Hospital.  I am aware that I have tried your patience in regard to this issue because of the number of times I have sought permission to raise it by way of Adjournment debate and parliamentary questions.  Nonetheless, I ask you and the House to understand the importance of this issue for the people of Tallaght and Clondalkin and the surrounding region which houses just short of 250,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the Minister the respect of assuming that I do not have to go back over all the arguments again because he is very familiar with them.  Will the Minister tell the House that the Government have <Col N="634" /> agreed to go ahead with the construction of Tallaght Regional Hospital?  There is growing disillusion among the people in Clondalkin and Tallaght and the surrounding area because of the growing conviction that the Government are beginning to use the question of a regional hospital in Tallaght as a political ploy in the run up to a general election.</P>
    <P>I will be the first to welcome a positive decision by the Minister and the first to praise him for making it, because with the single exception of unemployment no other issue means so much to my constituents.  It is frustrating that in trying to elicit information from the Minister and the Government we are fobbed off with reference to reviews and studies and told that &ldquo;the matter is under active consideration&rdquo;. For example, I refer to the reply I got from the Minister of State on this matter on 9 July which said:</P>
    <P>The Kennedy Group submitted their report to my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, very recently and it is at present under active consideration.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I put that question to the Minister and he replied:</P>
    <P>The position is that the report of the Kennedy Group, which were set up to examine the functions, scope and scale of the proposed Tallaght Hospital, together with the funding options for building the new hospital, is under active consideration at present.</P>
    <P>The reply does not show any respect to an elected Member of this House for the constituency, that so many months later I get precisely the same reply with no attempt to elaborate or to explain.  I do not know whether the Minister for Health is involved in the local Fianna Fáil organisation but councillors are going round the constituency telling people that it is in the bag and that there is no problem. They have gone further and said that the Taoiseach will attend a local function on 6 November at which he will announce the building of the hospital and that tenders will be invited in January.  I sincerely hope all that is true, but the <Col N="635" /> Minister should have sufficient respect for the House to take the opportunity here &mdash; since it is a matter of such acute concern to people &mdash; to say that, having regard to all the considerations, medical as well as employment, the fact that three hospitals are due for closure in the city and that such an enormously populous area must have a general hospital, he has decided to proceed.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister will do that and also deal with major questions which arise concerning the size, facilities and procedures which will be available at the hospital and indeed the implications, if any of the involvement of private funding for access to hospital care in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me an opportunity to speak in regard to the Tallaght Hospital project.  The Tallaght Hospital is the last part of the planned development of six major general hospitals in the Dublin area.  I would like to reiterate both my own and the Government's commitment to the Tallaght Hospital project.  I have given this reassurance on many occasions and I am happy to repeat it again today.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the hospital has been planned on the basis that the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals will transfer to the new hospital.  All three hospitals and their staffs have contributed fully to the planning process for the hospital. However, concerns have been expressed in this House and elsewhere that the ethos and traditions of the Adelaide Hospital may not be protected in the new hospital.  Both I and previous Ministers for Health have always stated that the traditions of the Adelaide will be protected and that the traditions of the other hospitals involved in the new hospital will also be fully protected.  With regard to the Adelaide, a specific assurance has been given in relation to 40 places being retained for trainee nurses from the Protestant tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> A working group chaired by Mr. David Kingston was established by my predecessor, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, to examine management structures for the new hospital.  I have received this report and am glad to state that a large measure of agreement on possible structures was achieved.  I feel confident that with the necessary goodwill on all sides the remaining issues can be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties in due course.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there have been many changes in the way in which medicine is practised in the interim with new techniques, new technology and drug treatments giving rise to much shorter stays in hospital and in many instances day treatment is now possible where two and three days stays were necessary in former times.  These developments have meant that the same number of patients can now be treated in our hospitals with less overnight bed accommodation being necessary.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght Hospital was planned before many of these medical developments and bearing in mind this factor a report was commissioned by my predecessor from the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, headed by Professor David Kennedy, to examine the functions, scope and scale of the proposed hospital and the funding options for building of the new hospital.  This report has been received and the recommendations there in are under active consideration at present.  Progress is being made.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this very serious matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with great regret that I again stand in the Dáil this evening to raise the matter of the crisis that exists in Ennis General Hospital.  At that hospital there are now the unprecedented circumstances of only 66 beds being provided in a hospital that had 128 beds in 1987.  The complement of beds is just over half what it was five <Col N="637" /> years ago.  The result of the reduction of beds is that the people of Clare are faced with the serious problem that they are not receiving a proper hospital service within their county because there are not adequate beds to provide that service. Terrible hardship is being imposed on people from all over the county.  Some of those who get to the hospital have to stay overnight in casualty &mdash; some on beds and some on stretchers &mdash; because there is no bed available for them in Limerick. There seems to be some kind of a hidden agenda to get as many people from the Clare area into hospital in Limerick.  I hope that the Minister is in a position to clarify those apparent health board tactics.  I would be grateful if he could clarify that aspect.</P>
    <P>The people of County Clare find it most unacceptable that males and females are mixed together in accommodation in the male medical ward. Absolutely unbelievable conditions exist in that ward, with sick men and sick women occupying the same ward.</P>
    <P>In addition, because of understaffing at the hospital, the staff are overstretched.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that industrial action was planned for this week.  At the last minute that action was called off because negotiations with the health board were taking place.</P>
    <P>Conditions at Ennis General Hospital are at a critical point.  I do not understand the way in which the Government can stand back from the problems in such a cool, removed fashion.  The Minister for Health must be aware that in 1989 his own party and the Progressive Democrats gave a firm commitment to the people of Clare that if they were elected to Government they would provide 100 acute hospital beds in Ennis General Hospital.  The kind of rhetoric now coming from the Department of Health and the health board stating, as the Minister stated in reply to a Dáil question put down by me this week, that the hospital will continue as an integral and important part of the general hospital service in the Mid Western Health Board area is not satisfactory.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on that statement.  What kind <Col N="638" /> of integral and important part will the hospital continue to play?  Do the Minister, the Department and the Mid Western Health Board believe that the provision of 66 beds is an important and integral part of that service?  I put it to the Minister that the people of Clare do not believe that to be an important and integral part of the general hospital service; in fact, they know it to be a completely inadequate service.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister visited the hospital recently.  Unfortunately, in the course of that visit he was very carefully steered in certain directions by hospital personnel who accompanied him.  I ask the Minister to visit Ennis General Hospital unexpectedly some evening or some morning.  He should let no one know he is coming and just walk in through the back door of the hospital. Just walking around the Minister would see something that he would not believe could possibly be happening.  I speak particularly of the people in casualty staying overnight on stretchers and of having males and females mixed in one medical ward, which is completely unacceptable in 1992.</P>
    <P>During the week the Mid Western Health Board released a press statement which advised that the board were seeking the provision of a new health centre, an acute psychiatric unit and a new outpatients' department established around the existing hospital.  Right now the people of Clare are not interested in that kind of detail.  What the people of Clare are interested in is the provision of 100 acute beds in Ennis General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister this evening to deliver on the promise made by his party, by the Progressive Democrats and indeed by Fine Gael before the 1989 General Election.  The only difference is that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are in Government; Fine Gael are not.  The Minister is in a position to deliver on those beds.  I appeal to him, as a Minister with knowledge of health, to recognise the crisis at the hospital. County Clare is a very large county with a huge hinterland.  Some people live as far as 70 miles away from Ennis.  For <Col N="639" /> those people to get to hospital in Limerick they have to travel up to 90 miles.  The situation is completely unacceptable and I ask the Minister to have the position reviewed and to tell the House this evening when the 100 acute beds will be delivered in Ennis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Taylor-Quinn has raised this matter.  I am happy to be provided with this opportunity to allay any fears people may have in relation to the acute services at Ennis General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The position is that bed management is an important feature of hospital resource management and involves the closure of beds at times of the year when demand is lower and when many staff take holidays. That practice is not unique to Ireland; it happens in many countries.  It is a feature of many hospitals.  As part of planned seasonal closures, Ennis General Hospital reduced its bed numbers to 68 in-patient and six day-beds with effect from 1 July 1992.  Arrangements were put in place whereby any patients requiring hospital admission which would result in that number of beds being exceeded were referred to Limerick Regional Hospital. I am informed that the number of people whom it was necessary to admit to Limerick Regional Hospital has been quite small &mdash; on average, two a day.  Some of these patients would, I understand, have required admission to Limerick Regional Hospital in any case.</P>
      <P>During the summer, the pattern of admissions changed from that in previous years and the closed ward was re-opened on a number of occasions.  This coincided with the peak annual leave period.  As a result, expenditure for July and the number of temporary staff required for the summer were considerably higher than had been projected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in relation to the reopening of the female medical ward in Ennis is being kept under review by the health board on a daily basis, having regard to the demand for medical beds both in Ennis and the regional hospital, Limerick.  Based on past experience of <Col N="640" /> patterns of demand, it is anticipated that it will be necessary to re-open the ward in the coming weeks.  This will bring the bed complement to 88 in-patient and six days beds, a total of 94.</P>
    <P>Staffing levels at Ennis General Hospital were arranged to coincide with the number of beds open.  I understand that nursing personnel threatened industrial action earlier this week.  However, I am happy to inform the House that agreement was reached between the health board and the unions concerned. A joint review group will be established to consider the nursing requirements of the hospital in relation to the resources available to the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>I would like to further state that it is the policy of the Mid-Western Health Board that the mixing of patients of different sexes in the same area should be avoided where possible &mdash; I indicated my disapproval for mixed when I was in Clare &mdash; except in those departments which have been designed to operate on this basis; these are the intensive/ coronary care unit, the elderly care unit and the day unit.  These are expensive units and I can understand that it would not be possible to have two in every hospital.  Occasionally, however, the urgent demand for beds for one of the sexes exceeds the number available and it may become necessary to accommodate patients of both sexes in the one area.  I have to confess I disapprove of it.  I have been assured that this is kept to an absolute minimum and that every effort is made to respect the dignity and privacy of patients and to ensure that any mixing takes place for the shortest period necessary. The ward areas in which patients of both sexes are accommodated from time to time have recently been upgraded and refurbished.  This work included increasing the bathroom and toilet facilities.  The beds are individually curtained.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the future of Ennis General Hospital, I would like to emphasise that in 1988 the Mid-Western Health Board approved a strategy for the future of the acute hospital services in the region.  This included, <i>inter alia</i>, a <Col N="641" /> decision that Ennis General Hospital would continue to provide acute medical and surgical services.  There has been no change in this strategy.</P>

The Minister will be aware that there are approximately 30 children aged between four and 14 years who are using the facilities provided by Iarnród Éireann from Waterford to Dublin each weekend to commute to schools for the deaf in Dublin City &mdash; St. Mary's in Cabra and a school in Stillorgan.  For the past number of years there has been a satisfactory arrangement in so far as third level students returning for the weekend have co-operated with the parents of those deaf children and have supervised them on the train.</P>
      <P>Recently some concern has been expressed by the National Association for the Deaf, and by the third level students who have been engaged in a supervisory role of those children, that the assumed responsibility could result in a certain liability in the event of an accident.  This has given rise to consideration of serious insurance matters.  I would like to establish whether the Department of Education have responsibility for the children while on board public transport and whether they will take steps to ensure that deaf children who, through no fault of their own, have to leave their own community to attend various schools in Dublin will be supervised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable that children between the ages of four and 14 years, who are suffering from a disability, should be unsupervised while travelling to and from Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that this matter is redressed because in the event of an accident the position of voluntary escorts would assume greater importance.  If the accident occurs the Department of Education will have no option but to assume <Col N="642" /> responsibility and to fund the escorting of those children to and from their place of education.  I look forward to the reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this case and I fully appreciate the difficulties encountered by some children with disabilities in travelling to special schools and classes and would be anxious to alleviate those difficulties as resources permit.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the Department provide transport for pupils to special schools and classes, or alternatively, a grant is made towards the cost of private transport arrangements, if official transport cannot be provided. Escorts are allowed to travel on special transport services where there is no additional cost involved and where there is spare capacity on a vehicle.  These escorts are usually child-care workers attached to special schools and carry out the duty as part of their job.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate pupils attending residential special schools, the Department make available transport vouchers which enable pupils to travel home at weekends on mainline rail and bus services. The successful operation of this service depends on degree of co-operation between parents, pupils and the school authorities.</P>
      <P>Members of the school staff bring pupils to the various stations and also collect them there each weekend.  I understand that older pupils act as escorts to younger pupils on the trains and buses and parents make the necessary arrangements to transport pupils to and from local points of departure.  However, I do not accept that this is a proper arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department have no scheme to provide financial assistance towards the cost of weekend travel passes for escorts. However, I will be considering whether additional measures are appropriate in the light of the report of the special education review committee, which is considering the range of support services required for children with disabilities.  I can assure the Deputy I am aware of this <Col N="643" /> case and will do all I can to have the matter resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to articulate on the school books scheme.  There is considerable confusion regarding the school book scheme.  I understand a new directive has been issued by the Minister for Education that only persons who receive clothing and footwear allowances will be eligible for the scheme.  There will be great difficulties with this scheme.  The idea behind this scheme is to make a financial saving in the Education Estimate this year.  The Department, and the Minister, ought to be involved in progressive rather than savings ideas.  We all want to see disadvantaged children given the best opportunities.  The only way they can better themselves is through a proper education.  If it involves hitting the disadvantaged people who do not have a voice, it is not a very worth-while scheme.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to re-examine the whole scheme in view of the fact that the old book scheme which was in existence for a number of years worked extremely well.  Most schools which operated the scheme were allowed to lend books at a nominal rate to the majority of pupils.  If the new scheme is brought into operation the number of children who will be allowed participate will be reduced considerably.  It will mean a financial cutback in education expenditure which is not a progressive step.  I request the Minister to revert to the old scheme. The only complaint made by school principal about the old scheme was that not enough finance was made available.  I ask the Minister to consider the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to explain the Department's school book scheme to the Deputy.  The present grant scheme for school books for needy pupils has been in operation since 1967 up to the present 1992-93 school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present scheme of aid in operation in primary schools towards the cost of <Col N="644" /> school textbooks is administered through the principal teachers of the schools who, subject to the amount of money made available to them annually, have discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted and in the extent of assistance to be given to each pupil.</P>
    <P>The Department decided to revise the arrangements for the allocation of grants to schools under the scheme to have effect from the 1993-94 school year.  The purpose of the changes are to ensure that funds are distributed equitably between schools and within schools and that available funds are directed towards those pupils who are most in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare operates a back to school clothing and footwear scheme with established criteria and systems for identifying children most in need of assistance.  Children who qualify for assistance under the back to school clothing and footwear scheme will be eligible for support under the revised school book grant scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain assistance under the new school book scheme, parents-guardians should present this certificate to the principal of the school attended by their children.  The type and level of the assistance would be determined by the principal in line with the nature of the scheme operated in each school and the relative cost of school books for the different standards.</P>
    <P>I accept that there will be situations where the principal will be aware of cases of real need where children have not qualified for support under the back to school clothing and footwear.  The principal will have discretion to respond to these cases within the overall grant allocated to the school.</P>
    <P>The amount of the grant will be determined by the number of pupils eligible for assistance under the back to school clothing and footwear scheme.  An advance of approximately 75 per cent of the grant will be paid to the school in the spring of 1993.  When the form confirming the number of eligible pupils is returned by the school to the Department in September, the balance of the grant will be paid.  Application forms and further <Col N="645" /> details will be sent to schools early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education have advised management authorities to implement, in co-operation with parents, a school policy which would ensure the efficient use of school books and minimise the cost for parents.  Circular M54/91, which was issued to schools in September 1991, advocated the operation of an appropriate loan-rental scheme in schools in which it was envisaged that pupils would be required to pay either the full economic rent, an appropriately subsidised rent or no rent in return for the use of school textbooks. Many schools already have such schemes in operation while other schools provide assistance to the parents of needy pupils by providing secondhand books or by reducing the cost of the books by a fixed amount or by the amount of the grant.  I am confident that the scheme for the 1993-94 school year, when in operation, will be very effective and efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of an extension for Glenamaddy national school, County Galway with the Minister of State at the Department of Education.  It is proposed to build two additional classrooms and rearrange two of the existing classrooms. Planning permission has been granted by Galway County Council for this work and a copy of the planning permission has been submitted to the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>The school in question is a five teacher school with 148 pupils.  Unfortunately, one of the classrooms is a prefabricated building which is in a very bad condition. The board of management have informed me that there is not adequate space for the children in the classrooms.  The old style seating is still being used in the school; they cannot use the new style seating necessary for implementing the new curriculum.  This is a very sad state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Health Board have issued a report on the school which states that the situation there is serious.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to get the <Col N="646" /> Department to give approval for this extension so that tenders can be invited and the contract placed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Alyward Mr. Alyward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alyward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to outline the present position in regard to the proposed extension of Glenamaddy national school, County Galway.</P>
      <P>The present accommodation at this school comprises four small classrooms and a prefabricated classroom which is being rented at present and which is grant-aided by the Department.  The staffing consists of a principal and four assistant teachers.  The average enrolment in September was 136.  Because of increasing enrolment it will be necessary to provide additional accommodation.  It is proposed to convert the existing small classrooms into two standard classrooms and to build two further standard-size classrooms.  The chairman of the board of management has been advised to discontinue the rental of the prefabricated classroom and to purchase it in lieu of an extra classroom.  This will also be grant-aided.</P>
      <P>Tender documents for the project are complete.  However, under the new building regulations it will be necessary for the chairman to obtain a fire safety certificate from the planning authority. The chairman has been advised in this regard by the Department.  Once the certificate has been received the question of the invitation of tenders will be considered in the light of the difficult budgetary position and the large number of projects in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that each national school authority seeking capital grants from the Department invariably make the case that their project deserves priority treatment.  My task and that of the Department is to allocate the available resources in any one year as fairly as possible to as many schools as possible, having regard to the overall constraints. The Deputy will also know that the allocation of the 1993 capital allocation is now under consideration in consultation with the Department of Finance.  Representations <Col N="647" /> have been made to the Minister for Education and myself regarding this school and the urgency of the situation has been consistently impressed on us.  It will not be possible to say when the tenders will be invited for this project until we know precisely what money will be available in 1993.  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that it is my intention that work on this project should commence at the earliest possible date, having due regard to the financial situation.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House and the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for sport will join with me in congratulating the Munster rugby team on their magnificent and historic win in Musgrove Park, Cork yesterday.  This win went a long way towards restoring our national pride in the game of rugby, which has been somewhat lacking in recent years.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the necessity for a new vocational school in Dungarvan, County Waterford.  I will preface my remarks by referring to the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question put down by me on 25 June 1992 in which I asked about his intentions regarding the provisions of a new vocational school for Dungarvan. He replied:</P>
      <P>The architectural planning of a new vocational school for Dungarvan was suspended in 1987 in the light of the declining demographic trend and its implications for future post primary enrolments in Dungarvan.  An application for the provision of temporary accommodation to meet short term needs at this school is currently being processed within my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out to the Minister that that school has gone forward in leaps and bounds since 1987 and, in particular, during the last year.  It is now one of the most outstanding schools in County Waterford.  The enrolment in the school is increasing significantly every year.  For example, there are 345 pupils in the school, an increase of 72, or 25 per cent <Col N="648" /> over last year's level.  That has been the trend in recent years.  It is not that long ago since there were barely 100 students in the school.  The school is totally out of date and inadequate to cater for the numbers attending it.  It should be borne in mind that many of these students would be regarded as disadvantaged in some ways &mdash; they would not attend schools which are regarded as high on the academic honours list.</P>
    <P>There is a young and brilliant staff in the school.  Through their work they have attracted an unprecedented number of students to the school.  The Government and the Department of Education should respond to their efforts by providing a new school for them.  This school, which dates back to the thirties, is totally inadequate. In addition to the main school building, there are a number of prefabricated classrooms.  This situation should not pertain in 1992; it can only get worse.  There is a site available.  The whole scene has changed in the past five years.  In view of the changing circumstances, I would ask the Minister to back up the staff and the children attending the school by making provision for funds for a new school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The vocational school is one of four post-primary schools in Dungarvan.  Enrolment in 1992 was 290. In 1981 the Department sanctioned the provision of a new building for the vocational school to cater for 225 pupils. At that stage there were five post-primary schools in Dungarvan.  In 1987 the architectural planning of a new vocational building was suspended in the light of the declining demographic trend and its implications for future post-primary enrolments in Dungarvan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, in the light of a renewed emphasis <Col N="649" /> on rationalisation of post-primary facilities talks were initiated with all the post-primary managements to see what rationalisation measures could be achieved.  As a result, the amalgamation took place in 1990 of the Mercy and Presentation secondary schools and one of the boys' schools, St. Augustine's, became co-educational.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years the Department have approved the provision of prefabricated classrooms at the vocational school as follows: 1990, four prefabricated classrooms; 1991, three prefabricated classrooms, and 1992, two prefabricated classrooms.  It is considered, therefore, that the accommodation needs of the school are adequately catered for at present.  In view of the Deputy's interest I will have the matter looked into.</P>

Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, tá sé beagnach ceithre bliana ó cuireadh plean forbartha an oileáin os comhair an phobail agus rinneadh é a lánsáil nuair a bhíomar uilig ar an oileán.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of a review of the School Books Scheme my Department have drawn up proposals to link the scheme with the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  Under the new arrangements it is proposed that the financial allocations to schools under the School Books Scheme will be based on the number of pupils in the school <Col N="531" /> who are beneficiaries under the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Scheme.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the operation of the revised scheme arrangements have been made for Community Welfare Officers to issue certificates of eligibility under the Clothing and Footwear Scheme to parents-guardians for children who benefit under that scheme.  My Department have asked School Principals to keep a record of the number of pupils for whom certificates of eligibility under the Clothing and Footwear Scheme in 1992 to support their future applications for grants under the School Books Scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Department of Social Welfare that certain parents-guardians who are at work benefit under the Clothing and Footwear Scheme depending on their incomes and the number of dependent children.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that School Principals will have discretion to give assistance within the resources which have been allocated to them under the School Books Scheme to children whom they consider to be in real need but who have not qualified for support under the Clothing and Footwear Scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the pre-service training of teachers, <Col N="532" /> the subject of bullying and how to deal with it is addressed as part of the primary teacher training course and in the courses leading to the Higher Diploma in Education.</P>
    <P>My Department issued a circular to the authorities of primary and post-primary schools containing <i>Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline for Primary and Post-Primary Schools.</i></P>
    <P>School authorities were reminded in that circular that the managerial authority of each school is responsible for ensuring that a fair and effective code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.</P>
    <P>My Department is anxious to ensure that school management authorities take positive action in this area and will bring to the attention of the relevant school management authority any complaint received with a view to having appropriate action taken by the school management to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The Child Abuse Prevention Programme, devised by the Eastern Health Board, and being implemented jointly between my Department and the Department of Health is specifically designed for use in primary schools and covers all forms of child abuse with particular attention to bullying.</P>
    <P>Its aim is to prevent child abuse by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced through discussion with their parents.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 44, 46 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on Education lays particular emphasis on the need for a broad general education for all to completion of senior cycle.  As part of the proposals to broaden the school curriculum it sets out a number of initiatives to develop curricula in the technical-technological areas.  Details of those proposals are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of a new subject, Enterprise and Technology which will be obligatory for all students initially in the junior cycle and extending to the senior cycle;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the expansion of the vocational-technical options available to students within the Vocational Leaving Certificate Programme with the intention of expanding the numbers of Leaving Certificate participants in that programme from its present 5 per cent to 30 per cent;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; the development of a programme of vocational education and training which will be broad based rather <Col N="535" /> than job specific aimed at promoting the achievement of high skill levels;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the provision, with EC support, of a network of technological centres to serve a variety of needs in each catchment area;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the development of vocational skill modules as part of the Leaving or Senior Certificate programme which would be coupled, wherever possible, with work experience. </P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these proposals, when implemented, will provide for greater opportunities for students to follow programmes in technical subjects.</P>

    <P>All teacher trainees in the Colleges of Education attend courses which are <Col N="537" /> University-accredited.  The structure and nature of these courses must be in accord with Government policy.  However the contents of these courses, while broadly similar in nature, vary in detail from College to College and are essentially a matter for the individual Colleges and accreditation authorities.  Tuition given to trainee teachers on dyslexia or specific reading disability is encompassed in general courses on reading problems, disabilities and remediation in the Colleges of Education and the number of hours devoted to individual topics in such courses is not separately identified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 71, 74 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the day-to-day running costs of primary schools are discharged by making funds available by means of the capitation grant scheme and the contribution from local sources. The capitation grant is not intended to meet the operating costs in full.  A location contribution towards school running costs equivalent to 25 per cent of the capitation grant must be lodged annually to each school bank account.</P>
      <P>I will be considering the existing rates of capitation grants to schools in the light of the results of the unit cost study which is being undertaken by my Department. For the future, the Green Paper envisages a standard budget system based on the costs per student.  As essential part of the preparation for this system is the study on recurrent costs already referred to above.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September, of the previous year.  The enrolment in St. Michael's, Cootehill on 30 September 1991 was 157 which warrants a staffing of Principal and four assistants for 1992/93.</P>
      <P>The only departure from this arrangement is in the case of the maximum class size guidelines set down by my Department being breached.  The distribution of classes in the current year may be organised among the present teaching staff so that no class is in breach of the maximum class size guidelines.</P>

      <P>In the case of primary schools the State pays a capitation grant which, taken together with a contribution from local sources, provides for free primary education.  The local contribution must be provided by the parish community or other analogous community or body from general funds and there must be no levy on parents of children attending the school.</P>
      <P>Similarly in the case of secondary schools the Department pays a capitation grant towards the running costs of the schools.  Voluntary contributions by parents are permissable under this arrangement provided it is made absolutely clear that there is no question of compulsion involved, and that no sanctions are imposed on pupils whose parents choose not to make such a contribution.</P>
      <P>In the case of Vocational, Community and Comprehensive Schools direct grants are made to the school management authorities towards the operating costs and, again, no fees can be levied on individual pupils.</P>

It is not clear that such an arrangement would be more beneficial from the point of view of cost, efficiency and effectiveness.  In the Green Paper, the possibility of provisions for substitution becoming part of the discretionary <Col N="560" /> school budget provision is raised.

      <P>The seamen referred to by the Deputy worked on ships flying the UK flag. Under EC law, they were required to pay social insurance contributions to the UK authorities.  The PRSI allowance was introduced to reduce the burden imposed by Irish social welfare law on employees who paid contributions to the social insurance fund at the high rates. As the seamen referred to in the question did not pay social insurance contributions under Irish law there was no basis for extending the PRSI allowance to them.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present treatment is equitable in that the availability of allowances to particular groups of workers is based on the possession by these workers of the relevant qualifying characteristics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of social insurance contributions being made to the UK Authorities, the seamen are not entitled to statutory redundancy payments from this State.  Accordingly the tax exempt status of statutory redundancy payments as provided for in section 37 of the Finance Act, 1968 is not applicable.  However, the seamen are entitled to the normal reliefs, allowances and deductions in computing the tax liability on loss of office payments. These include an exemption of between <Col N="566" /> £6,000 and £10,000 or standard capital superannuation benefit (SCSB) on lump sum payments and top slicing relief.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 110, 111 and 112 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards customs officers, the ultimate aim is to ensure that, to the greatest <Col N="567" /> extent possible, a career is provided for all Customs and Excise Staff in, or close to, their present location.</P>
    <P>On the question of assisting customs clearance agents to adapt to the single market EC support can be provided under three headings: the Social Fund, Interreg and measures outside the Structural Funds, which are the subject of a Regulation now before Council.</P>
    <P>The operations eligible for ESF support relate to training and job creation. As far as Interreg is concerned, the Commission has identified four specific areas</P>
    <P>&mdash;restructuring of the companies concerned</P>
    <P>&mdash;retraining and reorganisation of staff</P>
    <P>&mdash;adaptation of goods-handling sites at frontiers</P>
    <P>&mdash;the creation of replacement jobs </P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, the Commission has included a one-off budget heading of ECU 30 million in the draft Community Budget for 1993.  These resources are designed to provide assistance for the areas of the Community which are particularly dependent on customs clearance activity and to assist the companies most severely affected to maintain employment through diversification. The measures to assist these companies will include assistance in planning and restructuring, market research and technology transfer, co-financing of conversion investment, diversification and restructuring.  A draft Council Regulation to implement these measures is now under discussion.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour has applied for 30,000 ECU under a small EC Budget line in 1992 to provide information and advisory services for customs clearance staff.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with the Departments and State Agencies involved at end September, it was agreed that customs agents would liaise with FÁS in relation to <Col N="568" /> training/retraining proposals.  FÁS staff are currently in discussions with firms which could result in agents availing of existing FÁS programmes or courses being organised to meet specific needs of individuals and firms in this sector.  It was agreed also that proposals would be drawn up by the agents and discussed with the appropriate Stage Agencies for submission to the Commission under existing measures or the new ad hoc proposals.</P>

      <P>The matter of additional funding for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is kept under constant review in my Department.  As in the case of all public services, funding for criminal injuries compensation has to be allocated on the basis of requirement, competing demands for other services and for the limited financial resources available and the overall budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy would constitute legal advice.  It is outside the scope of my official functions to offer legal advice and I could not with propriety do so.  All I can say is that section 2 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, as amended by section 23 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, makes provision for the grant in certain circumstances of a new licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor for premises which had previously been licensed.</P>

      <P>In the organisation of school transport services, Bus Éireann plan routes in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of time-table, while, at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.  In order to do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to schools and, consequently, the necessary time-table often requires some pupils to make a relatively early start in the mornings or to wait for some time in the evenings. Every effort is made to ensure that pupils collected first in the morning are returned home on the first trip in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Such an arrangement applies in this case.</P>

      <P>Since 1990 my Department has made a special additional allocation available to the Eastern Health Board specifically for the development of orthodontic services and dental services for adult medical card holders and their dependants.  The special additional allocation provided in 1991 for this purpose was £862,500 and the Eastern Health Board's original allocation for 1992 includes a repeat of this special provision for the continuing development of the orthodontic services and the adult dental services.</P>
      <P>These special allocations will have enabled the board to provide over 12,000 adult dental treatments since 1990 and to clear waiting lists which then existed.  The level of service now being provided has generated an increased expectation and consequently demand.</P>
      <P>As a direct result of the additional funding the board have been able to provide 5,012 on-going or completed orthodontic treatments since 1990.  The Eastern Health Board are at present making arrangements for the shared appointment of consultant orthodontists with the Dublin Dental Hospital and the interviewing of candidates is due to be held this month.  In addition to their own direct clinical involvement, a primary task of the consultant orthodontist will be to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to specialist and sub specialist levels for health board dental staff to provide a greatly increased volume of service.</P>

    <P>There is a growing demand for each type of organ for transplant purposes; however, demand for donor kidneys is greatest.  The national organ donor card campaigns which have been organised by the Irish Kidney Association have had a significant influence on the number of organs which have been donated. Initially, only kidney donor cards were produced; however, the introduction of multi-donor cards has motivated the public to multi-organ donation and I understand that approximately 70 per cent of organ donations are now multi-donor i.e. heart, lung, kidneys, liver and eyes.  I am happy to inform the Deputy that my Department has provided a grant of £30,000 in both 1991 and 1992 from the health allocation of the national lottery proceeds towards the cost of these donor campaigns.  In addition, a donor awareness programme for health professionals is also provided by the Transplant Coordinator at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    <P>In 1991, the donor rate in Ireland was 21 per million of the population.  This compares with a figure for the USA of 18 per million and the United Kingdom of 15.1 per million of the population.</P>

      <P>I will shortly be making Regulations to implement Directive 91/441/EEC on measures against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles.  These Regulations will generally prohibit new cars and certain other new vehicles from entering into service on or after 1 January 1993 unless they conform to the emission standards of the Directive; in the case of petrol-engined vehicles these standards require that the vehicles should be equipped with catalytic convertors.</P>
      <P>Directive 92/53/EEC on motor vehicle type approval includes an &ldquo;end of series&rdquo; provision whereby member states may permit the entry into service of new vehicles whose type approval is no longer valid, subject to restrictions on the number of such vehicles and the time within which they may enter into service. The Society for the Irish Motor Industry has represented that a transitional exception of this kind should be embodied in the Regulations.</P>
      <P>I am at present finalising my consideration of the issues involved and will make an announcement shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 154 and 155 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Commission's requests (on dates which are substantially as cited) for information on these matters arose primarily from complaints made to them about a range of developmental and operational aspects of particular landfill sites in Ireland.  Since local authorities are responsible for waste management planning and control in their areas, it was necessary to consult the local authorities concerned on the extensive and detailed points raised in the Commission's letters. <Col N="594" /> Some of these points necessitated consultation also with other public sector interests in order to ensure a comprehensive response.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the Cregga disposal site, it was only necessary to obtain information from a single local authority, Roscommon County Council, and a reply to the Commission was duly issued in August, 1992.  This was to the effect that the Cregga site, which was selected from a number of sites for the disposal of charred meat from a major fire at a meat factory in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, was suitable for this purpose and that hydrogeological survey confirmed this.  The reply also detailed the various monitoring measures which have been put in place to ensure that surface and groundwaters are adequately protected from contamination.</P>
    <P>As regards the disposal sites at Moylaogh and Oldcastle, the request for information covered a wide range of issues which involved consultation with local authorities, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Department of Agriculture and Food.  All of the information requested has now been compiled and a response to the Commission will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>The Commission communication in relation to the treatment and disposal of asbestos in Ireland called for consultation with an even wider range of interests including Kildare and Laois County Councils, the Electricity Supply Board and the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, as well as the assembly of a considerable body of supporting documentation.  The requisite information is now available to my Department and a comprehensive reply will issue to the Commission in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the refusal of an application for a pro rata old age contributory pension from a person (details supplied) in County Dublin given that the applicant was intermittently in and out of insurance and eligibility from 1953 to 1968 as a direct consequence of the change of Government policy on this matter and given also that the applicant was not made aware of the changing situation either by his Department or his employer; if he will review this case with a view to (a) granting him credits for the periods in question and thus enable the pro-rata pension to be paid or (b) refunding the contributions made during this period.</Quest>

      <P>In order to qualify for a <i>prorata</i> (mixed insurance) old age contributory pension, an applicant must have a mixture of full-rate and modified rate contributions, that is, contribution rates payable through having been an employee in both the private sector and the public service.  The application by the person concerned for a <i>pro-rata</i> (mixed insurance) old age contributory pension was unsuccessful, as he paid standard rate insurance contributions only.  The mixed insurance provisions do not apply in his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a statutory earnings limit in force from 1912 to 31 March 1974 whereby a person was not compulsorily <Col N="603" /> insured when his or her earnings exceeded certain specified limits.  This limit increased by legislation from time to time.  It appears from gaps in the insurance record of the person concerned that his earnings may have been above the insurable limit intermittently during his employee career up to 1968.</P>
    <P>Special provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1988, to provide a pro-rata pension for people who were affected by the operation of the insurable income limit prior to 1974.  A condition of this arrangement was that people must have been in insurable employment at the time the income limit was abolished in April 1974.  The person concerned was not in insurable employment at that date and, therefore, is not eligible for a pension under these rules.</P>
    <P>Those affected by the earnings limit were free to become voluntary contributors, thereby maintaining entitlement to contributory pensions. According to the records of my Department, the person concerned paid voluntary contributions in 1966 and 1967 only.  He did not continue to contribute voluntarily when he became a selfemployed shopkeeper in 1968.  Consequently, his entitlement to old age contributory pension was not maintained.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to refund the pension element of his insurance contributions to the person concerned.  The only situation in which contributions can be refunded is where a person enters insurable employment or self-employment for the first time after reaching the age of 55 years.  The person concerned entered insurable employment many years prior to reaching this age.  Similarly, there is no legal basis for awarding credited contributions in respect of periods during which earnings exceeded the statutory upper earnings limit.</P>
    <P>I regret that the legislation does not allow a contributory pension to be paid to the person concerned.  However, it is open to him at any time to apply for an old age non-contributory pension by completing the appropriate application form.</P>

      <P>There are two statutory agencies under the control of my Department, namely the Pensions Board and the Combat Poverty Agency and women are well represented on them.  At the end of 1991 five out of 13 members of the Pensions Board were women, including the chairperson.  Most members of the board are representative of interest groups or organisations who nominate their own members.  Also at the end of 1991 six out of 12 members of the Combat Poverty Agency were women.</P>
      <P>In the filling of any vacancies on these agencies within my own discretion, full consideration will be given to the appointment of women, as it has been in the past.  Where nominating organisations are concerned I would expect them to do likewise.</P>
      <P>The non-statutory National Pensions Board, which preceded the Pensions Board is still in existence and is completing its final report to me on pension matters.  There is one woman on this board.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid a lump sum of £1,058.22 on 28 April 1992 arising from her dismissal on redundancy from her employment on 2 April 1992.  The lump sum was paid from the <Col N="605" /> social insurance fund as the employer in question had been put into receivership and was unable to pay.  According to the information submitted to my Department in connection with the claim, the amount paid represented the correct statutory entitlement under the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>
      <P>The amount of the statutory lump sum payment which a qualified redundant employee is entitled to receive is calculated as follows:</P>
      <P> (a)  a half week's pay for each year of employment continuous and reckonable between the ages of 16 and 41 years;</P>
      <P>(b)  a week's pay for each year of employment continuous and reckonable over the age of 41 years;</P>
      <P>(c)  in addition, the equivalent of one week's normal pay. </P>
      <P>At present, there is a ceiling of £250 on the gross weekly wages which may be taken into consideration when calculating the amount of statutory redundancy lump sum.</P>
