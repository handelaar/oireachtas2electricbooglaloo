      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 11, 2 and 8.  It is also proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, Nos. 11 and 2 shall be decided without debate, that the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. today and that the Minister or Minister of State at the Department of Health shall be called upon not later than 2 p.m. to reply to the debate on Second Stage of No. 8 and that proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 2.15 p.m.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 11 and 2 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. today agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 8 satisfactory and agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to No. 8, I am very unhappy with the idea that legislation which has been promised for two years and which has been on the Order Paper for a year is now to be put through by the Government in one day. This House is being treated as some form of legislation processing institution rather than a deliberative body where we are intended to improve legislation.  The House is being run like a badly managed <Col N="730" /> sausage factory rather than a place where Members elected by the people have an opportunity to contribute to the improvement of legislation proposed by the Government.</P>
      <P>I see little prospect of the Government going back on this proposed guillotine. I therefore propose an amendment to the Order of Business to at least ensure that as many Members as possible on both sides of the House are allowed to contribute to the debate.  I propose that after 2.15 p.m. the following words be added &ldquo;the speech of each Member called upon shall not exceed 15 minutes&rdquo;.  If that is agreed a larger number of Members will have an opportunity to speak than would be the case if the initial contributors were allowed to monopolise the time.  While I object fundamentally to the entire procedure I make that proposal <i>faute de mieux.</i></P>

      <P>Two weeks ago I anticipated that exactly what Deputy Bruton is saying would be said every morning on the Order of Business until the summer recess.  In his absence, this Bill was described here as something that was written in five minutes, which could be debated in five minutes and could be got rid of.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, my purpose in rising is to ask the Taoiseach, in relation to the proposed visit of the President to this House today, if he could explain to the House why his Government are treating my party differently in terms of representation on the reception visit from the way in which the Progressive Democrats are being treated.  They also have six Members?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy, and Members, will agree that the Chair, and his predecessors, have striven most earnestly to keep the incumbent of the Office of President out of controversy on the floor of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>I fully accept what the Chair says in relation to keeping the Office of President out of a controversy in this House.  I do not intend to embroil her in any controversy but I have an obligation to defend the rights of my party.  On the basis of precedent, I believe I am entitled to be present in the reception group welcoming the President to this House on this historic occasion. My party have six Deputies, as indeed do the Progressive Democrats, whose leader will be in the reception group.  On previous occasions, in 1987 and in 1988 when I was a member of The Workers' Party, our leader was present in such reception <Col N="733" /> committees and at that stage we had only four Deputies.  The present action is a gross attempt at pettiness and discourtesy to a party of this House and I appeal to the Taoiseach to change his mind at this late stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Any remarks I will make on this subject have to do with the internal business of this House. Obviously, the House can make a decision which supersedes that of any committee.  On behalf of my party, I am perfectly agreeable to Deputy De Rossa being involved with the other party leaders in any reception arrangements that are made for visitors to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the Labour Party position on this matter quite clear yesterday and that has not changed.  It would be in order if Deputy De Rossa were present on the reception line and, certainly, if this were the case it would have saved us a great deal of silly hassle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> We will finish this session on Friday. Will the Taoiseach indicate if there will be an opportunity to have a discussion in this House or a briefing for the party leaders on the talks that are taking place in London?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last week, I want to ensure in so far as I can the confidentiality of those talks, as they are very sensitive.  I know the party leaders appreciate that and I appreciate the manner in which they have approached this matter up to now.  May I repeat again that I will keep them informed of developments as they take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>In their joint Programme for Government the Government promised to introduce legislation that would apply to companies in general, and State companies in particular, to include provisions that company directors and any persons involved in the management or control of companies would be required to disclose direct or indirect personal interests in the company's business and imposing new penalties for nondisclosure of such interests.  Would the Taoiseach indicate the position in regard to this promised legislation and the Minister responsible for its preparation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the bottom of page 19 and the top of page 20 of the joint Programme for Government, which I believe he was involved in negotiating with the other party forming the Government, which clearly states, &ldquo;legislation will be introduced on this subject&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that legislation is being introduced, and if so, the Minister involved or if this part of the joint Programme for Government is now null and void?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="740" /> move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to bring this legislation before the House.  It is an issue which has been the subject of much debate for some time and one which I felt needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The legislation is required urgently for two reasons.  First and most importantly, for public health reasons and, second, to bring our family planning legislation more in line with current public mores and thinking.</P>
      <P>I would like to outline why the measures in this Bill are necessary for public health reasons, in particular as a means to tackle the problem of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS. As the House will know, HIV-AIDS is a relatively new disease, being recognised as a specific entity only within the last ten years and it was only in 1985 that laboratory testing for the HIV virus became possible.  There are a number of well-recognised risk factors associated with the spread of the disease of which the two most common in Ireland are intravenous drug abuse and unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years almost 1,250 people have tested positive for the HIV virus in this country, 276 people have developed full-blown AIDS, according to the internationally accepted definition, and 114 people have died.  It is very probable &mdash; indeed, almost certain &mdash; that the pool of infection in this country is much larger than that reflected in these official statistics.  For a variety of reasons, a number of people who have engaged in high-risk behaviour do not come forward for testing.  In addition, because of the international mobility of people, particularly between here and the UK, people who will have had positive tests in other countries and are now resident in this country may not feature in the official statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of paramount importance that the spread of the HIV infection is curtailed, and a range of recommendations have been made by the National Aids Strategy Committee towards this end.  These <Col N="741" /> recommendations have been accepted by me and are being implemented.  They include broadly based public education programmes together with specific initiatives aimed at targeted sub-groups who are considered to be at particular risk.  Coupled with these educational strategies, however, must be the recognition that people will continue to be sexually active and that further practical measures need to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease.  It is universally recognised that a good quality condom, properly used, does provide significant protection against the transmission of the virus.  The wider availability of this protective measure must be seen, therefore, as a practical and sensible contribution to the prevention of its spread.</P>
    <P>Similarly with other sexually transmitted diseases, the network of sexually transmitted diseases clinics set up over the past few years in areas such as Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick, report an increasing number, of young people particularly, using their services for advice, counselling, diagnosis and treatment. Between 1986 and 1990 notification to the Department of Health of STDs such as gonorrhoea, herpes genitalis, non-specific urethritis, chlamydia, syphilis, trichomonas in all have shown a 45 per cent increase.  In St. James's Hospital alone the numbers attending STD clinics have risen from 9,755 in 1988 to 13,758 in 1991.  While many STD infections, unlike HIV-AIDS, are amenable to treatment and cure, diseases such as gonorrhoea can have devastating long term effects such as sterility and infertility and are, therefore, not only a cause for public health concern but a source of tragedy and despair for many individuals and couples.</P>
    <P>From a purely medical and public health point of view, the prevention of transmission of these diseases is a matter of serious concern not only to my Department, but also to the wider community. The wider availability of condoms, coupled, of course, with educational initiatives, has a major role to play in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>The Bill also updates to a very considerable <Col N="742" /> extent many of the provisions of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979, which itself was amended somewhat by the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985.  The 1979 Act was designed in its time to deal in an acceptable and responsible way with a problem which had already been a matter of debate for some years and had culminated in a Supreme Court decision which involved a fundamental change in the law relating to the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>The Government in 1979 decided to avail of the opportunity, when introducing legislation made necessary by the Supreme Court decision, to legislate also for a full family planning service.  It made provisions, <i>inter alia</i>, for: the orderly organisation of family planning services and the provision of a comprehensive natural family planning service; the making available by health boards of a family planning service, which, I might add, was defined as a service for the provision of information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to any one or more of the following: family planning, contraception and contraceptives; the sale of contraceptives in certain chemists' shops to persons named in a prescription or authorisation given by a registered medical practitioner.  The doctor had to be of the opinion, in giving the prescription, that the contraceptives were being sought for the purpose, bona fide, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances. The doctor had to indicate this on the prescription.  The Act also made provisions regarding the licensing of importers and manufacturers of contraceptives; the advertising and display of contraceptives and the funding of research into certain methods of contraception.</P>
    <P>The 1979 Act was seen at that time as an appropriate legislative initiative, given that it set out a structure for the organisation of family planning services and introduced controls considered necessary at the time with regard to the sale of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Regulations made in 1980 required <Col N="743" /> health boards to make available a family planning service and indicated the requirements to be met in relation to family planning services provided by other bodies.  They dealt with the issuing of prescriptions and authorisations for contraceptives, their importation and their advertising and display.</P>
    <P>The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act was introduced in 1985.  It amended the 1979 Act by extending the right to sell contraceptives to doctors, employees of health boards, licensed family planning clinics, maternity hospitals and hospitals providing services for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.  The Act provided that condoms and spermicides could be sold without prescription to persons over 18 years of age from the specified outlets.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it was agreed that the operation of the family planning services will be kept under review in association with relevant organisations.  In view of this and the significant rise in the incidence of sexually transmissible diseases and of the incidence of AIDS here the Government in 1991 applied themselves to formulating legislation to provide for greater availability of condoms while at the same time respecting the concerns of many groups and individuals, not least parents.</P>
    <P>This led to the publication of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill in July last year.  This Bill provided for (i) an increase in the range of outlets permitted to sell condoms and certain spermicidal preparations; (ii) a reduction in the age limit at which persons could buy condoms and certain spermicides, without prescription, from 18 years to 17 years; and (iii) the removal of the anomaly whereby pharmacies which were limited companies were legally prohibited from selling contraceptives.  It provided that condoms could be sold without prescription or authorisation provided that (i) the purchaser was over the age of 17 years; (ii) the vendor was <Col N="744" /> over the age of 18 years; (iii) the sale was not by way of vending machine and (iv) the sale was either from one of the existing approved outlets selling all contraceptives, that is pharmacies, family planning clinics, hospitals and so on or from a premises registered by a health board.  The Bill provided that if, on the application of an owner or occupier of a premises, a health board were satisfied as to the suitability of the premises for the sale of condoms and certain spermicides, then they could approve the premises for such sales.  It also provided that each health board would be required to establish and maintain a register of such premises.</P>
    <P>Where a person was convicted of an offence under the Bill, or where the health board considered that his premises was no longer suitable for the sale of condoms and certain spermicides they could withdraw their approval and remove his name from the register.  The particular provisions with regard to the role of the health boards attracted considerable comment of which I do not need to remind the House.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed Minister for Health I indicated that one of my priorities would be the fight against AIDS.  In the short term I have been in office I have overseen the completion of a set of recommendations from the National AIDS Strategy Committee and provided funds for their implementation.  I would like to take this opportunity to formerly record my appreciation of the work done by the National AIDS Strategy Committee. Their recommendations underpinned my own views with regard to many of the initiatives which are required to deal effectively with the transmission of the disease, including the need to take action to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS through sexual contact.</P>
    <P>I very quickly looked carefully at the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1991, to ensure that it dealt adequately with the serious public health problems and, as I said earlier, in the context of bringing the provisions of the 1979 Act more into line with current <Col N="745" /> thinking and practice in so far as family planning issues, <i>per se</i>, are concerned.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns which the Government had last year in bringing forward the 1991 Bill and I have retained many features of it in the present Bill.  I have always felt, however, from my own experience and in the light of views which have been expressed since it was published, that a number of changes in this Bill were necessary.  I am very pleased to acknowledge the full support which I have received from the Government with regard to this issue.  It has been accorded priority attention because of the major public health issues at stake and of the Government's concern that all action be taken to tackle the spread of HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>I intend to take the House through the Bill section by section but at this stage I would like to signal the main changes which I have introduced to the 1991 Bill.</P>
    <P>First, I have removed the provisions with regard to spermicides.  In the 1991 Bill it was intended that condoms and certain spermicides would be widely available without prescription.  This provision had followed from the 1985 Act which, as I outlined earlier, had allowed condoms and spermicides to be sold to persons over 18 years of age.  The decision in 1985 was taken in the context of the desirability of using spermicides with certain condoms for contraceptive purposes.  Spermicides, however, have no prophylactic effect other than as contraceptives. They do not prevent the spread of sexually transmissible diseases. In fact I would be concerned that were they to be used mistakenly for such purposes they could lead to the transmission of such diseases, including AIDS.  The Bill provides, therefore, that spermicides will in future come within the definition of a medical preparation to be governed by the provisions of the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in section 3, I am dropping the requirement that doctors must indicate on a prescription that a contraceptive is for the purposes, bona fide, of family planning.  This provision originated in the 1979 Act when entirely different considerations prevailed.  It is no longer considered appropriate to <Col N="746" /> retain this requirement.  I will return to this issue on Committee Stage when I will be tabling technical amendments.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I have lowered the age limit for the purchase of all contraceptives to 17 years and have eliminated the requirement that married couples should have to obtain a prescription to buy contraceptives. I have made provisions, therefore, in section 3 to exempt them from the prescription requirement.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, I have dropped the role proposed for the health boards from the Bill. I have considered the background to the decision last year to provide for a registration system involving the boards.  I can appreciate the concerns which led to that decision but I have come firmly to the conclusion that if we are to make condoms, which are not medical devices, more freely available we must have the least possible amount of red tape.  Section 3 clearly sets out those places which may not sell condoms.  Consequently any place not excluded may sell them if the proprietor so wishes.  There is, therefore, no need for a registration system as it will be clear from the outset where condoms may be sold.  I would hope that Deputies will agree with this approach but, as I said, we cannot hope to see greater availability of these prophylactics unless we have the minimum bureaucratic involvement.</P>
    <P>A further change which I have made to the 1991 Bill involves the requirement that importers and manufacturers of condoms should hold a licence from the Minister for Health.  I do not see this as necessary.  Instead of requiring that importers and manufacturers of condoms hold ministerial licences I am introducing a provision, in section 3, which enables me to prescribe standards for contraceptives. It will be illegal to supply contraceptives which do not comply with these standards.  This is a very important provision which was not in the 1991 Bill. If we are to make condoms more widely available we must ensure that the public is provided only with quality products. There is no EC standard for condoms yet but the issue is being considered in Brussels.  There are, however, internationally <Col N="747" /> recognised standards such as the BSI and I will be looking at these with a view to introducing regulations at an early date.  I am anxious to hear the views of all Members on this very important Bill which aims to make condoms more freely available.  However, I have had to take into account the concerns of parents, who may be a minority, but we must remember that we have a duty to protect minorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of a Bill to deal with our family planning laws.  However, this latest attempt by the Government to amend the legislation is a disappointment.  The Government have not seriously faced up to the reality of the public health issues involved, on which the Minister eloquently touched in the course of his contribution.</P>
      <P>As parents, we all, rightly, want to pass on moral standards to our children and it is not desirable that young people should engage casually in sexual relationships. Our health education programmes should support the efforts of parents in regard to this task.  A society that loses sight of the values of responsible sexuality is building up huge problems for itself.  However, it is folly to think that criminal law can be an effective tool in promoting responsible sexual behaviour. It is that error which undermines the Minister's approach.</P>
      <P>It is an established fact that young people are becoming sexually active at a younger age in Ireland today, thereby exposing themselves to risks which were never contemplated by their parents' generation.  Many young girls face the hardship of unwanted pregnancies and many have taken the sad, lonely passage to Britain to procure an abortion.  Young people are exposed to the risks of sexually transmissible diseases and, as the Minister rightly pointed out, the huge and growing threat of AIDS is the greatest of those risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> However regretful we may feel about the responsibility of the changed attitudes to sexual behaviour, we cannot ignore the clear indications for public health policy.  However strongly we may feel about their responsibility of engaging in casual sexual relationships, we cannot but feel even more strongly about the irresponsibility of engaging in such relationships without protection, people thereby exposing themselves and their partners to enormous risks.</P>
    <P>The Government today are insisting on an age limit which I believe the Minister knows is unenforceable.  Indeed, this age limit could have a counter-productive effect.  It could well be interpreted as suggesting that the State takes a different attitude to responsible sexual behaviour once people go over the age of 17.  The Government insist that in no circumstances can condoms be sold from vending machines.  If the Minister truly recognised the very real public health risks involved, which he described today, he would want to see those who are sexually active protecting themselves and their partners.  He will know that purchasing contraceptives and condoms is an extremely personal matter.  The wall of embarrassment which the Minister proposes to put up in this legislation is a far more powerful barrier than any prohibition he might issue.  If those who are engaging in casual sexual relationships are to avail of protection, vending machines should be permissible in places where there are already legal restrictions on young people congregating, such as pubs and adult discotheques.</P>
    <P>Sad to say, the Minister has also missed an opportunity to embrace the far wider reform needed in our family planning laws which contain provisions that can only be described as sectarian.  He should have recognised the obligation of the State to provide a full family planning service not confined to natural family planning as the law now makes it.  He should have recognised equally that the State should be supporting research that goes far beyond natural family planning methods.  These are major public health <Col N="749" /> issues for women today, and the Minister has missed an opportunity.</P>
    <P>At the outset we should recognise what our task as legislators is.  It is not to choose between any sets of moral beliefs nor is it to use criminal law to try to police any moral code.  Our role is much humbler than that.  We have to make decisions in the interests of the public good in a very imperfect world where people may subscribe to different moral beliefs and where many people lapse from the standards they set for themselves. As legislators we have responsibility to protect the rights of individuals to exercise their personal rights in freedom in a context that protects the overall public good.  As parents we all want to pass on our standards to our children and we in this House must make greater efforts to support this.  We need much more investment in teaching responsible sexual attitudes.</P>
    <P>The churches, too, have a clear pastoral role to play on their own part.  In advocating a law that makes condoms more widely available our party have no desire to see teenagers becoming involved in sexual relationships at young ages.  Such a law is not giving endorsement to casual sexual behaviour.  Indeed, one of our worries about the notion of an age limit is that it is much more likely to be interpreted by young people as an endorsement of different sexual attitudes once you reach the age of 18.  We do not want to create a situation where people who have reached the age of 18 are thought to have been given an official licence.</P>
    <P>It would be a mistake for the Minister to exaggerate the role of law in the changing sexual attitudes that have developed in Ireland.  As he knows, up to 1935 there was no law restricting condoms in Ireland, but Ireland could not have been described as a centre of promiscuity. There has been a dramatic change in sexual attitudes in the last 30 years, I believe despite, not because of, our attempts to restrict that by legislation.  To quote the late Professor John Kelly when he spoke in this House: &ldquo;We may be winching down the gates faster than the <Col N="750" /> waters are building up on the outside&rdquo;, as he described our efforts in 1985 to amend the legislation.  It is clear at this stage that the waters have built up and are washing over our very outdated legislation.</P>
    <P>Young people today face enormous pressures and hazards.  We cannot overlook those dramatic changes in sexual attitudes and sexual behaviour in the world in which this generation is growing up.  It is established that young people are becoming sexually active in younger and younger age groups.  This is a serious source of worry at many levels.  The Minister will know that last year over 2,000 babies were born to unmarried teenage mothers.  I have no doubt that these children have brought great joy into their young mothers' lives.  However, for many of those mothers it may have destroyed the opportunity of making full use of their young lives.  All too often the evidence is there that they and their young children slip into serious deprivation.  Last year also over 4,000 young mothers are recorded as having crossed to the UK to have their pregnancies terminated and 700 of these were in their teens.  This was something not lightly undertaken and for all of them has been a deep personal tragedy.</P>
    <P>Last year also 800 new cases were reported to the clinics for dealing with sexually transmitted diseases and those figures are well known to seriously underestimate the true position.  The greatest and most menacing threat is the explosive growth in the HIV virus.  As the Minister has stated today, official estimates put these figures at 1,250 but most commentators believe the true figures are at least two or three times that level.  If present growth rates continue we could see levels of this virus reaching 20,000 by the end of the decade.  However strongly we feel about changed sexual attitudes, these risks I have just described are of such enormous stature that we cannot but feel much more strongly about young people engaging in relationships without the protection they should be providing for themselves and their partners.  It is of enormous importance that young people <Col N="751" /> who engage in casual sexual relationships protect themselves and the means to do so must be available when and where they will be availed of.  I do not believe the Minister's efforts today will achieve that.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot delude ourselves into thinking that liberalising legislation &mdash;I hope the Minister will take on board amendments from the Opposition &mdash; is an adequate response to the growing problems I have described.  Young people are coming under pressure from their peers to engage in casual sexual relationships at very young ages and their ability to deal with this pressure and to resist sexual involvement before they are ready to make a positive choice is directly related to their understanding of their own sexuality.  Sad to say, our education system has not got to grips with the need to equip our young people to cope in this vital area of their lives.  Education must impart to young people a self-respect and a respect for one another in their sexual relationships.  It must give them the confidence to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in an increasingly macho world.  A proper programme of action in this area is a vital factor in the sort of legislation I hope we will adopt when this debate is over.</P>
    <P>Some people say the availability of condoms will encourage people, who would not otherwise have done so, to engage in sexual relationships.  It would appear that the Minister has taken to heart representations along those lines which he says he has got in enormous volume.  Maybe because of more liberal legislation a small minority of people will become sexually active who might not otherwise have done so.  However, we cannot accept that the preventable tragedy on the scale of HIV, or any of the other threats, should be the price that has to be paid by some individuals in order to get other people to behave responsibly.  That whole thinking about the way in which we should approach this issue is flawed.  The Minister should have taken the trouble to explain to those people who are making representations to him the scale of the public health risks <Col N="752" /> involved and the alternative approach we must adopt if we want young people to have responsible attitudes.  We must instil in our young people a sense of responsibility in sexual matters.  Having done so, we must trust them to make their own decisions and not hope that shopkeepers can act as sentries, policing responsible behaviour.</P>
    <P>The credibility of what the Minister is suggesting is coming under strain and has been the case of hilarity in the newspapers, especially in regard to the idea of people going into pubs or discos and asking for a packet of condoms and a pint of plain.  There is a serious credibility gap.</P>
    <P>The greatest barrier to using the protection which the Minister says should and must be used in a public health context is embarrassment.  People will not feel happy buying condoms in that context. I believe the Minister shares that view.  We are looking at a law which the Minister hopes will not be enforced.  He hopes people will not take seriously the age limit and that sales will not be confined to over-the-counter mechanisms where ages can be scrutinised.  If that is his approach and that of the Government, the former Deputy John Kelly's description of the attitude of the present Government party in 1985 still holds.  He said the 1985 Bill was designed to permit the Government to sit smugly back with its hands folded over its stomach and say, &ldquo;we have done our duty by the young people of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is not a true attempt to address this issue.  The successive efforts of this House to reform family planning laws do not constitute a proud record.  There are still elements of our family planning laws which cannot but be described as sectarian. Many of the elements of the old 1979 Act will remain intact after the passage of this legislation.  The Minister remains obliged only to provide for natural family planning.  His responsibility in relation to other services is merely to secure their orderly organisation. These sections have been used to limit public funds to family planning clinics which provide a comprehensive <Col N="753" /> range of services.  While under section 9 of the Act, grants for research are confined to natural planning which is of enormous importance in promoting public health, women have a right to proper advice on the alternative methods.  There should be a duty on the State to provide such service and to gather information and research that can improve the quality of services and advice to women.</P>
    <P>There is another part of the 1979 Act which is an anachronism.  Advertisements are deemed indecent if they refer to sexually transmitted diseases, complaints relating to sexual intercourse or to the removal of irregularities in menstruation. How can this sort of restriction on information be defended by the Minister? This Bill is a sad disappointment. We will not oppose it on Second Stage but we will put forward amendments on Committee Stage which I hope the Minister will accept in a positive spirit.</P>

      <P>The last time this issue was debated in Dáil Éireann was seven years ago.  Most Members will recall the debate which concerned a Bill published by my party colleague, the then Minister for Health, Mr. Barry Desmond.  The principal provision of that Bill was to remove the requirement of a doctor's prescription for the purchase of condoms and to allow them to be purchased by people over the age of 18.  It was a modest provision, little more than an attempt to introduce some measure of rationality into the law of the land promoted by one of his predecessors as Minister for Health, Deputy Charles Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was published on 7 February 1985 the then Archbishop of Dublin strongly criticised it, saying it would lead to premarital sexual activity, moral decline, increased incidence of venereal disease, teenage pregnancies, illegitimate births and abortions. Throughout the Second Stage debate in 1985 there was an atmosphere of considerable political tension.  It was a time for either standing by the Republic or by strongly expressed religious and moral convictions.  It was also a time for some of the most cynical and opportunistic posturing <Col N="754" /> by a political Opposition in the history of this Chamber.  The result of the debate was anxiously awaited by the people and, despite the strong and often scurrilous debate waged by the then Opposition inside and outside this House, the Bill was narrowly passed by 83 votes to 80.</P>
    <P>In a real sense the publication of this Bill says something too.  If passed in its present form, it will say that the seven years which have elapsed have not really informed us and that we as legislators in 1992 are still out of touch with the needs, attitudes and values of the people we are sent here to represent.  The truth is that people have stopped listening to this Chamber and have gone about living their lives according to the standards they are setting for themselves.  This Bill pretends to be about family planning.  That alone makes it a Bill that does not matter to the lives of many people.  People who want to plan their families will not look to the leadership of this House.  They will get on with their lives and decide that the matter is a private one for themselves and their spouses.</P>
    <P>The issue that does matter is the spread of a killer disease, and that is what the Bill should be about.  It fails that test also at the very first hurdle.  One has only to read the definition section to realise that for the first time in any Irish legislation the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; is being expressly widened to include condoms or contraceptive sheaths, as they are quaintly called in the Bill.  From now on in Irish law, should this Bill be enacted, a condom will be defined as being for the prevention of pregnancy &mdash; it is a contraceptive, not a prophylactic.  This is patently absurd.  It alone makes the Bill a laughing stock.  We will be the only country in the western world whose legislators have refused to recognise the prophylactic properties of a condom, which should be our main objective in the battle against AIDS.</P>
    <P>Suspicions may arise in some minds that there may be an ulterior motive. The Virgin Megastore case in many ways emphasised the need for this Bill.  In that case the defendants argued unsuccessfully <Col N="755" /> that condoms were on sale as part of the fight against the spread of infectious diseases, particularly HIV and AIDS.  The new definition strengthens the argument against the prophylactic use of condoms.  This definition will give rise to further controversy in the future.  In some European countries and in the United States there is on the market a new product, a female condom known as a femadom.  Undoubtedly, it will be made available some time in this country.  How is it to be regarded in the eyes of the law if this Bill is enacted?  It is not a sheath, an oral medicine or an intra-uterine device.  This is a good example of the failure of this legislation to address the realities which confront the people.</P>
    <P>The Bill is absurd in other ways. Section 6 reclassifies oral contraceptives and makes them subject to section 65 of the 1947 Health Act which enables the Minister for Health to make regulations covering the sale and distribution of these products.  Section 66 of the 1947 Act gives the Minister very wide-ranging powers to ban any or all products, including medical preparations.  It is a section that I believe has only been used once to ban tobacco products, chewing or oral tobacco.  It is believed that it was originally inserted in the 1947 Act because of a conviction in certain circles at the time that it would be necessary to persuade a Minister for Health to ban the use of tampons if they were introduced into Ireland.</P>
    <P>A section inserted for that purpose is now capable of application by way of regulation to any oral contraceptive or, as the Bill makes clear, any preparation which can be used for the regulation of the menstrual cycle.  It could be used, for example, by any Minister for Health who may decide that he wants to ban an oral contraceptive and forbid the sale of it in Ireland because it might be construed as being an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>As I said, Ministers will have the power to ban oral contraceptives under the terms of this Bill.  This is legislative hypocrisy and it will be seen as such by the great majority, particularly of the young people, whose cynicism concerning <Col N="756" /> politics we deplore but whose cynicism we encourage by enacting legislation such as this.  It is not the first time that Fianna Fáil in particular have deployed cynicism in relation to this issue.  Who said the following:</P>
    <P>A contraceptive society requires abortion as a fail-safe and that, if we were going to have obtaining a widespread liberal situation in so far as contraceptives were concerned, we would also have to place ourselves in the position of providing abortion as a backup to that service.  Any society that has widespread contraceptives available is an anti-life society and it would be in contravention of the stated aims of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The speaker was the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, who was contributing to the debate on the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1985, introduced by former Deputy, Mr. Barry Desmond, as reported in the Official Report of 20 February 1985, column 359.  In the next column the same Deputy went on to suggest that contraception had a detrimental effect on veneral disease and that there were statistics available to back up that statement.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of his speech that Deputy said that the Bill, &ldquo;would constitute official recognition and give respectability to the use of contraceptives by all and sundry leading inevitably to permissiveness among the young.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If his fears for the future moral wellbeing of the young people were considerable then, he must be quaking in his shoes at the prospect of what will ensure from this legislation.  However, he was not alone in 1985 in forecasting the direst of consequences in relation to the modest reform that was proposed.  For example, his colleague, former Deputy Seán McCarthy, described that Bill as contemptible, reprehensible and of showing an appalling lack of judgment. Former Deputy Gene Fitzgerald told the House that the free availability of contraceptives to teenagers hits directly at the family unit which is the main support <Col N="757" /> of society.  Deputy Michael Kitt described the Bill as likely to undermine the values of young people.  Deputy Tunney suggested that the Minister for Health had a personal vested interest in the legislation, and Deputy Noel Treacy accused the Minister of shunning his responsibility to promote natural family planning methods.</P>
    <P>However, the <i>pièce de résistance</i> came from the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Health at the time, Deputy O'Hanlon, who went on to have a long career as Minister for Health.  In a long contribution he never used the word &ldquo;condom&rdquo; but in the course of his speech in 1985 he described his party as &ldquo;the Republican Party, representing all opinions with no particular sectional interest, a mature political party&rdquo;.  He then went on to say that the 1985 Bill would make contraceptives freely available to any teenager and he warned, &ldquo;it is not possible to enforce the age limit. There is nothing to stop a young girl of 15 or 16 years of age going into a chemist shop wearing high heeled shoes and asking for contraceptives&rdquo;.  In short, he concluded that, &ldquo;if this legislation is passed we in this House will be endorsing a pattern of behaviour which no responsible adult would condone&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I greatly regret the truncation of the debate and I expressed that view last night.  To limit the time to 15 minutes for each Deputy's contribution on a Bill of this importance is too short.  I wish to say much more but I will reserve my contribution for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have a duty to represent all sections of opinion in our society, not one particular ethos, but to represent everybody.  As a principle we should involve ourselves as legislators as little as possible in the lives of people and only when it is necessary. The Bill that we would wish to have before us would seek not to impose arbitrary, unenforceable age limits for the availability of condoms but, instead, would facilitate the widest possible availability of condoms to people who are sexually active.  The Bill we would wish to see implemented would make it legal rather than illegal to disseminate information <Col N="758" /> through advertising and other means about the efficacy of condoms in the struggle against AIDS and would set out to supplement such information with a proper and non-moralistic programme of education.</P>
    <P>The Bill that we need would remove restrictions on vending machines and the difficulties already described in relation to the purchase of condoms.  Unfortunately, this Bill is flawed in many ways. We will, however, support the Bill on Second Stage in the hope that between now and tomorrow the Minister will reflect on all that has been said by the Opposition Deputies and on his own feelings in this matter.  When Committee and Report Stages conclude tomorrow I hope we will have a Bill that is in keeping with the times and that does not seek to be a throwback to a time long forgotten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to participate in the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  My colleague, Deputy O'Connell, the Minister for Health, has set out the background to, and the rationale for, the Bill.  As he has indicated to the House, the Bill is a pragmatic, appropriate and balanced approach to the wider availability of condoms, in particular in the context of HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmissible diseases.</P>
      <P>The Bill is primarily a response to these issues which continue to present problems to individuals, the community and the health services.  AIDS was identified as a clinical entity in 1981 and diagnosed cases have been reported to the Department of Health since 1982.  Serological surveillance of the disease became possible in 1985 and was initiated in Ireland on a voluntary, linked basis in September 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The epidemiological development of AIDS and HIV in Ireland is similar to that experienced in other western European countries.  From 1982 to 1985 cases were reported in homosexuals and haemophiliacs and the condition was seen as a largely imported disease.  When seroprevalence monitoring became possible <Col N="759" /> in 1985 it was apparent that the HIV virus was indigenous in the country and that a particular problem existed in relation to the spread of HIV infection in intravenous drug abusers.</P>
    <P>To date we have 276 reported cases of AIDS which meet the CDC/WHO definition.  Some 1,223 people have tested HIV positive.  The percentage of intravenous drug-related cases is now 39.5 per cent of all cases as compared to 10.5 per cent in 1986.  This movement of the epidemic towards the drug abuser has been accompanied by a steady increase in the number of heterosexual cases. Some 9 per cent of Irish cases are heterosexual. In 1986 we had no heterosexual cases in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Positive tests are reported by the virus reference laboratory to the Department of Health each year.  Of these, the number of heterosexual cases which have tested positive is increasing steadily.  In 1986, 21 HIV positive heterosexual cases were reported.  Since then, the numbers have increased to 148 cases to date. Interestingly, the number of tests carried out on heterosexuals has trebled between 1985 and 1992, increasing from 7,638 to 20,850.  It is not unreasonable to conclude from these figures that there is a movement of the disease away from the groups traditionally considered to be most at risk of contracting the infection to the wider community.  In addition, using the heterosexual figures as an indicator, it would appear from the statistics regarding the numbers tested than an increasing number of heterosexuals are considering themselves to have been at risk of contracting the infection.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated, the figures in respect of other sexually transmitted diseases also support the need for wider availability of condoms.  The numbers of attendances at the genito-urinary medicine clinic at St. James's Hospital have increased considerably over the past few years.  In 1988 a total of 9,755 attendances took place.  This increased to over 13,000 in 1990 and 1991.</P>
    <P>The new cases of sexually transmitted diseases notified to the Department of <Col N="760" /> Health under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981 also show an increase from 2,891 in 1986 to 4,189 in 1990. Clearly, the framework for the availability of condoms provided under the 1979 and 1985 Acts needed to be updated to respond to the situation which I have now described.  The use of condoms in the fight against AIDS-HIV, in particular, has been endorsed by international fora, such as the World Health Organisation and was addressed recently by the National AIDS Strategy Committee in their comprehensive review of our national AIDS strategy.  The strategy committee highlighted the role of the condom as a primary measure in preventing the infection and it is incumbent on us, as legislators, to pay particular attention to advice of this nature.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as chairman of the national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse I am presiding over the implementation of the Government strategy on drug misuse which was adopted in May 1991.  This strategy took account of the twin problem of AIDS and drug abuse and strongly recommended the introduction of appropriate risk-reduction programmes aimed at minimising the spread of the virus in the community.  I am happy that the co-ordinating committee's views are being implemented and that condoms are being promoted as a key component of this strategy also.</P>
    <P>With reference to the provisions of the Bill specifically, the House will note that its primary purpose is to make condoms more widely available.  This is done through the combined effects of sections 3 and 4 which reduce the age limit of persons to whom any contraceptive as defined in the Bill may be sold from 18 years to 17 years; enable contraceptives to be sold to persons aged 17 years or under who are married or in respect of whom a prescription has been issued by a doctor, that is a single person under the age of 17 years and increase the outlets through which condoms may be sold, that is from the traditional outlets, such as pharmacies and family planning clinics, under the 1979 and 1985 Acts, to all <Col N="761" /> retail outlets, except through the outlets excluded as mentioned in section 4 (1) (b) of the Bill.  The Bill also removes the requirement whereby prescriptions were required for other contraceptives for persons over the age of 18 years by restricting this requirement to persons aged under 17 years and who are single; the requirement whereby registered medical practitioners had to indicate on prescriptions that the prescriptions are for family planning or medical reasons; the anomaly whereby pharmacies which were limited companies were legally prohibited from selling contraceptives and the requirements for importers and manufacturers of condoms to hold licences.</P>
    <P>I regard this Bill, a Cheann Comhairle, as a further, integral development of public health policy, with particular reference to containing the spread of the HIV virus.  I am pleased, therefore, to be in a position, as Minister of State at the Department of Health, to join with my colleague, Deputy O'Connell, in strongly commending this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time the State was finally and unceremoniously evicted from the bedroom.  Unfortunately, this Bill does not do that.  Having waited almost 12 months for its publication and having listened with great expectation to the promises of three successive Ministers for Health, especially the present occupant of that office, the reaction to the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1992, has to be one of utter disappointment.</P>
      <P>The Bill does represent some advance on that produced last year by the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, but simply does not provide an adequate framework for a comprehensive family planning service, nor does it adequately equip Irish society for the battle against AIDS.  This is the third family planning Bill within a period of 13 years and it is the third botched attempt. Important issues have been ignored and fundamental questions dodged.  It is, as I described it on the day of its publication, a typical Fianna Fáil fudge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> There has been a major change in the situation since the Dáil discussed the last Bill in 1985.  In 1985 the Bill was judged solely on its merits as a family planning measure.  AIDS was then regarded as just some obscure condition which was a health risk for some members of the gay community in the United States.  How the situation has changed in just seven years.  We now know that AIDS poses a threat to many people all over the world. The World Health Organisation now has more than 500,000 reported cases of AIDS.  In Ireland over 1,200 people have been tested positive for HIV &mdash; the virus which causes AIDS &mdash; but many people believe that the actual number of those with HIV could be three or four times that number.  Over 100 people have died of AIDS in Ireland and there is now a death every second week.  We ignore the spread of AIDS at our peril.</P>
    <P>This Bill has to be judged, then, not simply as a family planning measure but as an anti-AIDS measure.  It fails on both counts.  It is not a family planning Bill.  It deals primarily with the sale of condoms and it would be much more honest if it were to be entitled the Sale of Condoms (Amendment) Bill.  It fails to take all available steps to counter AIDS.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have demonstrated once again their political cowardice and innate conservatism in the area of social reform. For the past 20 years the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, has been telling anyone who was prepared to listen what a wonderful Minister for Health he would make, how he would be prepared to make decisions on the basis of medical needs alone and how he would stand up to the Roman Catholic Church and other conservative elements.  The Minister has fallen at the first fence.  This Bill is based on political expediency, rather than on the health needs of a modern society and is, I suspect, responding more to internal Cabinet politics than to the question of public opposition that he has indicated may exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that he would have liked to have made condoms available through vending machines but that he backed down in the face of lobbying <Col N="763" /> from conservative elements.  If the Government are prepared to surrender to lobbying on the relatively simple issue of the sale of condoms, what chance is there of their resisting the far more intense lobbying they are likely to face on the much more complex issue of travel and information in relation to abortion?</P>
    <P>The Minister made an extraordinary statement this morning at the close of his contribution when he admitted he had caved in to lobbying from a minority group and said: &ldquo;We are here to defend minorities&rdquo;.  We are, of course, here to defend the rights of minorities, we are also here to defend the rights of every citizen.</P>

      <P>We cannot allow a small group of people or even a majority of people in society to deprive others of their rights, their right to family planning, their right to avoid pregnancy, their right of access to information, their right to travel.  Not to allow that is the real defence of rights, and simply caving in to those who are attempting to impose their fundamentalist views on society in general is not defending anybody's rights.</P>
      <P>One must ask where are the Progressive Democrat Ministers.  Where were they when the Cabinet were agreeing to yet another Irish solution to an Irish problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does represent some advance on the current situation but the decision to impose unenforceable marriage conditions and age limits and to prohibit sales from vending machines greatly diminishes its value.  There is now widespread recognition among the medical community of the need for the wider availability of condoms, especially in the light of their value in the battle against AIDS. Responsible bodies like the Irish Medical Organisation have urged that condoms should be made available for all irrespective of age.  The World Health Organisation has said and the Paris Centre for AIDS Research emphasise that condoms when used properly can block the transmission <Col N="764" /> of the AIDS condition.  According to the outgoing head of this country's national AIDS programme, Dr. James Walsh, there is no argument on that in medical and scientific circles.  All of the data and the research in western Europe indicate that the condom is 90 per cent effective in preventing the spread of the disease.  Even with the enactment of this Bill we will still be one of the few countries which place restrictions on access to a simple device which can prevent unwanted pregnancies and the needless deaths of people from AIDS.</P>
    <P>The suggestion from the Minister that pubs and clubs will be free to sell condoms across the counter is unreal.  It is unlikely that staff will want to sell condoms and even less likely that customers will be prepared to publicly buy them in crowded bars and clubs.  It is medically reckless to prohibit vending machine sales of condoms in pubs and clubs. People are entitled to privacy in regard to their sexual lives and vending machines offer the prospect of confidentiality and safe sex.  Condoms are widely available from vending machines in pubs and clubs in Northern Ireland.  Yet there is nothing whatsoever to suggest that this has made the people of Northern Ireland any less moral in relation to sexual matters.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Minister must know that an age limit is virtually impossible to enforce.  We all know how relatively simple it is for under age people to buy drink and cigarettes.  We all know how difficult it is for publicans who want to observe the law to implement the age limit.  How can you tell how old a young person is?  We have all seen signs in pubs which publicans have put up to try to protect themselves and which say, &ldquo;persons under 21 not served&rdquo;.  Will we now see pubs and shops with signs up saying &ldquo;condoms not sold to persons under 21&rdquo;; or will publicans and shopkeepers be reduced to asking young people wanting to buy condoms to produce ID cards complete with photographs and addresses to verify their age and their marital status? This provision is a nonsense.  It is bringing in a law that cannot be enforced and enacting such measures simply makes an <Col N="765" /> even bigger ass of the law.  The fact that it will be illegal to supply condoms to those under 17 who are not married will not stop young couples from having sex. Making condoms available without an age limit just might encourage them to have safe and responsible sex.</P>
    <P>One of the most disappointing aspects of the Bill is its failure to move any nearer to a comprehensive national family planning service.  As a medical doctor the Minister must know the impact that unplanned pregnancies have on the health of a mother.  One of the most serious shortcomings of the existing legislation &mdash; and this Bill does nothing to rectify it &mdash; is that it discriminates against all forms of contraception other than the so-called natural family planning measures which are considered acceptable by the Roman Catholic Church.  The Minister is required, under Deputy Haughey's 1979 Act, to provide a comprehensive natural family planning service. There is no obligation on him to provide any other sort of family planning service.  The result is that the health boards play little or no role in the provision of the sort of family planning service which most couples want and there is no assistance from the Department of Health to those groups, like the Irish Family Planning Association, to provide such a service.</P>
    <P>We have long argued for a comprehensive approach to family planning and that it should be provided as an integral part of our overall health system. This view is based on our belief that it is a fundamental personal right to plan the number and spacing of one's children, and, secondly, that it is an important dimension of preventative health care.  In some countries, particularly in the Third World, concern about the long term implications of rapid growth in population is the primary argument for family planning but in this country recognition of the right of a woman to control her fertility, together with concern for the personal health of women and their families, must be the factors which are taken into account when deciding on policy in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> Let us take a look at the health risks which can arise for women who bear children either very early or very late in their reproductive lives.  A study of infant deaths in the United States a few years back showed that 26 out of 1,000 children born to mothers under 26 died in the first year of their lives compared to 15 per 1,000 to mothers in their late twenties. On the other hand, the risk to mothers over 40 of bearing a child with Down's Syndrome can be as high as 14 per 1,000 compared to near zero in younger mothers.  The number of children a woman bears in her life affects her health and her family's health.  Her first birth carries a slightly higher risk of complications and death for her child than later babies do, primarily because the first birth reveals any physical or genetic abnormality in the mother or father. With the fourth birth the incidence of maternal deaths, stillbirths and infant and even child mortality begin to rise. Clearly then general health would improve markedly if comprehensive family measures were more widely available and were more widely used to reduce early and late pregnancies, to enable couples have only the number of children they want and to give a healthy interval between births.</P>
    <P>What we need is not just a Bill to provide easier sale of condoms but to provide for a comprehensive family planning service as part of our overall public health service.  It should provide not just for contraception but for related issues such as vasectomies, tubal ligations, breast examination, cervical smear tests, menopausal and sexual counselling.  The legislation as it stands makes it possible, but still quite difficult, for women to have access to proper family planning services. It is particularly inadequate for those who are dependent on the public health service and for those who live outside the major urban areas.  Access to tubal ligation &mdash; female sterilisation &mdash; is a case in point.  There are some women for whom tubal ligation is the only safe and effective form of contraception.  These are typically women in their thirties who have completed their families and for whom <Col N="767" /> other forms of contraception are not suitable. There is no difficulty if one has the money, but successive Ministers for Health have not recognised the importance of this facility.  There should be at least one centre in each health board area offering this service free to medical card holders or to those entitled to free hospital services specifically for the purpose of family planning and not just on the basis of other medical grounds.</P>
    <P>Why is there not more of an effort by the health authorities here to promote vasectomies among men?  Family planning is not just the responsibility of women.  Men must play their part.  Again, for those couples who have completed their families, male vasectomies can be an ideal solution but they can be relatively expensive for those on low incomes and are not available in all parts of the country.  There are still areas around the country where doctors are unsympathetic or not fully trained in family planning issues or where pharmacists simply refuse to stock a range of contraceptives.  The problems faced by women of child bearing age in such areas of the country will not be greatly helped by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Is it not time we set about removing some of the ludicrous anomalies that remain in our family planning legislation?  The provision which prohibits advertisements relating to sexual diseases is just one example.  Indeed the advertisment campaign against AIDS on the part of the Department of Health may well have been illegal under current legislation, defined under the Act of 1979 introduced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey.  Clearly that legislation not only prevents any publicity campaign aimed at alerting the public to the dangers of sexually-transmitted diseases such as syphilis or gonorrhoea but could be used also to block advertisements on the dangers of AIDS as it can arise from sexual intercourse.  Surely it is time we set about removing such Victorian nonsense from the Statute Book?  Surely it is time that we unceremoniously evicted the State once and for all from the bedroom <Col N="768" /> by providing not for the control of the distribution of condoms but by ensuring their equality and providing a comprehensive service to our health boards for all our men and women.</P>
    <P>My party will not be opposing this Bill on Second Stage.  However, we hope the Minister will accept reasonable amendments from the Opposition to render it more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us has been long overdue.  Indeed, its introduction has been a response to a changing society, an acceptance of the reality today, which is that people are engaging in sexual activity at an earlier age than ever before.</P>
      <P>When the Government first indicated that they intended amending the Health (Family Planning) Acts there was tremendous uproar in various quarters. The Government were accused of promoting sex outside of marriage and of encouraging young people to engage in sexual activity.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to note that, when the present Minister for Health brought forward his new proposals last week, they led to a much more mature debate and realistic assessment of the position obtaining.  Perhaps it is a sign that things are improving in Ireland, which I hope will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those accusations against the Government were simply not correct or justified. If we were never to amend the Health (Family Planning) Acts young people would continue to engage in sex.  If some people choose to bury their heads in the sand then it is the duty of Government to act responsibility.  It is my belief that the Government have behaved in a responsible, mature manner in introducing this Bill.  In his introductory remarks the Minister outlined his reasons for introducing this Bill and emphasised the necessity to prevent the spread of AIDS.  I am sure all Members would agree with me that, from the day he was appointed, the present Minister put on record that one of his priorities was the fight against AIDS.  I have no doubt about his sincerity in endeavouring to tackle this enormous problem.  However, <Col N="769" /> we must all accept that it is simply not sufficient to make condoms more freely available; educational initiatives are vital if we are to tackle that problem.</P>
    <P>There has been much play recently about citizens' rights when, unfortunately, responsibilities are often forgotten. It is vital that schools nationwide educate their pupils about sex.  For far too long we have been reluctant to talk about sex in an open, frank manner; it has suited many people to sweep the subject under the carpet.  I have no doubt but that attitudes are changing, that, as a nation, we have matured but we still have quite a distance to go.  A proper educational initiative would teach those who choose to engage in casual sex to take necessary precautions and act in a responsible manner.  It is the duty of Government to ensure that condoms are freely available to such people regardless of how we might regard their behaviour.</P>
    <P>Shortly after my election to this House in June 1989 I was asked to give an interview on my local radio &mdash; CKR &mdash; with Chris Walsh who asked what was my opinion on the position obtaining with regard to condoms.  I said then I felt the law was inadequate in that respect, that changes were necessary, that condoms should be more freely available and that I would be in favour of reducing the age at which they can be purchased at 16.  I have heard and read much comment over the past three years but nothing I have heard or read has given me reason to change my mind.  Three years ago I felt legislative changes were necessary; I contend they are even more necessary today. For that reason I am happy that the Minister has taken the bull by the horns and decided to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with two issues, first, the increase in the range of outlets permitted to sell condoms and the reduction in the age at which they can be purchased from 18 to 17.  It was crucial to increase the range of outlets since a totally unrealistic position obtained here which meant that condoms were available almost only in chemist shops.  The fact that some owners chose not to sell <Col N="770" /> them meant that in some towns nationwide they were not available and could not be purchased.  With the proposed increase in the number of outlets henceforth at least all towns, if not all villages, will be treated equally.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the purchase of condoms is a private matter.  There should be no necessity for half a shop to know when a person is buying a packet of condoms.  Citizens are entitled to privacy. For that reason it is essential that vending machines be allowed.  Surely the most sensible approach to adopt would be to have vending machines installed in pubs and clubs nationwide?  We appear to have serious hang-ups about vending machines; I am not sure why.  For example, do we think that a condom purchased over a counter is safer or cleaner than one purchased from a vending machine?  I have to say I have my doubts.</P>
    <P>As I said, we in Ireland have been reluctant to talk about matters relating to sex.  Times are changing, we have matured somewhat but, if we ignore the necessity for installing vending machines in various venues, we shall not have matured as much as I would have liked.  A number of Members referred to vending machines and the necessity for their installation.  On the one hand I appreciate the Minister's position in that he does not want to be seen to be promoting casual sex or encouraging younger people to become involved in sexual relations. Nonetheless we must accept the reality of the position.  In dealing with the reality there is one approach only which can be adopted, that is to install vending machines.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa contended it was almost impossible to enforce the 17 year-old age limit <i>vis-à-vis</i> availability or purchase of condoms.  When one considers that one can marry at 16 but cannot buy a condom until a year later one becomes even more aware of the ridiculous position obtaining.  I would ask the Minister to take a fresh look at that matter now that he has decided to make changes for which I am grateful.  Nonetheless there are a couple of amendments necessary to render the provisions of this Bill more <Col N="771" /> realistic in meeting the needs of present-day Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>While in all honesty I cannot say I welcome the contents of the Bill, I welcome the debate it has generated.  In considering Members' contributions on Second Stage it would be my hope that the Minister would seriously consider accepting amendments tabled later, particularly since he has made great play of the fact that he had to listen to the views of all his party colleagues on all of the issues involved. It would be my hope that he would take on board also the views expressed by his party colleague, Deputy Power, this morning with regard, not to availability but accessibility, of condoms, in particular in relation to vending machines.  I suspect that Deputy Power's views concur with the Minister's personal views.  I would go further and say I would suspect there is broad support for that move even among his Fianna Fáil back benchers.</P>
      <P>The Bill is symptomatic of the moral cowardice, the sort of creeping paralysis that grips this Chamber on any occasion we discuss questions of private morality. This Bill has had a long gestation period; the original Bill was published by the Minister's predecessor.  In spite of this, no significant improvements have been made in the Bill in respect of the people for whom it is designed to benefit.  This is very regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much debate, political and otherwise, about the contents of the Bill.  I accept that there are deeply and sincerely held views by people on both sides of the debate and it is imperative that we all put down markers.  No one who contributes to the debate can make the use of condoms compulsory or mandatory.  That is a question of personal choice and sexual morality.  This is safety net legislation; people who engage in sexual activities should have access to contraception.  Even though the legislation may cater for only a minority of people, the moral majority have no right to hijack it, which it would seem from <Col N="772" /> its contents they have been successful in doing to date.  I hope the Minister will accept the views put forward by Deputies in this debate through amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Education is a key element in this entire issue.  It is regrettable that the Ministers for Health and Education have been unable to date to formulate a proper sex education programme for all students in primary and secondary schools.  Some pilot projects have been put in place and aborted attempts made to tackle this issue, yet there is no proper sex education programme in the education curriculum. This is extremely regrettable.  It is understandable to a certain extent why some members of the public believe what we are engaged in here today &mdash; this perception is latched onto to a large extent by the moral majority or the guardians of our morality &mdash; is a preoccupation with condoms without considering the broader issues involved.  As I said, education is a key element in this entire issue. This House stands properly indicted for failing to present a balanced approach to this debate.  In his opening remarks the Minister heralded this as public health issue.  I do not think the contents of the Bill live up to that statement.  There is an obligation on us to legislate for the reality which confronts us and not for how we wish things were.  The Bill is seriously flawed in this respect.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposed age limit.  Why is the Minister apparently prepared to sacrifice the health of people under the age of 17 years who engage in sexual intercourse?  There are two possible answers to this question: first, the Minister believes that no one under the age of 17 years engages in sexual intercourse or, second, he is prepared to sacrifice their health by not making available to them, through the strictures of this Bill, access to contraceptives.  The Minister has failed to address this very fundamental issue in his comments on the Bill to date.  As we know from other legislation, it is almost impossible to enforce age limits.  One has only to look at the level of alcohol abuse and under age drinking to realise this.  This legislation <Col N="773" /> will be starting off on a wrong foot, so to speak, if the Minister includes provisions in it which are unenforceable, or to which he expects the State authorities to turn a blind eye.  This is an extremely poor reflection on the Minister, and I hope he will take on board the amendments tabled in this respect.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, accessibility and not availability is the critical issue in this debate.  Even though condoms are available at present they are not accessible to many people.  Condoms are available from chemists, health boards and general practitioners. However, many people find it very intimidating to walk into their local chemist or GP and ask for a packet of condoms.  This is the reason many people have sexual intercourse without using contraception.  This anomaly has not been addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The familiar call in public houses of &ldquo;two pints of Guinness and a packet of crisps&rdquo; will not be replaced with &ldquo;two pints of Guinness and a packet of condoms&rdquo;. This is a particularly sensitive issue in rural areas.  It might be possible, with some stretch of the imagination, for people in larger urban centres to go into a public house or supermarket and ask for a packet of condoms but people in rural Ireland will certainly not do this. Every Deputy will bring a particular perspective into this debate, and I know that this perspective will be widely held by Deputies from rural Ireland.  People of all ages in rural Ireland are not a whole lot different from their urban counterparts in terms of sexual activities but they will be inhibited from walking into their local supermarket or public house and asking for a packet of condoms.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take on board the points made by Deputy Seán Power about the use of vending machines. Anonymity is a critical issue in this whole debate; people are entitled to privacy in terms of their sexual activity.  If this legislation is enacted in its present form, people who ask their local barman for a packet of condoms will have to endure the nudge and wink syndrome.  This is unfair; it is an intrusion by this House <Col N="774" /> into people's private morality, something we have no right to do.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take on board the strongly held views which have been expressed by Members on all sides of the House in regard to the two critical issues of the age limit and vending machines: there should be anonymity in regard to accessibility to condoms and there should be no age restrictions.  This House should not be prepared to sacrifice the lives of those people under 17 years of age who engage in sexual activities.  We are obliged to provide every possible protection for them.  This is not to say that the House condones people under 17 years of age engaging in sexual activities. This goes back to my earlier point about the need for a proper sex education programme in our schools.  The ethos of most people would be chastity outside marriage and fidelity within marriage.  This is an admirable ethos and one with which this House should be associated. However, we cannot legislate for this and we have to recognise that people under 17 years of age engage in sexual intercourse. These people should have access to contraception.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing worthwhile changes to the Bill.  It is important to stress that under this Bill contraceptives will be available in all retail outlets, for example, supermarkets, barber shops, which were popular outlets in Britain for many years and all retail outlets.  I understand at present about 40 per cent of chemist shops are refusing to sell contraceptives and that this is creating problems.  The minimum legal age of marriage here is 16.  Anyone who is married at 16, and not many peope get married at that age, will have no difficulty in obtaining contraceptives. There is nothing in the Bill that outlaws the use of condoms by those under 17 years or suggests they are committing an illegal act if they use them.</P>

      <P>There are people who are deeply concerned about youngsters under 16 years and the State recognises that people under that age are old enough to engage in sexual activity.  In a sense that almost gives them the nod, the go ahead.  That must be weighed up against the danger of those young people being infected by carriers of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV-AIDS. We have a responsibility to protect our young people in that regard.  However, the problem is that very young people who are 11, 12 or 13 years of age are sexually active.  In our city there are young people of 13 years of age who brag to each other &ldquo;how is your kid&rdquo;.  That culture exists.  The problem is that in many cases those young people do not use contraceptives.  In Britain where contraceptives are freely available, and have been for many years through vending machines and other outlets, there is still a dreadful problem.</P>
      <P>It is worrying to contemplate the number of people who are HIV positive; 1,250 people have tested HIV positive but we all know the real problem is that the number of people who may be HIV positive and who have not come forward for testing is far greater.  It is a frightening prospect that people who may be carrying the HIV virus are afraid to be tested. That is where we should direct our attention and we should encourage people who have any doubts that they may have the HIV virus to be tested.  They may infect others with the virus without being aware that they are carrying it and they will never forgive themselves if they discover some considerable time later, having had many partners, that they are HIV positive.  That is a problem we should address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also respect those people who have reservations about the availability of contraceptives, they are not all fundamentalists. There is an attempt to dismiss anyone who has reservations about the broad availability of contraceptives as being a fundamentalist.  Many people are concerned that peer pressure may be brought to bear on their children; they may be asked, &ldquo;do you have contraceptives, <Col N="776" /> are you using them or are you engaging in sexual activity&rdquo;?  From that point of view there is a possibility that people under 17 years of age may be subject to this peer pressure.  There are many areas to cover, I do not know how much of the legislation is subject to regulation, but a considerable amount of it can be amended.  We have come a long way since the first family planning Act was passed and the former Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, walked through the &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; while his Government Members voted &ldquo;Tá&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The former Ministers, Mr. Paddy Cooney, who is now the great liberal and Mr. Dick Burke, voted against their own leader.  We have come a long way and we should not be political. We should all work together, listen, be tolerant, and realise that others have a point of view.  We should act in the best interests of the people, and that is what this Bill proposes.  If the Bill is not comprehensive enough, the next stage may be to reduce the age limit.  I understand 1,250 people have tested HIV positive over recent years, but we all know the real figure is much greater.  We can estimate it at any figure we like because we do not have statistics in this regard.</P>
      <P>In Britain where there is free availability of contraceptives enormous problems exit in relation to people who are HIV positive and who do not use contraceptives. Regardless of how many partners a person may have had, they will always remember their first sexual experience and they may make empty promises to their first partner.  The spread of AIDS is a real problem and I am glad we are going some way to dealing with it in this Bill.  We can all work together on Committee Stage and I know if the Minister is persuaded that the Bill should be amended he will be open to suggestions.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  In case my comments are misunderstood, before I deal in detail with the aspects of our family planning legislation on which I wish to concentrate, I want to emphasise that I view seriously the restrictions imposed by our laws over the years in relation to access to contraceptives and the obtaining of information about contraception.</P>
      <P>These laws created enormous problems and difficulties for teenagers, men and women, single and married people and, sadly, lacked logic and humanity. Instead of educating people for life and for relationships and ensuring that men and women understood their responsibilities to each other and the consequences of their actions, the Oireactas in years gone by pulled a shamrock curtain around the 26 counties that today form this Republic which was designed to keep people in ignorance and denied basic human and civil rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> When the law is an ass, adult educated people who have the means to do so find a way around it.  Unfortunately, the poor, the young the uneducated and the disadvantaged are usually the ones who suffer as they are unable to do so.</P>
    <P>Hence, though information on contraception was restricted, despite then existing legislation, many people found their way around the restrictions.  As we entered the late sixties and early seventies they were substantially assisted in doing so by the voluntary family planning clinics that were opened.  Women who wished to plan their families and control their fertility obtained the contraceptive pill officially not for &ldquo;contraceptive purposes&rdquo; but as a &ldquo;cycle regulator&rdquo; so as to comply with the law. Under this legal fiction this State probably had the highest number of women in the world per head of population who appeared to have a medical problem with their menstrual cycle.  Condoms were, of course, smuggled in by friends and relations visiting this country or brought in by Irish residents when returning from holidaying abroad.  The prohibition on sale of condoms was, of course, got around by the the family planning clinics use of the fiction that they were not selling them but giving them away in return for a donation.  When the law is a fool, human ingenuity knows no bounds in circumventing it.</P>
    <P>It has always been my belief that people should have the fullest access to information about sexual relations and family planning so that they may behave responsibly and have the means to implement the decisions that they make. I have always viewed the restrictions imposed by legislation enacted by the Free State and maintained in this Republic after the coming into force of the 1937 Constitution as little short of ludicrous.  In so far as this Bill removes further restrictions I welcome it.  I regret, however, that it still maintains some of the shibboleths and ludicrous restrictions that have been part and parcel of our law for some decades.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the legislative history of the Minister for Health and the many <Col N="779" /> speeches he has made in this House in relation to this issue I have no doubt that the Bill is well meant and well intended. It is clear from remarks publicly made by him, even since its publication, that the Bill does not fully reflect the Minister's views, but is a compromise measure imposed upon him by the antiquated views which still prevail in parts of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat parties and around the Cabinet table.  I regret that the Minister has retained in the Bill restrictions concerning the availability of condoms which he does not support and which he knows to be largely unenforceable and ridiculous.</P>
    <P>It is in relation to access to condoms, that I wish to address the rest of my remarks.  Before I do, however, I want to enter one further caveat, again for fear that what I say may be misinterpreted.</P>
    <P>Condoms have particular importance in the area of sexual relations.  The overwhelming majority of people who use a condom do so in the course of making love as a responsible decision to ensure that an unwanted pregnancy does not result.  That is, of course, the primary function of condoms.  Condoms, however, play a secondary role.  They provide a barrier to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and in the context of the AIDS epidemic, they act as a life saver.  I want to fully acknowledge this.  In doing so, however, I regret that in much of the public comment made by Government about this Bill and in the comment made in this House by Government members emphasis has been placed largely on the issue of AIDS and not on the simple issue of making condoms available to assist people in exercising responsibility in sexual relations.</P>
    <P>Many people outside this House share my view that the approach taken by successive Governments over the years to family planning and to the general availability of condoms is little short of idiosyncratic and ludicrous.  Any of those who take the time to read reports of today's debate may have a private giggle at the po-faced speeches made and, that no doubt will continue to be made, by <Col N="780" /> Members of this House.  Most people view their sexuality as a matter for their own private concern and do not believe that their actions and their access to condoms should be restrained or controlled by legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to address briefly the history of the manner in which this House has dealt with condoms.  I suspect that if a space traveller arrived on this planet and visited this island, without seeing a condom or having one described to him, and merely read the debates that have taken place in this House, he would quickly come to the conclusion that condoms are lethal weapons which obviously pose a serious threat to the wellbeing of the human race. If my space traveller was shown a condom, or if one was simply described I suspect he would look incredulously at the occupants of this island and swiftly re-enter his space capsule to visit a saner place.</P>
    <P>The saga starts, of course, with the Health (Family Planning) Act of 1979. Under that Act a condom was fixed firmly in the mind of Government as a lethal weapon.  If one resided within the State one could not obtain one except by medical prescription for &ldquo;bona fide family planning or for adequate medical reasons&rdquo;.  The fiction was maintained that single people could not obtain condoms but this, of course, was not true.  Any person, according to the Act, could obtain one, not, of course, for the purpose of making love but for &ldquo;family planning or for adequate medical reasons&rdquo;. This ludicrous restriction was compounded by virtue of the fact that they could only be obtained by way of sale &mdash; hence, it became an offence for someone residing in Ireland to give to another person be it a teenager or adult, married or single a condom as a gift or by way of a sample for no charge.  This criminal offence, the gift of a condom, is a unique and bizarre Irish input into universal criminal law.  I am unaware of any other country which has laws which render it a criminal offence and which make people liable to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for giving a condom to another as a present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> The 1979 Act provided an exemption for &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; so that persons entering the State were free to import as many condoms as they wished provided they were for their own personal use.</P>
    <P>I was never able to figure how the medical profession came to terms with the 1979 Act.  When a suppliant male attended his local medical practitioner seeking a prescription for condoms, how did the GP determine the number of condoms it was reasonable to prescribe on a weekly or monthly basis?  Was this determined by a look into the whites of his eyes or an examination of the shape of his kneecaps?  Did some GPs prescribe a particular branded condom or did they, for their favoured patients, prescribe a particularly sensitive one?  When customs officials were confronted with a person returning home from abroad with a large number of condoms in their luggage how did they figure whether they were all for personal use or whether some might be given away as gifts?  The law was, of course, always a farce and was so viewed by the majority of ordinary decent people with no axe to grind outside this House. If the 1979 Act had been a Hollywood production, in so far as the idiocy of its provisions demanded that there be a sequel, I have no doubt it would have been dubbed &ldquo;Lethal Weapon I&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The 1985 Act, among much heartrending, became &ldquo;Lethal Weapon II&rdquo;.  A somewhat more successful production, it nevertheless maintained in being in our laws ludicrous and outdated anomalies that defy rational explanation.</P>
    <P>Lethal Weapon II allowed persons over 18 years of age to purchase condoms without prescription but continued to require those under 18 who wished to obtain them in Ireland to do so only by way of prescription.  I wonder how many doctors since 1985 have written prescriptions for condoms for persons under 18 years?  The over 18's who obtained them, of course, still could not officially use a condom for the purpose of making love.  They had to be used bona fide for family planning or adequate medical reasons.  I suppose it is noteworthy that at no time since 1979 has anyone been <Col N="782" /> prosecuted for the improper use of a condom under the provisions of these two Acts.  Legislation, of course, continued to allow persons under 18 years of age as &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; to bring into the country as many condoms as they wished for their own personal use and continued to prohibit persons either over or under 18 from obtaining condoms otherwise than by way of purchase.  It is still today a criminal offence for any person to give a condom to another person as a gift.  I suppose it is a small mercy that to date no additional special Government tax has been imposed on those using them.</P>
    <P>Lethal Weapon I confined the sales of condoms to chemist shops.  Lethal Weapon II extended to registered family planning clinics the right to sell condoms. We now have Lethal Weapon III &mdash; the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill of 1992 published by the Minister last week.  It is being rushed through the Dáil this week by a Government who hope that its speedy passage will avoid public controversy and inhibit the self-appointed moralists from launching an effective political attack on the measure.</P>
    <P>The good things about the Bill are that it will allow for a far wider sale of condoms and will no longer confine their sale to chemist shops and family planning clinics.  This Bill, however, does not allow condoms to be purchased through vending machines.  It remains a criminal offence for someone to be given a condom as a gift rather than pay for it and persons under 17 years of age who wish to obtain them still require a medical prescription.  There is nothing in the Bill which prohibits the use by a person over 17 of a condom when having relations with a person under 17 years.  A person under 17 who is a traveller can of course continue to bring into this State as many condoms as they wish for personal use.</P>
    <P>No doubt, the Minister will say that it is against the law in this country for persons under 17 to engage in sexual intercourse and in that he is right.  However, law and social reality in this area, as in so many others, do not coincide.  This is clearly seen from the statistics of the number of children conceived by teenage girls under <Col N="783" /> 17 years of age over the last ten years. In the period 1981 to 1990, inclusive, a total of 5,518, over 550 each year have been born to mothers 17 years of age and under, outside marriage.  If young people are engaging in sexual relations, it makes a lot of sense for there to be easy access to condoms.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the age prohibition is unworkable.  If the Minister recognises this why is he including it in the Bill in the first place?</P>
    <P>This age limit should be removed and should not be preserved in the Bill as a gesture to the self-appointed, self-righteous pressure groups who seem to get sadistic pleasure in engaging in activities intended to strike fear into the hearts of politicians.</P>
    <P>I find the issue of vending machines far more curious.  If virtually all retail outlets are now to be allowed to sell condoms, why should there be a prohibition on the purchase of a condom from a vending machine?  Many people, particularly young people, find it embarrassing purchasing condoms and regard vending machines as a simple means of obtaining them without being caused embarrassment. Vending machines are used worldwide for the sale and distribution of condoms.  Do this Government think that the sight of condoms on sale in vending machines is going to result in young teenagers engaging in some sort of national sexual rampage?  What public danger is posed by their presence in such machines and by their sale in this way? The Minister's prohibition on the sale of condoms through vending machines is part and parcel of the philosophy that sees them as `lethal weapons.'  This foolish prohibition means that this Bill is yet another sequel to a long-running saga which will require further legislation.</P>
    <P>The ban on the sale of condoms from vending machines needs to be put in context. Cigarettes are widely available for sale through vending machines and have been for decades.  The most lethal weapon a young person can purchase at a vending machine is a cigarette.  Teenagers and younger children smoking cigarettes <Col N="784" /> develop an addiction which in this country annually causes hundreds of deaths through lung cancer and which internationally is responsible for millions of deaths every year.  If we are to ban vending machines as retail outlets, a ban should be imposed on the sale of cigarettes through vending machines.  I do not know of a single death that has resulted anywhere to any person as a result of the purchase of a condom through a vending machine.  A Government that regard the sale of cigarettes through vending machines as acceptable are making an ass of the law and bringing it into disrepute if they prohibit the sale of condoms in the same way.  A packet of cigarettes is lethal and can kill.  A packet of condoms can ensure responsibility in sexual relations and may save a life.</P>
    <P>It is time, Sir, for us to move away from the use of euphemisms.  The contraceptive pill may be useful as a cycle regulator but it is used by most people to enable them to make love responsibly.  A condom may be a protector against the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases but it is also used primarily to enable people to make love responsibly. It is a pity, Sir, that in the context of this Bill nothing has been said by the Government about the benefits of making love in a responsible way within a close loving relationship.  It is a pity that this Bill fails to fully confront and recognise this aspect of human relationships. As a political climax to the political year it is sadly uninspiring.  As an example of open Government and a willingness to implement radical social reform this Bill has unfortunately failed the test.  It is, however, not too late for the Minister to agree to the amendments necessary to bring this long drawn out and bizarre legislative saga to a satisfactory end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I am aware that many other Members wish to contribute to this debate.  First, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him every success in the future.  He has been a very positive and active Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> In his opening address the Minister said that this legislation was required urgently for two reasons: first, and most importantly, for public health reasons and, second, to bring our family planning legislation more in line with public <i>mores</i> and thinking.  I support the introduction of this legislation on the grounds of public health.  The Fianna Fáil parliamentary party have given their support to the Minister's Bill.  A certain amount of public controversy was generated by the proposal to amend the legislation to make condoms available to those of 16 years and over.  However, in this Bill the Minister has struck a fair balance by making provision to make condoms available to those of 17 years and over, thus reducing the present age limit from 18 to 17 years.</P>
    <P>The only reason I would not object to the provisions in this Bill is on medical grounds.  The medical profession indicate that there has been a vast increase in the incidence of AIDS.  A recent report from the Eastern Health Board indicated that in the last decade of the 20th century the greatest potential public health threat facing Ireland is AIDS.  Since AIDS was first diagnosed in Ireland in 1982 there has been a steady increase in the number of cases and resultant deaths from AIDS. A national AIDS strategy group were established at the end of 1991 and they have recently reported to the Government. The medical profession have also expressed their concern about the increasing incidence of AIDS and have advised that condoms should be used as part of our strategy to prevent the spread of AIDS.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes provision for increasing the number of outlets where condoms may be purchased but there is no provision to make condoms available through vending machines in public houses.  The purpose of the Bill is to make condoms available to persons who have reached the age of 17 years and over in order to reduce the risk of contracting AIDS.  RTE interviewed people on the street and the view expressed was that people would be reluctant to approach a staff member in a public house in order to <Col N="786" /> purchase a packet of condoms &mdash; indeed, can you imagine asking somebody for a packet of condoms with his pint?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about asking for a loaf of bread and a packet of condoms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those interviewed expressed the view that, if condoms were available from vending machines in the toilets of public houses, they could be acquired without embarrassment.  I believe the Minister should consider these views &mdash; indeed, that very point was made by some Deputies in the House. Under the licensing laws people in public houses must be 18 years or over and therefore if condoms were available in public houses we would not be breaking the law.  If we are to achieve what the Bill sets out to do it would be helpful if those who were sexually active used condoms. I would be completely opposed to making condoms available through vending machines in places where discos are held. As I stated at the outset, the only reason I support the Bill is on health grounds and we should not be seen to be encouraging young people to become sexually active. I am aware, however, that pressure is being put on the Minister and the Government to introduce this Bill.  May I compliment the Minister once again and wish the Bill a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset may I state that it is time for us, the legislators, to firmly and unequivocally state that we are here to make laws that will be viable, practical and of positive assistance to those whom we represent?  I intend to be very brief.  Having listened to previous speakers, I recall those early days in 1973 when I began my political career in Seanad Éireann.  In 1972 the distinguished person who will visit this House later today had proposed the introduction of the first family planning Bill in an atmosphere in which the Bill itself could not be put into print &mdash; there was opposition to the printing of any such Bill.  During the second attempt to introduce a family planning Bill there <Col N="787" /> was what could only be described as a disgraceful campaign against those who were trying to suggest introducing the basic elements of family planning legislation.</P>
      <P>Now is a time to be generous and to positively acclaim the changes in public attitude, including the rather more tardy change in the attitudes of legislators which has taken place in the intervening period.  It is tragic that we cannot discuss and initiate this legislation on grounds that are drawn firmly from social policy and public health and from the perspective of rights.  People who engage in sexual activity are engaging in an act that is protected in most law by legislation governing forms of privacy.  Indeed, this was one of the principles invoked to enable the use of certain forms of family planning within marriage in the early legal cases.  There is also a matter of social and public policy and a recognition of the kind of society in which we live.  In the early years people drew from a set of prescripts that claimed a transcendent authority.  I remember a very honest speech by Senator Michael J. O'Higgins in which he quoted the prayer we say in the Dáil and Seanad at the start of business and he suggested this was a vindication of natural law which took precedence over all positive law and certainly over the law of the State.  His was an honest speech but there were many other dishonest speeches over the years in which people sought to whip up irrational and prejudiced fears against those who were seeking to change the direction of necessary legislation.  I have always paid tribute to his speech because I believe that he genuinely believed what he said, which was in stark contrast to those who were exploiting and degrading themselves and the legislative process by whipping up emotional and unsustainable fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could hardly say that in this legislation we have made the leap to being able to respect conscience, defined broadly, within the rights of the State that stands separate from any particular denominational prescription.  It is indeed <Col N="788" /> the incredible shadow of AIDS that stands behind the present legislation. One must ask whether it says something about a Legislature and its response to the needs of its society if it is necessary to have such an incredible and dreadful disease threatening society before that Legislature is forced to act.  As I try to answer that rhetorical question to myself, I have to conclude that we are not yet in the realm of legislating socially and responsibily in terms of public health.</P>
    <P>How can it be that at the end of this century a vending machine is becoming an object of idealogical significance to speakers to whom I have listened from my office today?  Do people really think that there are those who nowadays when they go into places of public entertainment, places where people who are sexually active are gathered, and do not see a vending machine will congratulate themselves and think of that as a great ideological victory on their part in that they stopped the installation of any vending machine at that place?  And will they know at the same time that those who are sexually active and who could with discretion procure condoms will be prevented from doing so, and by being prevented from doing so acquire a much greater risk than they need be asked to carry?  It simply does not make sense to be holding this point.  A very thin body of research in relation to people who acquire condoms has been carried out, but it does exist.  After all, many people in society remember the trauma following the mention of terms such as &ldquo;life skills&rdquo;, and there are groups in this country that would like life skills to be taught without any reference to biology &mdash; another unique feature of our culture.</P>
    <P>Without adequate education and public information a great series of inhibitions is placed on the sexually active person and the ability to acquire condoms if he or she wants to have sexual relations in a responsible manner.  Surely it would be much easier for people to overcome all of those obstacles by being able to acquire condoms from a vending machine.  I do not recognise any <Col N="789" /> way in which it could be progressive to put this blemish on this modestly amending legislation.</P>
    <P>What about the requirement for an age limit in relation to the purchase of condoms?  What earth-shaking research is available to the Government but has been hidden from the rest of the world that suggests that people become sexually active at the age of 17 and do not need protection for safe sexual relations before the age of 17?  I am reminded of the old arguments about the miraculous concurrence of the age of seven and the age of reason, which declared that on one's seventh birthday there was some kind of cosmic shift in one's consciousness.  That kind of antiquated nonsense is being smuggled into the Bill.  Who could implement an age limit of 17?  Are we following down the road that led to the phrase in the intoxicating liquor legislation, &ldquo;knowingly serve&rdquo;?  Could one knowlingly deliver a condom to a person one genuinely thought was 17?  If one were to follow the logic that appears to have informed the legislation, which is to make a response late in the day to the phenomenon of AIDS, surely one would not only be talking about availability in the best circumstances in which one would impact on that but would also be trying to use a term of definition of access that would not include an age restriction of 17.</P>
    <P>Another question relates to the notion of the prohibition on advertising.  If the legislation accepts the enormous import of the AIDS problem and the need to act responsibly, is it not rather daft not to amend those antiquated laws that place restrictions on advertising?</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to organisations such as Condom Sense, which are supported by distinguished people who are seriously concerned and who have taken great risks, both professionally and otherwise, in supporting the availability of condoms. I know one of the founders of AIDS Help West.  That person spoke to me about this legislation and expressed a strong feeling that there is need for amendment. I know that the Minister for Health is very informed about what happens on <Col N="790" /> the ground.  I say to him that on this occasion, it is a case, if he wants to be courageous, of responding to the public need rather than to any irredentist elements that have personal hang-ups about vending machines or the true age of people or that feel suddenly frozen on the sight of a newspaper advertisement for condoms.  From such people may we be released, in a secular, liberal and democratic sense, before we all die.  May the Minister release himself before this legislation is enacted.  I suggest to the Minister that people who imagine that their pints will get flak if there is a condom machine within the environs of a pub, or that the bread will go off quickly or that the milk will curdle if there is a vending machine within hundreds of yards, are not in the real world.  It would be fine if those people wanted to live in the world of their personal eccentricities, but we are not talking about that.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that we are legislators and what is required now is good and adequate legislation.  I strongly implore the Minister to listen to those organisations that have said to him that if the legislation is to be effective he should consider amendments in relation to the age limit, vending machines and advertising.  I also suggest that he has a great opportunity because perhaps &mdash; and this point has been made by my colleague, Deputy Howlin &mdash; he is now in an atmosphere in which he is likely to be able to carry the support of the House, support from all parties, in making the legislation effective.  He will be able to deliver the legislation as an instrument which will have an impact on a grave social and health problem.  The Minister will be remembered if he does that but he will not be thanked if he allows the coming into effect of the needless restrictions contained in this legislation at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very sad reflection on the state of our legislation and on the confidence we have in ourselves that we should be able truthfully to describe this Bill as progress.  The legislation is progress, <Col N="791" /> but it is a sad reflection of where we are coming from that we can describe a Bill such as this as one that makes a progressive move in our legislation.</P>
      <P>During the course of this debate a great deal of emphasis has been placed on the very important public health issues that arise in relation to AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  I agree with some of the very wise things that have been said but I should like to go back a little to more fundamental issues.  I do not consider that the question of family planning, as we euphemistically call it here, or contraception, as it should more properly be called, is solely or even mainly a public health issue.  There is a matter of basic fundamental human rights involved here.  Since we are told that the use of reason is what distinguishes humankind from the rest of the animal kingdom we should apply that lesson to all areas of human behaviour.  I deliberately say &ldquo;humankind&rdquo; and not &ldquo;mankind&rdquo; in case I might complicate the issue with another diversion.  Although I am sceptical about it from time to time, if it is true that the use of reason is one of the things that distinguishes us, it seems logical from that that humankind has the right to control its fertility and its reproduction, that women most particularly have the right to control fertility, to control reproduction, and that that right should not be interfered with in any way. It is a matter for women of physical, mental and what I might call social health.  This is something that should be uppermost in the minds of legislators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not to say the responsibility for the control of fertility and reproduction should rest only with women.  Of course it should not, but we are dealing here with an area of legislation which is of importance to all humankind but of particular importance to women.  We should not forget that.  I see no fundamental reason whatever for the State being involved in legislating for what are called non-medical contraceptives.  As I have said, I believe control of fertility and reproduction is a basic human right and <Col N="792" /> I see no reason why the State should interfere in that any more than is absolutely necessary.  I accept that there are other forms of contraceptives where the State has a perfect right and, indeed, an obligation to intervene in order to protect public health and most particularly the health of women.  I do not need to go into all this area of the contraceptive pill or the various IUDs that have been on the market and that have caused serious problems in recent years.  The State has a perfect right and, indeed, an obligation to intervene in those areas to regulate the kinds of products that may be made available in the interests of public health, private health and particularly the health of women, but that issue does not arise in relation to condoms.</P>
    <P>There is much nonsensical, quasi psuedo-statistical stuff about condoms. Many of us will have received in our post today a copy of <i>The Condom Bill &mdash; All the Facts</i> published by the Children's Protection Society, which sets out to prove that the more you make condoms available the more widespread AIDS will be. It is perfectly possible mathematically to prove there is a statistically significant correlation even at the 95 per cent confidence level between the rate of ownership of microwave ovens and the certainty with which we know the moon is not made of green cheese.  You can prove that mathematically and perfectly respectably but the one has nothing to do at all with the other.  That is the kind of nonsense these irredentist guardians of our morals, who never consult us about it, try to foist on us in this.  There is no reason why the State should intervene in any way in the provision, distribution and sale of non-medical contraceptives.  The only obligation the State has is in setting quality standards so that the product, if I may use the term, performs up to specification.  That is the only area that is of proper public significance.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the step the Minister has taken about spermicides and the reasons he gave for it today.  It seems absolutely outrageous for the Minister to say he is going to change the way we treat spermicides because he is afraid people <Col N="793" /> will regard them in some way as a prophylactic if he does not control them.  That is nonsense.  The Minister has taken a totally unnecessary step that will unnecessarily complicate life for people who otherwise might have got a grip of what is involved in various methods of contraception which they might have found could contribute to their lives.  Let us make no mistake about it, when we are talking about non-medical contraceptives &mdash; my colleague Deputy Shatter spoke of this &mdash; we are talking about the most readily available, least complicated and simplest form of contraception.  God knows, anybody who is acquainted in any way with social life, particularly social life among lower income groups, will know that the question of contraception or, as we euphemistically call it, the question of family planning, is much more for a great many families and a great many women than this theoretical concept of spacing out their family and deciding whether there will be two, three or four years between the children that will be born to the family.  It is a matter of day-to-day concern and a cause of great mental anguish and frequently a cause of severe mental illness to them.  Deputy Creed mentioned that the fact that we do not have access to non-medical contraceptives on as wide a basis as we rationally should is directly the cause of a great deal of suffering, mental anguish particularly to women, and a great deal of tension in marriages.</P>
    <P>If these moral guardians are as seriously concerned as they claim to be with protecting the institution of marriage and family life, they should be advocating the widest possible availability and the greatest degree of accessibility of non-medical contraceptives rather than advocating the contrary.  We know from surveys that have been done, from observation and from work that has been carried out by people involved in this area that access to non-medical contraceptives is in many parts of this country a patchy, hit-and-miss affair.  The Minister rightly realises that he cannot oblige anybody to stock condoms.  He is hoping, apparently, in this Bill that by <Col N="794" /> making it possible for a wider range of outlets to stock them, somehow something magic is going to happen and they will be made available on a wider basis. I hope I am wrong, but I am prepared to bet that in 12 months' time the 166 Members of this House can walk around their own home towns, home areas or electoral districts and count on the fingers of one hand the number of new outlets where condoms will be available as a result of this.  For example, nobody is going to tell me that my local supermarket are suddenly going to move, that my local grocer or greengrocer is suddenly going to have condoms available. The Minister is making sure there are some kind of outlets that will not have them available, because he is prohibiting the use of vending machines.  I am prepared to bet that if we come back here in a year's time the Members of this House will be able to say, &ldquo;I do not know of anything even like five or six new outlets in my area where condoms are now being made available as a result of the legislation passed&rdquo;.  If that is the case the Bill will very largely have failed in what it sets out to do and will not have contributed any noticeable increase to the level of human wisdom, human happiness, marital concord or any of the other things this Bill should set out to promote, if indeed, we should have a Bill at all about non-medical contraceptives.</P>
    <P>It is a general reflection that in many areas like this, and maybe in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Act that Deputy Michael D. Higgins spoke about a few moments ago, the more the State intervenes the more the State is going to get it wrong.  That is a lesson we should learn from this.</P>
    <P>There is one other area on which I want to touch briefly.  There has been a great deal of publicity about the question of the reliability of the condom as a contraceptive and a health measure.  There has been this nonsensical claim &mdash; repeated again today &mdash; that in all the countries where condoms are most widely available AIDS is most prevalent, which is true, but the two are totally unrelated.  Nobody can claim any statistical <Col N="795" /> basis for saying that, in a specific case, the use of a condom is not a useful means of preventing the transmission of AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. There have also been spurious comments about the failure rate of condoms from organisations like the Children's Protection Society who, like the so-called pro-life group in the latest debate, showed no concern for facts, truth, honesty or the use of language.  Of course there is a failure rate and failures by the people using condoms to understand how to use them properly.  That is something which manufacturers &mdash; and the Minister &mdash; should try to remedy. Here again, in any situation it is less likely that conception will take place if you use a condom.</P>
    <P>I hope in the public debate from here on that we can get past this spurious, quasi-statistical nonsense and go back to the simple proposition which should inspire legislation &mdash; or even a lack of legislation &mdash; which is that humankind have a right and indeed an obligation, when you look at the pressures in the world, to control fertility and reproduction. The use of non-medical contraceptives is the safest, healthiest and most reliable way of doing this as it respects the integrity of the individual and, specifically, the health of women.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that time is so limited and that so few speakers can make their views known.  In particular, it would have been very revealing for the Minister, and his policy makers, to hear views of Members of his party. One or two of them spoke and they generally supported what was said by Opposition speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two main concerns on this side of the House &mdash; which would be shared by all political parties &mdash; is that the issues of the availability of condoms through <Col N="796" /> vending machines and the age limit should be addressed.  I appeal to the Minister to consider those issues.  In recent weeks we had the debate on the Maastricht Treaty which veered on to the abortion road.  The people who preached loudly on the issue of abortion and the necessity to change the judgment of the Supreme Court failed to address two very important subjects, namely the question of the thousands of Irish women who travel every year to Britain for an abortion and why they do this.  We should reflect on the old saying that prevention is better than cure.  Why do we have 4,000 unwanted pregnancies here?  One of the main reasons is that our attitude to the availability of condoms is extremely immature and results in a situation where tens of thousands of people practise unprotected sex, resulting in many young girls travelling to Britain for an abortion. If we could, through this legislation, do anything which would stop even one of those girls having an unplanned and unwanted pregnacy we would have done a good day's work.  However, the legislation will not be very helpful in that respect.</P>
    <P>We must live with the reality that the Ireland of 1992 is very different from the Ireland of 1985 and it is even more different from the Ireland of 1979.  Things have changed dramatically since we debated family planning in 1974.  We must all accept that the comely maidens and their male equivalents have long since left the village green.  We must live in the new Ireland and the new Europe and face up to the fact that people look at lifestyles differently in 1992 compared with some years ago.</P>
    <P>Our job is not to legislate for morality, I think it was Deputy Creed who said that we must legislate for reality but we are not going far enough in that respect.  We all have certain standards to which we would like people to aspire but that does not always happen.  We must try to ensure that the legislation we put in place in relation to family planning will be realistic and meaningful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed also said that the question of availability of condoms is quite <Col N="797" /> different from the question of their accessibility.  I know life in rural villages and towns and, under present legislation and indeed the proposed changes, it would still be extremely difficult for most people to buy condoms in their local village or town.  Vending machines are necessary and unless we make provision for them in the legislation we will have made very little progress.</P>
    <P>The question of the age limit must also be addressed and changed, as it will be impossible to implement.  Condoms will be available to a person aged 17 years and one day while a person two days younger will not have access to them. Who will be the judge and jury in this regard?  There is no point in introducing legislation which cannot be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the haste with which this legislation is being brought in. It is very difficult for someone like me who has a long term interest in this subject because I had to make my views known in the &ldquo;letters to the editor&rdquo; column.  The way we organise business in this House is a disgrace.  I regret that the five minutes in which I have to speak will be the only contribution from a woman Member.  The lack of family planning grievously affects women.</P>
      <P>The whole debate is furtive, it is as if we are ashamed of what we are doing here.  This is only the third time that family planning has been discussed in this House, in 1979, 1985 and today. Members should think about the message this debate is sending out, it is a message that it is something shameful, which we cannot discuss openly or debate honestly. It is restricted in the most dreadful way. We are in the medieval age with regard to contraception.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Health, who I am convinced cares and knows better, has not had the courage and leadership to go all the way and to have a proper debate.  We do not need laws, we need to provide information, facilities and to ensure that everyone who is sexually active has a responsible attitude to family planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have a debate it should be <Col N="798" /> an open, honest one.  Let us look at the total area of family planning and the needs in relation to it.  We should take account of the awful circumstances from January of this year in relation to the High Court and Supreme Court cases on the young woman who was raped and subsequently became pregnant.  That is part of this debate and we are very remiss in having such a limited and small section in this Bill and leaving out all the other areas.  I should like to have the area of information discussed; the Minister missed a wonderful opportunity to amend the 1979 Act to enable us to have proper information outlets and policies with regard to family planning and, if necessary, abortion referral.</P>
    <P>I stress the need to change the whole approach to family planning from the medical approach.  Far too many Irish women are on the pill.  Many women who would not have access to family planning clinics or to GPs who would have a sympathetic approach to all forms of family planning will tend to take the pill. In many instances this is very bad for them.  Problems like varicose veins or other medical conditions may arise. There should be a promotion campaign to inform men and women about the various forms of contraception, where they can get them and what is safe for them.  The thrust of the Bill to make condoms more readily available is right but we must go much further.  Condoms are readily available and their use does not interfere with a person's physical state.  They have been proved to be effective.</P>
    <P>I join with other speakers on this side of the House who have condemned the age limit and have suggested that it is ludicrous not to allow condoms to be sold through slot machines.  The sky will not fall if we agree to give people freedom of choice by allowing slot machines.  We should let individuals make their own decisions.  What will happen to the 11 slot machines which are already in position? Are the Garda Síochána to be deployed, when the Bill is passed, to take away these slot machines?  That question must <Col N="799" /> be answered, given the explicit condition in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask for greater information on the availability of family planning.  I have in mind information which would be provided by the Department of Health.  I asked some time ago what information is available to people who want to know the various forms of family planning.  I was referred by the Department of Health to the <i>Mother and Child Book,</i> a delightful book published for young mothers to tell them about feeding their babies and the first developmental steps. That is an inappropriate response to somebody who inquires about family planning.  I would hope that we would reach maturity.</P>
    <P>We will not get the chance, during this furtive and hasty debate, to educate and inform people, to tell them that they are perfectly entitled to plan their family and to adopt a responsible approach to sex if they are sexually active, so that children who are not wanted are not conceived and we can reduce the number of women going abroad for abortions and the huge number of children conceived outside marriage, most of whom are not wanted and end up in the deprived zone of society, poor, uneducated and without a proper chance in life.</P>
    <P>I would wish for a fuller debate and a more generous and open approach to this legislation.  One must welcome it as a means of improving the awful position which exists but it does not go far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of participating in this debate and the recognition of the need for the broader availability of condoms in a range of retail outlets.  I do not believe there will be a huge number of retailers indicating a desire to sell condoms.  A number of outlets may decide to do so but could find there is not a market for them.  In some areas there may be a problem with regard to attitude to over-the-counter sales.  This will not work as well in rural society as it may in urban society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is progressive in certain areas but I am not wholly satisfied that it <Col N="800" /> goes as far as I would wish.  I say that as a young, sexually active person who is also a parent.  Some colleagues opposite have indicated that there should not be an age restriction but I cannot agree fully with that view.  The Minister has indicated two important elements, the public health aspect and the bringing of family planning legislation more into line with current public thinking.</P>
    <P>I am very familiar with problems in relation to sexually transmitted diseases, particularly HIV and AIDS, and the numbers of deaths in this category.  The Eastern Health Board figures indicate that there have been 188 deaths from AIDS and 272 cases of AIDS identified. God knows the number of unidentified cases.  The cost implications of the development of services to cater for AIDS are mind boggling.  It will continue to account for a huge proportion of the health budget for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for Health concerning the number of single parent births over the past 25 years.  I have not the exact figures with me but I recall that in that period the figure rose from about 290 to 7,000.  I do not know how many single parent births are unwanted or what effect the greater availability of condoms would have.  Condoms have been available through family planning outlets for some time.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is of paramount importance that the spread of HIV infection is curtailed and he referred to the range of recommendations made by the national AIDS strategy committee towards this end.  He said that the recommendations have been accepted by him and are being implemented.</P>
    <P>The National AIDS Strategy Committee in their conclusions and recommendations cited eight short-term recommendations and nine longer term recommendations.  In the short-term recommendations they state that the legislation should be amended to allow for the sale of condoms from vending machines and for the distribution of free condoms by statutory and voluntary agencies involved in HIV prevention. That is an important <Col N="801" /> recommendation.  I am pleased the Minister has indicated that these recommendations have been accepted by him and are being implemented.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter in another forum this morning and at a meeting last week at which I strongly supported the recommendation of the National AIDS Strategy Committee regarding vending machines.  To avoid being misunderstood in regard to this matter, I want to state clearly that I would not like to see a vending machine in every public toilet or on the corner of every street.  That would not be the correct approach.  When I raised this matter in the other forum to which I referred, I said that vending machines should be placed in venues where people are more likely to make sexual advances &mdash; disco bars, nightclubs and so on &mdash; where people of 17 or 18 years of age and over attend.  Disco bars and nightclubs usually do not open until midnight or afterwards, or at least people do not frequent them until late at night. I do not envisage people under the age of 17 years being allowed to gain entry to such establishments or using the condom machines that would be provided there. As the Minister has taken on board the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee will he clarify whether vending machines will be introduced by ministerial order?</P>
    <P>In section 4 (1) (b) the Minister prohibits the sale of condoms from vending machines.  I welcome the fact that he prohibits their sale at other outlets, but there seems to be a contradiction between the Minister's speech and some sections of the Bill.  Therefore, I would welcome clarification on this aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the public health issues and strategy in relation to the prevention of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.  It is important to refer to a report circulated by the Eastern Health Board in relation to services for HIV and AIDS patients which stated that, whatever the target population, the core message is the same.  HIV is spread by sexual intercourse and the sharing of dirty needles.  If we can ensure that the recommendations of the National AIDS <Col N="802" /> Strategy Committee on the free distribution of condoms by statutory and voluntary agencies and the sale of condoms from vending machines are implemented, it would be a step towards meeting that core message that condoms should be made available to help in the prevention and spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV, which may lead to AIDS.</P>
    <P>I regret that we have very little time to discuss the Bill, but I look forward to the Minister clarifying the points I made and further participation on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I regret the way this legislation is being handled by the Government.  While I recognise that it represents progress, small though it may be, the fact is that we had to wait for more than a year for the original Bill to be withdrawn and this new Bill to be circulated.  That reflects the difficulties the Government have in trying to approach this issue within their own ranks.  As this Bill is being rushed through the House in a very short Second Stage debate, and an equally short Committee Stage debate, some of the fundamental issues will not be dealt with and will, in fact, be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamentals we should lay down are the right, if not the duty, of the Government to provide for proper fertility control, an issue that, unfortunately, was not addressed in any comprehensive way at the recent Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.  That must be addressed by this Government in the overall context of social planning and direction.  The right of individuals to privacy as a paramount concept in regard to regulating and legislating for family planning purposes has been lost.  We should respect the right to privacy of people who are past the age of puberty <Col N="803" /> and who wish to engage in free and responsible sex.</P>
    <P>Because we have forgotten, if not overlooked these basic rights, the legislation before the House is seriously flawed and disappointing.  This is not a family planning Bill, it is incorrectly titled.  It includes very narrow proposals in some respects and primarily deals with the availability of condoms.  For example, issues relating to the availability of resources to the health authorities to educate people about the responsible use of family planning devices are overlooked in the Bill.  In particular, a sectarian provision in section 9 of the 1979 Act should have been deleted.  The provision enabling resources to be provided for research into &ldquo;natural family planning methods&rdquo;, as they are described, is blatant sectarian legislation that should be deleted.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the issue of tubal ligation which has generated controversy recently by the two-handed act of Bishop Casey who did a secret deal behind the backs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889 &mdash; section 3 in particular &mdash; should have been addressed in this legislation to make it possible for advertisements with regard to family planning, and devices to be used for family planning purposes, not to be the subject of prosecution or restriction in the way provided for under that Victorian legislation.  We should not fool ourselves in this regard.  I do not want to take away from the arguments the Minister is <Col N="804" /> advancing about the importance of the condom as a device to aid in the campaign against the spread of AIDS.  That is an important aspect of the legislation but is not the primary one.  The Minister is being a little disingenuous in attempting to float this legislation through for public health reasons only.  We recognise that condoms are a useful device in regulating unwanted pregnancies.  It is a very good device in the campaign and fight against abortion and the number of women who travel on a daily basis to England to avail of abortion services there.  That is the primary reason we are arguing for more availability of condoms.  The restriction on the vending machine device should go.  Not one Deputy who has contributed, from whatever party, has argued for the restriction to be maintained.  I hope the Minister will take that point on board on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Currently there are vast areas of the country that do not have available to them a simple condom device because chemists, for their own particular reasons, will not sell them.  That is their decision.  I do not see the climate of that locality changing simply because of this legislation but I do see an opportunity arising where a vending machine becomes, so to speak, part of the furniture of the public house, the dancehall or wherever couples frequent as in Britain and in Northern Ireland.  If the Minister is serious about ensuring that condoms have a wide circulation the vending machine is realistically the only vehicle by which to achieve that objective.  May I ask for guidance when five minutes remains?</P>

      <P>I wish to share some of my time with Deputy Byrne.  I am concerned about the provisions in the legislation with regard to spermicides and, indeed, the way in which the pill will now become less readily available because of the way in which &ldquo;contraception&rdquo; is being redefined.  I would ask the Minister to reflect on that point <Col N="805" /> before Committee Stage.  We should be arguing for greater availability of these devices, not for their restriction.  I do not accept the arguments put forward by the Minister that they have to be differentiated from other non-medical devices.  In particular, the provisions with regard to spermicides must be examined.</P>
      <P>As someone who was not here to contribute to the earlier debates on previous legislation, I bow to those who were in the House and who like to recall the years 1972 to 1974.  As we approach the conclusion of Second Stage we can pat ourselves on the back that this House has taken the opportunity to debate in a cold, cool and logical way very important legislation. I hope that, because of the way the debate has been structured and the responsible way in which Members have contributed, the Minister for Health will take on board the points made by Deputies on all sides of the House with regard to certain provisions in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow I hope to see substantial amendments being tabled by the Minister to reflect points being expressed, such as the question of the age limit which cannot be policed and is unworkable.  Time will not allow us on this side of the House to table all the amendments that need to be tabled to improve this legislation.  The onus rests on the Minister, in view of the opinions that have been presented, not only from this side of the House but from within his own party to table such amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCartan for allowing me five minutes of his time. I stand here today as the first inner city Deputy to contribute; in fact I share a common constituency with the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell.  Like me I am sure the Minister is aware of the crisis and the number of families that have been afflicted with HIV and AIDS-related deaths.  It is not an exaggeration to say that in Dublin South inner city there is a death per week <Col N="806" /> resulting from AIDS.  I am amazed that the Minister, who would be conscious of this fact, being a medical doctor, has put so many restrictions in the Bill.  The stark facts are that in Dublin alone &mdash; and this is backed up by the report of the national AIDS strategy committee &mdash; there are between 2,000 and 7,000 drug abusers.  The Minister's statistics showed that 1,250 people have tested HIV positive.  What the Minister did not tell the House and what the House should be made fully aware of is that while 1,250 may appear to be a relatively smal proportion of the population, it takes eight to ten years of an incubation period before it can be medically proved that one is HIV positive.</P>
      <P>The national rate for live births to unmarried women is 16.5 per cent.  In parts of Dublin city, in community care areas, the rate is 20 per cent and in other parts of the city there is an even higher percentage.  Drug abuse and sexual activity are rampant.  If we look at the statistics for people seeking accommodation from local authorities we see a number of single parents on that list.  The Eastern Health Board provide the startling figures relating to the number of births outside marriage.  The Bill before us indicates we are washing our hands of the realities of life.  The realities of life in Dublin city are frightening. The Minister has an obligation to the House to be brave and tackle these problems with which he has the power to deal.  I cannot understand the logic of the Minister's position when he says he is personally in favour of dispensing machines.  He argues that he favours reducing the age limit even further or abolishing it altogether.  Who is dictating to him?  He is the Minister with the power to bring in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was appointed Minister for Health, looking all Members of the House straight in the eye he said he would not allow the <Col N="807" /> Church to dictate anything to him.  Who is now dictating that the most convenient method of making condoms available through vending machines should not be permissible?  Five minutes is a farcical amount of time in which to endeavour to make the points which need to be made. If there is any time remaining at the end of the Fine Gael contributions perhaps I could be awarded another ten minutes to make a few more points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to oblige Deputy Byrne if that were possible but I wish to share my time with Deputy Reynolds and we have approximately five minutes each.  Lest anything I might say later would be interpreted differently I should say, first, I have no objection to contraceptives being made available to those who wish to use them. It is not the duty of legislators to choose between any set of moral beliefs.</P>
      <P>I have serious reservations about the manner in which this debate has developed not merely in the House today.  I contend that the public debate over the past 12 months lacked a certain element in that contributors to this debate, especially when speaking to and about young people, should express the view that sexual activity outside of marriage is wrong and should be discouraged. One would glean the impression from the public debate on this issue that sexual activity on the part of young people is something to be encouraged whereas exactly the opposite should be the case. I want to put that clearly on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that young people would be embarrassed purchasing condoms, that they should be available for sale from vending machines.  I have no great hangup about that aspect.  But do we hear any responsible adult say to young people that they should not engage in sexual activity until they are in a mature, stable relationship?  That needs to be said in this debate.  The impression being created in the media, probably also unwittingly on the part of some politicians, is that there is something wrong with teenagers who are not sexually active, that they are not <Col N="808" /> normal.  That impression should not be created in the course of this debate. There are four teenage children of each sex in our family.  My wife and I endeavour to advise our children not to engage in sexual activity.  That is a duty and responsibility of all parents.  We should not under estimate young people's desire to behave sensibly and responsibly but, for Heaven's sake, let us encourage rather than brainwash them.</P>
    <P>I listened to a programme broadcast on RTE 1 on Monday last, &ldquo;Queuing for a Living&rdquo;, presented by Paddy O'Gorman. He interviewed people who had engaged in petty crime, such as shoplifting, handbag snatching and so on as they left a courtroom.  I was amazed at the attitudes of some of the people he interviewed.  I asked myself what is wrong with us, as a society, that people should have such attitudes?  At the time I was travelling down a busy street in Galway, when immediately my question was answered.  I was approaching pedestrian traffic lights.  There was a child of about four years of age vigorously pushing the button.  I stopped, thinking the child would run across the road but, as soon as the light changed to red, the child continued on the same side of the road. I rolled down the car window and said to the child in a rather stern, but not aggressive manner, &ldquo;Please do not push the button unless you wish to cross the street.&rdquo;  Fifty yards on I was held up at a main junction, by which time the child had caught up with his mother, who seemed to be a respectable, ordinary woman.  I saw her approach my car in the side mirror.  I assumed she was coming over to apologise for her child.  Instead she said, &ldquo;Pádraic, you had no authority at all to do that.  You have upset my child very much.&rdquo;  I maintain it should have been the child's parent's responsibility to correct him, not mine.  Probably I lost a vote but I hope I did that mother and child some good.</P>
    <P>I contend that parents are not sufficiently responsible, not merely in relation to the subject before us.  We listened too long to Dr. Spock.  Dr. Spock and Irish parents have much to answer <Col N="809" /> for.  Let us take our responsibilities seriously and talk to our children about discipline and responsibility.  That incident in Galway on Monday last was more enlightening for me than 100 lectures on parents' responsibilities.  I hope it will have done some good.</P>
    <P>We should take our responsibilities in this matter seriously.  We are all in this together, let us play our rightful part.  If we adopt an attitude of openness and responsibility to our children then where condoms may be available, whether in pubs, shops, through vending machines, or on the roadside, will matter much less.  I acknowledge that it is not an easy task but it will be much less difficult once we begin to educate our young people in proper sexual behaviour, with proper sex education in our schools and particularly within our families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for sharing his time with me. Deputy Creed said we should legislate for reality, not morality.  I contend the Minister has become caught between two stools, is endeavouring to legislate for both, which is extremely difficult.  We legislators must legislate for what is taking place in the real world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an urban-rural divide in the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister has introduced the Bill without taking into account extreme difficulties encountered in many rural areas on the part of young, sexually active people who experience great difficulty finding non-medical contraceptives or condoms.  While appreciating that the Minister has been progressive in his endeavours he has not taken these difficulties into account.  The provisions of this Bill will not render their task any easier.  If any young person attempts to ask for a packet of condoms in any outlet in rural areas he or she will be asked many questions, with many comments being made simultaneously, which will inhibit them.  This can be resolved only by installing vending <Col N="810" /> machines in public places.  I do not recommend their installation at every corner or public place nationwide.  Proprietors of pubs, discos and the like should be allowed decide whether they want them installed on their premises.</P>
    <P>I happen to live approximately ten miles from Northern Ireland and have socialised there along with friends.  In recent years condom vending machines have been installed in public places in Northern Ireland.  The people of Northern Ireland, and none of my friends, suffer any sexual depravity because of the availability of condom vending machines there.</P>
    <P>We have much to answer for because of the lack of sex education in this country. However, the time available does not allow me go into that matter in greater detail.  I perceive this to be a type of &ldquo;nod and wink&rdquo; Bill because its provisions mean that young people will have to ask for condoms in retail outlets.  Privacy is essential in sexual relationships.  None is afforded when somebody must ask a barman, or a shop assistant, for a packet of condoms.</P>
    <P>While an age limit on the purchase of condoms may be morally plausible I contend it is totally unnecessary and will be impossible to police. Numerous Members have made the point that the provisions of the intoxicating liquor legislation here are not capable of being policed.  As a country, we experience major difficulties with regard to under-age drinking.  I predict we will experience the same difficulties with regard to the age limit on the purchase of condoms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my introductory remarks, the provisions of this Bill are urgently required to tackle the problems of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.  I am pleased to see there is a consensus in this House that the thrust of the measures proposed in the Bill are a practical and sensible contribution towards this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the 17 year age limit, the <Col N="811" /> Bill provides that condoms may be supplied from a wide range of outlets and that the age at which persons can obtain condoms should be reduced from 18 years to 17 years.  Deputies will be aware that I have already referred to the representations and the approaches which I have received from parents &mdash; not fundamentalists or anyone like that, just concerned parents &mdash; that I must take into account.  I am not legislating for John O'Connell.  This is a Bill with full Government approval to meet the needs of the people and to respect the fears and anxieties of parents.  We are all parents, we all have children and we are all genuinely and understandably concerned. Whatever our own personal views on this subject are, we must take cognisance of the views and reservations of parents in implementing legislation which provides for the wider availability of condoms.  We must strike the correct balance between the concerns of these parents and the requirement to take measures to protect public health.</P>
    <P>It can be contended that the present Bill in the context of an age limit of 17 is consistent with the development of the preventive elements of the National AIDS Strategy Committee and the dictates imposed by the continuing high prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases.</P>
    <P>It does not interfere with the right of married couples under the age of 17 years to obtain contraceptives freely.  I will also have to consider the question of single parents.  It also contains a provision which enables contraceptives to be sold to a person under the age of 17 years in respect of whom a prescription has been issued by a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>It can be contended that the Bill represents a significant liberalisation of outlets through which condoms may be sold and, by extension, greater access to condoms for those who require them.</P>
    <P>I would say that there is nothing very special about vending machines.  What I want to say is that we have had the notion here that sex is sinful.  This notion has <Col N="812" /> permeated our society for a very long time.  Maybe it is a good idea that we ask people to go up and ask for them; there is nothing disgraceful, nothing wrong, nothing sinful, nothing morally wrong in sexually active people asking for condoms.</P>

      <P>We want to get rid of the notion that sex is wrong.  Maybe the best thing we have ever done is to ask people to do this, to go and ask for condoms. We have come a long way from the time of the debate on the 1985 Bill. We would be appalled today if the 1979 Bill were brought in but it met the needs of the time.  The 1985 followed.  While we must make the public understand, we have to realise and have concern for their feelings and fears.  This is a good measure, but I wonder what would have been the response had I said that there would be total deregulation.  I would love to read the speeches that would have been made by Opposition Members.  I was congratulated by an Opposition spokesman for the stand I took in liberalising their availability as far as possible. I have gone some way towards meeting the wishes of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to respond to a number of points raised.  Deputy Howlin mentioned the position in regard to oral contraceptives. Such products are technically subject to the provisions of the family planning legislation and of the controls relating to medical preparations operated by the Department of Health in conjunction with the National Drugs Advisory Board.  In reviewing the requirements to meet the evolving AIDS problem I <Col N="813" /> formed the view that it is not essential to maintain the controls over them under the family planning legislation.  I felt it was much more important that they come under legislation dealing with medicines. Condoms are primarily designed to prevent conception and I am satisfied that the sale of condoms for other purposes, such as to prevent infection, would not be precluded under the Bill.  That is my thinking.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the supply of contraceptives.  On the basis of discussions with the Office of the Attorney General I gathered that the ordinary dictionary and everyday meaning of supply relates to continuous commercial activity where transactions take place between persons or companies re goods or services. These meanings do not relate to <i>ad hoc</i> activities between individuals and the Bill does not purport to control any such <i>ad hoc</i> activities.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables the Minister to provide grants to assist research into methods of family planning that do not relate to the use of contraceptives but the Minister may grant-aid a variety of organisations under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953.  The Minister can make grants available for other types of research&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A health authority may with the approval of the Minister, give assistance in any one or more of the following ways to any body which provides or proposes to provide a service similar or ancillary to a service which the health authority may provide:</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the point that there is provision.  I would be very opposed to the sectarian approach and would not want it included.</P>
      <P>Deputies Bruton and De Rossa made a point about a prohibition on treatments for sexually transmitted diseases under the Indecent Advertising Act, 1889, as amended by the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 and contended that this was carried into the Family Planning Act, 1979. I would like to clarify that the Venereal Disease Act, 1917 does allow such advertising by health authorities.  There is no need for an amendment to the 1979 Act to enable such advertisements to be placed.</P>
      <P>I wish to make some further points about advertising.  I will be making some changes to the regulations which are in force under the 1979 Act.  I have indicated a number of areas where I will be bringing forward new regulations and, during Committee Stage tomorrow, I will explain how certain of the current regulations will no longer apply in the light of the repeal of sections of the principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the regulations which I will be considering in detail is the current provision with regard to advertising and display of contraceptives.  Section 7 of the 1979 Act provided that a person could <Col N="815" /> not take part in, or procure, the publication of an advertisement or notice in relation to contraception or contraceptives or display, or procure the display of, contraceptives except in accordance with regulations.</P>
    <P>The 1980 regulations provided that publication or display should be (a) related to family planning services authorised under the Act or (b) reasonably necessary for the purposes of informing: (i) persons providing family planning services under the Act; (ii) registered medical practitioners; (iii) registered chemists and druggists; (iv) registered nurses; (v) trainee doctors, chemists or nurses, or (c) where the publication or display is arranged by or on behalf of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is fairly obvious that these provisions are out of date.  All Deputies will agree with me on that.  They were framed at a time when the acceptability of advertising and displaying condoms, for example, was quite different.</P>
    <P>Today we are talking about a serious public health issue.  We want to encourage young people and all who are sexually active and may be at risk to take sensible precautions against both sexually transmissible diseases and unwanted pregnancies. This is important.  The new outlets should be able to display condoms, as should the traditional outlets, many of which may have had concerns about advertising and displaying contraceptives for some time.</P>
    <P>I will be looking at the changes which should be made to the current regulations to bring them into line with the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed mentioned the lack of educational programmes on sexuality in the formal schools system.  I intend to have discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Education, on this issue of AIDS but I would like to clarify that the Departments of Health and Education are implementing an AIDS education programme in secondary schools at present.  Teachers have received guidance on how the programme is to be delivered.  The programme has been well received and I am happy to say that internationally <Col N="816" /> the AIDS education programme for schools has been praised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes was adamant in making the point about fundamental rights but he was singularly silent during the debate on the Bill in 1985 when he was a Minister. He said he did not think there would be any increase in the number of outlets selling condoms in a year's time.  If retail outlets will not sell condoms over the counter we have no reason to believe they will accept vending machines.  Deputy Higgins was very quiet at that time.  If he had radical views he kept them very much to himself.</P>

      <P>The Bill is an appropriate response to this issue at this time. As I said, as legislators we have an obligation to listen to the views of the public; we do not have a monopoly on wisdom in regard to this matter.  We have to be guided by the views and concerns of the people we represent.  A number of improvements have been made in this Bill which take account of the concerns expressed about the previous Bill.  This is a serious issue which needs to be tackled urgently.  This is why the Government allocated time for a debate on this Bill before the summer recess.  We need to act now in the interests of public health.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the Deputies for the reasons I have outlined.  I believe the Bill will meet the wishes of the majority of Irish citizens.  I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  From my experience as an office holder I am aware of the substantial resources available to a Department and to a Minister in the preparation of replies to questions.  Would the Taoiseach not share my concern &mdash; unprompted by Deputy Flaherty's intervention &mdash; that there has been a regrettable anti-democratic practice creeping into the halls of the various Departments of denying Deputies the maximum information, giving Deputies as little information as possible and making it as difficult as possible for us to obtain the answer to a question?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that such an unwitting attempt by Ministers in the various Departments to prevent Deputies from having access to information which must be democratically accounted for is against the spirit of the Republican Constitution of which we are all proud?

      <P>The Deputy would agree that on many occasions since I became Taoiseach I have been criticised for giving answers which were too long rather than too short.  I have never withheld information.  I try to be as informative as I can be.  If there are any instances where other Departments are falling into the trap of giving minimum information, as suggested by the Deputy, I will have the message transmitted to all Departments that this House is to be given the maximum amount of information consistent with the parameters I have set out in my answer.</P>

The questions have gone the rounds.  They went to the Minister for Energy who refused to answer them in the House and refused to deal with the issues as he said that they were not his responsibility.  They then went back to the Taoiseach's office and they were again transferred, this time to the Minister for Finance.  Does the Taoiseach consider that is honouring the spirit of democracy?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject entirely that something was approved by me personally, as the Deputy said, I do not personally approve anything.  The office which I held at any time would be an instrument.  For the Deputy to say that I approved of something as Taoiseach and then did not take the question is not accurate.  The question was sent to the Department of Energy because it related to an energy matter but it transpired that more information was available in a different Department and that it was later transferred to that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the considerable dissatisfaction of the Independent Deputies about the way priority question time works, particularly on a Tuesday when the questions are addressed to the Taoiseach?  Usually there are a great many questions to the Taoiseach on a Tuesday and the only questions generally reached are those given priority.  No doubt the Taoiseach is aware that the Independent Deputies are not entitled to table any priority questions and, furthermore, if our questions are taken in conjunction with priority questions &mdash; and this will probably happen to my question today &mdash; I am not entitled to ask any supplementary questions.</P>

      <P>In his earlier reply, the Taoiseach indicated that he always gave comprehensive replies to questions.  I do not think that was the reason the question was tabled to him.  Would the Taoiseach agree that Members experience great difficulties in getting a definite answer from some Departments, particularly from the Department of Agriculture and Food? Quite often this leaves a Deputy more <Col N="823" /> frustrated.  If the Department gave the Deputy the specific information he requested, he would not have to resort to tabling a parliamentary question.  Would the Taoiseach investigate that specific complaint?</P>

The Department of Agriculture and Food have the worst record in this respect.  Would the Taoiseach ensure that the procedures that are now in place in the Department of Social <Col N="824" /> Welfare are put in place in the Department of Agriculture and Food so that we can get the information from the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In their report for the year ended 31 October 1986, published in 1987, the Public Service Advisory Council stated, in the context of the merging of the Department of Public Service with the Department of Finance, that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>it would seem appropriate that consideration should now be given to resting the Public Service Advisory Council, pending a new approach to the reorganisation of the Public Service.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Minister for Finance did not appoint members to the council when the term of office of the then existing members expired.  Since then, a number of measures to improve the organisation, efficiency and effectiveness of the public service have been taken. These have included: the rationalisation of the number and functions of State-sponsored bodies; the establishment in 1988 of the efficiency audit group, with strong representation from the private sector to examine working practices and procedures in each Department with a view to improving efficiency and effective savings; the introduction in 1991 of the system of delegated administrative budgets in Government Departments designed to improve management and efficiency and to reduce the real costs of adminstration; the formulation of proposals and up-date and expand the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Legislation for this will be circulated during the summer recess and major proposals for restructuring the Civil Service grading system with a view to achieving efficiency improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme of reform is still in progress and, at this stage, I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to reactivate <Col N="826" /> the Public Service Advisory Council.  However, I will keep the matter under review in the light of future developments in the organisation of the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I am pleased to note that legislation to expand the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General will come before the House.  Would the Minister agree that the weakness of the Public Service Advisory Council arose from the fact that their report went to the Department of Finance but if members were reappointed to this council, together with the requirement that they report jointly to the Department and a committee of this House, this would have the effect of their reports being actively considered and then acted upon?  Would the Minister consider taking that approach if he were to re-appoint members to the Public Service Advisory Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>While the reports of the efficiency audit group are not coming before the House, the Deputy will appreciate they are having a major effect on Departments.  At this stage the two major reports they have completed in the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Defence have been very effective. The single disadvantage is that the report is not public as it is an internal report, but I would like to see this work through the system for some time because a great many of the procedures they recommended are still not totally established. We should leave things to them for some time.  The Public Service Advisory Council found themselves in a position where they were hamstrung and were unable to effect the efficiencies they desired.  However, the efficiency audit group are working effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider extending the role of the Public Service Advisory Council so that they would not only take into account the matters being considered by the efficiency audit group but topics such as good morale in the public service, which <Col N="827" /> would necessitate good industrial relations practices, and the services best delivered by the public service directly and those best hived off to the State bodies or the private sector?  I believe matters of that kind could be very actively and properly considered by the Public Service Advisory Council and perhaps the Minister will respond to that aspect of my question.  Would the Minister agree the problem arose because the Public Service Advisory Council reported only to the Department of Finance and their reports became an everyday event but if the reports were laid before a committee of this House as well as the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some points of merit have emerged from what the Deputy has just said.  The new remit that the Comptroller and Auditor General will give to the Committee of Public Accounts might allow for some of these suggestions to be adopted.  However, if that is not the case, perhaps we can look again at appointing members to the Public Service Advisory Council.  It would be futile to re-establish the council if other bodies are undertaking their functions.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the opening budgetary position for 1993 on the basis of the Exchequer returns at the half-year position, and having regard to the commitments already made in respect of expenditure in 1993 and the loss of yield to the Exchequer coming from changes in DIRT and the application of VAT at the point of entry.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The end-June Exchequer returns showing total Exchequer borrowing of £647 million in the first half of the year were broadly in line with expectations and compare very favourably with the position at the same stage last year.  Tax receipts are performing satisfactorily, and although the 9 per cent increase on the yield during the first six months of 1991 will drop back as the year progresses, there should be a margin sufficient to cover much of the emerging upward pressure on social spending.  In any event, the Government are reviewing the potential for securing savings so as to ensure that expenditure will be held as closely as possible to the budget provisions.  In consequence, I do not expect the EBR out-turn to exceed significantly the budget target.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my statement on their release, the end-June returns provide further evidence that the Irish economy continues to turn in a creditable performance against a difficult international background.  They indicate that the view of economic prospects that underpinned the 1992 budget is being substantially borne out.  I am particularly pleased by the confirmation the revenue returns give, in the payroll-related components, that employment is holding up well. Nevertheless, the unfavourable economic trends abroad, whose knock-on is directly affecting the unemployment figures, undoubtedly make it more difficult to achieve the employment gains we need.  For that reason, it is vital to preserve the domestic conditions that were of decisive importance in reviving growth and turning around employment over the past few years &mdash; especially the budgetary discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the challenge that faces me in framing a budget for 1993.  I have already acknowledged that the slow international recovery, with its indirect implications for certain spending areas, makes for a more difficult scenario than had been anticipated last autumn.  Moreover, there are, as the question recognises, <Col N="829" /> additional pressures arising from certain factors that come into play in 1993, particularly on account of the EC internal market.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that notwithstanding these pressures the Government are determined to bring in a budget which both accords with the need for prudent management of the public finances, keeping us on course for participation from the outset in European Monetary Union, and otherwise contributes to economic and social progress. As regards the ending of VAT at point-of-entry on goods sourced in other EC member states, I have already announced my intention to provide in a supplementary 1992 Finance Bill for measures to offset its adverse implications for Exchequer cash-flow.  The Government's commitment to ensure that public expenditure for 1993 is kept within the tight bounds necessary in these circumstances is also made clear in the strict parameters that I have laid down in the Estimates circular recently issued to Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for his reply.  Would he confirm the remarks attributed to him in the news media that the Government have now abandoned their medium-term fiscal targets for 1993; that the Government do not intend to bring in a broadly balanced budget, as stated in the Programme for Government, and that his intention to bring in a current budget deficit in excess of 2 per cent is Government policy?  If that is Government policy, I put it to the Minister that that is undermining confidence in the economy, is undermining his credibility, will tend to continue upward pressure on interest rates and is not consistent with the targets outlined by the Taoiseach, and by Cabinet, during the Maastricht Treaty debate to bring Ireland to the position in which it needs to be in 1997 consistent with European Monetary Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>What the 1993 EBR will be is a matter that will be decided about Christmas time.  I assure the Deputy that <Col N="830" /> no decision for next year has been made, six months earlier than usual.  What I said and what was correctly attributed to me by the news media was that the factors that underlined the 1.5 per cent EBR for 1993 in the Programme for Government were based on certain economic facts and indicators.  Those figures differ in two major areas.  Unemployment is now about 31 per cent higher than it was in the earlier part of last year, to which the Department of Finance figures used in the discussions between the Government parties held a little later than this time last year, related.  The cost in the unemployment area is £100 million and a combination of other elements come to approximately £100 million.  There is social welfare indexation, and other non-pay aspects agreed for inclusion in the targets for this year and next year.  Social welfare indexation stood at 3.75 per cent, based on the long term unemployment figures of 6 per cent.  Social welfare carryover figures also were not fully reflected. If one were to make a direct comparison between what the targets were last year when we discussed the Programme for Government and the parallel position now, those figures would suggest an EBR somewhere between 2.1 per cent and 2.2 per cent.  That is the point I made.  The Government have to reflect on the way that should be handled.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Noonan that 1993 will be an extremely difficult year.  The cutbacks and the control on public expenditure that will be required for next year will be severe because of the Internal Market &mdash; which the Deputy referred to &mdash; and because the pay figures for next year show a requirement for an additional £350 million.  What I was signalling last week was that the addition of another £200 million is something I do not believe will be possible.  I did not upset the markets who have been indicating that since last February.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;that there will be an extravagant increase in borrowing next year and that the budget wil not be in broad balance.  Is the Minister aware that that is continuing to undermine his credibility as a Minister, the undermining of which commenced at the time of the budget and the Finance Bill, by the deferral of so many commitments to next year?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is not completely unaware of the markets' reactions to the budgetary targets in recent months and weeks and that there is great satisfaction with the six month figures, which were better than the markets had forecasted.  I am glad all the financial markets in statements made following the publication of last week's figures were complimentary in relation to Government policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 15, 16, 23 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>At present the Office of Public Works operate visitor facilities at 38 national heritage properties, and these were visited by over 1.5 million people last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 16 visitor centres being built under our current programme.  The location of visitor centres is inextricably linked to the location of the heritage property it serves.  Visitor centres seek to balance the conservation of the heritage property with facilitating public appreciation of that special property.  This <Col N="833" /> cannot be achieved successfully if the visitor centre is located away from the property which it is intended to serve.  Visitor centres are usually located at the periphery of the park or other heritage property, where visitor access can be planned in harmony with the conservation of the site.  The purpose of such visitor centres is to provide a first-hand experience of the site, in balance with the protection of the property.</P>
    <P>National heritage sites are established either under current legislation, as in the case of national nature reserves and national monuments, or by Government decision, as is the case with our national parks.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have a wide range of expertise among their staff.  This expertise is availed of in choosing the locations for visitor facilities.  The range of expertise includes architectural, engineering, archaeological and ecological disciplines, as well as experience in planning for and managing visitors.  Under the present programme the centres for the Phoenix Park, Tara, Coole and Killarney National Parks are located in existing buildings.  In each of the other cases, the site was chosen by the staff of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Under section 84 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the Office of Public Works are obliged to consult the planning authority for the area in which a development is proposed.  The Office of Public Works have fulfilled their statutory obligations in full in respect of all of these projects, and will continue to do so.  I would like to point out also that, in respect of the more controversial visitor centre proposals at Wicklow and the Burren, the Office of Public Works completed the purchase of the proposed sites only following consultations with the relevant local authorities, who agreed to the locations in principle.  Furthermore, in the case of the Dunquin site, this was selected following consultation with a community-based group, Fondúireacht an Bhlascaóid.  The Boyne Valley site was selected following a planning study <Col N="834" /> by an independent consultant.  The location and estimated cost for each centre is as follows:</P>

The statement accepts the Office of Public Works's views and decisions on the centres at An Bhlascaóid Mór and Wicklow but advises the Office of Public Works that there are some doubts in relation to the procedure adopted by the Office of Public Works in reaching their decision that an EIA was not necessary for the proposed visitor centre at Mullaghmore.</P>
    <P>My advice is that the Directive has been fully complied with.  An EIA does not have to be carried out for a visitor centre under articles 2 and 4.2, unless the competent authorities in the member state consider that its characteristics so require.  The Office of Public Works, as a competent authority under the EIA regulations, did not consider that the characteristics of this project required an EIA.  The Department of the Environment agree with this view.  The decision here is one for the member state and this is absolutely clear from the Directive.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the views of the competent authorities, the Government decided, because of various concerns expressed to them, that an EIA would be carried out for this centre, and that process is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have issued a response to the statement referred to setting out these points and I can say that the Office of Public Works are satisfied that all European Community Directives are being fully complied with and that the EC funding already approved for this project will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I have received a submission from An Taisce enclosing a copy of a visual impact assessment of the proposed visitor centre for the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  An independent environmental impact statement was commissioned for this project; the statement was published; public comments were sought and received and all views were taken into account in the subsequent assessment by the Office of Public Works and by Wicklow <Col N="836" /> County Council.  The environmental impact assessment concluded that no significant adverse environmental impacts would arise from the proposal.  It was accepted by the planning authority, Wicklow County Council.  I am satisfied that the location is the most suitable site for the visitor centre in all the circumstances. The project has been through an extensive planning and consultation process.  In the light of the foregoing, I approved the placing of the contract for the provision of the visitor centre last month.  Work commenced on site last week.</P>
    <P>The report referred to does not cover any points not dealt with already in the assessment process.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the report contains nothing which would change my decision to proceed with the provision of a visitor centre at this location.  The provision of EC Structural Funds has made it possible to proceed with this desirable project at this time.  The availability of funds has, however, no influence on the site selection process.  The site was selected as being the best available site to meet the criteria set out in the published environment impact statement.</P>
    <P>The site chosen for the visitor centre is in a commercial conifer plantation, and it was by far the most suitable at which to convey a first-hand experience of the major characteristics of the national park and to interpret it for visitors.  The site is well placed to convey to the visitor the two different landscapes in the area: to the east is the countryside which has been modified greatly by man, while to the west and south-west is a splendid panorama of the Wicklow Mountains.  The building will be sheltered by the existing conifer plantation on the site.  This will be converted gradually to a mixed species forest which will be more attractive to wildlife as well as being less visually obtrusive than the conifer plantation while retaining its screening effect.  No other site in the area can meet adequately the requirements for a visitor centre on the eastern side of the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  There would have been no point whatsoever in providing <Col N="837" /> a visitor centre in a location where the aims and objectives of the centre could not be achieved, such as in an existing town or village.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are at present considering what projects they will submit for inclusion in the next Structural Funds programme which commences in 1994.  It is too early yet to say which projects will be included in the application.</P>

The only income received from this source over the last four years arose in 1991 when £333.4 million was received.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline (a) the estimated level of profit repatriation by multi-national companies operating in Ireland in 1991 and (b) the anticipated level for 1992; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest full-year estimate of profit, dividend and royalty outflows published by the CSO relates to 1990, when they amounted to £2,452 million. CSO data for the first half of 1991 indicate gross outflows of £1,098 million, compared with £1,203 in the same period of 1990.</P>
      <P>My Department estimate that gross profit, dividend and royalty outflows in 1991 may have been somewhat lower than in 1990, in particular because of export price trends.  There has been relatively strong export growth over recent months and a pick-up in export prices in those sectors which are predominantly foreign-owned.  Accordingly, my Department anticipate a significantly higher level of gross outflows in 1992.</P>
      <P>These outflows, to the extent that they relate to industry, should be seen in the context of industrial turnover of around £22 billion and industrial exports of £12.5 billion, in 1991.  The ability to repatriate the profits earned by their Irish subsidiaries is an important factor in attracting foreign firms to locate here.  The importance of such firms is illustrated by the fact that in 1988, the latest year for which data are available, foreign owned enterprises accounted for 44 per cent of total manufacturing employment.  In addition, such firms also purchased major amounts of Irish raw materials and services, estimated at £2.4 billion in 1990 by the IDA.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the fact that profit repatriations by the multinationals have risen from something like 2.9 per cent of GNP in 1980 to almost 12 per cent this year? Does he think it poses a serious problem for the Irish economy, particularly given <Col N="841" /> the statistics he gave to Deputy Noonan a short time ago about debt-borrowing requirements and so on?  Will he also agree that this trend is a serious bleeding of our economy?  Does the Minister have any proposals to encourage these companies to reinvest their profits in the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is a number of schemes &mdash; the most notable under section 69 of the 1984 Act &mdash; to encourage repatriated profits to invest here.  However, I am sure the Deputy will agree that we should have a high rate of productive investment and, indeed, we discussed that last night on the ICC Bill.  The fact that investment is funded from the profits of foreign-owned firms or elsewhere is of secondary importance and if firms cannot make and distribute profits as they think fit they will not locate here.  Naturally, Government policy is to bring about conditions which will encourage investment and growth leading to a substantial increase in employment.  In budgetary terms the effect of the changes in GDP to GNP by profits repatriation does not do any harm to the economy.  Like the Deputy, I should like to see more of the money invested in the areas to which I referred earlier; this policy is being actively pursued by the National Treasury Management Agency, probably more actively than has been the case in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I welcome the fact that companies invest here and create employment.  However, the question of the ultimate value must be balanced against the cost of grant-aiding these countries in the first place and the degree to which their profits are repatriated.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £2 billion for purchases.  Will he indicate to what extent he believes that figure could be increased if the linkages programme &mdash; which has been promised by the Government for some time now &mdash; was implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to put a figure on it but the bonds issued to date under <Col N="842" /> section 69 in most of the European currencies, Canadian and US dollars, amount to £520 million.  There is room for an increase, not just in that area but in others to try to encourage companies to invest more of their profits instead of repatriating them.  It is a difficult area and the freedom of overseas companies to repatriate profits must be handled delicately.  Section 69 is a good way of doing this and the link between the IDA and the National Treasury Management Agency is also a good way of doing it. No foreign company can claim that it affects their activities although I am not denying that there is scope for improvement.</P>

Will the Minister now consider, in view of his being informed of the staff shortage, requesting the larger Departments to second on a temporary basis two people and the smaller Departments at least one person to the Houses of the Oireachtas? Will he at least admit that he is now aware of a staff shortage in this House?</P>

Can the Minister indicate a date for publication of that report? I put it to him that those of us who participated feel ill-used and black-guarded by the Department of Finance that we were conned into a Special Committee arrangement, the proceedings of which have not yet been published, under the guise of Dáil reform.  The professions or anybody else who want to find out the details of the Finance Bill do not have the report of that committee available to them.

Who consulted with the Clerk of the Dáil, with his own good offices and the Whips of the various parties?  The Minister's reply is totally inadequate.  If I did not believe the Minister was committed to democracy I would have the gravest suspicions.  May I ask the Minister to tear up the reply because it has been an insult to this House and commit himself to rectifying the gross deficiencies that occur in the operation of this House between now and the end of this session and to come back and speak directly with the Whips of the various parties?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>An estimated 1,375 people were employed in mining and exploration in 1970, 1,850 in 1980 and 1,200 in 1990.  Quarrying employs about 3,500 people and 15,000 are employed in associated industries such as cement and magnesia production.  Between 1,000 to 2,000 jobs are generated elsewhere in Ireland through linkages.</P>
      <P>Major investment in mining only occurs when a new mine is opened.  No new mines have been developed since 1977 when Tara Mines commenced at a cost of about £60 million.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Minister for Energy that the new discoveries of Galmoy and Lisheen are likely to result in major investment, in excess of £100 million, in the next few years.  Investment in exploration is estimated by the Minister for Energy to be around £4 million per year.</P>
      <P>The taxation legislation relating to mining is no more complex than other areas of the tax code and the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are not aware of any complaints about the lack of clarity in tax legislation relating to mining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a specific figure for that.  Specific legislation has been drafted at various times to address the issues as they arise and to try to generate activity.  This includes a number of Income Tax Acts in 1967 and 1974. In the recent Finance Bill there were changes to try to help exploration.  Again in the Finance Act, 1990, there were amendments to try to bring forward activities.  At that stage the ten year commencement period was done away with. Successive Governments have always responded to try to activate the market place and encourage people to invest in the mines.  There are very attractive tax incentives.  There is a great number of licences in existence which are unlike the one the Deputy has mentioned where there is no activity, but that is a matter for decision by the licence holder.</P>

      <P>During the Seanad debate on the 1992 Finance Bill I announced that my officials were holding discussions with representatives of the life assurance and unit trust industries to consider the impact of the changes in DIRT on their products.  These discussions are still continuing.  The issue is complex and no decision has yet been taken on changes in this area, which must be considered in the context of the overall tax code.  I am, of course, aware of the importance of equity investment for small and medium sized Irish businesses. <Col N="851" /> This is one of the major factors to be taken into account in the consideration of any proposals for changes in taxation of unit trusts or similar products.</P>

My question is somewhat separate and I would ask him, therefore, to reply to it.  Does the Minister have any specific intention, irrespective of what remedial action he might take in respect of the special savings accounts, to encourage the promotion of new unit trust type products that would be available for investment by way of venture capital in small and medium sized Irish industries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>

Proposals have been put forward by a number of people in the financial services area suggesting that both things could be done together by linking unit trusts and equity investments to what would be used to generate activity in small and medium sized enterprises. There is one substantial report from the industry in that regard which I am presently examining.  I want to assure the Deputy that I am trying to deal with the issue he raised.</P>

In addition to having discussions with the insurance industry, does the Minister intend holding discussions with the banking institutions to ensure that money being put on deposit is used properly for providing seed capital for small and medium-sized industries?</P>

      <P>I have had some discussion with the banking groups and I will be talking to the banking federation shortly.  The issue of the 3 per cent is one of the items under discussion.  The Deputy will recall that that levy was introduced because the corporation tax yield from life assurance linked investment was considered to be unacceptably low.  In any resolution of the issue some solution to that must be found.</P>

      <P>At the meeting on 9 June, the ECOFIN Council discussed a wide ranging agenda which included the abolition of fiscal frontiers, multilateral surveillance and the Delors II package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of preparation for the Lisbon European Council, the Council discussed in considerable detail, on the basis of introductory statements by President Delors and the chairman of the Monetary Committee, the main aspects of the Commission proposals on the future financing of the Community.  As <Col N="853" /> the Deputy is aware, the future financing of the Community was one of the main items discussed at the European Council in Lisbon.  As had been expected, final decisions were not taken on this matter at Lisbon.  However, progress was made in a number of areas as outlined in my statement to the House on 2 July.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Lisbon European Council was an interim stage in the discussion of the Delors II package.  Negotiations will now continue with a view to final decisions in December.  There is no doubt that there will be a substantial increase in funding for Ireland and the other cohesion countries.</P>
    <P>The sub-regional review committees have been invited to make submissions on the content and strategy of the next development plan in so far as it affects their sub-regions.  These submissions will concentrate on the development strategies that should be pursued, the type of measures that should be included and the relative priority of the various measures.  As part of the process the committee will be asking their constituent organisations and other organisations in the sub-regions to make submissions to them.  It is open to local community groups, if they so wish, to make a submission to the sub-regional review committee relevant to the sub-region in which they operate.  Alternatively, if their input relates to issues at a national level, it is open to such groups to make a submission to the relevant Government Department dealing with the sector to which their submission relates or to the Department of Finance.</P>

Will the Minister indicate what level of Structural Funding would be required in order to maintain services <Col N="854" /> and the development of infrastructure?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It does include the Cohesion Fund.  The overall increase was 73 per cent.  The figure to hold services as they are has already been achieved because they have accepted an increase in the Structural Funds and £3 billion was the figure which we have had for the last number of years.  The negotiations now must continue to try to achieve what is our negotiating position, to get a full doubling of the funds.  I would not like to speculate on a figure.  My position at all the meetings of the ECOFIN Council has been that it is similar to what the Delors II package states, which is a doubling in the case of Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland.</P>

      <P>The sub-regional review committees are preparing submissions.  Is the Minister aware that local community groups are likely to be very sceptical because of the 1979 proposals?  Many of them incurred a great deal of expenditure in drafting submissions but in fact the situation turned out to be a bit farcical. <Col N="855" /> In relation to this latest tranche of funds in the sub-regional review committees could the Minister assure us that the local community groups will be respected?  In order to make it more simple for the sub-regional review committees and in view of the disproportionate amount of funds spent in the eastern region on the last occasion, will the Minister agree that it would be far more scientific, in dividing up the funds between the different regions, to allocate a specific amount of funds to the different regions and then let them make their proposals based on that funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's last question, I can give him the figures for the north-west region, the west region and the south-west region if he so wishes.  I met the chairpersons of the sub-regional groups some time ago and agreed a work programme with them. Letters have been issued to the chairpersons of the sub-regional groups and their constituent bodies who, in turn, advised their members that the plans should be submitted by the end of October. As the Deputy said, on the last occasion the work had to be done within a very limited period.  We have been working for a few months this time and we still have some way to go.  I will have to submit the plans to Brussels early in the New Year at the latest so that we will know the position before the Edinburgh Council is concluded.</P>
      <P>It is important that the sub-regional groups do not submit huge, bulky submissions, as they did on the last occasion. It would cost tens of billions of pounds and not just billions of pounds to fund all the proposals.  The reports have to be prioritised in a meaningful way.  This applies right across the board to Government Departments, the various agencies and the constituent bodies.  I have pointed this out both in writing and in direct discussions with the sub-regional groups.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he will let those of us who, like him, are not members of a local authority, have copies of the correspondence he sent to the sub-regional groups so that we will have a clear idea what precisely is being asked of them?  Will he clarify how local groups or national organisations who are concerned about developments, particularly in the area of poverty, will interact when making a submission to a Government Department and on receiving a response from that Department on the Government's long term plans in that area?  How will they dovetail their submissions in relation to how Structural Funds might be used? As the Minister said, it is not as simple as a national organisation producing a grand plan.  They may well be wasting their time if they do not know the parameters within which they should operate.</P>

      <P>I will try to be brief. The constituent bodies of the sub-regional groups, the Council for the Status of Women and the Chambers of <Col N="857" /> Commerce of Ireland are included in the groups who will make submissions.  The relevant bodies associated with certain agencies have been asked by the constituent bodies to make submissions.  We have tried to make the representations as broad as we possibly can.  Bodies who feel they may not be represented by any constituent body should make a submission to one of those agencies or the relevant Department, for example, the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Finance, as the national co-ordinator.  If they do not think they can link their submissions with constituent bodies, for example, the Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the CII or farmer organisations, they should link them with the relevant Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle (Mr. Seán Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>A Uachtaráin Uasail, is cúis mhór áthais domsa fáilte Uí Cheallaigh a chur romhat ar an ócáid stairiúil seo.  Is mór an onóir dúinn Uachtarán na hÉireann a bheith in ár measc inniu.</P>
      <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of the Dáil and the Seanad, I am privileged to extend to you warmest greetings and the most hearty céad míle fáilte on this unique occasion of your address to the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Apart from the address by the late esteemed President Éamon de Valera to the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas on that historic occasion in the Mansion House in 1969, this is the first occasion on which a President of Ireland has addressed both Houses of Parliament, as it were, a working Parliament, whereby the constituent parts of the Oireachtas &mdash; President, Dáil and Seanad &mdash; are present here in the traditional seat of the Irish Parliament, Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is therefore, a Uachtaráin Uasail, with feelings of honour and pride and a <Col N="1001" /> deep sense of history in the making that I ask you to address this House under Article 13.7 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, A Chathaoirligh an tSeanaid, A Comhaltaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid &mdash; De réir an Bhunreachta &ldquo;Tig leis an Uachtarán, tar éis comhairle a ghlacadh leis an gComhairle Stáit, teachtaireacht no aitheasc a chur faoi bhráid Tithe an Oireachtais i dtaobh aon ní a bhfuil tábhacht náisiúnta nó tábhacht phoiblí ann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Tá sé de phribhléid agamsa mar Uachtarán na hÉireann leas a bhaint as an gceart sin chun labhairt libh inniu ag pointe suntasach i stair na tíre seo atá ar imeall na hEorpa agus atá san am céanna mar chuid de chroílár na hEorpa.</P>
      <P>I speak to you today as a constituent part of this Oireachtas.  I have exercised my right to address you because this seems to me a unique moment in our history. You as elected representatives and I as President of Ireland have witnessed the people we are privileged to represent vote in favour of the move towards European Union.  But I want to say at the outset that I have very much in mind today those who voted against.  Through you, who are representatives of all the people, I speak of them also.  I feel for the conscience and concern they brought to their decision.  I know, as you do, that the dissent of one time is the dialogue of another.  All of us today in Ireland &mdash; those who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash; now face the future.  And it is that prospect, both bright and challenging, which I want to speak about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Constitution the President can exercise a right of address.  It can be exercised in two ways.  Either the President can speak to the nation, or to the Oireachtas.  I very deliberately chose the second.  First of all, I was for many years a Member of the Seanad.  I think of those years and my time there with affection and gratitude.  But more importantly, it seemed to me that by coming here and talking to you I could hope to participate <Col N="1002" /> with you in a process of reflection; and we need to reflect.  This is a crucial moment in our history.  It is vital that we consider it: that we bring to it all the Irish gifts of insight and argument.  We need to reflect not simply on how we perceive and move towards European Union but on how we perceive ourselves in it.  We need to reflect not merely on the shape of the emerging Europe, but on how we shape ourselves within it.  I think we owe to coming Irish generations, something we received in abundance from past ones: articulate self-definition at a time of redefinition.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this Oireachtas &mdash; which has played such a vital part in building and sustaining a modern, democratic Irish state &mdash; is central to that process of reflection.  This assembly of elected representatives, from its beginnings in a time of upheaval and danger, has always caught the attention of the country by stating its concerns.  Now, as it considers the next context of Europe, I know it will do the same.  And as part of that Oireachtas I feel that now, once again, our obligation is also our opportunity. To borrow the words of Éamon de Valera, whose name is so associated with this Oireachtas: &ldquo;We of this time, if we have the will and the active enthusiasm, have the opportunity to inspire and move our generation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The more we reflect on it, the more I think we can see how vital this moment is.  &ldquo;The Irish race&rdquo; said Michael Davitt, &ldquo;have a place in the world's affairs.&rdquo; Today &mdash; through the signal given by our people in favour of a move towards European Union &mdash; that place has been confirmed and one perspective has been created from two aspects of our identity: our early heritage as shapers of European civilisation and our contemporary achievement as a modern State within it. Today as never before we are able to heal the distance between those opposite ends of our history.  Once, we reached out to Europe to sustain its Christian flowering. We were part of that remarkable outward-bound <Col N="1003" /> adventure of Irish scholarship which Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich has told us of in his book <i>Gaelscrínte San Eoraip.</i>  That extraordinary initiative as he describes it &mdash; lasting from the 6th to the 12th century &mdash; has left a shining mark on the Continent to this day.  I think we can note the fact that it was by their openness to Europe that our forebears enriched the Irishness of our tradition. And that they did so by performing &mdash; to quote Davitt again &mdash;&ldquo;the great humanising service rendered to society by the Celtic people of Ireland in the childhood of European civilization.&rdquo;  I find it poignant and appropriate to quote these words in the Parliament of a sovereign State, where our presences witness the existence of a contemporary democracy, and on an occasion which recalls the fact that we have come to a new context with our oldest values intact.</P>
    <P>James Connolly formulated a central question for us.  &ldquo;Who are the Irish?&rdquo; he asked.  The question remains with us, challenging us to find new answers, which will retain what was best and most distinctive in our past.  We have long known better than merely to look inward and to interpret ourselves in the framework of historical stresses.  From the foundation of this State &mdash; from the League of Nations to the European Community and to our recent participation in the UN environment conference in Rio de Janeiro &mdash; we have been ready to play our part internationally.  And I think this is the moment to stress that our presence in Europe itself is not simply a presence in the Community.  It is also our involvement as a founder member of the Council of Europe, with its concern for social issues, for education and the environment, and its commitment &mdash; through the Court of Human Rights &mdash; to protection of individual rights, and its value as a framework which has a particular relevance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  In these roles we have shown that we can be at our best: a nation <Col N="1004" /> which has learned from history but it is not limited by it.</P>
    <P>The Irish legal system, has responded well to the significance of Community law as an integrating force.  Indeed we have a strength in our legal system that we should not underestimate.  Alone among the twelve Member States we combine a common law tradition with a written Constitution.  Given that Community law functions both at the European and national levels, the Irish legal system provides a legal bridge to other English speaking jurisdictions such as the United States, Canada and Australia.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless the Europe which is unfolding will not be a place of tidy assumptions or quiet acceptances; and I think we should be prepared for that.  It is a theatre of concerns where diversity will bring tensions, and where tensions can lead on to the enrichment of mutual understanding.  These are not smooth issues: but since the answers will shape the new Europe, we should not shirk questions.  We are, for instance, a country which has held on principle to a policy of non-involvement in military alliances; yet we have a proper sense of responsibility to our partners.  How do we balance these things?  We need to debate this honestly, aware that the balance we strike and the approach we take can be both constructive and exemplary.  Nor should we be afraid that our debate on this &mdash; or any other &mdash; issue will be interpreted as an un-European attitude; in fact the reverse.  An open debate which takes as its fundamental point our history as a small country with a tradition of neutrality and an instinctive sympathy for the Third World, and which takes into account the changing context in Europe, our growing commitment to our partners and our distinguished record of service in UN peace keeping, cannot but be valued and valuable.</P>
    <P>Our honest reflection on this matter which is central to our concerns can be of importance not just to us but to those who might be applicants, potential applicants <Col N="1005" /> or those who are neighbours of the Community.  We have to remember that this is not a static Community we are members of; it is also one we shape and define by our participation.  The more of its particular values each country brings to it, the more it becomes a Community which can show its respect for differences of tradition; and the less likely it is to be a place where conformity takes precedence over conscience.  We have deep concerns about peace-keeping and peace-making. Let us debate those concerns openly; and let us not assume the debate will be unwelcome.</P>
    <P>But what of the additional anxiety that we run the risk of losing a treasured and hard-won cultural identity in the European monolith?  Again, why not face this issue squarely?  It is not negligible, this worry about whether the distinctive and individual, or even the eccentric and quirky, will survive a powerful centre. Each one of us in Ireland understands what John Hewitt, the Northern poet, meant when he wrote: &ldquo;This is our country also, nowhere else&rdquo;.  Nevertheless I believe that the answer to these fears is around us in the everyday witness of where our nation has its deepest roots.  If identity was rooted only in language, if it was rooted only in history, if it was defined purely by a version of events, then perhaps we might have cause for concern.  And if the Irish experience were a matter of abstract belief we might have something to fear.  But our identity is all these things with one addition.  That addition is the Irish people and so our abstractions have a human dimension. Rooted in that source, I do not think we have anything to fear from the larger context.  In fact the opposite.</P>
    <P>I want to put this in the most practical way possible.  I think we have a special characteristic of life in this country which is both an outcome of history and remains a profound resource of life in Ireland.  If I had to describe this characteristic I would say that we do not divide the purposes of our nation from the values of our community. <Col N="1006" /> And this is nowhere more evident than in the powerful continuum of voluntary effort which is so much part of the texture of Irish life.  Indeed I can say from my own observation that it is a striking feature of day-to-day life in all parts of this island.  Over the past year and a half I have witnessed the strength of this effort: in education, in health, in the care of the disabled and the elderly. I have been in towns where sports halls seem to have gone up overnight, magically; where children have been taught skills and self-sufficiencies which reveal their natural independence; where the unemployed train in centres which respect their individuality and worth; where the terminally ill have found care and dignity in their last hours.</P>
    <P>This voluntary commitment has one of its move moving dimensions in human care.  But it goes well beyond it into the cherishing of the environment as well as the person.  I have been astonished and delighted to see how the silences of our past are being reversed in town after town, day after day, in heritage centres, museums, libraries, local histories. Buildings are being restored, plant life is being recorded, historic events are being dramatised for schoolchildren.  And all of this has implications not just for our past heritage, but for our most important heritage-in-the-making: our young people.  It is in this area that we see an optimistic conjunction of different resources: of voluntary effort, of the input of State and semi-State agencies such as FÁS and Bord Fáilte and of European funding. I would also want to mention here the International Fund for Ireland which has become a sustaining presence in Border areas.  In these interdependences, as they come into play in projects which have enormous meaning for our regional and national life, we see an imaginative interaction of resources and human commitment.</P>
    <P>It is usual to lay these voluntary efforts at the door of pragmatic necessity: to say that scarce resources make them essential. <Col N="1007" /> I believe this is an inadequate explanation. Having seen them, I am sure they come from something much deeper and more constant in our identity.  I see them as bringing together within a single vision of action both strong community values and distinctively Irish ones.  I also believe these efforts form an important element of the initiatives we can take in Europe. They are a factor in the balance between the centre and the margins, between the individual and the bureaucracy, I do not think it is any coincidence that Irish men and women hold key positions in vital European voluntary networks: the Transnational European Rural Network, the European Women's Lobby, the European Council of Aids Service Organisations, the European Anti-Poverty Network, the European Network for the Unemployed and the variety of European networks representing those of all our populations with disabilities.  These names are not abstractions; they are signs of compassion, generosity and problem-solving. And the linkages these networks establish cannot but humanise bureaucracy and create dialogue rather than paperwork, consultation rather than anonymity.</P>
    <P>These networks have a further implication. In the ratio of our size to our resources, the contribution of Irish voluntary organisations and individuals to developing countries has been outstanding. Working often in difficult conditions, under considerable stresses, Irish individuals, and the organisations they represent, have provided friendship and a voice for many defenceless people.  I want to pay tribute to them today.  The witness of love and compassion given by our priests and nuns, our doctors, nurses, teachers and other voluntary workers of all denominations, and by all those who commit their energies unselfishly to working for a more equal world, is something we can be proud of.  At a practical level, their expertise provides a necessary lifeline of communications and understanding. <Col N="1008" /> Through their organisation, they already have a working relationship with other such agencies in Europe.  Just as they have made us understand here in Ireland the needs of developing countries, now they continue that process in a wider context.  The relation between a powerful community of nations and an afflicted and struggling part of our world can never be easy and will falter if such communicative skills and imaginative sympathies are missing.</P>
    <P>I think it helps to realise that the influence of Europe works in both directions. The reality of modern Ireland is that there is, at this moment, a young and well-trained Irish workforce in European capitals.  They bring with them the visible distinctions bestowed on them by our educational system.  But this is not all. They themselves are just part of a wider traffic of young people to and from the Continent: students at primary and secondary level; at third level through the Erasmus scheme.  They go there in the care of teachers who have a generous appreciation of what that traffic will mean for all our futures.  Through them, through the new emphasis on languages, our students are now part of a Europe they can lay claim to as well as visit.  Most importantly, they also bring with them something less visible: an imaginative feel for suffering and the quick sympathies which are the bright offerings of a dark history.</P>
    <P>We also have a business community whose enterprise and improvisation has been crucial on the eve of the opening of the Single European Market.  And how exciting that we are beginning to talk about an economic corridor between North and South, where promotions and industrial commitments can draw on common resources: where industry becomes part of understanding.</P>
    <P>But in this matter, as in every other one to do with Europe, our attitude is vital.  We need to realise we will not be subsumed by Europe; we will not be diminished by a wider theatre of action. <Col N="1009" /> Albert Camus was a great presence in post-war literature.  Nevertheless his statement that &ldquo;the opposite of a civilised people is a creative people&rdquo; is not one I agree with.  In the Europe of which he was an ornament I believe we will prove him wrong: we can be both civilised and creative.</P>
    <P>And new friendships will never replace old ones.  I realise how important it is, in the new setting, that we do not forget past loyalties and traditional enrichments. When James Joyce went to Europe, he set out on a historic paradox of exile and recall.  He reclaimed his birthplace by leaving it.  He went away with the purpose, so he wrote later, of creating &ldquo;the uncreated conscience of my race&rdquo;.  We stand at a distance from that time; but we can still be struck by that phrase.  I had in mind all our exiles, all our emigrants &mdash; past and present &mdash; when I put the light in the window at Áras an Uachtaráin.  I was not prepared for the power and meaning which a modest emblem would have.  But we have reason to know in Ireland how powerful symbols are; that they carry the force of what they symbolise.  Joyce's words remind us &mdash; that light reminds us &mdash; that the community of Irish interest and talent and memory extends far beyond our boundaries, far beyond Europe's boundaries.</P>
    <P>The dreams and insights we foster on these shores, the images of landscape which enter into people's hearts, and the friendships and family ties, are carried forever beyond them.  Through this absent community, our national constituency and culture are present in wider ones.  I put the light in the window to show that the dialogue between the absent and the present is one of remembrance at all times.  This presence of the local in the spacious context; this strengthening of a sense of home by the fact of absence is itself an emblem of how strong our national experience is, how much it is cherished by those who take it with them.  I know we can take that <Col N="1010" /> emblem with us to the new Europe, never forgetting in those surroundings how strong our bonds are with other countries, and other continents.</P>
    <P>When we reflect on the constituent parts of the modern Ireland, I think we find ourselves at the heart of the European debate.  Ireland is the first country to signify its willingness to ratify the movement towards European Union &mdash; whatever shape that may finally take.  As a modern State, we have the democratic right to do so.  But of course it can be argued that we are not only a modern State.  As a people we reach back in time to hardships and dangers.  At some mysterious point, time becomes history and a people becomes a nation.  Few of us, however scholarly, would venture a guess as to when that happened.  But I know that most of us would feel our Irish language was deeply and intimately involved in such a transformation.  It remains today an index and register of our nationhood. Through its continuance we avoid the desolate spectacle of Máire MacEntee's eloquent lines:</P>
    <P>Níl cuimhne féin ar a ainm</P>
    <P>Fiú cerbha díobh ní feasach ann</P>
    <P>His name is not even remembered</P>
    <P>Nor is his kindred known there</P>
    <P>I know there are fears that this Irish possession may be eroded in Europe.  But this is the very moment when fear must not become fatalism.  Why should the Irish language be threatened by Europe, when what we have, in fact, is an opportunity to take it with us as a precious and enduring frame of our self-perception. Providing, of course, that within this self-perception is also our sense of tolerance, our love of diversity, our cherishing of other traditions.  Provided we always have in mind that no one is less Irish for not speaking it.  And on the other hand, we can never presume to know who will speak it, or to whom it will be dear.  From the poets of Slieve Luachra in Kerry in the 18th century to those like Edward Bunting in the North of Ireland in the <Col N="1011" /> 19th, the language has had powerful friends and unpredictable ones.  Now we must look for those friends in this generation. After all, the new environmental movement has caught the imaginations of young people everywhere.  Their sense of the vulnerability of this planet has moved and persuaded us all.  Now we need to persuade our young Irish people that a language also is a part of our environment, is a living thing, subject to stresses and neglect, likely to be mourned if it becomes extinct and entitled &mdash; I believe &mdash; to the same excited sense of care and protection.</P>
    <P>In this context &mdash; of the Irish language and Europe &mdash; it seems to me particularly appropriate to quote one of my predecessors, Douglas Hyde: &ldquo;The Ireland of today&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the descendant of the Ireland of the 7th century, then the school of Europe and the torch of learning.&rdquo; It is our language which makes that link and proves that descent.</P>
    <P>San aitheasc a thug mé ar mo insealbhú mar Uachtarán, cuimhneoidh sibh gur dhúirt mé go raibh aistear cultúrtha le déanamh agam leis an saibhreas iontach atá sa Ghaeilge a bhaint amach dom féin. Dúirt mé freisin go raibh súil agam go leanfadh daoine eile mé a bhí ar mo nós féin, beagán as cleachtadh sa Ghaeilge agus go rachadh muid ar aghaidh le chéile le taitneamh agus pléisiúr a fháil as ár dteanga álainn féin.  Thosaigh mé amach ar an aistear sin agus tá sé ráite ag go leor leor daoine ó shin liom gur thug an deashampla sin misneach dóibh mé a leanúint. Agus mhéadaigh sé sin mo mhisneach féin.  Tá muid ag dul ar aghaidh le chéile ag cabhrú lena chéile agus ag tabhairt cuireadh do dhaoine eile muid a leanúint ar an aistear cultúrtha seo is dual do Éireannaigh.</P>
    <P>Ach tá níos mó ná dílseacht d'ár noidhreacht Éireannach i gceist leis an dea-shampla seo &mdash; tá dílseacht d'ár noidhreacht Eorpach san áireamh freisin. Is cuid de oidhreacht an Chomhphobail an saibhreas atá i bhféiniúlacht gach <Col N="1012" /> pobal ar leith, agus is cuid de oidhreacht gach pobal ar leith an saibhreas atá sa gComhphobal le chéile.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go ndéanfadh muid an fhéiniúlacht a chaomhnú agus an éagsúlacht a chothú i ngach ceantar den Chomhphobal.</P>
    <P>We bring with us also our wealth of expression in the English language.  I find it poignant that in a private letter Maria Edgeworth once lamented the bitterness of Irish life.  &ldquo;It is impossible to draw Ireland as she now is in a book of fiction&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;realities are too strong and party passions too violent&rdquo;.  And like so many other citizens of this country, I am grateful that this did not deter our writers in the end.  In novels, short stories, poems and plays, they have added immeasurably to the self-realisation of the Irish people.  It is to them, to their obstinate sense of their art, that we owe a wider concept of Irishness.  They persuaded us, through the beauty and force of their expression &mdash; often controversially received &mdash; that nationality is something which admits of the rebellious affections of a James Joyce, of the dual-language lyricism of Samuel Beckett, and the anarchic intelligence of a Myles na gCopaleen, that it encompasses the subversions of our artists as well as the steadfastness of our patriots.  Our writers have truly &mdash; as Patrick Kavanagh said &mdash; lived in important times.  And their self-questioning is something which lives with us as a challenge and a bequest.  &ldquo;For all my searching back&rdquo; says Kate O'Brien of her portrait of her relatives, &ldquo;and for all my will to reach them, I have not found the heart of any one of them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In fact it is our writers, our artists, our composers and our craftsmen and craftswomen who have been at the heart of the Irish identity &mdash; often before any of the rest of us.  Even as I speak, a new generation is continuing to do this in a new golden age for all kinds of Irish creativity which I have referred to with pride on my visits abroad.  Because of them we bring to Europe the important argument <Col N="1013" /> that a community and a nation need not be a smooth or acceptable continuum.  It can also be an assembly of valuable and shifting tensions.</P>
    <P>But no act of cultural possession or self-possession precludes change.  Our receptiveness to change is a mark of our confidence as a modern State.  There are changes all around us today which are an enrichment of our national life and which are going to serve us well as we take them into the fast-changing European environment. There has been, for instance, a radical change in the role and status of women.  Because of legislative and economic advances women now play a greater part in the structures which sustain the community.  I have observed, and stated on other occasions, and I will state it again tomorrow at the opening of the Global Summit on Women, that as they take more of a part in our national life women are actually changing the institutions and occasions they participate in. They bring to their various commitments &mdash; and they are a great part of the voluntary effort I spoke of &mdash; an exemplary relation between the individual and the group.  They are often open, consultative and progressive in institutions which especially benefit by such attitudes.</P>
    <P>In all this talk of a new circumstance and a challenging future it would be quite wrong to minimise the fact that there are tensions and sorrows in this country even as I speak.  They come from oppositions and traditional sources of misunderstanding. They also come from the profound inhumanity of protracted violence. I know the violence in Northern Ireland grieves every one of you as elected representatives, just as it grieves me.  I know I speak for you in assuring the people of Northern Ireland, of all traditions, of our deep commitment to dialogue and to friendship.  It gives me a chance to say how deeply I appreciate the welcome I received when I went there. It also allows me to say that of all the occasions of my Presidency I do not think any has moved me more than the visits I <Col N="1014" /> made to Northern Ireland and the visits made in turn to me by community groups &mdash; by young people, by women, by business people, by representatives of rural and urban concerns from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I said at my inauguration that I wanted Áras an Uachtaráin to be a place of storytelling. And I assure you that it was never more so than on these occasions.  These different groups, with all their diverse interests and areas of expertise and their deep cross-community respect for one another, brought their stories to one another, not just to me.  I found that open-mindedness both moving and challenging.</P>
    <P>I want to finish by saying how grateful I am for the opportunity you have given me today to reflect on our Irish identity at an important moment.  It has been a privilege to do so in the presence of elected representatives and in this place which symbolises so much of what we have achieved.  Having said that, I am deeply aware that I have given you just one perspective, just one individual witness on a complex and vital subject.  I also know how much this whole reflective process will benefit from the expert views and observations, the insight and concrete evidence you in this Oireachtas will bring to bear on it.</P>
    <P>The generation which founded this State could not have foreseen this occasion; and yet by their courage they helped to guarantee it.  I know we have them in mind today &mdash; these forebears of the modern Irish State and all those others who by their efforts and dedication brought it about.  I believe if they could see us &mdash; a sovereign democratic State reflecting on our place in a community of European nations, they would be satisfied. It is right, by way of honouring their memory, that we remember James Connolly's question today.  Who we are as Irish people is about to be challenged and confirmed by new circumstances.  I believe we are ready.  Nevertheless it seems important that we continue to <Col N="1015" /> reflect on that challenge with a sense of what we bring to Europe, rather than what we lose by being part of it; that we assert our future in terms of the best values of our past; that we do not take a passive view of our role in Europe.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest published figures were included in the 1990 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts and showed the position at 31 May 1991.</P>
      <P>The position at 31 May 1992 will be shown in the next report.</P>
      <P>The 1990 report showed a total of £2,718 million in outstanding taxes, of which £426 million was shown as likely to be collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has taken unprecedented <Col N="858" /> action in the last few years to improve the administration of the taxation system.  Among the initiatives taken were the following: the amnesty in 1988; the progressive development of the self-assessment system and accompanying audit programme for personal and company taxation; a withholding tax on professional fees was introduced; tax clearance requirements have been introduced for public contracts and grants; a new system of tax enforcement by Sheriffs has been introduced; the power to attach assets of tax defaulters has been granted to the Revenue Commissioners; the introduction of new general anti-avoidance provisions; an Arrears Identification and Review Programme was set up in May 1989 with extra resources to pursue those taxpayers who still had outstanding tax liabilities following the 1988 tax amnesty.  This is a co-ordinated programme between Inspectors of Taxes and the Collector-General's Office.  The provision of additional resources of £1 million in the 1991 budget and £0.75 million in the 1992 budget enabled the scope of that review programme to be further extended in 1991 and continued in 1992. To the end of 1991, some £183 million was collected under that programme; the Revenue Commissioners have put together a new initiative for 1992.  This is designed to release experienced staff for an increase in audits and, at the same time, to increase staff numbers engaged in the collection of arrears.  A further £45 million is expected from this measure.</P>
    <P>Also, in this year's budget, I announced several further measures dedicated to the improvement of collection and the elimination of abuse. Among these are, the extension of tax clearance to licences, permits etc., the extension of the withholding tax to the commercial State sector; the extension of the construction industry tax deduction scheme to other sectors and the strengthening of the legislation governing Revenue's power to attach the assets of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Finally, this year's Finance Act includes provisions which strengthen the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to <Col N="859" /> counter tax evasion and avoidance e.g.: Revenue's power to seek information from taxpayers, their agents and third parties (excluding financial institutions) has been extended; their power to search for information has also been strengthened; the levels of penalties for non-compliance have been increased.</P>
    <P>As to results, some of these measures have already contributed to better collection and enforcement of tax obligations as evidenced by the ongoing reduction in outstanding amounts shown in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General for the past five years to 31 May 1991: 31-5-87, £4,172 million; 31-5-88, £4,107 million; 31-5-89, £3,501 million; 31-5-90, £2,985 million; 31-5-91, £2,718 million.  An overall reduction of £267 million, in the amount outstanding is noted for the most recent 12 month period reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is also noted that this reduction occurred in a period during which over £7,000 million in additional charges fell due for collection.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the Comptroller and Auditor General points out in his report that the Revenue Commissioners estimate that only £426 million of the £2,718 million is likely to be collected. The reason for the difference is that the figure of £2,718 million consists largely of estimates, which were made by tax inspectors in the absence of returns from taxpayers.  Therefore, to quote a figure of £2,718 million without putting that figure into its proper context gives a misleading impression.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners' achievement in collecting £183 million of entrenched pre-amnesty arrears since 1989 is quite impressive when viewed against the figure of £426 million.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Revenue Commissioners are precluded by their confidentiality obligations from disclosure of the details of individual taxpayer's affairs except in certain specified circumstances.  Outside of these circumstances it would not be appropriate to make public the detailed information to which the Deputy is referring.  The circumstances allowing publication include certain appeals, prosecutions, judicial proceedings and settlement in lieu of court proceedings.  These disclosure criteria will apply in the normal way in relation to matters arising in the beef inquiry.</P>
      <P>Established practice has been that a Minister for Finance does not answer a Parliamentary Question about an individual's tax affairs, other than where the Deputy asking the question was acting on behalf of the taxpayer.  It is my understanding that this is not the case in the present instance.</P>
      <P>I can, however assure the Deputy that contributions made to political parties by the companies referred to in his question, or indeed by any other company, are not deductible for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 61 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 provides that only expenditure which is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of a trade is allowable expenditure for tax purposes.  Subscriptions to political parties would not be regarded as being incurred for the purposes of a trade and therefore, the companies referred to in the question would not have been entitled to a deduction from their corporation tax bill for any such subscriptions. If any such claim were made it would be refused for the reasons outlined. Attempts to disguise the contributions as allowable expenses would <Col N="861" /> not succeed as these would generally be discovered in the course of an audit.</P>

      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government and the social partners agreed that &ldquo;discussions will be held with unions in the public service with a view to determining how progress can be made in relation to employee participation in the public service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the public service consists of a variety of organisations having a range of distinctive tasks, it is a matter for the managements directly involved together with the appropriate employee interests to meet together with a view to discussing and devising mechanisms for ensuring employee participation which best fit the circumstances in which their organisations function and no doubt any difficulties which cannot be resolved at the level of a particular organisation will be brought to the attention of the Minister most directly involved.</P>
      <P>Under a Memorandum of Understanding which forms part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> there is also a commitment on the part of public service employers and employees to commence discussions related to the &ldquo;local bargaining&rdquo; clause of that agreement in a way which will &ldquo;create an organisation climate conducive to better job satisfaction, motivation and commitment of staff&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, my direct responsibility as an employer is confined to the Civil Service.

      <P>The Taoiseach did not say that unemployment itself would stabilise in the second half of the year.  What he did say was that he hoped to see a &ldquo;stabilisation in the upward trend&rdquo;&mdash; that the pace of increase in the (underlying) Live Register, which quickened in the early months of this year, would slow.  That is also my Department's view.</P>
      <P>My Department forecast a modest increase in employment this year &mdash; a view supported by the pattern of relevant tax receipts to date.  However, as long as international economic activity, particularly in the UK and the USA, remains muted employment growth here will not nearly offset increases in our labour force, and unemployment will rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's recent employment performance, considering the depressed level of international economic activity of the past year or more, had been good, even though inadequate to meet our needs.  The policies which we have been pursuing are in the best interests of growth in sustainable jobs.

      <P>I am not at present in a position to say how much may be involved.  The matter is extremely complex and requires careful assessment with professional actuarial guidance.  Similar considerations apply to the rate at which interest should accrue. The necessary work is in hands in my Department in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.  I would add that, under present arrangements, payment is not required until such time as the income of the pension fund becomes insufficient to pay benefits as they arise.  The Vote for Tourism, Transport and Communications for this year contains a provision for such a payment should it prove necessary. Approval was sought for the draft financing of benefits scheme, but of course this could not be given until the work I have referred to has been completed.</P>

      <P>The yield from excise duty on motor vehicles for each year since 1985 is set out in the tabular statement which I propose to circulate along with the reply.  As for part (2) of the Deputy's question the excise receipts from this source are estimated at £173 million for 1992.  As the Deputy may be aware, the excise duty on motor vehicles will be replaced from 1 January next by a first registration charge aimed to maintain revenue from motor vehicle taxation at an equivalent level, thus leaving vehicle prices broadly unaffected. As for estimates of the yield from this new tax for the five years requested, the methodology used in the formulation of medium-term forecasts for the evolution of overall public finances, as prepared by my Department, does not allow for the level of dis-aggregation which would be required to supply the information.</P>
      <P>In the short term, I have no further plans for motor vehicle taxation.  As always, however, all taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis in the light of budgetary circumstances and the new Vehicle Registration Tax will be treated no differently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution to which the Deputy refers covers a range of issues.  I am confining my reply to the policing of the corporate sector referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>I totally reject the suggestion that the corporate sector is unpoliced.  The Revenue Commissioners have a comprehensive programme in place to ensure that the corporate sector complies fully with its tax obligations.</P>
      <P>Self assessment for the corporate sector was introduced in September, 1989 and the first returns were due by 1 July, 1990.  As the Deputy will appreciate the various programmes are, therefore, at the developmental stage but considerable progress has already been made.</P>
      <P>The compliance programme to ensure that returns are lodged on time secured 73 per cent of the 1989 returns by 31 December, 1991.  This compares favourably with an ultimate response rate of less than 50 per cent in the pre self assessment era.  The actual response rate may in fact be shown to be higher when a programme to remove dormant companies from the Revenue record is completed by the end of this year.  Another feature of the corporate sector is that many companies do not have a tax liability in a particular year because of losses, capital allowances and other reliefs.  The surcharge for late submission of returns has not been effective in securing returns from many companies in this situation.  I have strengthened the Revenue's hand in this regard by a provision in this year's Finance Act which disallows in part certain claims to relief and offset of losses in the year in which a return is submitted late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> The audit programme for the corporate sector got under way in 1991.  Of the 76 inspectors currently engaged in self assessment audits some 24 deal with the corporate sector.  In 1991 over 11,000 corporation tax returns were screened and of these audits were initiated in approximately 900 cases. There has been a further expansion in the audit programme this year.  From January to March some 7,200 returns were screened and some 200 audits initiated. There are many dimensions to the audit programme for the corporate sector. Within the overall corporate audit programme there are specific audit operations in the VAT, PAYE (Employer) and construction industry tax area which impact directly on the corporate sector. It is estimated that over 6,500 such audits have been carried out in 1991.</P>
    <P>As part of the development of the self assessment system the Revenue Commissioners have specific proposals aimed at a further strengthening of the entire audit programme including the corporate sector.  In relation to the corporate sector these proposals involve the putting in place of specialist districts to focus on particular sectors of economic and commercial activity.  The implementation of these proposals requires the active support of all sides within the Revenue Commissioners to secure the necessary deployment of staff on the most efficient basis.  The Revenue proposals have been put to staff interests and their response is awaited.</P>

      <P>Official data do not exist which would allow the information requested by the Deputy to be provided.  However, an indication of the overall effect of VAT adjustments between 1985 and 1992 can be obtained by taking 1987 Household Budget Survey data and applying 1985 and 1992 VAT rates to them.  It is estimated on this basis that the average family comprising two adults and two children would pay VAT amounting to £17.94 under the 1992 structure and rates, compared with £18.20 under the 1985 system.  These figures should be interpreted with care since they take no account of improvement in living standards, nor of the general increase in the prices level between 1985 and 1992.  Furthermore, they implicitly assume that the consumption pattern and relative prices of 1987 apply to both years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's concerns relate to the provisions in the Capital Gains Tax Act which exempt the sale of a principal private residence from capital gains tax. There are safeguards in the capital gains tax legislation to deal with the type of situation mentioned by the Deputy.  The Revenue Commissioners tell me that these safeguards are working satisfactorily and there is no cause for concern.</P>
      <P>The exemption from capital gains tax is granted only under certain conditions. To qualify the vendor must have used the property as his principal private residence. An exemption will not be granted in the case of a house purchased wholly or mainly for the purpose of making a gain on its disposal.  Where a residence is sold for development purposes the additional consideration arising because of the value of the property for development purposes will not be exempt from capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>There are further provisions which enable the Revenue Commissioners to challenge persons turning over property on a regular basis.  Vendors of such properties may be regarded as carrying on a trade and would therefore be liable to income tax on the gain on the disposal of the property concerned.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the £42 million in loans for which contracts were signed during the visit to Dublin by the President of the European Investment Bank on 14/15 May 1992.</P>
      <P>The £42 million was made up of loans of £22 million to the Exchequer, £10 million to Waterford Harbour Commissioners and £10 million to Allied Irish Banks.</P>
      <P>The £22 million in loans to the Exchequer is being used to part-finance investment in the expansion of higher technical education facilities and in infrastructural improvements in Ireland, specifically in the areas of roads, water supply and sewerage facilities.  Details are as follows:</P>

        <i>Higher Technical Education Institutions</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A IR£10 million loan was provided to go towards the construction of new buildings, extension and modification of existing accommodation and provision of equipment in various colleges.  This will enable higher education institutions to increase research support to existing <Col N="872" /> industry, to introduce new technology and to upgrade and develop new products. The loan will contribute to the financing of investment of approximately £90 million in the following projects:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;new Regional Technical College at Tallaght, County Dublin</P>
    <P>&mdash;new science block at Dublin City University</P>
    <P>&mdash;new science and technology block at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth</P>

      <i>Waterford Harbour Commissioners</i>
    </P>
    <P>I understand that the £10 million loan from the European Investment Bank to Waterford Harbour Commissioners was for investment in a new container terminal to expand capacity and ease pressure on existing facilities at Waterford Harbour.  The EIB loan is going towards the project's first phase which includes construction of a 450 metre concrete wharf, office buildings, two new container cranes, dredging works and access roads.  The total cost of the project is estimated at £21 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Allied Irish Banks</i>
    </P>
    <P>I understand that the £10 million loan from the European Investment Bank to Allied Irish Banks is a global loan for on-lending in smaller amounts to small and medium-sized enterprises in industry, tourism and related services.  Global loans are lines of credit made available by EIB to increase the capacity of banks and financial institutions to meet the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. Funds will be advanced by the EIB to AIB according as specific projects are identified and approved by AIB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1990, the Office of Public Works published the Killarney National Park Management Plan, which sets out Office of Public Works' policies in relation to the protection of the Park's natural and cultural resources, and also their objectives for the provision of visitor facilities to enable the public to visit and appreciate them.</P>
      <P>In general the policy of the Office of Public Works is to encourage people to visit Killarney National Park for inspirational, educational, cultural and recreational purposes, under conditions compatible with the conservation of the environment.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works manage and monitor visitor activities to provide for this public use and enjoyment and regulate, where necessary, the amount, type, time or place of visitor activities to ensure the conservation of the natural and cultural heritage.  All new proposals for Park use will be evaluated in terms of their impact on the natural and cultural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Facilities provided for visitors will be harmonious with the cultural heritage, compatible with natural processes, and <Col N="877" /> as physically accessible as possible to all visitors.</P>
    <P>The Management Plan sets out conservation plans for the Park.  One of the biggest challenges in this area is the control of rhododendron ponticum, which has infested up to 900 ha. of native woodland. To date, 282 ha. have been cleared, and extensive work on further clearance is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Another main conservation aim is the removal of coniferous forestry plantations, and their replacement on a phased basis with natural vegetation, ultimately with the aim of integrating these areas into the other zones of the Park.</P>
    <P>The Management Plan also sets out Development Plans for visitor facilities at the Park.  Improvements are ongoing at Muckross House.  Since the Management Plan was published the Boudoir and Ante-Room have been refurbished, and further works on the Billiard Room, and &ldquo;Queen's Room&rdquo; are expected to be completed this year.</P>
    <P>Work on the adaptation of the laundry wing as the National Park Information Office, Audio-Visual Theatre and display area was completed this year.</P>
    <P>Other development plans stated in the Management Plan include the widening of the main road at the Carrigafreaghane entrance to the Park, while proposals have also been set out for the future restoration of Killarney House and Demesne.  The proposals for the Demesne include a major tree planting programme, restoration of internal pathways, development of car-parking areas and the restoration of the lands adjacent to Killarney House.</P>
    <P>The development programme for Ross Castle and its environs is another major proposal set out in the Management Plan. The programme includes the provision of toilet and boating facilities, extensive landscaping and an information service for visitors.  To date an improved car-park at Ross has been provided, landing facilities at Ross have been greatly improved, extensive landscaping work has been completed and a new information office opened.</P>
    <P>Additional walking routes and footpaths <Col N="878" /> within the Park are proposed. These include the provision of a path from Knockreer to Fossa, an alternative route for the Kerry Way and a &ldquo;Winter route&rdquo; route from Derrycunnihy to Gearhameen. The feasibility of a walking track around Lough Leane will also be examined.</P>
    <P>At present the Park is 10,129 ha. in extent.  It is the policy of the Office of Public Works to acquire further lands for inclusion within the National Park, resources permitting.  In this regard there is a proposal to provide approximately 90 acres of land previously leased for cattle grazing on the periphery of the National Park to the Killarney Golf Club as part of a third golf course in return for which the Office of Public Works would acquire 876 acres of upland deer range adjacent to the Park.  No decision, however, has yet been made, since no final plans of the proposed layout of the course have been made available to the Office of Public Works.  I want to assure the House that any plans submitted to me will be critically examined to ensure that the conservation and amenity qualities of the area are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I will arrange to have a copy of the management plan given to the Deputy so that he can be fully briefed on all aspects of the conservation of Ireland's largest national park.</P>

An intensive examination of the implications for DIRT of the final abolition of exchange controls, which must be done by the end of this year, was carried out in my Department.  This examination formed the basis of the revised DIRT provisions that have been enacted into law by the 1992 Finance Act.  There is no review of these revised DIRT provisions currently under way.</P>
      <P>My Department are holding discussions with representatives of the life assurance and unit trust industries to examine any implications the revised DIRT provisions might have for their products.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The Boyle Catchment Drainage Scheme (situated mainly in County Roscommon) and the Bonet Catchment Drainage scheme (situated mainly in County Leitrim) are, in fact, two separate schemes which are being carried out under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Works on these two schemes commenced in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheduled works on the Boyle Scheme are 70 per cent complete and at the moment consideration is being given to the action required to ensure that the overall cost estimate is not exceeded and that environmentally sensitive areas are not interfered with.  It is hoped to have the examination completed shortly and <Col N="882" /> to bring the scheme to a conclusion in 1993.</P>
    <P>In January this year operations on the Bonet scheme were suspended indefinitely on economic and environmental grounds, with about 92 per cent of the scheduled works completed.  Because of a serious risk of damaging important fisheries and the possibility of large compensation claims arising as a result, no work was undertaken in a number of sensitive areas.  There are no plans at present to re-commence work.</P>
    <P>The following table shows the financial allocations for these schemes and the numbers employed annually since works started:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 107 together.  The Government have commenced the preparation of the National Development Plan, which will be submitted to the EC Commission as the first stage of the elaboration of programmes to replace the current National Development Plan and Community Support Framework 1989-1993.  This plan will set out the structural measures which Ireland proposes to implement over the four year period 1994 to 1997, in conjunction with the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund, with a view to achieving the national and Community aims of greater economic and social cohesion.</P>
      <P>As the current Structural Fund arrangements will expire at the end of 1993, it will be necessary to have all the new arrangements in place at that stage if a smooth transition is to be assured.  I would hope to have the National Development Plan ready for submission to the EC early next year.  This timetable may need to be reviewed at a later stage in the light of progress in concluding the negotiations at EC level on the Delors II Package and on Ireland's total allocation under the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various Government Departments involved are currently preparing proposals for inclusion in the National Development Plan.  I have invited the subregional review committees, the organisations represented on the Central Review Committee, that is the CII, CIF, FIE, ICTU, IFA, ICMSA, and Macra na Feirme, and two other groups, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the Council for the Status of Women, to make submissions on the content and strategy of the plan.  A number of the subregional review committees have invited groups in their subregions to make submissions which the committees will take into account in drafting their submissions.  It is, of course, open to any group to make a submission in relation to the post 1993 Structural Fund to one of the subregional review committees, to the Department of Finance or to the <Col N="884" /> relevant Department dealing with the sector to which the submission relates.</P>

      <P>In relation to the affairs of Siúicre Éireann c.p.t./Greencore, the Government on 10 September 1991 decided, <i>inter alia,</i>&ldquo;to request the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="886" /> to carry out a complete investigation into all relevant matters which come within their jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On foot of this decision and under the statutory powers vested in my predecessor as Minister for Finance the Revenue Commissioners were requested to provide the report in question.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners' investigation is still ongoing.  The adequacy of existing legislation has been reviewed and certain measures have been included in the 1992 Finance Act.  In addition, the tax liabilities of persons involved have been under examination.  This examination, covering individuals and companies, has not been concluded but substantial progress has been made. Because of the scope of the inquiry, uncertainty and possible litigation concerning some basic facts and the possibility of appeals to the courts concerning taxation aspects arising, it may not be possible to reach finality on all revenue aspects for some time yet.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Revenue Commissioners are precluded by their confidentiality obligations from disclosure of the details of taxpayers' tax affairs except in certain specific circumstances. Outside of these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to publish more detailed information about the liabilities arising.  The circumstances allowing publication include certain appeals, prosecutions, judicial proceedings and settlements in lieu of court proceedings.  The disclosure criteria will apply in the normal way in relation to matters arising from the Greencore inquiry.</P>

      <P>There is already a number of schemes available to help new and existing businesses. In 1989, in response to a ministerial initiative, the commercial banks agreed to provide up to £10 million in loan finance to young entrepreneurs on certain terms.  The main feature of these terms is that the loans are at reduced rates of interest and the banks, in addition, do not demand personal security on such loans.  The scheme is administered by the individual banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1991, in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the four associated banks agreed to provide a further £15 million in loans at favourable rates for the creation or development of small and <Col N="888" /> medium-sized businesses with employment potential.  The assessment of individual loan applications is, of course, a matter for the banks.</P>
    <P>To date, in excess of £10 million has been lent by the participating banks to more than 220 projects under these schemes.  The provision of working capital and equity finance for small and medium sized enterprises is a commercial matter for the individual banks concerned. However, I am glad to note the recent initiative by the Small Firms Association in securing a particular scheme for its members with one of the main banking groups.</P>
    <P>As for the competitiveness of the banking sector, the legislation put through by the Government in 1989 on the Building Societies and Trustee Savings Banks and the recent ACC Bank legislation, and the proposed ICC legislation will increase the competitive pressures on the banking sector to meet the needs of their customers. The regulations giving effect to the EC Second Banking Directive will open up the Irish market to further EC competition.  These regulations are to be made later this year.  I have repeatedly exhorted the banks to act in a positive way to assist Irish business and I will be keen to monitor the banks' ongoing response in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank is the body with primary responsibility for interest rates in Ireland and it seeks to keep rates at the lowest level possible consistent with the objective of maintaining a firm exchange rate for the Irish pound within the narrow band of the European Monetary System. Over time, however, the level of interest rates in Ireland is determined by demand and supply conditions in the interbank money market and these conditions are, in turn, influenced by domestic and international factors which affect flows of funds into and out of the economy.  For these reasons, Irish interest rates in general cannot deviate significantly from the level determined by market forces.</P>
      <P>While domestic economic conditions warrant lower interest rates here at present, our position is determined largely by the interest rate levels of the currencies within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. The dominant currency is the Deutsche Mark and the German authorities continue to maintain interest rates at relatively high levels for their own internal reasons.  This, in turn, means that rates are relatively high for other currencies within the band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For its part, the Government seeks to promote economic conditions conducive to lower interest rates.  The maintenance of a firm exchange rate within the EMS and responsible fiscal policies have contributed <Col N="891" /> to a significant narrowing of interest rate differentials between Ireland and various other European countries since 1987.  For example, in March 1987 key German three month interest rates were some 9 percentage points below those in Ireland.  Today that differential is only about half a percentage point.  These policies will be maintained as the best means of ensuring further erosion of these interest rate differentials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the income tax objectives set out in last October's Review of the Programme for Government.  The review states the Government's firm intention to endeavour to achieve the objectives of a standard income tax rate of 25 per cent with a single higher rate of 44 per cent in the 1992 and 1993 budgets; it also states the Government's objective in the course of these budgets to begin working towards a considerable widening of the standard income tax band and increasing the basic personal allowances.  This reform programme is, the review states, to be implemented progressively from the proceeds of a parallel radical overhaul of the entire tax code and will be carried out on the basis of no net cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, considerable progress was made towards these objectives in the 1992 budget.  The standard tax rate was reduced from 29 per cent to 27 per cent and the top rate from 52 per cent to 48 per cent, so that there are now just two tax rates, 27 per cent and 48 per cent.  In addition, the standard rate tax band was extended by £775 for a single person and £1,550 for a married couple.  This major package of improvements was made possible by a range of base-broadening measures in income tax and other taxes.</P>

      <P>While Departments are not required to report cases of assaults on their staff to <Col N="895" /> me, I usually become aware of such cases through applications by Departments for benefits available to the victims of such assaults.  Such cases are largely concentrated in the Prison Service.  Elsewhere in the Civil Service, my information suggests that assaults on staff are not frequent or widespread.  Indeed, I am aware of only one case in 1990 and three in 1991.</P>
      <P>It is for Departments to take appropriate measures to minimise the instance of assaults on their staff.  General instructions issued by my Department in 1986 provided that Departments should regularly review and, if necessary, improve such preventive measures in the light of cases of assault reported to them.  I have no reason to doubt that this instruction is being complied with, particularly in those areas where staff are most likely to be placed in confrontational situations.</P>
      <P>All civil servants who are assaulted may apply for various forms of compensation. These are outlined in a circular issued by my Department in 1986. Medical expenses incurred as a result of an assault are usually reimbursed by the employing Department or the Department of Social Welfare, depending on whether or not an officer is established. Sick leave with pay may be granted for periods of absence resulting from an assault and such sick leave is not combined with normal sick leave in determining cut-off points for sick leave at full pay, half pay and pension rate.  Compensation may be given for any personal property, clothing, etc. damaged in an assault.  Should a civil servant have to retire as a result of an assault, or die within seven years of an assault and as a direct result of it, various benefits are payable to the officer or his-her dependants under the Civil Service Injury Warrant provisions.  The Injury Warrant benefits payable to the officer would be additional to normal Civil Service retirement benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as compensation for factors other than out of pocket expenses is concerned, there is a formal scheme of compensation in existence in the Prison <Col N="896" /> Service.  Applications for such compensation by other civil servants are dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and, given the small number of such cases, I am satisfied that a formal scheme is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 82 to 84, inclusive, and 101 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the Minister for Finance, in his capacity as President of the Council of Finance Ministers, signed the decision to raise the ceiling on borrowing by the European Commission under the Euratom Treaty from 2 billion ECU to 4 billion ECU in April 1990.  This is a matter of public record and, in his capacity as President of the Council, the Minister had no discretion once the matter had been agreed by the Council.</P>
      <P>Ireland has continually pressed for a greater emphasis on the health and safety aspects of the Euratom Treaty in relation to EC funding for the nuclear industry, and for a stronger role for the EC Commission in overseeing the implementation of the highest possible safety standards.  Ireland stressed this concern with safety at the Council of Finance Ministers when this proposal was discussed in December 1989.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that the decision related to the nuclear industry across the Community.  In addition, the decision to increase the ceiling did not widen the range of activities for which loans could be made.  The original decision in 1977 included both industrial production of electricity in nuclear power stations and industrial fuel cycle installations.  The Commission proposal for the increase stressed that it would contribute to safety-related investments which had been called for by member states and Community institutions as well as to reprocessing and waste storage.  The Irish Government will continue to emphasise the need to give priority to such safety-related investments.</P>

    <P>Government policy in relation to Sellafield <Col N="898" /> was set out in a speech made by the Minister for Energy during the debate on a Private Members motion on 30 June and 1 July 1992.  In the interest of maintaining all-party opposition to Sellafield's operations and plans, the Government accepted the Labour Party motion calling for a campaign of representation through every possible international forum with the object of securing the closure of Sellafield.</P>

      <P>The revised DIRT arrangements contained in the 1992 Finance Act were designed to avoid a situation whereby funds would leave this country after the abolition of exchange controls, which must take place before the end of this year.  Such an outflow of funds would create upward pressure on interest rates with serious consequences for levels of economic activity and employment.  A secondary objective is, of course, to preserve to the fullest extent possible in the circumstances the revenue the Exchequer receives from DIRT.  In the absence of the specific measures to be introduced, it should be clear that there would be a major erosion of the taxbase in this area, with obvious adverse implications for revenue.  The revised DIRT arrangements, especially the 10 per cent DIRT on the interest on money deposited in a Special Savings Account, will act as a substantial incentive for people to keep their savings in this country, thereby minimising the unavoidable negative impact on revenues resulting from capital liberalisation.  The revised DIRT provisions will not affect the 1992 revenue from DIRT.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have recently produced a further report on the staffing implications for the Customs and Excise service of the planned completion of the Single European Market on 1 January, 1993 and in particular the elimination of <Col N="902" /> the fiscal frontiers and border control between member states.  Overall the commissioners now estimate that about 75 Customs and Excise staff will be surplus to requirements following the completion of the Internal Market.</P>
      <P>The report identifies the Revenue Commissioners' staffing requirements for the expansion of some existing functions of the Customs and Excise service especially the strengthening of the common external frontier, increased control of drugs and other illicit traffic, improved Common Agricultural Policy control and post importation audit work.</P>
      <P>The report also outlines the Revenue Commissioners' staffing requirements for the redeployment of surplus Customs and Excise staff to other areas of Revenue work.  The first of these areas relates to the new arrangements for the collection of EC trade statistics post-1992 and the new VAT information exchange system.  The second area relates to the administration of the new motor-vehicle registration tax.  The third area relates to the use of surplus Customs and Excise staff in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners recognise that it is important to redeploy surplus Customs and Excise staff to these areas as soon as possible in order to ensure that proper administrative structures are in place and adequate training for staff is given before the end of 1992. The Revenue Commissioners are currently making arrangements to achieve this aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are 72 Customs and Excise staff employed in County Waterford and the Revenue Commissioners estimate that 14 of these staff will be surplus to requirements following the completion of the Internal Market.  There are redeployment opportunities for all of these staff in Revenue offices in areas adjoining County Waterford.  The commissioners are pursuing other options for the redeployment in the Waterford area e.g. redeployment to the new Department of Social Welfare Office in Waterford <Col N="903" /> city under the Decentralisation Programme.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have put a lot of effort into designing a strategy, the ultimate aim of which is to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, a career is provided for all Customs and Excise staff in, or close to, their present locations.  In keeping the human and domestic factors to the forefront, I would hope that through co-operative flexibility on all sides this aim can be achieved.</P>

      <P>The declaration of interest requirements set out in the <i>Guidelines for State Bodies</i> which I issued recently are specifically designed to form part of the internal control structures of the bodies in question, with a view to facilitating their optimum corporate governance.</P>
      <P>As regards the separate issue of public access, State bodies which are plcs are, of course, subject to the disclosure requirements of the Companies Acts. The <i>Guidelines for State Bodies</i> to which the Deputy refers also provide that those requirements which relate to directors should be implemented in the case of those State bodies which are statutory boards and whose legislation has not yet been amended to reflect these requirements. I have no problem with this.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to amend the Central Bank Act, 1989 to ensure that the bank is obliged to provide all relevant information to an inspector appointed under the Companies Act, 1990, in view of the recommendations of the interim report of the inspector appointed to investigate a number of companies involved in Sugar Distributors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Central Bank is required by the existing <Col N="905" /> legislation not to disclose information on specific transactions.  Consequently, it could not provide directly the information sought by the inspector. However, by virtue of section 16 &mdash; 2(c) of the Central Bank Act, 1989, this information was available to the Minister for Finance who transmitted it through the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the inspector, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so.  Accordingly I do not see a need to amend the Central Bank Act in that regard.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a sum of £284,000 sought under Subhead A5 of the Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas, destined for office machinery and other office supplies, was eliminated from the Estimate by his Department in view of the need to increase and improve the computerisation of the Houses of the Oireachtas because of the short term savings involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows all spending Departments' demands for additional resources are considered initially by the Department of Finance and ultimately by Government in the context of the resources available to the Exchequer. The Houses of the Oireachtas are no exception to this process.  The demand for office machinery and supplies for the Oireachtas Vote in 1992 was more than £500,000 greater than the 1991 allocation of £1.7 million.  Some £250,000 of the increase sought was in fact provided in the 1992 allocation.  Apart from minor estimating reductions amounting to some £30,000 the cut was made on the proposed computerisation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two main reasons for this. First, in my Department's estimation it seemed improbable that the necessary preparatory work would be completed sufficiently early in 1992 to warrant provision for expenditure at the level proposed <Col N="906" /> in 1992.  The Deputy will appreciate that an end of year rush to purchase computer equipment is not conducive to good decision making and there have been severe criticisms of such an approach in the past.  Second, I have a responsibility to the taxpayer to be satisfied that all investment proposals, including those for computerisation of certain aspects of the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas, will in practice yield the benefits and the savings claimed.  My Department has sought and expects to receive concrete proposals in this respect from officials of the Houses by the middle of this year for the specific purpose of advising on what additional provision for investing in information technology should be made in 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of media reports of a large number of songbirds being found dead in County Wicklow recently.  I understand that the gardaí in Arklow are in possession of three sacks of dead birds and are investigating this matter as are the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</P>
      <P>Songbirds are protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  I consider the illegal shooting of songbirds to be a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service has over 50 wildlife rangers employed throughout the country and indeed last year four additional rangers were employed in Wicklow.  Their duties <Col N="907" /> include enforcement of the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Any person, who has information in regard to illegal shooting of songbirds should speedily inform the local wildlife ranger and gardaí in the area concerned, so that they can investigate the matter immediately, before the alleged offenders leave the area.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service will prosecute any person, who is found illegally shooting songbirds.</P>

      <P>The most recent information available at county level is that obtained from the 1986 Census of Population and relates to the number of self-employed persons at work who indicated that their principal occupation was &ldquo;farming&rdquo;.  According to this source there were 3,556 farmers in County Sligo and 2,481 farmers in County Leitrim in 1986.  The comparable figures from the 1981 Census of Population were: 4,393 farmers in County Sligo and 3,288 farmers in County Leitrim. Corresponding information from the 1991 Census of Population will not be available until early 1993.  The results from the 1991 Census of Agriculture covering all persons involved in farming, whether on a full or part-time basis, will become available shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised that the Revenue Commissioners are making specific <Col N="923" /> arrangements to combat tax evasion opportunities which might otherwise arise in the context of the Single Market. Measures to combat tax evasion are kept under continuous review and there has been a significant deployment of Revenue resources in recent years into areas directly concerned with combating evasion and other forms of non-compliance with the tax code.</P>
      <P>In so far as VAT is concerned, this year's Finance Act introduced a comprehensive package of measures to counter certain types of fraud and abuse which had arisen and to limit the scope for tax evasion both under the present VAT regime and particularly following the abolition of fiscal frontiers as part of the Single Market on 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>Key elements in this package of measures are: the new VAT monthly control statement, to reduce the incidence of tax evasion involving the use of multiple accounts; the new VAT Information Exchange System, to ensure that traders' details of their intra-Community trade can be recorded and rapidly checked and monitored by the tax authorities here and in other member states of the EC; the new requirements for certain traders to provide security either as a condition of receiving a refund of VAT or as a condition of supplying goods or services where the Revenue Commissioners consider that there is a particular risk of fraud, evasion or loss of tax; the introduction of new penalties, and the increase of existing penalties in line with inflation, in respect of non-compliance with various requirements of the VAT Act; the treatment of an agent as being responsible for the VAT affairs of a non-resident trader and the VAT search, seizure and arrest powers, which retain existing Customs and Excise powers in so far as they relate to VAT on intra-Community trade and which tackle fraud and tax evasion.  I must stress that a number of these measures flow directly from the requirement to incorporate provisions of EC law in national legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new VAT arrangements which will <Col N="924" /> be put in place for trade between Northern Ireland and the State when customs barriers are removed are those which have been agreed between the 12 member states of the EC to apply on a Community-wide basis with effect from 1 January 1993.  Ongoing discussions are continuing in Brussels with regard to administrative co-operation between member states to counter fraud and evasion post-1992 and officials from the Revenue Commissioners are participating fully in these discussions.  Bilateral meetings with the United Kingdom Customs and Excise service are also taking place to ensure that any instances of evasion or fraud relating to trade with Northern Ireland are quickly identified and dealt with.</P>

    <P>The broad thrust of the Government's strategy for expanding economic activity and employment is as set out successively in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the <i>Programme for Government</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That strategy is working.  It has restored employment growth and is set, as international activity picks up, to underpin further expansion of sustainable jobs.  The Government acknowledges, however, that even more rapid economic progress, and <Col N="926" /> employment growth, is required having regard to prevailing high levels of unemployment and prospective increases in demand for jobs.  In this context it has taken a variety of initiatives, including the Industrial Policy Review Group, the Task Force on Employment and the Tourism Task Force.</P>
    <P>Since then, to further the objective of employment growth, the Joint Committee on Employment has been established on the initiative of the Government, <i>inter alia</i>&ldquo;to examine and make recommendations on all aspects of social policy which have a bearing on employment creation&rdquo;; and the Enterprise Trust, which is a key part of the employers' input to the area-based response to long term unemployment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, has been launched by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a number of submissions on the new powers of the Revenue Commissioners which were contained in the recent Finance Act.  As I have indicated on many occasions during the passage of the Act, the measures, which are circumscribed in law, are necessary to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners can tackle tax evasion effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed to taking action to curb tax evasion.  This is a firm undertaking given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Review of the Programme for Government.  Firm action in this area requires that the Revenue Commissioners should have the necessary powers to deal effectively with evasion. In considering proposals relating to Revenue powers for inclusion in the 1992 Finance Bill, which was enacted on 28 May, the Government had to consider three factors in particular: the Revenue Commissioners have now had some years' experience of auditing under the self assessment system.  This experience showed up certain weaknesses in the powers available to them to secure necessary information; the inquiries which the <Col N="928" /> Government had ordered into the affairs of certain companies in the last year had revealed some quite unacceptable practices in relation to taxation.  The Bill provided the Government with the first opportunity of putting in place appropriate safeguards against these abuses; and with the Single Market coming into operation next January, the tax compliance environment for businesses operating in the State will be fundamentally altered.  There will be no routine customs checks on intra-Community trade and VAT at the point of entry will have to be abolished.  Moreover, VAT-free or zero-rated goods will circulate freely.  This will provide much greater opportunity for fraud which could threaten legitimate businesses.  From 1 January 1993 the bulk of VAT will have to be collected under the internal VAT collection system i.e. as if the Border had been moved back to the traders' premises. In these circumstances, the powers already available to Customs officials in relations to VAT at the point of entry must logically be extended to the internal VAT collection system if VAT receipts are to be maintained and if compliant businesses are to be protected.  The Government were satisfied in the light of the above that an increase in the powers available to the Revenue Commissioners was necessary.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Government were conscious of the need to foster good relations between the Revenue and the great majority of taxpayers who comply fully with the law.  They were equally conscious of the need to keep to the minimum the amount of paperwork that compliant taxpayers must undertake in connection with their tax affairs.  Finally, they were conscious of the need not to upset the balance that must be struck between the rights of the citizen and the powers of the State.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed to me about the powers of entry and search.  It should be noted that Revenue have had the right to enter and search premises for records since 1972, in the case of VAT, and the right to enter premises and examine books since 1976 in the case of <Col N="929" /> income tax and corporation tax.  This has not led to any significant difficulties with compliant taxpayers.  For example, there have been no complaints to the Ombudsman about abuses of these powers.  The 1992 Finance Act does, however, give Revenue new powers to search in relation to VAT, income tax, corporation tax and certain other taxes including PAYE and construction industry tax.</P>
    <P>In so far as search of premises is concerned, this power will be needed in only a small minority of cases where taxpayers do not co-operate.  The board of the Revenue Commissioners have emphasised that officers concerned will receive appropriate training and guidance in the use of the powers to enter and search premises.  The board, as does the Government, intends to monitor closely the use of the measures.  In addition, a Revenue official can only gain entry to a private dwelling by invitation or on foot of a search warrant issued by the District Court.</P>
    <P>Public comment on the powers of arrest seems to indicate that there may be some misunderstanding in this regard. Section 189 provides, in relation to VAT, for the possibility of arrest but only in very limited circumstances.  An arrest can only be made where there are grounds for suspecting that a criminal offence has been committed under the provisions of section 94 of the Finance Act, 1983.  Only a person who is not resident in the State or who is likely to leave the State can be arrested.  The power of arrest in similar circumstances is already available to Customs officials in relation to VAT at the point of entry and the new provision merely takes account of the shift in the collection mechanism away from the frontier.  The whole purpose of the arrest provision is to make the alleged offender amenable to the judicial process &mdash; any abuse of the provision would quickly be highlighted by the courts.  Moreover, in order to further ensure that this arrest provision is not abused, only certain Revenue officials, specifically authorised under the new subsection, will be empowered to make arrests.</P>
    <P>Section 236 of the Act provides for <Col N="930" /> gardaí to accompany Revenue officials on audits.  The necessity for Garda protection for officials will seldom occur.  It has already been made clear by me a number of times that, in making a decision to arrest, a garda will be acting entirely on his own initiative; the Revenue official has no power to direct an accompanying garda.</P>

It has a <Col N="931" /> population of 319,089 (1986 Census) with an average density of 28 per sq km as against 51 for the State.  It covers an area of 11,333 sq km.  It is peripheral not only within the EC but also within Ireland itself.  It shares a land frontier of some 300 kilometres with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>1.2  The population is widely dispersed with a high degree of rurality; only four towns have populations above 5,000. There is a high level of migration which, if it continues, will mean that the rural way of life will disappear from many areas.</P>
    <P>1.3  The difficult topography of mountains, hills, rivers and lakes poses major problems for communications and agriculture. It adds significantly to the cost of providing an efficient road network and other infrastructure.</P>
    <P>1.4.  An important cultural feature of the area is the large Irish-speaking area (Gaeltacht) in North and West Donegal. It has a population of 26,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Infrastructure</i>
    </P>
    <P>2.1  There are serious deficiencies in the <i>road network.</i>  There are 717 km of national roads and much of this is substandard. There are 15,918 km of regional and county roads and most of them have deteriorated in recent years due to lack of funds for maintenance. <i>Rail services</i> to the sub-region are minimal with only the Dublin-Sligo line which serves only a small part of the sub-region.</P>
    <P>2.2  The most important <i>port</i> in the sub-region, Sligo, has suffered siltation over recent years with a consequent decline due to limitations on ship size and cargo tonnage.</P>
    <P>2.3  There are two <i>regional airports</i> in the area, one at Sligo and the other at Carrickfinn in West Donegal.  Both commenced scheduled flights in 1988, Sligo to Dublin and Carrickfinn to Glasgow. Both airports are being further developed.</P>
    <P>2.4  There are many inadequacies in the area of <i>water supplies and sewage disposal</i><Col N="932" /> which inhibit the development of industry and tourism.  Adequate waste disposal services also need to be developed.</P>
    <P>2.5  In general the <i>telephone service</i> is reasonably adequate; however, there is only a limited availability of advanced telecommunications services.  The relatively low population density in the North-West results in high average costs for the provision of telephone connections in rural areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Structure of the economy</i>
    </P>
    <P>3.1  A high proportion of the population is engaged in <i>agriculture.</i> However, given that 72 per cent of the land is marginal and that many of the holdings are small &mdash; of a total of 44,388 holdings over 4 hectares 32,500 are less than 20 ha &mdash; there is a high level of underemployment and a low level of farm incomes.  Average farm income is just half the national figure.</P>
    <P>3.2  Of the 19,145 persons engaged in <i>manufacturing industry</i> in 1987 65 per cent were working in the engineering, clothing and food sectors.  The principal sectors attracting multi-national investment have been healthcare, chemicals and clothing.</P>
    <P>3.3  The <i>labour force</i> in the sub-region (1987 figures) is about 115,000 which shows an increase of over 3 per cent since 1981.  This has been accompanied by a change in the pattern of employment by sector over the period as shown in the following table:</P>

    <P>These changes in the labour force are overshadowed by the growth in unemployment over the period from 15,700, or 14.1 per cent to 23,700, or 20.6 per cent of the labour force.</P>
    <P>3.4  Average <i>per capita income</i> (1984 <Col N="933" /> figures) is about 85 per cent of the national figure and about 49 per cent of the EC average.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Development objectives</i>
    </P>
    <P>4.1  The primary aim for the sub-region is the creation of viable, sustainable employment in all sectors of the economy so as to reduce unemployment, retain population and raise <i>per capita</i> income, while protecting and improving the environment.</P>
    <P>4.2  An essential prerequisite for measures to achieve this aim is the provision of an adequate <i>infrastructure:</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;access roads to the sub-region and roads within the sub-region must be improved.  This will involve the improvement of national, regional and county roads;</P>
    <P>&mdash;water supplies and waste and sewage disposal facilities must be improved if the sub-region is to attract industry and tourism in a worthwhile way and if the environment is to be protected and enhanced;</P>
    <P>&mdash;further development of regional airports is important to facilitate tourism growth and other economic activity;</P>
    <P>&mdash;advanced telecommunications services to and within the sub-region must be introduced.</P>
    <P>4.3  Given the rural nature of the sub-region, and notwithstanding the marginal nature of the land and the problem of farm size, <i>agriculture</i> is likely to continue as an important source of employment in the sub-region.  However, it is necessary to improve dramatically on the present situation regarding farm income.  To do this it will be necessary to improve farm efficiency, improve quality and diversify into alternative products and agri-projects.</P>
    <P>4.4  <i>Rural development</i> must be a priority in order to halt the depopulation of rural areas.  Two of the areas, and part of two other areas, for the Pilot Programme for Integrated Rural Development are in the sub-region.  The lessons which will be learned from that <Col N="934" /> programme must be applied across the sub-region.</P>
    <P>4.5  Much of the marginal land in the sub-region is eminently suitable for <i>forestry.</i> It is intended to increase substantially the area under forestry over the five-year period to 1993.  This should be accompanied by a substantial growth in timber processing.  It will be necessary to construct new and improve existing forest roads to enable the potential of forests to be exploited.</P>
    <P>4.6  The <i>fishing</i> industry is already an important sector in the sub-region.  Four of the ten ports with the largest landings in the State are located in the sub-region; one of those, Killybegs, accounts for 40 per cent of national tonnage.  However, efforts must be made to capitalise on this by fleet modernisation and the development of a fish processing industry.  <i>Aquaculture</i>, particularly salmon farming, is also reasonably well established.  There is evidence of possibilities for other species particularly shell fish.  Much remains to be done, especially as regards the provision of facilities, to develop the full potential of <i>angling</i> in the many inland lakes and rivers of the sub-region.</P>
    <P>4.7  <i>Tourism</i> is already reasonably well established in the sub-region but the full potential is far from being reached.  For many areas tourism is the only possible developmental sector.  Some 272,000 overseas visitors (13 per cent of the national total) visited the sub-region in 1987; by 1992 it is intended to bring this figure up to 588,000 giving rise to an estimated 2,000 additional jobs.  The principal strategy is to develop products based on the sub-region's natural cultural and heritage attractions.</P>
    <P>4.8  Notwithstanding what can be achieved in the sectors already mentioned <i>industry</i> will be the key to creating permanent employment.  To achieve an expansion of the industrial base it will be necessary to promote:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of small and medium-sized industries particularly those based on indigenous resources <Col N="935" /> and the expansion of existing such industries;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the attraction of new overseas investment and the expansion of existing overseas industries in the sub-region;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the attraction of international service industries;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the improvement of technology;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the promotion of a strong marketing capability.</P>
    <P>4.9  Of equal importance to the physical infrastructure as a prerequisite for economic development is the availability of an able and efficient work force.  <i>Education and training</i> must, therefore, be a prime objective.  This objective can be achieved by:</P>
    <P>&mdash;developing and adjusting education-training programmes to respond to <Col N="936" /> structural changes in the economy and to technological change;</P>
    <P>&mdash;encouraging an increase in the numbers of people who receive education-training after the compulsory period of education;</P>
    <P>&mdash;improving skills of persons with special labour problems to enable them to avail of job opportunities;</P>
    <P>&mdash;upgrading and extending facilities for education-training.</P>
    <P>4.10  The sub-region is well placed for the further development of economic and social <i>co-operation with Northern Ireland</i> thus providing for a much higher level of integrated development within the island of Ireland as a whole.  It is expected that there will be a considerable boost to tourism in both parts of the island with the proposed linking of the Shannon and Erne water systems by the re-opening of the Ballinamore- Ballyconnell Canal.</P>

This section of the canal was reopened to navigation in 1987 and has been operational ever since.</P>
    <P>The second phase consists of the clearing to profile the remainder of the canal between Acres Lake and Lough Allen, the construction of a new lock at Drumshanbo and the dredging of sections of the bed of Lough Allen to provide adequate navigation depths.  In this connection the canal clearing works are virtually complete while the construction of the lock is progressing satisfactorily and should be completed next year when the lake dredging operation will be put in hands.

The question of compensation for landowners along the route of the Ireland onshore segment of this pipeline, as in the case of any other pipeline, is primarily a matter for negotiation between Bord Gáis Éireann and the persons concerned.

      <P>Development plans for Sligo Harbour are in the first instance a matter for determination by Sligo Harbour Commissioners. Where such development works request EC aid, I will in due course be making recommendations to Government on the Commissioners' proposals.</P>
      <P>Work is underway in my Department for a continuation of EC aid for development works at commercial ports.  Port authorities, including the Sligo Harbour Commissioners, have recently submitted development plans for consideration for EC aid under the Cohesion Fund and the post-1993 EC Operational Programme on Peripherality.  The projects submitted are being evaluated on an equal footing.</P>

      <P>I think it is important to stress at the outset that pelagic tank boats of up to 90 feet in registered length are legally entitled to fish in the area in question.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this my Department has devoted considerable time and effort in addressing the problem of conflict between pelagic tank boats and local fishermen using fixed gear in the area.</P>
      <P>In this regard significant progress has been made in resolving the difficulties between the two sides.  An agreed code of practice has been put in place which deals with such matters as the positioning and marking of static gear, the operation of trawlers in the area, and the processing of claims for damage to fixed gear.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that these arrangements will enable both sides to operate in harmony in the area.  I will, however, be keeping the matter under close review.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>It would be misleading to list all the stations in the Division of Sligo-Leitrim which are not up to standard.  Problems relating to Garda stations can vary greatly and can be rectified in different ways.  Frequently stations which would formerly have been adequate are replaced or extended because of changes in Garda accommodation requirements. Many of the buildings which house Garda stations are old; some require structural improvement, others new facilities such as central heating, new kitchen facilities, shower facilities, improvements to cells, and so on.  Finally, a very large amount of the work which takes place is of a minor nature and is part of an ongoing process of maintenance and modernisation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be pleased to note that I recently announced the setting up of a review of the Garda Building Programme to assess Garda accommodation needs, having regard to changing Garda requirements and to make recommendations as to how these should be met on the most cost-effective basis.  This review will pinpoint the objectives we must set ourselves in relation to Garda accommodation in all areas of the country for the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The provision of acute hospital services is a matter for each health board having regard to their competing service priorities and the resources at their disposal. Some health boards have made provision for seasonal closures in their service plans for 1992.  I should point out that seasonal closures are not unusual and, indeed, <Col N="966" /> are part and parcel of the provision and organisation of hospital services throughout the country.  This has been the case over many years.  Seasonal closures are often planned to coincide with staff annual leave and when the level of activity at the hospital has traditionally decreased.  All emergency and urgent services will, of course, continue to be provided. I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that my Department is closely monitoring the situation regarding seasonal closures and is keeping in constant touch with the health agencies about this matter.  Should it emerge that undue hardship arises, I have no doubt that the health board concerned would take appropriate action with a view to alleviating the situation.</P>

      <P>Statistics published by the World Health Organisation show that Ireland's suicide rate is among the lowest in the European Community.  Nonetheless there has been an increase in recent years, in particular among younger age groups and among women, a trend which is common to most European countries.</P>
      <P>The causes of suicide are complex. Changes in the cohesiveness of society, depression, an erosion of traditional values, a lack of employment opportunities and social isolation are all factors which can contribute to individual distress. In a report carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute on unemployment, poverty and psychological distress, it was found that the unemployed were five times more likely than other people to show symptoms of a non-psychotic psychiatric nature.  Social support was seen to play an important role in reducing the impact of deprivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ability of people to cope with life is <Col N="967" /> a crucial factor influencing mental health. The ability to cope may also be affected by other issues, such as damaging experiences in childhood, inadequate preparation for the challenges of life and addiction to alcohol and drugs.</P>
    <P>The health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed. A large proportion of suicides is associated with a recognisable mental disorder, most commonly a treatable depressive illness.  Health boards are involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through parenting programmes, pre school playgroups, life skills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that the promotion of mental health should form part of health promotion generally. As the Deputy will be aware, I launched a Green Paper on Mental Health on 3 June last.  One chapter discusses the challenge of promoting mental health and the prevention of suicide.  The Green Paper outlines the role mental health personnel can play in the prevention of suicide and emphasises the important contribution of voluntary bodies.  Submissions on the proposals in the Green Paper are invited from interested parties before 1 October 1992.</P>

      <P>The Regulations governing the statutory in-patient charge specify that the charge is payable in respect of each day or part of a day.  A patient admitted and discharged at the times given in the question would therefore be liable to pay the charge in respect of both days.  I should stress that this applies only to the statutory charge, currently £15, which represents only a small part of the cost of providing hospital services.  Maintenance charges for private and semi-private accommodation are based on the number of nights spent in the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am aware that this aspect of the Regulations has been of concern to patients, and I am prepared to examine whether there is any alternative approach which would be more satisfactory.  I will consider the Deputy's suggestion in that context. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that I would have to ensure that any alternative approach did not cause a reduction in the revenue available for the provision of hospital services.</P>

      <P>The distribution of the full Health allocation of national lottery funds for 1992 is not yet finalised.  Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to say what proportion of the 1992 allocation will be spent in the North-Western Health Board area or in County Sligo.  The bulk of the £39.8 million will be expended on services for the elderly, the mentally and physically handicapped, child care services, the hospital building programme, public health and other services provided by the health boards and on miscellaneous grants to national and local voluntary groups.  The North-Western Health Board was recently given a block <Col N="969" /> allocation of £160,000 from national lottery proceeds which it will distribute, as it sees fit, mainly to local voluntary groups operating in the health board area.</P>

Accordingly, the councils of counties Longford, Meath and Roscommon were invited by my Department to nominate appropriate road projects and put forward a total of 17 projects with a combined cost of £3,310,000.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>European Political Co-operation (EPC), as a system of consultation and co-ordination on foreign policy questions among the member states, was already in existence when Ireland acceded to membership of the Community in 1973.  These arrangements were placed on a Treaty basis in the Single European Act, which came into effect in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Single European Act, the member states have <Col N="983" /> co-ordinated their positions on the political and economic aspects of security. This has led, <i>inter alia,</i> to the adoption of common positions of the Twelve on a number of disarmament and non-proliferation issues at the United Nations and in other international fora.  Ireland has participated in all discussions in the EPC framework since becoming a member of the Community in 1973.</P>
    <P>Under the new Treaty on European Union, the common foreign and security policy will address security questions in the broadest sense.  The new Treaty does not empower the European Union to act in the defence area nor does it require member states to become a member of the Western European Union or any military alliance.  Where issues with defence implications arise, these may be elaborated and implemented in the Western European Union at the request of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Treaty does not alter Ireland's position as a country outside military alliances.  The terms of Article J.4 (4), which states that &ldquo;the policy of the Union in accordance with this article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;, constitute an additional safeguard for Ireland's position and will ensure that our traditional policy will not be prejudiced by actions or decisions of the Union.</P>

      <P>In accordance with what I indicated during the Adjournment Debates in the Dail and Seanad on 24 June last, I raised the question of the lower ewe premium for 1992 resulting from its calculation for the first time on the basis of a single region of the entire Community, <Col N="986" /> at last week's Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg.  At Council I pressed for an additional premium to compensate farmers in member states, including Ireland, where market prices are particuarly low.  The Commission noted my concerns and agreed to monitor developments closely over the coming months.</P>
      <P>The importation of New Zealand lamb into the EC is governed by a Voluntary Restraint Agreement under the GATT, which limits imports to 205,000 tonnes per year.  In addition, the Agreement contains price surveillance provisions designed to ensure that lamb imported to the EC does not undermine prices in the Community.  There is no scope at present for further restrictions, but it is of course the policy of my Department to bring to the Commission's attention at all times the need to ensure that the existing protective provisions are fully observed.  The Agreement expires at the end of 1992 and any further Agreement would require a consensus between the EC Member States and New Zealand.  In this regard I will be pressing for terms taking full account of Ireland's interests.</P>

      <P>With a view to minimising the effects of the regional imbalance in the applications for the recent Community buy-up scheme, I have put a number of arrangements in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> All small producers with quotas of less than 12,800 gallons were allocated additional quotas of 2.8 million gallons from a national reserve.  These allocations represented an increase to allocations previously made to small producers from the special 1 per cent reserve in 1989.  Depending on the co-operative-dairy, the initial allocations ranged from 139 gallons to 542 gallons. This additional award has brought all allocations up to 640 gallons.  The co-operatives-dairies in the North-North-West have the largest number of small producers and therefore, while this area accounts for about 20 per cent of the national quota, their share of the additional 2.8 million gallons was in the region of 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Arrangements were also put in place for the allocation of an available reserve of 117,000 gallons to a small number of co-operatives in this region who had sur rendered most quota under the buy-up scheme.</P>
    <P>I also successfully negotiated an extension of the Buy-up Scheme and decided to operate this in the Munster region only.  Any quota purchased under this extension will, however, be available nationally.</P>
    <P>With a view to the operation of any future Community buy-up schemes, I have asked the milk quota review group to consider the approach to be taken to the problem of disproportionate losses.  The group recommended that future schemes be framed so as to avoid the flow of quota from one co-operative-dairy area to another.  It is my intention to negotiate on this basis, in so far as possible, future proposals of this nature.</P>

      <P>Statistics of the number of people affected by the discontinuance of the alleviating payments are not available on a county basis.</P>
      <P>Arising from the delay in implementing the Equal Treatment Directive by the then Government, a number of court proceedings were initiated by married women.  Having considered the most recent decision of the European Court, the Government decided earlier this year to provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay at a cost of £60m in the period 1992 to 1994.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the courts have also found that the alleviating payments are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment and for this reason, the Government had no option but to discontinue these payments.  In order to minimise the impact on people still in receipt of the alleviating payments, the Government decided to discontinue them with effect from the end of July coinciding with the date of implementation of this year's budget increases.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to introduce some other compensation in these cases as suggested by the Deputy as any such provisions would similarly be in conflict with the EC Directive.</P>

The numbers of persons receiving unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance on the live register at the four local offices situated in County Clare are as set out as follows:</P>

      <P>Unemployment statistics are compiled by reference to the local office from where the claims are administered rather than the area of residence of the claimants.  Only the Ballymun local office caters exclusively for persons resident in the areas specified by the Deputy. However, a considerable number of claims in respect of people resident in these areas are administered by Gardiner Street and North Cumberland Street local offices and it is not possible to distinguish between these claims and those of persons resident in other areas.  The numbers of persons registered as unemploymed at Ballymun Employment Exchange are as set out as follows:</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the numbers who have availed of the recently introduced employment subsidy and job training scheme; and if, in view of the fact that the take up under both schemes is extremely poor, he will agree to hold urgent meetings with the social partners with a view to rectifying the design faults and relaunch both schemes.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications for the recruitment of about 5,000 persons under the employment subsidy scheme (ESS) and 280 under the job training scheme (JTS) have been received by FÁS so far.  Actual placements to date are 1,483 and 19 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the level of take-up to date on both schemes.  Recruitment on the employment subsidy has picked up and is now running well in excess of 100 per week.  As regards the job training scheme, I always accepted that the scheme would be slow getting off the <Col N="1000" /> ground.  I am concerned to have a quality training scheme on employers' premises. Training programmes have to be designed, agreed and monitored.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I recently met with representatives of the social partners to discuss the low take-up on the schemes. At that meeting, the Taoiseach urged employer representatives to encourage their members to take advantage of the schemes and arranged that FAS and employer and ICTU representatives should meet to see how participation in the schemes might be increased.  This meeting is due to take place this week. Depending on the outcome of the meeting, in the light of these discussions, I will consider what further action is to be taken.</P>
