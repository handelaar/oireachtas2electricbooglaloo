      <P>We are now into the middle of May, the Referendum will take up the time of Members, and then we come towards the end of the session. Last week I asked the Taoiseach if he was in a position to instruct the Government Whip to indicate to the Opposition parties the priority of Bills the Government seriously intend to take this session so that we could have more constructive and meaningful debates. That has not happened yet. Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Government will be in a position to clearly indicate the priority of the Bills they hope to take between now and the end of the session so that we can all do our work better?</P>

      <P>In view of widespread leaks, will the Taoiseach inform us when it is intended to introduce the promised legislation to amend the Broadcasting Act? In relation to another matter that has been mentioned, may I suggest that one of the reasons the Government are <Col N="1156" /> not concerned about the postal dispute is that they support one of the protagonists?</P>

      <P>In a sense my question is related. The Taoiseach indicated to the House that the terms of reference or the proposals for a European affairs committee are with Members of the Opposition parties but that is not our understanding. The terms of reference were circulated to some Members but not the entire proposal for the committee. As the Taoiseach will be aware, in respect of other committees recently launched in this House, the support arrangements for them have not yet been finalised and will, effectively, prevent them from doing any work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, a Cheann <Col N="1158" /> Comhairle, this regrettably seems to be one of the few forums in which we can ask questions to which we might get a succinct reply. In view of the question raised by Deputy De Rossa with regard to Delors Mark II and the farm package, a European affairs committee would make the Chair's job so much easier because we would not be raising these matters on the Order of Business, and the Chair knows how much we care for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was giving details of my experience as a member of two local authorities in my own constituency. I also outlined to the Minister of State how impossible it would be to meet the needs and demands of those already approved and placed on housing waiting lists due to a lack of commitment by the Government to a public housing programme and failure to provide the capital to complete existing waiting lists. It must be an embarrassment to the Minister, the Minister of State and Government representatives on local authorities that the only response from the Government to the housing crisis is to publish this Bill. There is nothing in it that will meet the needs, demands or worries of the applicants who have been approved for local authority houses.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will agree that one of the most important achievements for young married couples with a family, is to have a house of their own even if they have to pay excessive repayments. I indicated last night also that 10 per cent of people on the waiting list are being housed annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South Tipperary local authority <Col N="1160" /> have 270 approved applicants. Compared with the cities of Dublin, Cork and other cities this may appear a small figure but it includes all the major towns and villages in the county. The Government in a proposal released this month indicated we can only provide 25 houses this year. At that rate it will be ten years before South Tipperary County Council can meet the existing waiting list, presuming nobody else needs a house during that time which is unlikely.</P>
    <P>We have a housing crisis which is not confined to the local authorities in Tipperary. The position is very bad in Cashel and Carrick-on-Suir, and the latter town in addition has an unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>On the radio this morning a Fianna Fáil member accused me, and other Members, of not addressing the problems of Carrick-on-Suir. He must know from his consultations with his own Ministers &mdash;he is reluctant at times to discuss problems with Progressive Democrats Ministers &mdash; that the Government are not responding to any crisis whether it is unemployment, housing, health or whatever.</P>
    <P>Over recent months the Minister identified this Bill as the response to all the problems. Last night I described that response as a disgrace. From my experience as a member of a local authority I know how difficult it is to meet the needs in this area. When introducing this Bill the Minister signalled a danger.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said, as reported at column 2346 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the plan is intended to supplement, not to supplant, the traditional local authority house building programme. Indeed, there is a commitment in the plan and in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to maintain the local authority programme&mdash;</P>
    <P>He then qualified it by saying:</P>
    <P>&mdash;at an appropriate level having due regard to resources and to the impact of the alternative measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> The plan does, however, signal for the future a reduction in the historical degree of dependence on local authority house building.</P>
    <P>That statement by the Minister that he was not supplanting the traditional role of local authorities is qualified by him saying, depending on the resources available. He warned us we will be moving away from local authority houses being provided by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas is shirking its responsibility to allocate funds to local authorities to provide housing for those in need. If the policy being followed by the Government is continued it will be the death knell of the provision of houses by local authorities. There is little in this Bill to suggest that the historical role of local authorities in relation to housing will be taken over by any other agency. Such agency would need capital funding from the Government for such housing. Why by-pass a statutory authority which has a record second to none in housing? Local authorities have never once built a house that did not have three or four applicants for it. They have not built houses for the sake of building them. Carrick-on-Suir has an excellent record as a small local authority. Clonmel Corporation has had a magnificent record as indeed have all the officials, housing officers and town clerks attached to those local authorities. Now they are embarrassed week after week and month after month by our questioning as to what they are doing about the housing crisis. They are unable to respond because of the lack of capital funding from the Government.</P>
    <P>Last night I formally thanked the Minister for the Environment who recently visited the constituency and agreed to sit down and talk to members of the council from all political parties who made a submission to him along the lines I am now putting on the record of this House. His only response, having met us, was that he was publishing this Bill which would address some of these problems. We are examining the Bill to see in what possible way it could address the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>We have discussed at length with the <Col N="1162" /> housing officer at local authority level the idea of the shared ownership/leasing option and have come to the conclusion that this could be a recipe for disaster. In a scheme in which participants would put up half the cost of a house and the local authority the other half, participants will be faced with meeting the cost of a loan plus rent to the local authority. Over a period of 25 years, if they are fortunate enough to stay in employment, they will have to continue that double payment and will subsequently have to make arrangements to buy out the remaining share of the house from the local authority. I can see major problems arising. The income limit for eligibility for this scheme is pitched so low that with any indexation of costs it is inevitable that over the next 20 years or so participants will be under major financial pressure to meet both the mortgage and the local authority rent. At the end of the first period another mortgage must be taken out for an equivalent period to redeem the county council's part of the mortgage arrangement. I see this leading to tremendous financial difficulties. Local authorities will be faced with the obligation to repossess these houses, evict the people who opted for this shared ownership and rehouse them, with all the complications that will arise with the title deeds because of the shared ownership. What we should have done was to house them and give them the opportunity to purchase their own local authority house.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the previous Minister, Deputy Flynn, on the 1988 tenant purchase scheme which was successful in spite of the reservations expressed by other Deputies last night. There was a queue of applicants for this scheme. Unfortunately the conditions under which tenants could apply were narrow. If the scheme had been extended, many more would have applied. Indeed local authorities throughout the country requested by resolution that that scheme be extended to allow people the opportunity of owning their own house. The cost was pitched at a level of compensation which made it possible for people to avail of that <Col N="1163" /> scheme. It gave tenant purchasers pride in owning their own houses and removed from the local authority the obligation to carry out repairs, which is a major burden on local authorities and on which many millions of pounds are spent. It may be that from the beginning we should have ensured that the standard was better than it was. Aside from the removal of the burden on the local authority to carry out repairs, it is in the nature of Irish people to want to own their own homes. It is a legacy of the importance attached to owning one's own piece of land. It is something the Irish are proud of and they should be encouraged in that. I call on the Minister to give people that opportunity so that subsequently they will have the option of going into the private market and releasing local authority housing for other people on the list.</P>
    <P>Last night a Deputy on the Government side criticised that scheme on the basis that it encouraged people to move to other areas. That was one of the reasons the scheme was discontinued. Now the Government have seen the light and have reintroduced a mortgage subsidy to assist people to move if they wish and release the local authority house. There is nothing wrong with people trying to better themselves. They should not be locked into housing schemes if they would be happier in another area and can improve their situation. We should give incentives to people to better themselves.</P>
    <P>The new trend seems to be to shepherd people into villages and towns, and planners are obsessed with housing people in estates and groups of houses where there are services; but in the past local authorities made a major impact on the development of rural Ireland by refurbishing old cottages and isolated houses and building houses for people on their own sites. This was done through tenant purchase schemes or vesting schemes. Magnificent families, many of whom have had to emigrate and some of whom have married and have been housed elsewhere, were reared in those houses, but these were the original homes. They are <Col N="1164" /> the parents' houses, the vesting orders have been redeemed in full and to all intents and purposes, they are private houses.</P>
    <P>In 1987, the Government scrapped every grant which would enable these people to refurbish these houses. The criticism was made, in particular by Fianna Fáil, that too much money was being spent refurbishing rural cottages and houses at colossal expense to the Exchequer. Yet, the building industry boomed during that period because the builders and contractors had to register for VAT and tax which benefited the Government and the industry provided employment and improved the housing stock.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme introduced in this Bill, if a house is sound instead of rehousing the people living there &mdash; generally the parents who are tenant purchasers or vested owners and usually old age pensioners with limited disposable incomes &mdash; the local authority may spend £10,000 or £12,000 to bring it up to an acceptable standard and this money will have to be repaid to the local authority by way of rent. I ask the Minister to provide a subsidy to help tenants repay that money so that they will not be evicted from the house in which they invested their life savings and for which they paid rent, or die bankrupt. Having gone through all this and having redeemed their loan, they now have to repay the local authority by way of rent, the cost of refurbishing the house. However, I will reserve judgment of the scheme until I see the level at which the rent is pitched so that ownership will not be interfered with &mdash; that is very important &mdash; and that the local authority will be recompensed for the works carried out. The rent should be pitched at a level which would make it possible for old age pensioners to meet the repayments. As I said, it is old age pensioners in the main who are occupying these houses.</P>
    <P>I would like to address the problems associated with HFA loans. Most of us, as members of local authorities, try to implement every scheme for applicants <Col N="1165" /> to purchase their own houses or to be involved with the local authority as the lending agency. Under the terms of the HFA loan scheme, the applicant's repayments were based on his income. We all realised that if his income dropped, his repayments were reduced. However none of us realised that at the higher end of the scale repayments were almost excessive but made relatively little contribution to the capital value of the house. At the other end of the scale, I know people who have lost their jobs and are on social welfare but because the repayments are so low and the value of the houses is increasing these unfortunate people will never be able to pay off their bill. Through no fault of their own, they will never be able to meet the entire cost of the HFA loan. We have now reached the stage where the only option open to these people is to take out a second mortgage from a building society or some other financial institution to redeem the HFA loan and to start again. That is extraordinary. When the scheme was initiated many years ago the recommendations of local representatives were accepted by those in need of housing. However, it was never envisaged that, when a person's income dropped to such a low level, despite meeting their weekly or annual repayments, they still owed money on the capital and they could end up with their children having to repay the HPA loan.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in getting some local authority housing loans. My local authority made a submission to the Department in which we asked them to waive some of their obligations so that people would not have to ask banks or building societies to refuse their legitimate applications in spite of the fact that mortgage repayments are lower in the case of loans from some outside agencies than they are from local authorities. People always believed a local authority loan was cheaper than a loan from a bank or building society because some of the legal and other costs were included. In the private mortgage sector one can only get a 90 per cent loan with the result that an applicant had to pay a high deposit. It <Col N="1166" /> is humiliating for people to find it necessary to go to a bank or building society and ask them to turn down their applications so that they meet the local authority requirements.</P>
    <P>My local authority wrote to the Minister earlier this year requesting that the Department change the housing regulation in this regard but in his letter dated 30 April, the Minister said it was not possible to do so. He indicated that public funds could only be made available to those in need, but I am talking about applicants who qualified under the means test and whose income does not exceed £12,000. They should qualify for a local authority loan but we request them to go to a bank or building society to be refused before we will process their application, even though they have complied with the regulations set down by the Department, and can meet their repayments. That is very important.</P>
    <P>For years now at each local authority meeting a list of people is presented which the council intend to pursue by way of notice to quit or evictions. Due to unemployment, these people are unable to meet some of their repayments. It is important that the local authorities and the housing officers carry out indepth investigations to ensure that an applicant will be able to repay the loan. No one is looking for loans for people who will be unable to repay them because they realise that will only get them into difficulty. However, they are bound by restrictions and the regime. I am disappointed that even as late as this month the Minister refused to change the criteria for the ordinary local authority housing loan. The way to address the housing need is to make loans available to genuine applicants in a limited category which would help them to help themselves. This policy has been followed in the past by successive Governments and local authorities but the present administration seem to want to make it more difficult. Indeed, I have a feeling that the Minister wants to give the cream of the market to the private sector which, of course, would be the Minister's philosophy and that of his colleagues in Government &mdash; that the <Col N="1167" /> private sector at all stages must be supported. We do not have any objection to the private sector but the public sector is also the responsibility of the Government and any funding available to the public sector by way of Housing Finance Agency loans, local authority and small loans funds and grants are incentives to people and would assist them in being rehoused. I ask the Minister to look again at this provision.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to look at the provision in relation to the new house grant section of his Department. The Minister has stated that, when building a house, a registered builder must be employed. In addition to having a qualified registered builder, the applicant is still expected to produce evidence that he paid at least £15,000 on VAT registered products when the house was being built. These regulations make it more difficult to build houses and they have denied people an opportunity to use the direct labour system to build houses, which can be cheaper by means of contracting with different people who are competent in the area of roofing, block-laying, design or plumbing. The Minister now expects all materials used to be VAT registered. I accept the principle of VAT and builder registration but I also recognise that unemployed people are competent to do this work. If they sign off the unemployment register &mdash; as many a stone-mason and builder's labourer have done &mdash;if they want to work on building houses where the materials used have had VAT levied on them and they can produce evidence to this effect, I see no objection to an applicant building a first house in a rural area, on a site of his own, being able to avail of the best expertise which may not be part of a huge contracting company. If the person can produce evidence of PRSI, unemployment assistance or qualification number, it should be accepted proof that the operator does not owe tax. I do not accept &mdash; this applies to all members of my party &mdash; that people should do &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; and sign on at the same time. However, people should be given the opportunity to come off the <Col N="1168" /> unemployment register and to be employed legitimately in building, an area in which they could be competent. If these people can show proof of the fact that they do not owe tax and are not drawing unemployment or other benefits, that they are legitimate builders and that the materials they used have been registered and subject to VAT, what more can one ask? That does not seem to be enough for the Department as they are insisting on a whole tier of regulations in this area which makes it very difficult to assist people to qualify for a miserly grant of £2,000 for a first time builder of a new house.</P>
    <P>Most houses in rural areas cost £25,000 to £30,000, I am talking about ordinary three bedroomed houses. If we follow the philosophy advocated by the Department and local authorities that we shepherd everyone into villages and towns we must recognise that sometimes there are social problems as a result of people living so close to one another. Some of these people would be much happier in rural areas and it would be as cheap, if not cheaper, to build houses in rural areas because land is much cheaper than in a developed area or one zoned for development, where land is expensive. In my local authority area, the small urban council in Tipperary have a land bank available to people, they have sanitary services, sewerage, lights and footpaths but it costs £8,000 per house. What young married couple, unless they have a very good income, could pay £8,000 for a site and then build a house which must meet a certain planning requirement? Even the colour of the slates is designated. We have not really addressed local authority responsibility or assistance to the private sector for people who need some help. There is nothing new about this but the Minister decided, for financial reasons, to curtail that facility. There should be grants for people to build or repair their houses and regulations to ensure that loans are available which will be repaid at considerable expense. Everybody knows that when a mortgage is repaid it is double the amount originally borrowed. It is frightening for people who receive <Col N="1169" /> redundancy payments and who want to redeem their loan to find that, after ten or 12 years' payment, they owe as much as they borrowed. One must go through approximately 75 per cent of repayments before repaying capital. We are not asking for handouts, we are asking for the facility to be able to borrow at a reasonable interest rate.</P>
    <P>Local authority interest rates must always be pitched lower than the private sector because the private sector is available to people who can reasonably afford to take out a mortgage. They are welcomed &mdash; indeed coaxed &mdash; by the building societies to do so because that is their business. However, a local authority which operate a grant, assistance, housing or loans scheme always do so on the basis that they are a housing authority and must house people or assist them to house themselves. That is the philosophy but most of the provisions in the Bill do not address it. The Minister indicated that at the end of the day we would no longer be dependent on the traditional way of local authorities providing houses. There is a great need for housing, especially social housing, in which I am sure the local authority or a local co-operative housing agency will be involved with assistance from the Department.</P>
    <P>I hope that the people who will qualify for assistance will receive care and attention from the agencies which deal with social problems in the community. I am taking about the responsibility of the health boards because there are vulnerable people in our housing estates. They are vulnerable to attack from vandals and to gangs of youths interfering with their privacy and damaging their property. They are vulnerable at all times because of health disadvantages. It is those people who should receive aid under social housing programmes, and the houses they occupy in ordinary housing estates should be re-allocated to families who would be able to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>In the past, because of a lack of experience, we housed old people, retired people, widowers and widows and even single parents, in small houses within a <Col N="1170" /> normal housing estate. At the time we all believed that it was right to mix small houses and big houses, that it was a good thing for older people and retired people to live in an area where there was activity &mdash; an area in which they would always have company and there would always be someone to look after them. We envisaged the operation of a community alert scheme under which residents in family homes would always ensure that the older people, the widowers and the widows in smaller houses would have the company of others and would be in contact with activity. What none of us realised at the time was that in housing estates where there are hundreds of children those children have no regard, and could not be expected to have regard, for old age pensioners, who would like a little privacy and a little peace and quite rather than having 25 or 50 children playing football outside their door and in their gardens.</P>
    <P>Some of my own constituents from the town of Cahir have prepared and submitted a document to all public representatives, itemising the difficulties faced by old people living in a highly active area that has many children. That document should be studied and the difficulties examined. We do have a responsibility not to put people into an area where they will be unhappy and which could easily become a kind of ghetto for them; so that they almost look forward to the day that they will be removed from their own home and admitted to a geriatric hospital or a welfare home just so that they can get a little peace and quiet. It is a shame that in practice our policy of mixed housing has worked out that way. We provided for open plan housing, with no boundary walls and no facilities for privacy, but we did not realise that residents would face trespass. Of course, children do not think that they are trespassing. For them it is par for the course to play outside when they come home from school. During the school holidays some old people are unable to cope with all of the activity happening around them.</P>
    <P>The continued availability of some grants, particularly the disabled person's <Col N="1171" /> grant, is welcome. I am disappointed that a warning has been issued to local authorities of a limitation in any year on the payment of such assistance for disabled persons. Tragedy can happen in any home and at any time because of an accident or a stroke, for example. At times major changes have to be made to houses to make it possible for disabled people to remain in their own home. There should be no restriction on the amount of money available in any year when such a sensitive issue as the housing of disabled people is involved. The number concerned is not great but we do need to be able to accommodate all applicants for disabled persons' assistance who come before local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bill does not really address the housing crisis that is faced by every one of us. The Minister has heard of the crisis in his own constituency and in his own corporation area and I have heard about it through the councils in my own area. As I said last night, various agencies calling themselves &ldquo;housing action groups&rdquo; are now coming together to advocate direct action with councillors. They blame the Government and they blame the Minister. The only answer to the crisis is finance. We need money to be able to meet the demand upon us. If we do not make some effort to meet the demand then other groups will exploit the homeless &mdash; and it is being done now &mdash; and use them in their agitation and campaigns at election time. Representatives from those groups will go forward as candidates for election on the basis that they represent the homeless. There are now so many homeless in all of our constituencies that the numbers are becoming quotas. Last night Deputy Durkan said that they are probably not a very strong lobby, but they are being made into a very strong lobby. All of us in public life have a responsibility to bring that to the attention of the Minister. If we do not bring the problem to his attention then we will fail and the groups I have talked about will be able to convince the homeless that the Minister has not responded and that we have all forgotten <Col N="1172" /> them because of cost and an inability to do anything.</P>
    <P>Under the 1988 legislation for the housing of the homeless the Minister made unlimited capital available to local authorities for the provision of halting sites for itinerants and to buy houses on the open marketplace in order to house itinerants. I welcome that initiative. However, we cannot purchase houses under that scheme to house people who are not itinerants but who are as badly in need of accommodation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision to exclude a two-mile zone in and around halting sites from unauthorised camping by itinerants so that those people will be brought into the area of the camping site. My local authority and the Clonmel Corporation have incurred considerable expenditure in providing properly serviced halting sites for itinerants. That has also been done in Cashel and in Tipperary. We ourselves operated an area that was zoned by the courts to preclude people from unauthorised camping in or near halting sites. In the court, however, the judge refused to make a judgment, even though we had declared an area as zoned. We tried to convince the public that if we as a local authority provided proper services for them it would solve all our problems and no other unauthorised parking could take place within a certain restricted area, but our efforts were not successful.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Roads Bill, also coming before the House, and this Bill will strengthen the legislation and make it obligatory for district judges to operate the spirit of the law to make sure that unauthorised camping and caravan parking by itinerants does not take place in and around halting sites or on our national primary roads, where they seem to want to park, with tremendous disregard for the rights of property owners. It is known that if comment is made about such parking or about other extraordinary activities in or near gateways a hive of itinerants arrive and everything, from beds to washing machines, is dumped over a fence. Just because somebody had the cheek to say &ldquo;You are on <Col N="1173" /> my private property&rdquo; or &ldquo;You are causing an obstruction on the public road&rdquo; they feel a need to get their own back. This issue has to be firmed up for people who are not the true itinerants but merchants of the road. I have called on farmers and on others to stop doing business with those people, whether that business be road dressing, gravelling paths, the purchase of gates or whatever. If people did not do business with itinerants they would not park in an area.</P>
    <P>We must give ourselves the powers to deal with this festering problem. By doing that we will assist local authority members to meet the challenge of providing halting sites. Halting sites have been successful where they operate. There is a strict regime relating to the type of people who will be allowed into the halting sites in order to prevent difficulties arising in them. The Minister is aware that this is a major problem. It is mentioned in the Bill so I would ask him to ensure that legislation is strengthened in this area. This policy should be carried through in the Roads Bill. Between both Bills we should have an opportunity through court procedures to exert our rights and the rights of the settled community. Nobody wants to be unduly critical or unchristian in their attitude to genuinely homeless people but none of these people want housing. They want to be able to stop, sell their wares, beg in an area for weeks on end and then move to another place. We find that they have many fine mansions elsewhere to which they return for holidays. That is a new phenomenon that has struck rural Ireland. The local authorities have not been able to address it because the law is deficient in that area.</P>
    <P>I commend the good parts of the Bill to the House but the Bill will not address the housing crisis. If the Minister pleads inability because of lack of funds, at least the people will know that but the Minister should not produce an alternative system which he knows will not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate. The Bill aims to significantly <Col N="1174" /> expand housing legislation. I agree with much of what Deputy Ferris said in his excellent speech but what he said with regard to the provision of finance and loans is something that can be said from the Opposition benches whereas we on this side of the House must live in the real world. Fianna Fáil have an excellent record in house building. I may not agree with some of the types of houses or flats that were built in my area. I have serious reservations, for instance, about the building of all those flats in Ballymun. I was not a Member of the House at the time but it was ludicrous to build in the region of 3,000 flats without providing any sporting or shopping facilities and so on. Many of the tenants who moved into Ballymun at the beginning could only shop from a mobile van and they were exploited because the cost of buying provisions in this way was far in excess of the cost of shopping in shops or supermarkets. Anybody could question the wisdom of building large housing estates without providing facilities.</P>
      <P>It is the long established policy of this party to ensure that every family has a dwelling suitable to their needs. This cannot happen overnight. It is important to encourage owner occupation by developing measures to address our changing housing needs. There is an urgent need to get value for taxpayers' money. The Minister indicated in his speech that the Government's housing plan is to supplement the traditional local authority house building programme. It is not the Government's intention to return to the old system of building large housing estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that there are social reasons for limiting segregation and for developing a better social mix in our communities. I agree, but it does not work in every case. Many people have had bad experiences when a local authority housing estate was built alongside a private housing estate. The people in the private housing estate had no objection to the development but in later years they were subjected to continual harassment and intimidation from people in the local authority housing estate. I have no doubt <Col N="1175" /> that every Member of the House who represents the Dublin area particularly, have continuing requests from residents associations to build walls between housing estates to try to reduce the intimidation and vandalism to which people have been subjected. Many people in private housing estates have had no option but to sell and move out to other areas. Many people agree with uniting people, but the experience is that it does not always work.</P>
    <P>There are continual requests from representatives on the backbenches, from the Opposition benches and from local authorities for more local authority housing. The high cost cannot be overlooked. There is a cost in building the house and a significant cost in maintaining a local authority house. Due to financial constraints on local authorities there has been a big cutback in maintenance. The money spent on some local authority housing schemes far exceeds the amount of money collected in rents. At the last meeting of the city council the Dublin City Manager in reply to a question said that the high cost of housing maintenance in the Dublin area is mainly due to the fact that the majority of maintenance work is done through the direct labour scheme. In other countries and in parts of Ireland maintenance work is done on contract which gives far more value for money. The Minister should encourage local authorities to do maintenance work on contract. The people employed to do local authority maintenance work would take home a hugely increased pay packet if they were prepared to work on contract. There is a great difficulty with this because the trade unions will not agree to it. When I go into housing estates in my own area the greatest complaint from tenants is about lack of maintenance. Many tenants would agree that a contract system would be far better, that more work would be done and that there would be better value for money. Not having such a system presents a great difficulty because it appears that trade unions will not agree to such proposition. I contend that the trade unions are not doing those <Col N="1176" /> people any favour because, if they were prepared to undertake that work, they would be taking home a greater amount of money each week.</P>
    <P>There is widespread concern at present at the high rate of vandalism in local authority housing estates. In my constituency, especially in Ballymun, there is widespread concern at the high rate of vandalism of the lifts in the Ballymun Flats complex. This continues causing great hardship to the inhabitants especially in the case of women with children. At a special meeting of the Ballymun residents' committee some months ago I recall a senior official of Dublin Corporation, when asked questions about a lift there that had been out of order for a couple of months, replying that it had been vandalised to the extent that major repair works costing approximately £38,000 were warranted. He made the case also that if that amount of money were to be expended in Ballymun on other projects it would considerably improve the area overall. It is that type of difficulty one encounters.</P>
    <P>The former Minister, Deputy Flynn, introduced the 1986 tenant house purchase scheme which was an outstanding success and on which I compliment him, attracting almost 40,000 local authority tenants to avail of the opportunity of purchasing their homes. The former Minister also provided funds for the refurbishment of local authority flats by way of an allocation of £5.8 million towards phase 1 of the refurbishment scheme for the flats in the Ballymun area, work on which scheme is now at an advanced stage. Indeed when this refurbishment work will have been completed by the end of this year it will mean that the tenants of the flats in Joseph Plunkett Tower and Balbutcher Lane will be housed in the most modern type of flat to be found nationwide. I am also aware that plans have been prepared for phase 2 of that refurbishment scheme of the flats in Ballymun and I call on the Minister to provide the necessary funds for its implementation as soon as possible. I know the relevant plans are with the Minister's Department at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> For the first time in housing legislation the Housing Act 1988 made statutory provision to address the housing needs of homeless people, affording local authorities extensive powers to deal with homelessness, revising the law in relation to planning provision and the allocation of local authority housing thereby ensuring that the needs of the homeless, travellers and disadvantaged groups were taken into account.</P>

      <P>There are a number of areas in which the provisions of this Bill break new ground and merit attention. For instance, there are the questions of shared ownership, the proposal that local authorities improve private housing as an alternative to their rehousing approved housing applicants, new arrangements for the subsidisation of voluntary housing and comprehensive, flexible lending powers being given housing authorities. In addition its provisions allow the participation of local authority tenants in the management of their estates along with streamlined provisions for the sale of local authority houses and flats.</P>
      <P>The shared ownership provision will improve lone owner occupied housing in the case of people in receipt of low incomes who cannot afford to purchase a house, which system involves the granting by local authorities of a special type lease called a shared ownership lease. In addition the Bill puts on a proper statutory footing the interim arrangements under which the shared ownership system have been operated by local authorities since last year. I am aware that many people have opted to participate in the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the building of large local authority housing estates. No longer is this a reality. In the greater Dublin area <Col N="1178" /> there is no land available or requisite funds forthcoming for this purpose. These are the two major problems with which local authorities in the Dublin area have to deal. The last time Dublin Corporation built large housing estates they had to concentrate on areas such as Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown as no land was available in the inner city. As a member of Dublin City Council, I am aware of the difficulties experienced by Dublin Corporation at that time in getting families on the housing waiting list to accept accommodation in these areas. Even some single parents and deserted wives who urgently required accommodation were not prepared to accept housing in Tallaght, Clondalkin or Blanchardstown. It is only in recent years that people accepted accommodation in these areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fergus O'Brien referred to the £5,000 grant scheme introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government which enabled local authority tenants to vacate their flats or houses and purchase their own homes. That scheme proved to be disastrous in my area and in many other areas in the Dublin region. For example, it led to 500 or 600 flats in the Ballymun area being left vacant. I heard a senior official in Dublin Corporation say at that time that the £5,000 grant scheme was responsible for the large number of vacant flats in Ballymun. Dublin Corporation had to spend substantial amounts of money in refurbishing flats which had been vandalised. There were similar experiences in other Dublin Corporation areas.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to the housing accommodation problem as the numbers on the waiting lists continue to grow. For example, if families who are given local authority housing break up after a few years, the local authority have to provide a second house for a member of that family. In some cases both the sons or daughters of those families have to be housed by the same local authority. This is the reality with which public representatives and local authorities have to deal. Many young people, some of whom are only 16 years of age, have applied to <Col N="1179" /> Dublin Corporation for housing. However, under the regulations people of this age cannot be considered for accommodation. I have no doubt that the break-up of families is one of the contributory factors to the long waiting lists for housing. I accept that the waiting lists do not reflect the true number of people seeking accommodation. Many of the people on these lists live in local authority accommodation but they move from one area to another. Deputy O'Brien, a former member of Dublin City Council, referred to this point in his contribution. There may be valid reasons for some local authority tenants moving to a different area. In many cases people accept accommodation in another area out of desperation. For example, I know people who moved from Ballymun to Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown and who suffered loneliness because they were so far away from their families. Because they are on low incomes they cannot travel to visit their families and friends. Other families who settled into these areas had their lives made a hell by unsociable families who moved in beside them. Local authorities have not been able to deal with what I would describe as unsociable tenants. The efforts being made to deal with this problem are merely piecemeal. It needs to be dealt with urgently and in a more effective manner.</P>
    <P>The overall purpose of the Bill is to establish a housing policy which will ensure that all people live in dwellings which are suitable to their needs. I am concerned at the number of local authority tenants living in accommodation which has no toilet or bathroom. Previous speakers also referred to this point. In some cases tenants have to share an outside bathroom. I know Dublin Corporation have carried out many refurbishment schemes and that there are plans to carry out many more. I should have liked this Bill to contain a provision which would encourage local authority tenants to look after their houses. I accept that some tenants do take care of their houses but many of them do not. <Col N="1180" /> Consequently, it is a costly exercise for the local authority to refurbish such houses when those tenants leave.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many local authorities put much work into beautifying estates, for example, planting trees and shrubs. It is sad to see trees and shrubs which have been vandalised. The Minister in his speech indicated that local authority tenants will be given an opportunity to manage their own estates. We should all encourage local authority tenants to do this because when they take an interest in their estates there is a decrease in vandalism and the estates are better maintained.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have an excellent record in building good quality housing. The inner city housing schemes have been a great success. It is regrettable that more of these housing schemes cannot be built. Dublin Corporation also have a good record in providing accommodation for senior citizens. The houses and flats built for senior citizens in the Dublin area were well designed and are located close to shops and churches. Deputy Ferris expressed concern about the fact that some accommodation for senior citizens was located in isolated areas. This is not the case in Dublin. Dublin Corporation have built such accommodation close to shops, schools and other houses. Committees have been formed in many areas and meals are provided two or three days a week in the common rooms attached to senior citizens' accommodation. I have one reservation in regard to this type of accommodation, that is, that many of the dwellings are open plan. As a result many senior citizens have had their houses and flats vandalised and have experienced a certain amount of intimidation. I have no doubt that a great deal more accommodation for senior citizens needs to be built.</P>
    <P>The 1986 house purchase scheme was a great success in so far as it enabled 40,000 local authority tenants to purchase their own homes. Many tenants did not avail of that scheme for one reason or another. I ask the Minister to introduce another house purchase scheme as soon as possible. I am aware that due to <Col N="1181" /> financial constraints any new scheme would not be as generous as the 1986 scheme. Nevertheless there is an urgent need to introduce a new house purchase scheme in the very near future. In view of the number of flat refurbishment schemes being carried out in the Dublin area, I imagine that many local authority tenants would be anxious to purchase their flats.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill which I hope will be given a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted with interest the comments of the previous speaker, Deputy Michael Barrett, that his party have an excllent record of house building. One has only to quote the figures of the last ten years for houses completed, both in the private and public sectors, the number of people on housing lists and those classified as homeless to see how good or bad that record is. I submit it is a very poor record indeed. The Minister, Deputy Smith, in his speech, which I read again last night, said that the Government's housing plan restates the long established objective of Government housing policy of ensuring that every household has a dwelling suitable to its needs, located in an acceptable environment and at a price or rent that the household can afford. The proposals as set out in the plan, and in the Bill, will fail to reach that objective.</P>

    <P>I find it difficult to understand statements from Ministers that we do not have a housing crisis. Ministers who make such comments are totally remote and insulated from the realities of life. One thousand young people will sleep on the streets of the towns and cities of this country tonight. If that is not a crisis, what is? For example, a survey carried out by Cork Action for Young People between August 1989 and July 1991 found that 104 young people spent at least one night sleeping rough in Cork city. Edel House run by the Good Shepherd nuns in Cork, a refuge for women and young children, now acts as a long term housing unit because the <Col N="1182" /> people who go there cannot get housing and stay indefinitely. There is no provision for beds for young girls who are taken there. Yet the Government say there is no crisis.</P>
    <P>I gave much thought to this whole issue in preparing my contribution. According to recent opinion polls the Government are enjoying unprecedented popularity. I cannot understand how that can be so when there are major problems in our health services &mdash; I do not have to specify details of those problems today, but people have to wait two years for a preliminary examination or assessment. There is a crisis in housing and there are problems in education, especially at primary level, with young people being accommodated in substandard prefabs. With those major problems, I do not know how the Government can enjoy such support.</P>
    <P>My views were summed up by John Waters in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday when he referred to <i>The Culture of Contentment</i> by the US economist, John Kenneth Galbraith. He made the point that the Government target a major percentage of people who are relatively happy in their style of life, and feed their needs day in and day out while ignoring the social problems. A Government, and a party, who do that do so at their peril. What the US Republican Party in the United States by their policies have done, what the Tories have done in Britain and what we are doing here is storing up huge social problems that will explode in our cities and towns. We have only to look at the crime figures of recent time and the urban unrest in our cities and towns to see that that is so. Any Government who adopt a policy and a philosophy of the culture of contentment are storing up trouble in the long term.</P>
    <P>John Waters said: &ldquo;The morning, after finishing <i>The Culture of Contentment</i>, I awoke to the news of the Los Angeles riots&rdquo;. One can translate that into an Irish context. One can see the first signs of people on the margins, the victims of economic policies of recent years, kicking back, although maybe not in a political way. I know from reading the electoral <Col N="1183" /> returns for constituencies throughout the country that, unfortunately, many of the people who are victims of economic policy become so disillusioned that they do not vote. That is a kick back at Government and it adds strength and muscle to the people who are relatively well off, happy and contented. This is a short term exercise and is something that parties of all persuasions will ignore at their peril. There are other factors involved in relation to opinion polls and the strength of parties, but I will not go into that today. However, this underlying principle is one of the major reasons that people are disillusioned.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is more shadow than substance. The reality is that there is a housing crisis unprecedented since the sixties. There are 30,000 applicants on our housing lists &mdash; we are talking about households as opposed to people. In some cases two, three or four people in a family are awaiting housing. Many thousands are living in inadequate housing without bathrooms. The reply to a question I put to the Minister on 25 March of this year makes alarming reading. It shows that in the five boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford the number of dwellings without bathrooms as at 31 December 1990 was: in Cork, 508; in Dublin, 2,172; in Galway there are no dwellings without bathrooms &mdash; they are better off than the rest of the country; in Limerick, 293 and in Waterford, 324. I thought there would be a headlong rush by Government to provide the most basic of facilities for people.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the Cork local authority had to cease their programme of installing bathrooms, having installed a small number because no capital allocation was made for that purpose. I am sure the position is the same in Dublin &mdash; I have written to the local authority there but have not received a reply. In a recent letter to me the Assistant City Manager in Cork stated that the programme of installation of bathrooms had to cease because of a lack of commitment of Government funding. That shows the <Col N="1184" /> overall commitment of Government to the plight of people living in substandard conditions in this day and age.</P>
    <P>The onward drive to improve houses in our housing stock has slowed down. The Government have neglected their housing programme and ignored the 30,000 people living in substandard accommodation in our towns and cities. The figures speak for themselves &mdash; they are official figures from the Department &mdash; in 1980 the Department built 5,984 houses; in 1981, 5,681; in 1982 they built approximately 5,500; in 1983, 6,000; in 1984, 7,000; in 1985, 6,500 and in 1987, 3,074. The figures plummeted to 1,450 in 1988 and 768 in 1989. In 1990 there was a marginal increase to 1,003.</P>
    <P>The Department classifies categories of those in need of accommodation. The figures are as follows: homeless, 1,500; travellers, 748; those living in unfit or materially unsuitable accommodation, 4,590; those living in overcrowded accommodation, 5,896; those involuntarily sharing accommodation, 2,432; young persons leaving institutional care or without family connections, 104; those in need of accommodation on medical or compassionate grounds, 1,331; the elderly, 2,379; disabled or handicapped people, 180; those unable to afford existing accommodation, 4,075. Even those figures seriously under-estimate the reality but they speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>There are 30,000 households awaiting housing and there are 800 young homeless people, the major black spots being counties Cork and Limerick and the Dublin area. It is a scandal to see around our cities so much housing stock which is vacant and unavailable for tenancy because the local authority cannot keep pace and are unable to repair houses which have been vandalised or left in a bad condition when people surrendered tenancy. If we were to quantify unavailable housing stock nationwide the figure would be frightening. I have calculated that in Cork alone £5 million worth of housing stock is closed. This problem will have to be addressed. The reality is that the housing maintenance programme has slowed considerably, despite statements <Col N="1185" /> to the opposite effect at high-powered Government press conferences. A myth is being disseminated at these press conferences. In 1991 the programme for housing was announced at such a press conference and a glossy publication was produced. Since then it has become obvious that there is no urgency in tackling the problem. We still do not have in place legislation to deal with some of the provisions announced. These provisions are in any event dependent on finance. This Government have invested less money in housing in recent years than any previous Government. The figures in the public capital programme this year show that the provisions of this Bill cannot be implemented. In the past four years an average of over 1,000 local authority houses were completed. This is no answer to the housing crisis. The Government are abandoning people to hovels and substandard accommodation.</P>
    <P>The result of Government inactivity is that more people are becoming dependent on the health boards to subsidise substandard accommodation. The Southern Health Board recently paid out almost £500,000 in rent subsidies to people on housing waiting lists. People are also at the mercy of landlords who are exploiting the position and threatening unfortunate young couples with eviction if they have children. If tenants attempt to get a rent subsidy from the health board they will also be evicted because landlords do not want the tenancy to be made public if they do not disclose the income to the Revenue Commissioners. The reality is very remote from some of the comments made by Government spokesmen. Another reason for threatening people with eviction is that landlords do not want the local authority to examine a property because it would probably be deemed substandard and closed down.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the provisions of the Bill meet this crisis. Deputy Durkan said yesterday that the bottom line is money. We cannot achieve the required targets unless the necessary capital is provided. There is a black market in the accommodation area in major cities and towns. <Col N="1186" /> The contents of this legislation will not bring about any improvement. The Bill is more shadow than substance. This is confirmed by the fact that 10,000 fewer private houses were completed in the five years to December 1991 than in the previous five years. Official Department figures confirm this. The number of private houses completed in 1981 was 23,236. The figure went as low as 14,000 in 1988 and is now at about 18,000. That is adding to the problem.</P>
    <P>People who want to buy their own houses in the private sector are faced with false barriers often put up to exploit them. Any Government who are serious about making purchases in the private sector more attractive must eliminate some of the pitfalls and reduce the barriers. I recently bought a house and found the whole business quite confusing. I thought I knew the ins and outs of house purchase but I found the range of loans available confusing because the hidden costs were not spelled out. The lending agency rarely spell out what they charge for the legal costs involved in the transaction. Only last evening I heard a very sad case of the exploitation of returning emigrants. A couple in London who wish to return to Ireland decided to buy the family home when the parents decided to live elsewhere. They tried to borrow from the financial institutions but were refused a loan because they were non-resident. However, eventually they got a loan at 2 per cent above the going rate from one of the major banks. I think that is one of the cruelest things I have heard for some time &mdash; young emigrants being exploited by one of our major financial institutions. I can stand over this case and I intend to take the matter up with the Minister for Finance, because it is unpardonable that this could happen in this day and age.</P>
    <P>The cumbersome procedures and the hidden costs are a barrier to young people who wish to purchase a house in the private sector. I ask that this be examined and a determined effort made to eliminate these barriers. We have heard a great deal about restrictive practices. The commission have issued a report on <Col N="1187" /> restrictive practices in conveyancing, but very little action has been taken as a result of this report. I submit that more action and fewer words would be welcome from a Government who propose to have a social housing policy. The success of the policy for social housing is tied to getting those who can afford it to buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>We have a housing crisis. One of the first measures taken by this Government in office was to abolish the house improvement grant scheme, a scheme which helped people to improve substandard housing conditions. In addition, any hope that tenants had of having their living conditions improved have been smashed by the Government's lack of determination in making funds available to local authorities to improve the condition of the housing stock. The Minister may put forward the counter argument that they ploughed money into a refurbishment programme of the housing stock in our major cities. However, these funds are being used to refurbish houses where major errors were made. Deputy Barrett spoke about Ballymun. Serious errors were made in the sixties in the development of National Building Agency houses. This happened in Cork, too. These estates are now being refurbished but that is long over-due. However I give due credit to the Government for attempting to finance the refurbishment of these houses. Refurbishment is totally different from the ongoing maintenance of the existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>The routine maintenance of our housing stock has almost ceased. Deputy Durkan dealt with this point so I will not labour it but there is no great incentive for corporation or local authority tenants to maintain their houses. A classic example is where a carpenter in my constituency came to me to have a minor job on his door carried out by the corporation. This shows the lack of incentive for a tenant to maintain and carry out repairs in his own home. Increasingly, less money is being allocated in real terms for day-to-day maintenance. In fact in <Col N="1188" /> many areas local authorities have been forced to abandon routine maintenance. This is a short-sighted step and will add to future problems.</P>
    <P>People are now roaming the streets of our cities at weekends looking for even the smallest room in which to stay in order to provide shelter for their young children. The health boards are coming under more and more pressure to provide funding for them under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The pressure that young couples find themselves in puts an even greater strain on their relationship. The housing crisis is a major boost to private sector landlords. Rents in the private sector have gone through the roof and landlords who exploit the situation can make huge profits. We cannot, however, get away from human nature.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister attempted to put a gloss on the crisis by saying that large scale local authority estates will never again be built. I agree wholeheartedly with this policy. Huge local authority estates must be a thing of the past but that does not mean we should not build the number of houses required to meet the needs of those on the housing waiting lists. It should be Government policy to buy houses from private builders in all areas of the country. This would not only meet the needs of those on the housing list but would also be a major social advance in that at long last there would not be a division between local authority and private housing estates, a case of the pennies looking down on the half pennies, which has existed for so long. If the Government were to purchase houses in the private sector, this would bring about a very positive social mix in housing estates. It is now realised that the housing policy over the decades &mdash; all Governments were involved &mdash; has resulted in a two-tier system. We must encourage people to purchase their own homes but there is a high percentage of people who, even with every possible support, could not plan or organise that. We cannot abandon such people. The work of the voluntary housing groups is laudible, but this must not <Col N="1189" /> be the be all and end all of our housing policy. The number of houses erected with the support of voluntary housing groups does not meet the national requirements, in fact, the figures fall quite short of the Government's target for this sector.</P>
    <P>About 70 per cent of the people on the local authority housing waiting list are in receipt of social welfare. Under the present social welfare code, those in receipt of social welfare or the long term unemployed have no possibility of building their own homes no matter what type of support they are given by the voluntary groups or the Department. It is an inescapable fact that houses must be built for them and the local authorities and the State must continue to be involved in housing construction programmes. We cannot act like Pontius Pilate and wash our hands of the problem by farming out the task to the voluntary groups. This point was made by Deputy Mitchell and a number of other speakers over the past number of days so I will not bore the House by repeating the arguments.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government philosophy is to abandoned people on the housing waiting list and allow them to continue to live in the slums and hovels in our cities and towns. I had hoped that this legislation would give hope and encouragement to people throughout the country but in fact the publication of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992, has deepened their despair and condemned them to living in substandard and outdated accommodation for years and years.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I would deal in more detail with the statistics on homelessness published by the Department. The figures for March 1991 show that 1,507 people were deemed homeless. The issue of homelessness in urban areas is a vast topic with many angles. For an approach to be of any substance the topic must be narrowed. I propose to look at homelessness from the point of view of the policies that surround the issue. First, homelessness should be more clearly defined. Second, the Housing Act, 1988, must be examined in relation to how it works for the homeless. We must then consider <Col N="1190" /> funding for the necessary projects to address the problem.</P>
    <P>Attention must be given to the high risk groups who are sleeping on the streets of our cities and towns. The number of homeless people in Ireland today is closer to 5,000 rather than the official figures. This number includes people living rough, in shelters, hostels, residential homes, Garda stations and convents. Such a number is only an estimate of the true number of homeless. I believe the figure of 5,000 does not include those on waiting lists or those in psychiatric units who have nowhere to go on their discharge. I refer those interested to the 1991 annual report of the National Campaign for the Homeless which deals with the reality rather than the myth that is being put forward.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; covers a variety of people: the most obvious are those who are living rough or in shelters; and the problem does not stop there. Women and children face homelessness when they are forced to double share an apartment with friends to escape domestic violence or other bad conditions. Prisoners, psychiatric patients and children living in State care face the prospect of homelessness when they are released. I refer those interested to the Simon Community report 1992 on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and homelessness &mdash; promises versus performance.</P>
    <P>One can become homeless due to a variety of circumstances. Poverty, lack of education, low pay, unemployment and institutional care can all contribute to a person's homelessness. However this is not a permanent condition and even the long term homeless can successfully find housing with the necessary support services. In this context I refer people to the Simon Community report, page four. I wish to deal with this matter in detail and to put it on the record, because we have heard so much about homelessness and the steps being taken to deal with it. Many myths and inaccuracies are being put forward.</P>
    <P>A great deal of concern around the issue of homelessness today is focused on <Col N="1191" /> the Housing Act, 1988. This Act was the first updating of the housing code since 1966. All access to housing for the homeless is governed by the 1988 Act. A number of sections of that Act stand out as more crucial than others, for example, section 5 sets up the rules under which the local authorities can provide financial assistance to voluntary organisations who house homeless people. Section 9 calls for an obligatory assessment of housing needs every three years. Section 10 states the local authorities' responsibilities to the homeless population. Again I refer those interested to Brian Harvey's National Campaign for the Homeless report 1990, page 56. Section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, evoked a great deal of criticism from the voluntary organisations concerned with homelessness. These organisations felt that a duty should have been placed on local authorities to accommodate the homeless. The Act refers to &ldquo;enabling powers&rdquo; and does not specify &ldquo;duty&rdquo;. Many voluntary groups feel this could give local authorities a loophole to escape their responsibilities to those without homes.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> also commented on the Housing Act, 1988, and how it was being implemented. The programme made two commitments in regard to the Act: first, that an assessment of the number of homeless would be undertaken in 1991 with the help of voluntary agencies and, second, the Department of the Environment would ensure that local authorities would fully implement section 10 of the Housing Act.</P>
    <P>Before the policies that have been developed to fight homelessness are examined the severity of the problem Ireland faces must be discussed. This is a more difficult issue than would at first appear. In my opinion no thorough studies are available. This group is so flexible and fluid that attaching a number is almost impossible. The figures that are used will allow one to grasp the general size of the problem. I suggest the homeless figure is about 5,000 people. This represents about .14 per cent of the <Col N="1192" /> national population as homeless. This number does not take into account inward and outward flows of people in shelters and those about to be released from hospital with nowhere to go. These are summed up in New Perspectives on Homelessness &mdash; National Campaign for the Homeless, Combat Poverty Agency report, 1988.</P>
    <P>The housing lists are another indicator of the severity of the homelessness crisis. In Dublin there are at least 4,000 people on the housing waiting list and the list continues to grow with under 100 houses being built per year. The last assessment of local authority housing needs, before the 1991 survey, was in 1989. This study identified 19,376 households as being in need of public housing. That figure increased to about 23,000 last year and I submit that now it is of the order of 29,000 or 30,000. Of this number 987 were defined as homeless and from that group 226 were families of two or more. Nationally the waiting list for local authority housing is just under 30,000.</P>
    <P>An assessment of the scale of homelessness was undertaken in March 1991. That assessment was problematic from the start. Up to January 1992 the results had not been published. The Simon Community informed me that the local authorities figure for the homeless was a gross underestimation. I should like to deal with the figures supplied by the Department and those put forward by voluntary groups. The Department's figures show that Dublin Corporation reported 1,351 homeless persons, 466 of whom are living in shelters. However, Dublin Simon Community alone claimed to accommodate 714 from May 1990 to June 1991. The findings from Cork were similar. The figures published by the Department show that Cork Corporation had 303 people classified as homeless, of whom 214 are living in shelters. The Simon Community in Cork claimed to accommodate 335 homeless in 1990. Finally, in Galway, the corporation stated that 97 people were homeless, 66 of whom are living in shelters. In 1990 the Fairgreen Shelter alone accommodated 387 people &mdash; this is contained in the Simon Community <Col N="1193" /> report. Obviously the numbers given by the city corporations do not match those given by the Simon Community. Whether because of lack of accurate data, lack of communication with voluntary agencies, or a number of other reasons, the assessment of the true scale of homelessness was not possible. A reliable assessment of the real number of homeless in Ireland is a necessity. To implement programmes to fight the problem one must know what programmes are being dealt with. The programmes that would cure a relatively small number of cases would not be effective in dealing with the problems our major urban areas face. Without a reliable assessment effective schemes cannot be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government and voluntary organisations are working on several projects at present to combat homelessness. Some are in place while others are at discussion stage. Those schemes cannot be evaluated fully in the time available. I will discuss three projected plans.</P>
    <P>The first involves monetary policy while the second relates to improving the self esteem and self worth of applicants and the third involves the role of the Department of Social Welfare in alleviating homelessness. Two other issues must be looked at &mdash; the level of co-operation between local authorities and voluntary organisations, and after hours emergency programmes. I have tabled numerous Dáil Questions on those issues in recent times and the replies I received left me as much in the dark as I ever was.</P>
    <P>The first policy discussed concerned the financing of projects aimed at alleviating the housing problem. Voluntary organisations like the Simon Community felt that a redistribution of public resources was needed in the housing system. A reorganisation is needed but a redistribution of funding is a long way away.</P>
    <P>The second policy aims at the improvement of self esteem and self worth of the homeless. Again, the Simon Community feel that as part of a national plan an upgrading programme should be undertaken on sheltered accommodation. A number of facilities and shelters have <Col N="1194" /> been documented by the National Campaign for the Homeless as being inadequate and unacceptable. That organisation made the point that the homeless have a right to accommodation that is not degrading. In association with the upgrading a plan of work projects is recommended and long overdue. Government financed work projects would give the homeless a source of income, thus making the securing of a home easier, not to mention bringing the homeless back into society as working members.</P>
    <P>Social welfare has a role to play in alleviating homelessness. The Simon Community submitted that each year a social welfare floor below which no payments could fall should be adopted. This minimum could raise the income of some people enough to enable them to find housing. It would also slow the growing numbers of homeless in Ireland. Social welfare reform would be worthwhile because it would tie in with the whole housing programme. Improvements in that area would bring about knock-on improvements in people's ability and will to house themselves.</P>
    <P>The first of two projects concerns co-operation between local authorities and voluntary organisations. Under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, immediate assistance should be made available to the homeless who go to local authority offices. Section 10 opens three opportunities for the housing authority to intercede on behalf of the homeless. First, they can give funding to a voluntary body to provide shelter for the homeless. Second, they may rent accommodation or arrange other housing for the client and, third, they can give financial assistance to the homeless person.</P>
    <P>In October 1991 I asked the Minister if he would outline how much of the £600,000 which had been allocated under section 10 of the Housing Act to be paid to voluntary organisations had been paid and if he would confirm that there had not been a repeat of what had happened during the previous two years when the bulk of the allocation had been returned to the Exchequer. That money was returned <Col N="1195" /> because the local authorities, for one reason or another, did not spend the money. I had two other questions down on that day and the Minister's reply to those questions gave no great hope to me that there would be any major improvement.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act hoped to create a closer working relationship between the local authorities and working agencies. The Local Government Act, 1991, allows for non-elected persons to become members of local authority committees. This would facilitate a partnership between elected bodies and volunteer groups. To my knowledge the only place where there is any semblance of representation from voluntary groups is on the so-called itinerant committees which deal with the problems of the travelling people.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act also aimed to create a constant rapport between authorities and volunteers by establishing liaison and consultation between the groups. Up to 1990 most authorities had not put consultation mechanisms in place. In May 1991 the Department of the Environment issued new guidelines stressing the important role of voluntary agencies in alleviating homelessness. The links between local authorities, health boards and volunteer groups are reported by the Simon Community to be working well. Dublin Corporation appear to be the only authority resisting the networking.</P>
    <P>With these new arrangements the voluntary sector is calling on the Department to monitor the consultation agreements that are put in place. It is felt that at least a three year monitoring period is necessary for the partnership to work correctly. The White Paper on partnership that involves the voluntary agencies and the State must allow for wider consultation.</P>
    <P>A major initiative that is being put in place involves the extension of services for the homeless after business hours. In may 1991 the Department drew up guidelines under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, which require housing authorities to establish mechanisms for an <Col N="1196" /> emergency response to situations arising after business hours. Can the Minister tell me how many authorities have this mechanism in place? It was left to each local authority to decide whether to run the service or set up a programme with one of the voluntary agencies. The Simon Community in Cork have a working relationship with Cork Corporation but I would like to know to what extent working relationships have been built up since the issuing of the Department's directive in May 1991. It is my view that there are very few after hours programmes operated directly by local authorities and they are mostly operated by the voluntary organisations without the necessary resources. It is, in other words, a service on the cheap. They are the issues we should be addressing if we are serious about tackling homelessness.</P>
    <P>I submit, despite what some people may think, that it would not cost a huge amount of money to implement these programmes. There is a massive reservoir of goodwill among voluntary groups which should be tapped. I am astounded by their level of enthusiasm and commitment. If the statutory bodies had the same commitment we would be in a far better position. We are fast approaching the position where, if we do not harness the enthusiasm, commitment, skill and knowledge of these groups, they will become disillusioned. The Department should move far more quickly in this area.</P>
    <P>The national budget for helping the homeless in Ireland is £750,000. This figure is put in perspective when one realises that the four Simon Communities alone spent over £800,000 last year, most of it providing &ldquo;immediate accommodation services&rdquo;&mdash; the words used on page 23 of their report.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment provide £600,000 towards the cost of immediate accommodation services as stated in section 10 of the Housing Act. As I said, only a small portion of this money has been used by the local authorities. Of the £600,000 allocated to the fund in 1990, for example, only £115,000, or less than 20 per cent of the funds <Col N="1197" /> provided were used by the local authorities. Part of the reason this fund was not drawn upon more significantly can be attributed to financial strains. Although local authorities can recoup up to 80 per cent of their costs from this fund, this still leaves 20 per cent of the cost to be covered. At a time when resources are stretched to the limit, the necessity to pay 20 per cent of the cost may have dissuaded local authorities from using the fund.</P>
    <P>In a review of section 10 of the Housing Act the problem of drawing on the section 10 budget was addressed. The difficulty lay in the formula through which local authorities could recoup their funding. The old system of <i>per capita</i> payments was made more flexible and I hope that, as a result, there will be improvements.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the need to harness the goodwill of voluntary groups, but let me quote some figures to give people an idea of the size of grants made available. For example, the Cork Simon Community received 8.04 per cent of their total income from grants; the Galway Simon Community received 28.5 per cent of their total income from grants; the Dublin Simon Community received 2.8 per cent of their income from grants &mdash; the lowest percentage &mdash; and the Dundalk Simon Community received 13.76 per cent of their income from grants. These figures are taken from the Harvey report, paragraph 3.1.2.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 of the Housing Act the local authorities are allowed to fund voluntary organisations which provide accommodation for the homeless. Many types of assistance can be provided. I ask the Minister to indicate what schemes are in place to back-up section 5. In 1990, Cork Corporation, for example, provided the Cork Simon Community with £2 per night per bed. I would like the Minister to outline the up-to-date position and to indicate how he proposes to assist voluntary agencies in providing a 24 hour emergency service programme.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the moneys that have been allocated for the housing programme, but I cannot let the occasion <Col N="1198" /> pass without referring to the need to cater for discharged psychiatric patients, especially in view of the Department of Health's request that each health board submit a seven year plan for psychiatric services. I ask the Department to outline their views on psychiatric patients and how they propose to house discharged psychiatric patients. While some of them will be accommodated in hostels or in residential homes, the reality is that psychiatric patients are being discharged into the community. I believe the structures in place in local authority areas are inadequate to avoid casualties which may arise in making &ldquo;progress&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I refer the Department to some excellent articles in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in March of this year by Ann Mooney and Declan Kelly which highlight the position in Cork and I am sure the position in many other cities and towns. The articles &mdash;&ldquo;Driven to the Streets by Hurt, Neglect and Abuse&rdquo;&mdash; sum up far more eloquently than I could the reality, and contrast what is presented in glossy high cost publications from Departments issued through public relations companies and at press conferences which are stage managed.</P>
    <P>The gap between the reality and the myth is wide, and I submit that it is getting wider by the day. The proposals in this legislation will be meaningless unless adequate finance is made available to back them up.</P>
    <P>There are two other issues to which I would like to refer. The Department have failed to face up to the problem &mdash; perhaps they want to hide the facts &mdash; of repossessions and evictions. I believe the problem is far more serious than we have been led to believe. The victims of the economic recession in Great Britain have had their homes repossessed or have been evicted. I should say that the financial institutions in this country, to their credit, did not go overboard in the mid-eighties by giving 100 per cent mortgages to people with inadequate salaries, but there is a problem. Amazingly, when I put down Dáil questions on this subject every six months, in accordance with the Standing Order, I am told that no figures <Col N="1199" /> are available and that it is a matter for the local authorities. I was forced to carry out a survey last year when I wrote to each local authority for their figures for the number of people evicted. I received the usual veiled reply from many of them in which they gave the low figures. As they did not give the figures for the number of houses repossessed, I had to write to them again and the figures I got in return were alarming. I believe the position has got worse in the meantime, but that is only a guess as, in the absence of official figures we are only whistling in the dark. I appeal to the Department to highlight the extent of the problem in relation to the number of houses repossessed and the number of people evicted.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and I come from the same constituency and represent the same interests, and I believe that the problem is getting worse as more and more people are becoming victims of the economic recession. This exercise must be carried out and I ask the Minister of State to do so as quickly as possible. This investigation should not be confined to the local authorities only; the Minister should also write to the building societies and to the banks. I am sure that, at the end of the day, our eyes will be opened. Even at this stage I ask the Department to set up a scheme to ensure that the victims of the economic recession can be bailed out. There is nothing more degrading or demoralising than a family being forced out of their home; I have seen it too often and I do not want to see it again. My local authority take a very flexible attitude in this regard but a national scheme should be set up where people buying their own homes who lose their jobs or become ill could transfer to an arrangement where the local authority or the Department could take over the ownership of the house and allow the person to stay on as a tenant. We have not faced up to this issue but, if we quantify the problem, at least we can tackle it. A plan and policy are needed to deal with the issue of repossessions and evictions. I ask the Minister &mdash; I <Col N="1200" /> know he is genuinely concerned for those he represents &mdash; to deal urgently with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this Bill because it is a major initiative in the area of housing. We also owe a debt of gratitude to the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Connolly. I have no doubt that the present Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will carry on the work put in train by their predecessors.</P>
      <P>We can make various statements in regard to housing policy down the years as far as the State is concerned. However, the State has a proud housing record and nobody has the right to run it down for its efforts over the past 20 years. Anyone who remembers the quality of housing in the early fifties and sixties will know that there have been enormous improvements in the past 25 or 30 years. Of course, that does not mean we can rest on our laurels; the work done probably highlights the need for a major initiative in regard to housing for the future. The Bill is the mechanism which will be instrumental in housing policy in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also look at our future housing needs. The standard of housing, and the type of housing required, is much different from that provided in the last generation or two. There have been major changes in regard to social needs as far as housing is concerned in relation to individuals and families and in providing housing for people who are in poor circumstances because of bad health or other reasons. Because of the way society can treat them, they may become marginalised. However, there is no need to marginalise them and the Bill will help to prevent it. Local authorities have played a major role in the progress made over the years. However, they now find that they cannot meet housing needs which are beyond their resources. We all talk about providing extra money for housing but there is also a need for a more controlled <Col N="1201" /> policy with regard to spending housing finance.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been looked on by many over the past number of years as a source of accommodation. Perhaps some of those people should now consider whether a local authority house is the best future for them or whether they should look at the possibility of providing accommodation from their own resources. Somebody in employment paying the maximum rental to their local authority could be better off repaying a mortgage, claiming tax relief and becoming a house owner.</P>
    <P>There is a need for local authority housing officers to have a counselling role so that when people apply for local authority housing they may be properly advised because, in many cases, they go on the housing list saying that they will be housed eventually. However, they may spend five or ten years on a housing list because they are not seen as being in urgent need of housing. If those five or ten years had been spent paying off a mortgage, they would be closer to becoming home owners. That is why the Department should arrange to have proper counselling made available to local authorities as far as applicants are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a need for long term planning in relation to housing. Over the years the Department have done a reasonably good job but long term planning involves the housing needs for the next 25 to 30 years. We must take social housing needs and the change in family structures into account. The planning must be of a comprehensive nature and not the fire brigade type which has been used on occasion. Fire brigade schemes were implemented to deal with urgent needs which, in the long term, proved to be disastrous. We must look back with regret at some of the work done by the NBA on behalf of the Department, especially in the sixties and early seventies, which built very inferior housing estates. In my town the NBA built a number of houses with wooden panels in front which have now had to be replaced. While they may have been cheap houses <Col N="1202" /> at the time &mdash; and served a short-term need &mdash; the long-term cost to the tenant and local authorities has been catastrophic.</P>
    <P>In Sligo local authority houses were built with inadequate chimneys which cost the Department £300,000 over the past couple of years to remedy. Indeed, when some of them were taken down and examined it was found that they left a lot to be desired in relation to supervision when they were constructed. If they had been private sector houses they would have been better constructed.</P>
    <P>We must also look at housing finance and the resources available to local authorities and the Department. Housing finance has always been a bone of contention. I first became a member of a local authority in 1974 and we are still saying the same thing about finance and housing. We have never had enough, we will never have enough and we never expect to have enough; we do the best with the resources available, but the resources could be put to better use.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Allen, instead of, in many cases, the local authority constructing houses by the tender system, we should be looking at the possibility of buying constructed houses. One has to ask questions when one compares the average cost of a local authority house in this city with the average cost of a house built by the private sector. We should introduce pilot schemes throughout the country under which contractors would be sold sites valued by the local authority and would be allowed tender for the construction of houses of a reasonable standard and design, without the involvement of local authorities. I am sure other Members will agree that there is need for flexibility in the provision of housing. In many cases houses built by the private sector are of a higher standard and much cheaper than those built by local authorities in this city and in the principal towns. I am talking of developments where a contractor has had to buy a site and pay all the usual charges and expenses involved in the development of a housing estate.</P>
    <P>The cost of mortgage finance also has to be taken into account. The building <Col N="1203" /> societies have been reasonably rational in their approach to the provision of mortgage finance over the years. At times we might say that they have been quite conservative but in most cases they err to the benefit of the applicant. Often when people experienced problems in making mortgage repayments building societies were as sympathetic as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one category of person who finds himself or herself in serious trouble in meeting mortgage repayments, the person who, due to ill health or some other unforeseen circumstances, finds that his or her mortgage has run £2,000 or £3,000 in arrears. That person may be able to meet payment on the original amount but may not be in a position to pay off the arrears. Building societies in such cases should examine the possibility of extending the term of a mortgage if needed. The possibility of spreading the amount of arrears across the term of the loan could also be considered as an alternative to seeking repayment in a short period.</P>
    <P>The grant offered to first-time house buyers is not at the level we would like it. Perhaps we should consider the provision of an extra allowance to assist the payment of mortgage interest, based on a person's taxable income, or the provision of a mortgage subsidy for the initial years of a mortgage. That could make a great difference to a number of people who are considering buying their own home as an alternative to going on the housing lists. The Department should consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for some kind of house improvement grant based on a person's earnings. We could all accept a means-tested house improvement grant. I am not advocating a return to the unacceptable grants made in the eighties, when people applied for house improvement grants and, on receipt of those grants, removed sound windows and doors and carried out unnecessary work. A return to those days would not be tolerated but there are people who need help to improve and maintain their housing accommodation. A house improvement <Col N="1204" /> grant could provide the encouragement for people to carry out necessary work.</P>
    <P>The essential repairs grants operated by local authorities should be reviewed in regard to the amount being paid, at a maximum of £1,200, and in relation to the barring of house owners with a young family from those grants. If this scheme was a little more flexible people may not have to avail of local authority housing in later years because they would be able to carry out essential repairs to maintain their houses for the future. The investment of a small amount in such a scheme could prove cost effective and might prevent higher expenditure in later years in having to provide accommodation for a house owner, and his or her family who do not have the means to carry out essential repairs when needed.</P>
    <P>The disabled persons' grant scheme, again operated by local authorities, is a very beneficial scheme that helped provide facilities for many old people and people who are incapacitated.</P>
    <P>The schemes I referred to are imaginative and have done much work. However, if the schemes were a little more flexible they would achieve twice as much benefit for very little extra cost. I ask the Minister, and his officials, to reconsider the restrictions in these schemes in order to determine whether there should be a broadening of the schemes to deal with some of the problems caused by anomalies in the schemes. There is an anomaly as regards families in the essential repairs grant scheme and there is another in relation to age.</P>
    <P>The cost of maintenance of all public housing here must be considered. A bell rings in everyone's mind when people realise that the amount spent on the day-to-day repairs of local authority housing is much higher than the amount taken in local authority rents. There is something wrong there. The only way to deal with the problem is to encourage tenants to carry out the minor repairs that can be done to a house and is done as a matter of course to every privately owned house. When I heard Deputy Allen mention the carpenter who asked that a door in his <Col N="1205" /> house be repaired I was reminded of the painter who wanted the windows of his house and the exterior fence painted for him. That scenario does not help. Perhaps there is room for an incentive within each local authority housing area; authorities might give cash prizes to those who maintain their houses. If people knew that each local authority electoral area had a cash prize of £500 or £1,000 for the best maintained house people would have an incentive to improve their houses. The position is rather like encouraging a &ldquo;keeping up with the Joneses&rdquo; attitude &mdash; if Mary did something today, Kate would to it tomorrow and John would do it the day after. People would often follow a lead if they see others in their estate willing to make a sacrifice to improve the standard and condition of their houses. I hope that is considered; it would not cost a fortune but it would give back a sense of pride to tenants of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>When talking about local authorities, much more imaginative houses could be built than those constructed in the past. That could be done at little or no extra cost. It is not a major request to make that all local authority houses should have their windows made of either hardwood, PVC or aluminium. The white timber windows used previously had a lifetime of ten to 15 years and I hope local authority houses are no longer constructed with those windows. Architectural changes could be made to give each house individuality at no extra cost. Especially with regard to rural houses, local authorities could have several different designs available and they, in turn, would be able to show those who were going to have the houses built the different design of house they could have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all a question of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly says that it is a case of money, but my local authority have reviewed the situation and have come up with a number of designs which would not cost more to construct than those already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> We need to review the rents being charged to local authority tenants and to get a uniform rate. It is frightening to compare the rates charged to city tenants with those charged to rural tenants. In some rural areas the tenants also pay water and refuse charges and other charges which do not apply in the city. Rural local authorities wonder why they should try to get the maximum rent when city councils, because of financial resources, can be lackadaisical in their approach.</P>
    <P>We have to consider our rapidly changing housing needs. Twenty five years ago local authorities provided family housing only. It was unusual to provide old people's dwellings; they have only come on-steam in the past 15 to 20 years. The St. Vincent de Paul Society in Ballinamore decided to provide housing for the elderly, and this was the first housing scheme for the elderly in Leitrim. Since then the local authority have made enormous strides in providing OPDs for people in built up areas. There is a growing phenomenon that one family may, in the course of five to ten years, need from three to five local authority houses to suit their needs. A family house may be given over to one member and, at that stage, the parents will seek the tenancy of an OPD. Sometimes there may be a single parent in the family and another home is required. There is also marriage breakup. It is not unknown that five members of the one family should seek and be granted occupancy of local authority accommodation.</P>
    <P>I do not have a hang-up about this, but in all our housing estates we must be more careful as to the type of housing we provide. A mix is the only answer. There must be OPDs, accommodation for single parents and for traditional type families. We must not produce ghettoes for any section of the community. This is something that can easily happen. There should be a compulsory mix with regard to the type of housing provided by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The changes with regard to shared ownership, proposed in this Bill, are a major step forward in our housing policy. <Col N="1207" /> Shared ownership will result in many benefits to the State. When we are looking at planning, it would be no harm to consider the possibility of making it compulsory for local authorities to provide 50 dwellings in each housing estate in excess of 150 to 200 houses. At the moment if one comes from the wrong area or the wrong street, it affects one's employment opportunities. That is a fact of life which nobody should deny.</P>
    <P>The proposal with regard to improvement works in lieu of rehousing is welcome and has been taken up by many of those who are on waiting lists and the voluntary housing proposals are being taken up by various groups who are making a major contribution for the future.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider reintroducing, as soon as possible, tenant purchase schemes. Many people are prepared to buy houses and even if we sell them at what might be considered to be knock down prices, we will have savings down the road when it comes to maintenance and not having to seek rents, which are sometimes very hard to get especially in times of recession.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must be prepared to be flexibile with regard to housing policy. Whether we like it or not, the local authority have a social housing role. They deal with people who cannot, in many cases, provide accommodation from their own resources. Deputy Allen talked about the homeless with whom we all have sympathy. We have to help educate people who are homeless, who are on the margins as far as housing is concerned, to aim towards providing their own houses with State assistance.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives us a level playing field to improve housing accommodation in order to provide for the needs of families and individuals but the proposals will only go ahead if we have the full support of the community at all levels. People who live on the wrong road should not be victimised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It has enormous potential and, properly dealt with, it can <Col N="1208" /> do a lot to improve housing in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill launched a year and a half ago was to work wonders for many people on the housing lists. Unfortunately, we are not much further on, because we have not recieved answers to the many questions that were asked about the organisation of social housing and the organisation of people with the county councils and the urban councils in purchasing or building houses.</P>
      <P>There was a reassessment of housing needs in the county I represent. There are 462 families in need of housing in my area and, despite the grandiose proposals, they have not a hope in hell of getting a house in the next six to eight months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1-52, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am circulating in the Official Report the latest available figures for net migration which were included in the Preliminary Report &mdash; Areas of the 1991 Census of Population &mdash; which gives the appropriate details for each province, county and county borough and the relevant figures for unemployment for each of the last eighteen months.</P>
      <P>The Government are implementing a comprehensive set of policies as set down in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The Government consistently reinforce the action taken under these programmes as, for example, recently in the decisions announced by the Taoiseach to strengthen considerably &mdash; on a pilot basis initially &mdash; measures to improve the position of the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>These policies and the action arising from them will be complemented by action arising from the work of the Culliton Task Force, the Task Force on Employment and the Task Force on Tourism.</P>
      <P>The Government see a particularly important role, in further action in the emigration and unemployment areas, for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State confirm that the figures sought will show that 30 per cent of the labour force in each county have either emigrated or are now unemployed? Does he accept that a Government, always one more committee away from action, are not capable of addressing these serious problems of unemployment and emigration?</P>

      <P>The question is essentially a statistical one. If the Deputy wants to ask further questions in regard to percentages and so on perhaps he would table them, when I will reply. In addition, I should say that perhaps if Fine Gael participated in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment, we might have some action in that area.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Is it a sign of open government to lump 52 questions together and give no answer to any, expecting us to put up with that treatment? We encounter a serious problem at present in the replies given here. We come in here as public representatives and are treated as gombeenmen, being given answers meaning absolutely nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the reply before the Minister of State to the 52 questions tabled, would he say whether he is concerned at the regional and county variations in the rate of employment; whether there are specific regional focuses of Government policy and, in particular, would he say what are the regions of highest Government priority and the measures the Government propose to take to make an attack on the worst areas of unemployment nationwide?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>It is a statistical question but Deputies will be aware of the different actions being taken by the Government <Col N="1226" /> in various areas, including the area-based responses, the action being taken by the Task Force on Employment and so on. The Government are very much aware of more severe difficulties being encountered in some areas than others which is taken fully into account. Indeed the policies implemented by them to date clearly show that to be the case.</P>

      <P>With specific reference to Questions Nos. 38 and 39 dealing with the midlands area would the Minister of State address himself to the question and say what are Government initiatives towards employment creation in the midlands having regard to the serious position in Bord na Móna and the hundreds of jobs which have been lost in that area over the past few years? I would have expected the Minister of State at least to have given the House the courtesy of a response specifically to Questions Nos. 38 and 39 dealing with the position in my constituency.</P>

      <P>In regard to my Question No. 9, I cannot at all accept what the Minister of State says about these questions not having been tabled separately. They were all tabled separately. It is he who has replied to them all together. In my question I was endeavouring to establish what was the position in regard to Galway city. Even though the Minister gave no verbal information concerning any area it would be better had the Minister of State abandoned this Question Time and endeavoured to reply to Members by written reply if the information is not available to him since he is evading the questions altogether. Is the <Col N="1227" /> Minister aware that, apart from the emigration figures in regard to Galway city, there are now 14,000 people unemployed in Galway city and county? Would he say what he and the Government propose to do about this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <P>My research on the issue leads me to the conclusion that 9,000 people have emigrated from Cork city between the two censuses. I would ask the Minister to be more specific on the question I addressed to him, which is in relation to what steps the Government propose taking in the Cork city area from which 9,000 people have emigrated, approximately 14 per cent of the workforce of Cork city. With unemployment running at approximately 20 per cent at present and since Question No. 4 relates specifically to the Cork city area, I should like a detailed response from the Minister of State if he is sincere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Deputy should doubt my sincerity. The Deputy will be aware that the same reply pertains to his as to other questions. To give one example in Cork north city, I am sure the Deputy is aware of the new scheme announced recently by the Government in relation to the area-based strategy there and the area partnerships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>AIDS was identified as a clinical entity in 1981. Diagnosed cases have been reported to the Department since 1982. Serological surveillance of the disease became possible in 1985 and was initiated in Ireland on a voluntary linked basis in September 1985. Under this programme, tests are confirmed for their HIV &mdash; positivity by the Virus Reference Laboratory in UCD.</P>
      <P>There is a general acceptance that the present surveillance of the disease needs to be improved and that it is necessary to have more detailed information in relation to the spread of infection as a basis for programme planning and evaluation.</P>
      <P>This is particularly important in view of the bias inherent in current surveillance mechanisms where persons at greatest risk of infection may choose not to be tested individually. This non-participation biases the data to the extent that the current systems identify only a trend in the progression of the disease and not necessarily the prevalence of the disease in the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I, therefore, asked the sub-committee on Surveillance/Epidemiology of the National AIDS Strategy Committee to make recommendations to me on how these improvements could be introduced. The sub-committee have submitted an interim report to me and have recommended that (i) AIDS cases should continue to be reported centrally as at present, which has been the practice since 1982. However, the reporting form should be amended to indicate the county or, in the case of Dublin, the postal code of the case and that this should be done without prejudice to the confidentiality of the case. Confidentiality must remain the most important aspect of case reporting; (ii) HIV positive test requests to the Virus Reference Laboratory should indicate the health board area or, in the case of Dublin, the postal code of the case and that the existing request form be amended appropriately. Existing confidentiality of these tests should be maintained; and (iii) Information on the regional spread of infection, both AIDS notifications and HIV positive tests, should be made available to health, boards on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee are continuing to examine the feasibility of establishing a new surveillance programme which would monitor the spread of HIV infection under the following headings: (a) anonymous unlinked testing of blood specimens of pregnant women, already being tested for rubella; (b) anonymous unlinked testing on new born infants, currently being tested for PKU using the Guthrie card; (c) anonymous unlinked testing of blood from outpatients' departments of general hospitals and (d) anonymous unlinked testing of blood of hospital admissions.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the final report of the sub-committee in the near future. When it is available, I will consider all of their recommendations with a view to their implementation in this country.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Bruton was piqued at the fact that I read so slowly for his edification, if he wishes I will speed read this reply.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, I have taken a particular interest in this matter since becoming Minister for Health. I am anxious, above all, that matters relating to the neurosurgical unit be resolved so as to allay any fears that the public may have in relation to standards of care at the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> The Deputies will be aware that an ongoing inquiry is already being conducted by the Fitness to Practice Committee of the Medical Council into allegations against staff working in the hospital's neurosurgical unit.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have also established a committee of inquiry in relation to one of the six consultant neurosurgeons at the neurosurgical unit in accordance with the terms of his contract with his employing authority. If the committee of inquiry, following their deliberations, make certain recommendations, an appeal will lie with me as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I am sure the House will appreciate that, in fairness to all the parties involved, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter pending the outcome of these inquiries.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that all the inquiries to which he referred are being conducted in private and that other than the findings &mdash; other then the net point &mdash; will never be made available to the public? Would he not agree that holding inquiry after inquiry, inquests and court case after court case is not conducive to restoring public confidence? Will he take immediate action to appoint a team of experts, as suggested in the question, who would examine the procedures and establish a Protocol to which everyone within the unit could subscribe and, regardless of what happened in the past, let us start working on a new system for the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the <Col N="1232" /> Deputy. It was my intention to do as he suggested, but it was pre-empted by the decision of the hospital to suspend the consultant surgeon. I was obliged under the terms of the common contract between the employing authority and the consultant surgeon to set up this committee of inquiry into the allegation made. Second, I was obliged to set up an inquiry who would hold their proceedings in private. I had no control over this issue either. Third, the Medical Council inquiry, who have been in existence for over a year, and over whom I had no control whatsoever, meet in private to protect the good name and reputation of the parties concerned until a decision is made. I had no control over that inquiry or the inquiry into the allegations made against the consultant concerned.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister has the absolute power to require an inspectorate to go in there and to specify the make-up of that inspectorate? It is not true to say he was pre-empted from doing this by a decision of the hospital board. Surely, the Minister would agree, the hospital board are entitled to pursue whatever course of action they see fit. Would the Minister not accept that he, as Minister, must ensure that public confidence is restored in the way I suggested, and with which he appeared to agree?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>Detailed information on the age and condition of specific items of equipment for radiation treatment is not routinely collected by my Department. However, a programme for the phased renewal of equipment has been initiated and the priority for replacement in the subject for ongoing discussion between my Department and health agencies.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously to this House, substantial funds were made available in recent years towards the purchase of new and replacement radiotherapy equipment at Cork Regional Hospital. Last year my Department made capital funds of approximately £480,000 available for the purpose of a new cobalt unit in Cork. Considerable investment, both State and voluntary, has been made in recent years in the radiotherapy unit at Cork Regional Hospital with the provision of a linear accelerator at a total cost of £87,000.</P>
      <P>The other National Radiotherapy Centre at St. Luke's/St. Anne's Hospital is currently, at the request of my Department examining its longer term equipment needs. When this list is submitted to my Department, it will be considered in the context of the available resources, having regard to the many other competing priority requirements throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>Would the Minister accept that it would be sensible for his Department to maintain some knowledge of the age, condition and breakdown <Col N="1234" /> records of equipment which is crucial to providing care? Would he indicate the likely scale of this programme, whether it will be capable of dealing with replacement on a natural wastage basis so that we can have confidence that there will not be a continued series of break-downs as has been the case in the last 12 months in St. Luke's Hospital and in other centres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that such a system should be in operation. In the budget for every hospital there should be provision for depreciation of hospital equipment because it is not acceptable that people have to rush around to get the necessary funds when equipment breaks down. That is a very haphazard way of running a service. I indicated to the Department that such a practice should be implemented so that we have knowledge of the age and wear and tear of equipment and in order that there will not be a recurrence of what happened in the hospital mentioned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies may be aware, the Third Report of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group published last September contained a series of detailed recommendations in relation to the organisation and delivery of out-patients services. The implementation of these recommendations is being actively pursued with all acute hospitals. In particular, each hospital has been asked to establish an out-patient services group representative of medical, nursing and administrative staff to assist in the co-ordination and day-to-day operation of out-patients services and to devise strategies to tackle key problems. In addition, hospitals have been requested to put in place effective appointment systems for patients attending out-patient clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not sufficient to extol the various hospitals to perform better and that we need some efficient system of reporting? Would he agree, for example, that it is typical that in some specialties people have to wait a year for a first appointment to see a consultant, which is unacceptable? Would he accept that it is common practice to make all appointments for 9 a.m. and that frequently people have to wait most of the day before they are seen? Would he, therefore, accept that we need a system whereby the Minister can report to us on the performance in terms of these recommendations rather than just telling us that he has recommended them to hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. I am unhappy about the long delay in patients obtaining appointments at outpatient departments. Such delays are unacceptable and I have to see how we can solve this problem. As regards appointment times, I have made this point clear to each of the hospitals when I visited them. They tell me that the problem arises where patients arrive before their appointed time and, second, <Col N="1236" /> because patients from outlying areas come to the hospital by way of ambulance or minibus, and, therefore, all arrive together. These two problems result in the appointments system not working to schedule. Patients should not be expected to wait for long periods. It should be possible for them to be seen within 15 to 20 minutes of their appointment. We have to get hospitals around to that way of thinking and by highlighting the problem we will ensure that that is done to the benefit of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect to the Minister, would he agree that each predecessor before him urged hospitals along similar lines? Would he agree that the problem is that all appointments are made for 9 a.m. and that it is not an administrative problem relating to minibuses? Will the Minister undertake to report to this House on a regular basis on progress on these issues just as he has undertaken to report on waiting lists because this matter is as important to the quality of service provided to patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is my intention to bring in a new authority to replace the Eastern Health Board. This authority will effectively be in charge of management and bringing about the co-ordination of all the health services in the Eastern Health Board area. It would be in the better interests of the State, and the Department of Health, if such an authority formulated policy and did not become involved in day-to-day management, as suggested by the Deputy. I agree that there should be proper monitoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A questionnaire has issued to each hospital with questions along the following lines: has a systematic review of outpatients' services been undertaken recently in your hospital, and, if so, when? Is an outpatients' services group representative of medical and nursing staff in your hospital? Is there a designated person with overall responsibility for the operation of the outpatients' department? Have operational policies and procedures been developed? How <Col N="1237" /> are patients given an appointment for outpatients clinics &mdash; by specific appointment or block booking? Each hospital in the Dublin area stated that specific appointments are made except for fracture clinics, with the exception of the Mater Hospital which, for some inexplicable reason, operates block bookings. We have received much information in reply to the questionnaire and hospitals tell us that the system is fully operational. I would be glad to show this document to the Deputy because it is not confidential information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for my knowledge that I want this information. I would like to see the Minister directing each hospital to publish, for the benefit of its patients, indicators of its performance in respect of these matters so that any patient visiting or telephoning the hospital will know how the hospital is performing. If that information was available the system would operate successfully and it would not need to be addressed by the Minister or by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 73, 91, 100, 111, 145 and 218 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been stated previously in this House, a patients' charter is currently in preparation based upon the following principles: the right of access to services in accordance with need; the right to considerate and respectful care; the right to privacy; the right to information; the right of confidentiality of all medical records; the right to refuse to participate <Col N="1239" /> in research projects; the right to respect for religious and philosophical beliefs and the right to make a complaint.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the introduction of the charter should be linked to the current implementation of a package of improvements in acute hospital services, which have been recommended in the reports of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group and which are being implemented on a national basis. Officials of my Department have also consulted with a number of training agencies and organisations which have introduced customer relations/quality assurance programmes for their personnel. It is envisaged that a process of further consultation will take place within the health services and with ICTU, following which it is intended to proceed with the launching of the patients' charter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to include in the charter provisions whereby patients will be entitled, when they arrive at a hospital, to be dealt with in a timely manner? Will he ensure that the sort of block booking to which he referred, which is going on at the Mater Hospital, does not continue, that patients are called at a time when they are likely to be seen and will not have to spend hours in hospitals waiting for doctors who cannot see them at the appointed time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, and we in our own way can apply pressure on the hospitals concerned. I am a very agreeable person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to put these rights on a statutory basis? Would he accept that anything other than a statutory basis would not give the type of assurance that is required? Second, would he indicate the type of extra resources he intends to give hospitals to meet these high standards and what type of monitoring he intends to put in place to ensure these rights are vindicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would <Col N="1240" /> be possible to put the charter rights on a statutory basis, but we can apply considerable pressure on hospitals by virtue of the fact that the State is funding 99 per cent of their budgets. Regarding resources, I do not think special resources are required for a doctor to observe that the patient must be assured of privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about proper waiting rooms and space?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need special resources to ensure that confidentiality about patients' records is maintained. With regard to the complaints procedure, the non-medical section of the hospital could be involved in investigating complaints. I would envisage an independent body which would not involve the doctor connected with the case. There would be a social worker and a sister not connected with the complaint and perhaps a member of the administrative staff. When a person makes a complaint to a hospital he or she should receive a written reply and the complaint should be investigated thoroughly. The complainant should be notified as to the result as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right about monitoring. We have to inculcate into hospital personnel that this is what is required nowadays. There must also be treatment options. A doctor must be asked to spell out alternatives and to say how they equate with the course of action he proposes. The facts should be made available to the patients. They demand it, although years ago they did not. Doctors, nurses and medical personnel must be aware that patients demand these rights and we should be to the forefront in ensuring that they get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with what I have heard from the Minister. What steps does he intend to take to empower patients to pursue their rights under the charter before, during and after hospitalisation? What structures will be put in place to enable patients to pursue their <Col N="1241" /> rights? Surely he sees a central body playing a role as against an individual making a complaint to a particular hospital.</P>
      <P>Regarding that principle of the charter dealing with the right to equal treatment on the basis of need, is the Minister aware that there is an MRI scanner in each of the three private hospitals, St. Vincent's, the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private, and that there is none in the public health system? How does the Minister propose that patients needing access to costly equipment and drugs will be afforded the right of equal access?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to MRI machines, funds have been made available to Beaumont Hospital and such a machine will be installed there towards the end of the year at a cost of £1.3 million. This will be made available to patients in all hospitals and every hospital will have access to it. With regard to costly equipment, the public sector is following quickly on the heels of the private sector. We cannot control what the private sector buy but we can control their costs in that the VHI can put a cap on the money they pay. The public sector hospitals have very high-tech equipment installed. St James's and Beaumont have the best equipment. I should like to see a certificate of need required before a hospital could instal very expensive equipment like that. Enormously expensive equipment in one hospital is sometimes duplicated in another. I should like to see the public hospitals having it in preference to the private hospitals; I think we will see that. I have been amazed at the efforts made by my Department before I came into office in the amount of funds provided for high-tech medicine. It is a tribute that we have such very expensive and sophisticated equipment installed in Beaumont. The cost of each of these MRI scans is £600, a fact often not realised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there should be a central authority to handle all complaints from patients who want the terms of the charter applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman is available. In the booklet which I will have published it will be stated that patients have access to the Ombudsman and to the Medical Registration Council if they wish to complain about the professional conduct of a doctor. The complaint is best investigated in the hospital concerned because all the records are there. It could be claimed that it is not independent but there will never be a totally independent procedure. It would be much more time consuming if the complaint were submitted to a central body. We want complaints dealt with as quickly as possible in the interests of preventing litigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister about some matters which do not seem to be explicitly covered in the charter. Does he believe that patients should have the right to a second opinion, the right of access to their own medical records, the right not to be treated on a trolley but in a bed and the right not to have to wait beyond a maximum time for a certain procedure?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the right to a second opinion, this is normally done without reference to the patient; he or she is not given a choice. I am not sure whether we could guarantee that right. <Col N="1243" /> We could specify the right to a second opinion but the right to a particular second opinion would not be feasible. On that score, there is a right to a second opinion. Patients have a right of access to their records, which should be available. There would be aspects of their medical records which it would not be in the best interests of patients to see, but the full details of their records should be made available, not selected extracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The persons consulted should provide that information and as full and accurate an extract from the records as is possible to give the patient, having regard to the best medical interests of the patient. For instance, if a patient with a terminal illness was not psychologically prepared for such information, there must be a certain reticence by the consultant to disclose that in full but he would be obliged to give it to the nearest relative; he would be obliged to tell the patient or his relative as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, in the absence of legal underpinning of the rights to be published and bearing in mind the reports of the Ombudsman, who is totally overworked and understaffed, consider the establishment of a medical Ombudsman whose job would be to oversee and vindicate the rights to be established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would love to see that being done by statute but I am told it would create enormous problems. I have looked at the question of appointing a medical Ombudsman and I think this will have to be done. If a patient is dissatisfied, even about getting his report back from the doctor, he must have recourse to another body. At present, the Ombudsman has no right to intrude on clinical aspects of a patient's care, but we may have to look further at this and I would be one of the first to want to do <Col N="1244" /> this. The Deputy is right. It would make a sham of the charter of rights if a patient makes a complaint and does not get a satisfactory answer for one reason or another.</P>

Would the Minister agree it is unacceptable in this day and age that patients should be kept sitting waiting on hard seats in a waiting room for up to seven hours without proper facilities being available? Will the Minister incorporate in the patients' charter the right to have access to rest rooms, a telephone, a coffee machine and facilities of that sort so that they will be treated as human beings when they have to wait in these waiting rooms for up to seven hours?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 121 and 155 together. There has been a significant improvement in the number of children undergoing orthodontic treatment as a result of the special moneys provided by the Government. At the end of 1991 approximately 12,000 were receiving specialist treatment and a further 4,000 cases were being treated at primary care level by trained dentists.</P>
      <P>The 1992 allocation to health boards includes a repeat of the special provision to permit health boards to provide continuing orthodontic treatment for cases begun before 1992 and for new cases in 1992.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of consultant orthodontists is essential to the development of the health board orthodontic services. Major progress in this area has now been made in the recruitment of such staff and to date appointments have been made by the Mid-Western, the North-Western and Southern health boards. Further appointments are expected within the next few months by the South-Eastern Health Board, the Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>These appointments will considerably enhance the orthodontic services provided by health boards. The consultants will, in addition to their direct clinical involvement, have a major role to play in training staff to specialist and to subspecialist level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree he is expressing considerable complacency about a problem which is not within bounds? Is he aware that in the Eastern Health Board area, for example, there are 10,000 people on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment and the best throughout the health board could hope to achieve would be of the order of 2,000 per annum so that we are talking <Col N="1248" /> of a typical waiting time of five years for treatment. Would he also agree that the promise of the appointment of orthodontists &mdash; first promised about six years ago &mdash; has not been fulfilled and that we do not have an orthodontist in the Eastern Health Board area which has the largest population in the country? Will he agree that 2,000 patients are awaiting treatment in the Western Health Board area and that 1,000 people are awaiting treatment in the South-Eastern Health Board area and that this situation applies right across the country? Will he accept it needs more attention than the Minister is offering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Six years ago, the Deputy's party were in power and they made those promises.</P>
      <P>I place great priority on the dental services which, I accept, are not adequate. What I propose doing is to bring before the Government &mdash; I must get used to saying that &mdash; proposals for improving our dental services, including providing for a compulsory year after graduation of dentists which will give us an additional 50 dentists in the public dental service. That should relieve the pressure on the more experienced dentists. We are recruiting orthodontic surgeons in each health board area who will train a team to work with him. This will not solve the orthodontic service crisis overnight. I would be dishonest if I said I thought I would but the crisis will be tackled effectively. This is a big issue. Expectations are high and people want orthodontic care. The cost of private orthodontic treatment is enormous and Members know this.</P>

    <P>Constituents who have got an estimate from their dentist for £1,500 could never afford that amount. An ordinary person could never afford to pay that amount. We must put a proper plan into operation to tackle the problem. At present there are people who will not benefit. We have to try to prioritise those with cleft palate and similar disorders in category I. Dental services for the elderly must also be provided. I invited the dental council to see me to discuss whether the denturists <Col N="1249" /> could be brought into the dental service. They should be able to provide a service direct to the public. I have asked the dental council to submit a proposal for the incorporation of these people into the dental service. I think we would all agree that this must be done because there are many elderly people in need of dentures who are unable to get them. I expect to have their proposal in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>We are talking specifically about the orthodontic services. I welcome the admission by the Minister in the House today that the orthodontic services are in crisis. I put it to the Minister that all the promises we have had repeatedly over many years of new recruitments have genuinely come under difficulties because of the lack of trained orthodontists available. Because of the nature of orthodontics and the need to have treatment in a specific time-frame &mdash; it is no use telling a young girl that in three or four years we will have it right if such a delay would be the ruination of her facial features &mdash; would he accept the suggestion, practised in the United Kingdom, of establishing a national unit that would go from health board to health board until such times each health board had sufficient orthodontists to operate within their own boundaries? At least that would get us over the short term until the ambitions the Minister has put to us in good faith are realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will examine that point and I will discuss it with the Deputy. I accept we have got to do something positive about it, and I am prepared to listen to any proposals or suggestions by Deputies. I should say that in recent years special additional allocations have been made to health boards for the development of orthodontic services as follows: in 1989 an extra £300,000; in 1990 an extra £567,000; and in 1991 an extra £1 million.</P>

      <P>The allocation to <Col N="1250" /> health boards in 1992 includes a repeat of the special provision for the continuing improvement of orthodontic services. I know this is a big problem but I think we can tackle it. I will examine the problems and look forward to hearing from Deputy Howlin about his suggestion. I am prepared to take on board any positive suggestions that would improve the position.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Many schoolchildren who are identified at primary school are needing orthodontic treatment simply grow out of the range where they can obtain treatment. I would ask the Minister to consider one of two options: either ensure there is an increase in the number of trainee orthodontists or, alternatively, increase orthodontists' salaries to entice them from private practice. I spent some time on a health board and during that time we appointed three orthodontists, none of whom turned up because they could not give up their private practice. The Minister will have to deal in a practical way with this problem either by paying them sufficiently to entice them from private practice or train an extra supply through the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already decided to attract them into the public dental service by allowing them certain private practice. A number of orthodontic consultants have been appointed and the advertisement is in for the Eastern Health Board area where the main problems arise. Because of the attractions we will offer and the incentive of an appointment to a dental hospital we expect to be able to appoint orthodontists of high calibre. The orthodontist can train his own team. When we appoint an orthodontist we expect him to train at least four. Subcontracting it out to the private sector would be very wrong and we would never solve the problem. I think we will have this system in operation very soon. I am taking his problem seriously and I have looked at it every single day. I have called in the officials but they assure me that before the end of the year we will have orthodontists in <Col N="1251" /> the other main areas and the problem will be tackled. We will not have it tackled immediately but we will make progress. I promise to keep Deputies informed as to how we are progressing because it is a serious and important issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 109, 228, 229 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>I want to assure Deputies that the improvement of services to people with mental handicap is one of my main priorities. I am determined to improve these services and my predecessor outlined details of the Government's commitment in this regard in her statement to the Dáil on 11 December and in the statement issued following the announcement of the Estimates.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group &mdash; Needs and Abilities &mdash; which has been accepted in principle by the Government, sets out the framework for the development of services for persons with a mental handicap and the Government are committed to the improvement and expansion of these services under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> envisages a seven-year implementation period and in the past three years an extra £9 million has been allocated for the development of these services.</P>
      <P>With the extra £6 million provided this year significant improvements in services will be put in place in 1992. Of the £6 million allocated, £1 million will be allocated to support the capital costs of the new services. When the increases in the allocations to the health board and mental handicap agencies are taken into account, the total increase in cash terms in 1992 over 1991 is £10 million.</P>
      <P>Of the £5 million available for additional revenue costs, £1.12 million has been allocated to provide an extra 80 residential places and £1.2 million has been allocated to provide 300 day places for those most in need of such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further 41 respite places will be developed at a cost of £590,000 in a full year. This will mean that about 500 <Col N="1253" /> additional families will be able to have a respite break of one month in the year. This is a very significant provision and will provide valuable relief to families and carers. These additional places will be spread over the entire country in proportion to need.</P>
    <P>A home care or outreach programme is being developed at a cost of £1.21 million to meet the needs of families with a mentally handicapped member. It is my intention that this scheme will work in a flexible way. The scheme should provide a service for up to 1,000 families and will be targeted specifically at those persons who have no service at present or for whom services are inadequate.</P>
    <P>There is a particular need to have an effective and immediate response when crises arise in families with a mentally handicapped member. A sum of £400,000 has been allocated to provide 20 places in the Dublin area to ensure that emergencies can be responded to when they arise. There is also the need to cater for those persons with mental handicap who are also disturbed. The service for these people is being improved and expanded. An additional six places are being put in place in Dublin area at a cost of £150,000 and Unit B, St. Loman's Hospital, Lucan, County Dublin, will be replaced.</P>
    <P>Preventive and early intervention services play a significant role in reducing the level and severity of handicap in our society and will receive particular attention this year. A specialist genetic counselling service will be initiated in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, as soon as possible. A separate sum of £250,000 has been allocated for this purpose in 1992. Services for children will be expanded by the provision of three extra early intervention teams and 55 places in child education and development centres at a cost of £220,000 and £280,000 in a full year, respectively. The precise operational details of the additional services to be provided, the staffing requirements, and the people to benefit have been agreed by the mental handicap co-ordinating committees in each health board area.</P>
    <P>These developments are a major step forward and will result in a considerable <Col N="1254" /> improvement in service provision. I also do accept that more needs to be done but I want to assure Deputies that the service will be maintained at this higher level and it is my intention that this will be built on and further improved in future years.</P>
    <P>I recognise the understandable fears of parents who have a son or daughter with a mental handicap. I hope that the special measures being put in place this year will allay their fears to some extent but I accept that they will not be fully satisfied until they are assured of a place for their son or daughter. I hope that the service improvements which are taking place and which are planned as I have outlined will assure them that this Government are determined to resolve this issue.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that approximately 1,000 additional residential places are required to meet existing needs among the mental handicap population. The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services Needs and Abilities estimated that there was an annual requirement of 40 additional residential places to meet emerging needs. In the longer term the review group predicted a &ldquo;break even&rdquo; situation would not be reached until after 2010. While it is not possible to estimate the likely waiting time for a person in need of a residential place, I wish to assure the Deputy that respite care, which is an integral part of service provision, is available throughout the country and emergency situations are dealt with speedily and effectively. As I have already indicated significant improvements in these services are being put in place this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We would welcome this progress were it not for the huge size of the problem that is yet untouched. Would the Minister not agree that the provision of 80 places against a need for 1,000 is not really getting to grips with this problem? Would he not agree that when the review group said that this problem would be tackled by the year 2010, it said so on the basis that the Minister would in this year, 1992, provide a sum of £23 million for these services? Finally, would the Minister not agree that <Col N="1255" /> people with mental handicap have a right to treatment, that that is not being honoured and that if we want to have legal underpinning to rights we should be starting with those rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have followed the problems of the mentally handicapped since the time I went, unannounced, to see St. Ita's Hospital many years ago. What I saw there left a very lasting impression on me. There were 96 severely mentally handicapped women in two wooden huts and only two toilets. They were hidden away and I just strayed off the beaten track and went in and was appalled at what I saw there. I recognise that the mentally handicapped did not get the priority they deserved over the years, but I was crying in the wilderness'; there were not many people supporting me in my campaign on their behalf. I can understand the constant anxiety of their parents, and we all meet them in our constituencies. We are making some attempt to solve the problem and this will be done over a seven-year programme which they themselves believe will make major inroads into this area and will go a long way to giving the mentally handicapped their rights.</P>
      <P>There are many people who are only mildly mentally handicapped and what we need is up-to-date information of the numbers in the country. I have been trying to get this information today but no census of mentally handicapped people has been done since 1981. However, there are about 25,000 mentally handicapped people in the country. We have already asked for more up-to-date figures.</P>
      <P>We spend almost £200 million a year on the mentally handicapped. What we would like to see is a marked decrease in the incidence of mental handicap. The initiative of setting up the genetic counselling service at Our Lady's Hospital will go a long way towards ensuring this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to be able to give the Deputies a more optimistic outlook but if we make up our minds we can give this problem the priority it deserves. I hope <Col N="1256" /> that my many colleagues in this House will give it top priority, as I do, and with their help we will deal with the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will find he will get a resounding response to that call. Most people in this House would seek to support the putting of mental handicap as the number one priority in health because they are a category in our community whose basic rights have been denied and whose problems have not been addressed by Government for many decades. If we did nothing else today but assert that, we would be doing a good day's work.</P>
      <P>I will not quibble with the answer the Minister gave to the question, but because it is so global let me ask him a question in specific terms. We are talking about a limited sum of money when it is put against the scale of the problem. What exactly are the Minister's priorities &mdash; training or residential units, employment, day care or respite? How is the money to be spent? Can he tell us where the focus will be in the immediate short term so that we will know how we are to tackle this programme over a number of years? Is the Minister aware of any agencies dealing with mental handicap that are now on the point of bankruptcy? Will he address the problem if these agencies come to him with that dilemma?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many degrees of mental handicap. With proper surveillance and early detection of cases the mildly mentally handicapped can, with the proper education, live a normal life. We must, therefore, look first at the mildly mentally handicapped. For the moderately mentally handicapped we can have workshops and provide proper care rather than, as we have been inclined to do, shove them into mental hospitals. Too many are still there. Now we are taking them out of the psychiatric services, desegregating them and putting them in separate places even within the mental hospital campus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three priorities, to provide proper educational resources for the mildly mentally handicapped, to get the moderately mentally handicapped into workshops and to provide a proper environment in the hospitals &mdash; not necessarily the mental hospitals &mdash; for the severely mentally handicapped. I would like to get them out of the mental hospitals so as not to have this stigma that is still there despite all we try to do.</P>
      <P>Many of the moderately mentally handicapped can be accommodated in the community. It is well worth while visiting Peamount where there is a lovely place for the mentally handicapped and they do great work. Not every mentally handicapped person need be put in residential care. This is only for the severe cases. They must be taken out of the mental hospitals, redesignated and put on a rehabilitation programme. That is what is important for the moderately to severely mentally handicapped. For the mildly mentally handicapped, proper education is necessary to prevent the condition progressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We work closely with agencies. They come to us and cost the service and we pay them. In the case of an autistic person it costs £21,000 a year. The agencies did not complain that what they were getting was inadequate. Very few voluntary agencies complain that funding is inadequate. There was a complaint from some of the agencies who were very upset that the European Social Fund to provide training for the mildly mentally handicapped ran out. The EC rules were that provision should only be for one year but we got them to extend it to three years.</P>

How does the Minister propose to address that serious human problem? Second, I am amazed the Minister is asking questions about the lack of statistics, as clearly he is familiar with the central planning committee for the eastern region. Would he agree that the figures are frightening; that instead of the position improving in the eastern region during the past three years, in relation to the need for adult day places and residential places, it has got worse? Finally, given that he has said that this area is a source of concern to himself would the Minister agree that only 45 new residential places have been created this year despite the fact that the central planning committee pleaded that at the minimum they required 100 residential places and 250 day places along with a wide range of training schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should inform the Deputy that there are 11,846 people in receipt of day or residential services. Furthermore, we have increased the number of residential places considerably. There are 4,548 residential places, 1,515 hostel places and 5,783 day places. In the 1990 budget provision was made for an extra 149 residential places. If, as the Deputy says, the position is getting worse this <Col N="1259" /> can only indicate that there has been an increase in the incidence of mental handicap.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> First, I wish to compliment the Minister in relation to the attitude he has adopted towards people with a mental handicap. Second, would he agree that were it not for associations involving the parents and friends of those with a mental handicap who raise funds non stop throughout the year many of the services, despite the backing of his Department, would fold up?

      <P>If we did not have these voluntary organisations the situation would be chaotic. I do not think the statutory services could provide anything like the level of services they provide. They also serve a very useful purpose in that they highlight the needs of those with a mental handicap and keep them to the forefront. Even though at times they may irk us they are doing a great job and will ensure that it is our No. 1 priority. I meet them regularly and should say that they do tremendous work and are very dedicated. Therefore we could not do without them as the service would collapse. I agree with what the Deputy had to say in that regard. We could not praise them enough in relation to the work they do. We should encourage them because the public have to be made aware that there is a need to make this our No. 1 priority and to have a national debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Reported cases of meningitis in this country can be broken <Col N="1260" /> broadly into two main categories. These categories are (a) acute viral meningitis and (b) bacterial meningitis. Acute viral meningitis is not normally regarded as a serious illness. Bacterial meningitis is, on the other hand, a more dangerous condition.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health monitor the incidence of infectious diseases including meningitis in two ways: (I) through the weekly reporting of cases by general practitioners to the local director of community care/medical officer of health who, in turn, reports the cases to my Department, and (II) reports on individual cases of bacterial meningitis are submitted by the local director of community care/medical officer of health to my Department. This reporting mechanism enables the Department of Health and the health boards to monitor the presence of meningitis throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The reports showed the general pattern of infection for meningitis to be one of sporadic cases occurring in various parts of the country but late last year and earlier this year an increase in the number of cases of bacterial meningitis was apparent and a number of fatalities were recorded in the Southern and Eastern Health Board areas. Medical staff from my Department maintained close contact with these boards throughout these outbreaks during which the deputy chief medical officer of my Department wrote to each director of community care/medical officer of health in the country asking them to liase with general practitioners to ensure that there was a high awareness among GPs of the disease and that appropriate control and management measures could be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appearance of a case of bacterial meningitis indicates to the local health service the presence of infection in the area. The local health board through its director of community care/medical officer of health then liaises with GPs to create a more clinical awareness of the presence of infection in the area. This is important because in the more pernicious types of infection the prognosis will depend on early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Prophylactic <Col N="1261" /> therapy is also initiated for the family and immediate contacts of cases and a detailed report is made to my Department by the local director of community care/medical officer of health of each case that is notified to him by GPs in his area.</P>
    <P>My Department are not aware of any association between bovine TB in Ireland and recent cases of meningitis. I should say that no cases of tuberculous meningitis have been reported in recent years.</P>

      <P>Bovine tuberculosis is related to meningitis but not to bacterial meningitis and specifically haemophilus influenzae meningitis. It can be and was associated with tuberculous meningitis which is totally different. Bacterial meningitis which we are discussing at the moment &mdash; there were sporadic cases in Cork in particular and in Dublin &mdash; is caused by haemophilus influenzae. I should say to the Deputy that the Department of Health in Britain have decided to introduce a vaccine for children under the age of four. We are planning to introduce a haemophilus influenzae vaccination programme in this country for the winter or early spring seasons. This vaccine has been approved in Britain and they consider it safe. Given the increase in the number of sporadic cases in Britain <Col N="1262" /> they are introducing it. We are examining it to see if it should be introduced here.</P>

      <P>As I said before the break, this Bill was introduced a year and a half ago and was to do great things for many people throughout the country because the Government had failed to provide adequate funds for local authorities to build houses for the needy. To date, so far as I am aware, not one house has been provided in my constituency.</P>
      <P>We must look at the position over the last five years. A Fianna Fáil Government were in office from 1987-89 and there has been a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government since then. During that time &mdash; to their credit &mdash; the Government provided a total of 109 dwellings in County Meath compared with 531 houses in the previous five years.</P>

      <P>At present there are 462 people on the housing list in County Meath. Last Monday one of the Deputies in that constituency complained on the national airwaves about the local authority not providing enough homes for people in the constituency generally, especially in her area. In reply to that statement I will quote a remark made by a Member of this House, an elder statesman; it seems that Deputy Mary Wallace wants to be a mighty mouse in her constituency and a church mouse when she refers to problems in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any wish to attend any parliamentary party meetings of the Deputy's party, I am quite happy where I am. Double standards from Deputies are not acceptable. The facts are that the Government and different Ministers for the Environment over the last four or five years have not provided the funds to build houses for the people about whom Deputy Wallace is concerned. It should be clearly stated that it is not the fault of Meath County Council that the people to whom Deputy Wallace referred do not have houses. Indeed, houses will not be built this year either and they will still have to live in mobile homes. As chairman I reject her accusations. Double standards should not prevail as far as Deputy Wallace is concerned. Indeed, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, was up to other tricks in connection with planning and things like that. When he was part of the local authority he was not very vocal in relation to certain issues and would have liked them to be discussed behind closed doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social housing proposals will not make much difference when voluntary organisations throughout the length and breadth of the country are being asked to provide 90 per cent grants to provide housing. In fairness, what is proposed in real terms is passing the buck from the local authorities to voluntary organisations in relation to providing houses. Admittedly, some changes must be made. We have a proposal in connection with joint ownership. Many local authorities have written asking the Minister to clarify the position that will pertain when joint loans are taken out. The occupier will pay interest on the loan for half the house over a period of years, but it has not been indicated what amount will attach to the other half of the house at the end of that term. The Minister made statements at a recent conference in which he blamed local authorities for not <Col N="1351" /> implementing particular proposals, yet he himself has not clarified certain issues when requested to do so by local authorities all over the country.</P>
    <P>In the recent past we had what was probably the sale of the century in relation to local authority houses. Houses of a very acceptable standard have been sold extremely cheaply. Previous speakers in the debate mentioned particular problems of service charges and the difficulties people face in meeting rental payments. It is interesting to note, however, that many householders whom the officials were led to believe had had problems in meeting rental payments, water charges and refuse charges, were very quickly able to come up with the total amount of their arrears so that they could buy their home when the sale of the century took place. That happened in my constituency and I am sure that it also happened in every other county in Ireland. I have to pose this question to everybody for whom we provide houses, and, after all, the houses are provided with State funds: have they the commitment and the will when houses are built and allocated to them to maintain the houses and to pay their way?</P>
    <P>As has been stated, all houseowners have to repair and maintain their homes. I do not believe that it is unreasonable today to expect those who are provided with homes to carry out the necessary repairs to their homes. This morning other Deputies talked about carpenters who asked their local representative that repairs be done to their homes and painters who likewise asked that their windows and fences be painted. The policy should be changed. When we allocate houses it should be understood by the tenants that a certain amount of essential repair work must be carried out by them. Perhaps then the majority of those people would think a lot more of their homes. I do realise, of course, that only a small percentage of tenants abuse the system but it is not right that so much money should be spent on repairs when it could be put to more productive use.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with the housing lists <Col N="1352" /> throughout the country there is a very important need to reintroduce a reconstruction grant in certain circumstances. I do not believe that a grant should be made <i>carte blanche.</i> If I had any fault with the previous reconstruction grant it would be that the grant was made available for windows only. That was a mistake. We all know of the thousands of people who replaced quite adequate windows merely because the grant was available. There are many people living in houses in need of repair who, because they are on low incomes, find it difficult to get loans to enable them to carry out repairs to their homes. Some of those who are on housing lists because the house they are living in at present is condemned as being not properly fit for rearing a family would themselves, with the provision of a small grant towards paying for necessary facilities and making necessary repairs, be able to effect repairs. The numbers on the housing lists could thus be reduced by about 20 per cent. After five years in office and after having said when they abolished the former reconstruction grant that they would reconsider the provision of a grant later on, I cannot believe that the Government have not done so. The reintroduction of a reconstruction grant would result in an increased number of jobs becoming available in the construction industry. The material used in constructing houses would be about 95 per cent Irish produced. With the small amount of grant aid that would be allocated in each case under such a scheme the Government would do two things; they would provide badly needed jobs in the community, at a time when we have 300,000 unemployed, and they would be taking people off the housing lists and allowing them to repair homes, and in this regard I think particularly of homes in rural parts of the country that are in need of repair and should not be allowed to fall into total dereliction.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with housing development in my county. We are located on the periphery of the city of Dublin and every year thousands more people want to come to live in the county. <Col N="1353" /> That puts enormous pressure on services in the towns of Ashbourne, Dunboyne and Dunshaughlin, which all require new facilities for water and sewerage. As a result, the rural part of the county is experiencing much greater pressure for planning permission. All of those issues combined mean that any site becoming available in the upper part of the county is quite expensive and is beyond the reasonable reach of many people. The council are not in a position to provide adequate sites at a reasonable cost. To go back to the new social housing concept and joint ownership, people find that it is too expensive to buy houses in the open market even if repayments are being made on only half the price. In that scenario, nobody can provide a house any cheaper or as cheap as the local authority. The local authority units in Meath have been provided in the past few years with one of the finest design teams in the country, who have been able to provide homes at £24,000 &mdash; as low a price as that paid in many, if not most, parts of the country. When individuals are given the opportunity to become involved in a joint ownership arrangement they are prohibited from doing so because of the cost of the sites themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem in relation to the elderly. While I know that the Department of the Environment allow the Department of Health to carry out essential repairs under a grants scheme for many elderly people, I do not believe that apart from carrying out the essential repairs a much greater emphasis should be placed on providing not only improved windows and doors but also ordinary facilities such as bathrooms and showers. Once the essential repairs are done the tenants will not get the repair people back again in their lifetime. A small sum would ensure that these people could remain in their homes. In the long term it would save the State money it would have to spend on residential care for those people.</P>
    <P>When one compares the cost of carrying out those repairs with the cost of providing residential care it is obvious we are cutting off our noses to spite our <Col N="1354" /> faces. This should not be work for the health boards. The scheme should be run by local authorities and adequate funds should be provided. Many people would not have remained in their homes were it not for that scheme. We have missed an opportunity to go a little further and provide essential facilities so that people could remain in their homes for a longer period.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem in the provision of housing for travellers. The Minister made the case that it was a matter for local authorities and said he was disappointed that they had not been more positive in dealing with problem cases. In my constituency we provided 32 or 34 homes for traveller families over the past ten to 15 years. There is a halting site in Navan and all the travellers seeking accommodation live in the vicinity of the town. If a local authority decide to provide a site within a mile and a half of the town travellers can make the case that it is inconvenient and refuse to go there. The settled community must obey the planning laws and obtain planning permission to build their own homes and if a county council provide houses people have to accept them irrespective of where they are located; they do not have any choice.</P>
    <P>It is hard to accept statements from any Minister in the Custom House that we should get off our butts and look after these people when if we provide accommodation we can be told by the travelling community that it is unsuitable while people in the settled community who provide their own homes find that the value of their homes might drop by £10,000 or £12,000 due to the presence of a halt in the vicinity. There is need for dialogue between all concerned to ensure that the law on unauthorised camping is implemented.</P>
    <P>The community college in Navan caters for 600 pupils and there are 28 caravans on the road outside. There are 200 fewer pupils attending school because parents will not send their children to the school. The vocational committee made an effort to have some of <Col N="1355" /> the caravans moved and we made efforts to provide proper sites.</P>
    <P>If there is an epidemic due to the unsanitary conditions there, the finger will be pointed at local representatives for not doing their jobs. I can see that happening. There must be a way to solve this problem. Responsibility just cannot be laid at the door of the local authority to solve the problem regardless of the expense involved or inconvenience caused. When dealing with housing we should refer to these matters. Public representatives can walk away from the problem and leave it at the door of the county manager but what county manager would go against his council? We need two-way dialogue and co-operation. The law in some instances is totally on the side of the travelling community and if they do not like a site they can refuse to go to it even if it is only a half a mile away from where they stay. We must look at this as reasonable politicians and recognise the problems.</P>
    <P>Are we serious about expecting voluntary organisations to build houses? The Society of St. Vincent de Paul built a scheme of houses for the elderly in Oldcastle, County Meath, an enormous task, and the scheme was very successful. However, if we go down the road of expecting voluntary organisations to do the work local authorities should be doing, how many units will be provided?</P>
    <P>The categories of people on housing waiting lists have changed. I have been a member of a local authority for more than 17 years. One single parent was on the County Meath housing list 17 years ago and now, the number has increased to 33 per cent of the 462 cases on the list. I am sure that applies in all rural parts and I understand it is twice that number in Dublin. While the type of unit we require now may be smaller we require more of them.</P>
    <P>Social housing is a concept which has worked quite well in some European countries, but has not worked so well in other parts. I predict that the proposals encompassed in this Bill will work in certain areas and not in others. Unless the <Col N="1356" /> Minister and his officials accept that that will be the case it will mean that the problem will be partly dealt with in some areas of the country while, in other parts, the numbers in need of housing will escalate. For example, there will not be the voluntary organisations who can provide much cheaper houses. Therefore I predict that, because the costs will be prohibitive, it will work in some parts of the country and not in others.</P>
    <P>Something that must be taken into account nowadays in the case of applicants for loans from building societies, banks, local authorities or whoever &mdash; which was not the case, say, five or seven years ago &mdash; are the ancillary costs of sending children to school, the cost of providing health services for them and so on. For example, a number of years ago an income of, say, £10,000 or £12,000 was sufficient to allow applicants obtain a loan and build their houses. But nowadays people are experiencing increasing difficulties in merely surviving because of all the ancillary costs which did not obtain heretofore. In addition, because of unemployment, many families encounter difficulties in repaying their SDA loans as they were known.</P>
    <P>While recognising that it is the prerogative of local authorities to be repaid loans they advance they should be allowed negotiate with the occupants of a dwelling on which there are arrears of repayments, allowing him or her pay rent until such time as they may re-enter the labour force. I contend there is no point in a local authority taking possession of a house, recouping the amount owed to them, giving the balance to the individual concerned who must then, in turn, rent another house because the relevant local authority cannot provide them with an alternative home. There should be a new approach adopted in the case of an individual who may fall by the wayside in respect of his or her repayments on becoming unemployed. Rather the approach should be to deal with the circumstances pervailing, leave the family in their home and allow them pay rent in accordance with their means. If that <Col N="1357" /> approach were adopted it might help to alleviate the numbers on local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>These are everyday problems encountered by every public representative nationwide. To date local authorities' hands have been tied &mdash; being in the business of loaning money &mdash; in the sense that they must seek repayment of amounts owed to them. With more open, positive thinking in this respect we could leave very many more people in their homes on a rental basis until such times as they rejoined the workforce.</P>
    <P>Many Members have highlighted the problems encountered in the construction and/or repair of homes, as it is recognised that houses can be built more cheaply in some parts of the country than in others. For example, sites cost much less in some parts than in others. But it will be a tough task for anybody endeavouring to purchase a site and build a house in the eastern region. Unless the incentive of a reasonable grant or mortgage subsidy is reinstated for the first time purchaser of a home the housing waiting lists nationwide will continue to increase. I know that the number of people now seeking loans, as compared with a few years ago, is very much fewer because along with all the ancillary expenses it has become much more costly.</P>
    <P>At the General Council of County Councils I believe the Minister commented that he was disappointed that local authorities were not dealing with the matter of social policy on housing head on; in other words, apportioning the blame on local authorities for their failure to date. Local authorities posed several questions about the implementation of this Bill which have not been answered. Until such time as these questions are properly answered I predict this policy will not get off the ground. I contend that it is not the fault of local authorities but rather the inadequate information being made available to them with regard to the legislative provisions. Until such time as the attendant legal questions are answered the Minister and his Department will not receive people's full co-operation because they <Col N="1358" /> will be afraid of entering into commitments in areas where they may later encounter problems.</P>
    <P>Initially I was pleased to hear the announcement of a £10,000 grant for people on local authority houses to enable them to carry out essential repairs. However, when we received full details of this grant, we discovered it was a £10,000 loan; in other words, the grant turned out to be an interest-free loan. I could not but think of the enthusiastic response to the launch of this scheme &mdash; a £10,000 grant to be payable to people living in condemned local authority houses, whose names were on the local authority housing waiting list, which would constitute a life-saver for them and immediately remove them from the housing list. But, when they got into the nitty-gritty people were astounded to discover the money had to be repaid.</P>
    <P>People no longer accept that type of codology &mdash; that is what it amounts to. There is nothing wrong, in many cases, with an interest-free loan but it begs the question, why try to sell it as a grant? I have no doubt that many people could be taken off the housing lists if such small loans were made available to them. We in Meath were allocated £50,000 last year. It is very difficult to persuade people in receipt of low social welfare benefits to take up such an option since the amount has to be repaid. In addition, the amount of money granted was grossly insufficient to tackle the problem in any serious fashion. The Government will have to learn that they cannot propose something without providing the necessary funds for its implementation. Since this Government appear to have decided not to provide money for building houses they must then realise that each home will cost, say, £90 or £100 by way of subsidy or interest in repayments.</P>
    <P>If the Minister seriously wishes to reduce the number of people on the housing waiting lists he should give them a grant or make sufficient funds available to enable them to carry out, essential and reasonable repairs to their houses. I referred earlier to the plight of elderly people who have much less money. Some <Col N="1359" /> elderly people who receive grants to do up their homes may die after four or five years. In such cases the person who inherits the property benefits from the work which has been carried out. These people should have to repay these grants. The State has paid out a great deal of money by way of grants to elderly people who have died four or five years later. I do not think there is anything wrong in asking the person who inherits such property to repay the grant &mdash; times are hard and money is scarce. If this were done it would enable repairs to be carried out to many more houses, ensure that old people lived in comfort for the remainder of their lives and ensure that people who inherit these homes did not benefit at the expense of the State.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for the Environment with whom I have had dealings have been members of local authorities. I should like this scheme to be taken a stage further. There is nothing wrong in giving an interest-free loan provided the local authority are given discretion to set the level of the repayments &mdash; in most cases the recipients of these grants are on social welfare &mdash; on the basis of one's ability to repay. If this discretion were given to local authorities I believe the scheme would operate more efficiently. There is too much red tape in the present system. This is why Deputies come in here and say only one case has been dealt with in their constituencies. Local authorities can deal efficiently with individual cases provided the information is given and the legislation is straightforward. Unfortunately, the proposals in the Bill are not straightforward. Once the Bill is enacted the Minister should introduce regulations along the lines suggested by me. If the Minister talks to Fianna Fáil Deputies who are members of county councils I am sure they will confirm what I have said. The scheme will not work if the red tape is not eliminated.</P>
    <P>The problems on the ground should be dealt with in a more imaginative way. We are not asking for millions of pounds to be allocated to individual counties; we want a certain amount of money to be <Col N="1360" /> allocated to local authorities to distribute in the way they see fit. We are asking the Minister to allocate £50,000 to a county with 105,000 citizens and with a waiting list of approximately 500. This money would enable the local authority to provide housing for 50 to 100 people. The Minister cannot have his cake and eat it.</P>
    <P>The housing problem will not be solved if the Minister's colleagues from my constituency act as mighty mice in their constituency and as church mice here. As chairman of a local authority I could not let the debate on this Bill pass without referring to the double standards of some of the Minister's colleagues. This will not help the hundreds of people on the waiting lists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important Bill which sets out the legislative framework for the social housing plan. <Col N="1361" /> Even though I am relatively new to the political arena, I recognise the complexities involved in providing proper, suitable and appropriate housing for everyone. If I did not know any better I would think the Opposition Deputies who have contributed to the debate never had an opportunity to deal with the problem of housing needs, that they were never in a position to provide the level of housing required. However, I know most of them have at some stage had the opportunity to deal with housing needs. All they are doing here is playing charades: they criticise the Government's plan for social housing. If anything, they are probably jealous of what the Government are doing in this area through one of the most innovative plans introduced by any Government in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the document entitled <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> published in February 1991 which states:</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to pursuing housing policies with the broad objective of ensuring that every household has a dwelling suitable to its needs, located in an acceptable environment, at a price or rent it can afford.</P>
    <P>It goes on to outline the future strategy and highlights that it will embrace all sectors of the housing market. It focuses on the housing situation in Ireland and states:</P>
    <P>While the broad policy objective remains constant, the changing dimensions of housing needs and the background against which they must be addressed require that public policy instruments be regularly reviewed to ensure that they are the most equitable, effective and efficient means of responding to needs in the circumstances of the time.</P>
    <P>It goes on to highlight the new approach to social housing and the benefits that are expected from this approach.</P>
    <P>After listening to Opposition speakers I do not believe they read this document in any great detail. Most of them used terms that are sensational and may grab <Col N="1362" /> a headline. They referred to a housing crisis and the Fine Gael spokesman referred to people sleeping in cars. He said people live in bed and breakfast accommodation for months on end &mdash; they were his words. All Members and those involved in local authorities and health boards, realise that few people are accommodated in bed and breakfast establishments or sleep in cars for months on end. That was an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity of asking the corporation the number of people accommodated in bed and breakfast establishments by them or by the health board and asked for what period people were placed in such accommodation. The housing official informed me that it could be for one night, that they try to accommodate people as quickly as possible, that they would not be in such accommodation for more than seven days and that the maximum number of people accommodated in bed and breakfast establishments is 30 to 35. It is important that one produces the facts and does not exaggerate.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to respond to a person who held ministerial office, and who now holds a senior position, who said that the social welfare rules need to be relaxed. He said that elderly people who take in a son or a daughter should not lose their living alone allowance or other allowances. He said that the present rules were effectively forcing old people to live alone and were costing the State a fortune. I am sure that statement grabbed the headline in some of the papers. That Member went on to state that the estimated number of people on waiting lists for local authority housing could be reduced by 2,000 to 3,000 if the sons and daughters of elderly people, their spouses and families were allowed to live with them. Unfortunately, that spokesman is not just exaggerating; he is misinforming people about their entitlements.</P>
    <P>If that spokesman, or any member of the Fine Gael Party, contacts me I will be happy to give them a copy of my budget information leaflet which is produced after each budget. In the budget <Col N="1363" /> of January 1990 the Minister provided that people over 80 years of age who avail of free electricity, a gas allowance and other schemes can retain these allowances if somebody goes to live with them. I would be happy to keep the Fine Gael Party, and other Members, fully informed of people's entitlements to ensure that scaremongering and headline-grabbing comments of the type I referred to are eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>What about those over 70 years of age?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael spokesman referred to the 2,000 to 3,000 houses and I should like to point out that we have provided accommodation for 2,000 to 3,000 people. However, I support his comments about young people who leave home to go into private rented accommodation and live on State benefits. They are entitled to unemployment assistance and, possibly, some other social welfare benefits including rent subsidy, assistance towards ESB and gas bills, medical cards and so on.</P>
      <P>In recent days I received correspondence from a constituent indicating that an individual left home to avail of such benefits. This person was horrified that taxpayers' money was being misspent &mdash; as he said &mdash; in this manner. He asked me to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister as he does not want his hard earned cash to be spent in this way. Some people who came to me in regard to entitlements expressed great concern at the huge amount of money that is paid out by way of rent subsidy, in the form of electricity and gas allowances and assistance towards bills for young people who leave the family home. This matter should be carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Opposition speakers are playing a game of charade. I had an opportunity to look at the comments of the Labour Party spokesman during their period in coalition with Fine Gael. He stated that Fianna Fáil always deprived those in greatest need of their chance of owning or renting a decent house and always cut back on <Col N="1364" /> council house building, depriving tens of thousands of construction workers of jobs and tens of thousands of families of houses. I described this as an exaggeration and misinformation on the part of the Fine Gael speaker. The same applied to the quotation by the Labour Party spokesman. It was utter rubbish. Other speakers exaggerated the housing position. I touched on that matter earlier when I referred to the numbers given by Dublin Corporation of those accommodated in bed and breakfast establishments.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses our housing needs. I do not come into the Chamber to play games on this issue because housing is very important. Present needs must be addressed and there are many ways of doing so. When I was elected to Dublin Corporation in 1985 that body were picking up the tab for housing development projects prepared by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Ballymun was purpose built about 25 years ago to meet housing needs. We have heard about Ballymun not only in the context of housing but in the context of the difficult social problems there. Other housing estates of a similar nature were built. One with which I am quite familiar is Darndale. Dublin Corporation housing architects saw a German development of approximately 300 houses. They came back and more than tripled that number by building 970 houses. People will also recognise Darndale as an estate which has many social problems.</P>
    <P>When I became a member of Dublin Corporation in 1985 we had many difficulties to face as the controlling group on the council. One of the problems was securing vacant accommodation against squatters. In 1987 we were paying in excess of £2 million to security companies to protect vacant property. When speakers opposite say that many houses were built under their Government in 1984 and 1985 they seem to forget that in 1986 and 1987 a large number of local authority properties were vacant and tax-payers' funds were being spent on security.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> Since 1987, when Fianna Fáil came into office, the huge sum of £26 million has been spent on refurbishment in the Dublin Corporation area alone. The Minister could have decided to spend that money on new housing projects, but then there would have been many more vacant dwellings in other areas, with associated security costs. The addressing of housing problems in the global sense through an innovative plan for social housing is the right approach.</P>
    <P>This Bill is wide-ranging in scope, covering many aspects. The explanatory memorandum deals with the sections in great detail and each section has its own merits. I want to focus on the section dealing with shared ownership. This is a fantastic idea which gives people an opportunity to purchase their own home who heretofore did not have that chance. The scheme allows a person to acquire a house by purchasing only a portion of the equity initially, with a right to buy out the remaining equity on agreed terms. This is a fabulous idea and the scheme is to be available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the cost of purchasing a house in the Dublin area is very high when compared with the cost in other areas. I do not know how the Minister intends to address this difficulty. It is only fair that people in the Dublin area should have the same opportunity to avail of the plan as people anywhere else. Figures show that 90 per cent of the people on the corporation waiting list are earning less than £8,000 a year and 80 per cent are earning less than £6,000, 21 per cent of whom are single parents. We must recognise the difficulties for a person in that category who is trying to purchase a home. Somebody in the country might be able to get a site from parents and local labour might assist in the building of a home. Such a person would require a much smaller loan than the person living in Dublin. The Minister could address this matter in a number of ways. I would earnestly ask him to give special consideration to people in the greater Dublin area. The price difference in respect of housing is easily recognisable. <Col N="1366" /> There could be special consideration by way of loan repayments, a greater subsidy towards rent repayments or the raising of income guidelines for Dublin applicants.</P>
    <P>In the case of a couple, one of whom is working, I seek clarification as to the income threshold to avail of the shared ownership scheme. Where a couple are both working, what is the income guideline? I have been given some misinformation and I should appreciate clarification. The Minister has indicated that he will review the shared ownership scheme after an initial two-year period. I would ask him to take into consideration the point I have made in relation to the Dublin scene. He should look very closely at the income guidelines for married couples both where one is working and where both are working, so that the system is equitable. I believe that the shared ownership scheme could be applied to other areas.</P>
    <P>I have already brought to the attention of the Minister and the Dublin City Manager a parochial matter in my constituency where a more flexible approach to the shared ownership scheme could meet a huge demand for housing. Following the recent sale of a block of apartments with the tenants <i>in situ</i>, known as Seapark Apartments, Mount Prospect Avenue, Clontarf, the new landlord decided to sell off the apartments one by one. The tenants do not have adequate cover under the tenant-landlord legislation and they now wish to purchase their flats under the shared ownership scheme. Some of the tenants have lived in the block of apartments for between 15 and 20 years and are now settled in the community. Some are still earning and others have retired. Because of the necessity to buy out the remaining share in the property within a 20 to 25 year period, the local authority will not consider applications from people over the age of 40 to participate in the shared ownership scheme. This is very unfortunate. We could insert other conditions whereby a son, daughter or relative would guarantee to take up the remaining share of the <Col N="1367" /> property in a shared ownership buy-out. I know the matter I raised with the Minister and Dublin City Manager is still under review but I think it would be quite simple to organise a scheme so that in this particular instance the huge number of tenants could avail of the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    <P>I now wish to focus on the development of senior citizen housing. From my short stint on Dublin City Council, I am aware that elderly people are being housed in one room units. If we consider the age of those who apply for senior citizen accommodation, we know they will spend a great deal of time in bed, whether at night or during the day. A great many elderly people like to take a nap after the midday meal. If the local authorities are to develop statutory senior citizen accommodation we should ensure that every senior citizen apartment has a separate bedroom. Indeed, I tabled a motion at a meeting of the city council to ensure this would happen and it was agreed that we would not develop any further senior citizen accommodation which did not have a separate bedroom. This is only commonsense. If a person lives in a one room unit, the sofa is used as a bed at night and then has to be folded up for use as a sofa during the day. If the elderly person takes a midday nap they have to go through the folding up process again.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the voluntary housing groups as they are responsible for the development of excellent and superb senior citizen accommodation. I am pleased to note that special recognition as well as additional funding has been given to the voluntary sector in the plan for social housing.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions in the Bill dealing with improvement works in lieu of local authority housing has great potential for accommodating the elderly and other categories such as single parents. If we can be a little more flexible I envisage we will see more people being accommodated in their local area which we all recognise is far the best way if at all possible.</P>
    <P>We should specify that voluntary and <Col N="1368" /> statutory bodies approach the provision of housing for the elderly at parochial level in a co-ordinated way. The elderly person who may be living in a local authority house or a private house, which he may find difficult to maintain because of his restricted income, remains in the house because there is no other suitable accommodation available in the area. However, if we were to develop suitable appropriate accommodation for such people, one would find that this would free up local authority houses and private houses would be put up for sale. This would have a knock-on effect because others could purchase the house under the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, many other aspects of the Bill warrant mention and are of great merit: accommodation for travelling people; the provisions on private rented accommodation; the introduction of rent books, letting agreements and other controls; measures to counteract housing segregation; the increasing role for local authority tenants and homelessness. There are far too many to mention on Second Stage. I believe that given the opportunity the Bill should prove most beneficial in achieving proper integration and solving the present housing needs. This is why I fully support and commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I have been tied up with the Special Committee on the Finance Bill, I regret I have not had the opportunity to listen to the contributions to this debate. This is a critically important issue for so many people in our society, and so many in my own constituency.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been awaited for a very long time. An expectation has been built up that the Bill would make an appreciable contribution towards tackling the housing crisis. The only speaker I have had the opportunity to listen to was Deputy Callely. He certainly made the best of what is very poor material, and I want to reply to a number of the points he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Callely described the shared ownership scheme alternatively as a fantastic idea and a fabulous scheme but he <Col N="1369" /> then went on quite properly to show why it is almost of no relevance to the constituency he represents and the different constituency that I represent in urban Dublin. He dealt with the foolhardiness of a previous Government who left us with so many vacant houses in the mid-eighties that thousands of pounds of tax-payers' money had to be spent on security to protect these unoccupied dwellings. The Deputy is right, thousands of pounds were spent on the protection of vacant houses at that time and the vast majority of that money was spent in my constituency. If this anomaly is not addressed soon I predict it will result in an uprising a la Brixton, Toxteth or Los Angeles in my constituency where Dublin Corporation, for reasons of history, own the major part of public sector housing although it is a county council administrative area. In that constituency Dublin Corporation incurred the bill to which Deputy Callely refers. It was a scandal but it is important to point out the reason. What happened was that the then Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour introduced another fabulous idea which is known colloquially in my constituency as the £5,000 grant scheme. Of course, it was not really a £5,000 grant scheme, it was closer to a £10,000 grant scheme. In any event it had certain merits in certain geographic areas of the country but it was almost an unmitigated disaster for the local authority areas in my constituency and in Dublin generally. The reason was that in a relatively new constituency just as people are beginning to put down roots and community leadership was beginning to evolve, anyone who had a bit of get up and go and who was in employment got up and went. The result was a mass exodus at that time. People bought into low cost private housing as a result of assistance from the scheme in question. I had no objection to that scheme, it certainly had merits. Down the country, for example, it worked reasonably well from the point of view of my many constituents who availed of it and bought into the low cost private sector so it was successful and it was a good idea. Unfortunately, sadly <Col N="1370" /> and tragically some have had their homes repossessed since but generally speaking many did well as a result of that scheme and I would be the first to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>In terms of a constituency that has been planned so badly and which has such a vast homogenous belt of public sector housing and at a time when leadership was beginning to emerge and when people had put down roots they were encouraged to get up and go. The result was the situation to which Deputy Callely refers.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation, at the best of times unable, in my constituency anyway, to co-ordinate a tenanting policy with casual vacancies arising, suddenly had a vast number of vacant houses. I recall bringing the matter to the attention of Dublin Corporation by way of motion. I took a photographer around to some of the vacant houses and in the motion I gave the estimate that the cost to the taxpayer would be of the order of £250,000. A gentleman who works for, I think, Dublin Corporation &mdash; in any case he works for the Dublin City Manager &mdash; Mr. Noel Carroll, a great friend of Gay Byrne, who has easy access to the Gay Byrne show, said I was talking rubbish. Subsequently it emerged that the cost to the taxpayer was £750,000 and that I had vastly underestimated the cost of restoring the units destroyed. That is the situation and that is what happens as a result of <i>ad hoc</i> planning of housing needs, introducing schemes off the top of the head, introducing schemes that take no account of the variants and the geographical factors and of the circumstances &mdash; as Deputy Callely said &mdash; that are unique and particular to urban areas and especially the greater Dublin urban area.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been awaited with bated breath by the 30,000 housing applicants throughout the country as if it is to provide some badly needed relief. I am afraid it will make only a minimal contribution and will be a major disappointment to those people. In the local authority, of which I am a member, Dublin County Council, there are 2,117 <Col N="1371" /> people on the housing list. Some of these cases are desperate. Nobody in Dublin County Council area, to my recollection, has managed to be housed off the priority list during the past nine months or more. We have only managed to house people who have become homeless.</P>
    <P>We talk about taxpayers' money being wasted on the security bill to protect houses but now taxpayers' money is devoted towards keeping people in bed and breakfast accommodation and in health board hostels. That is the reality and it is a cruel confidence trick on people who are in need of housing.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the question of the shared ownership scheme. I have heard only Deputy Callely on this as we have been dealing with the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill since Monday. That Deputy said that the shared ownership scheme will be a fabulous scheme, that it is the jewel in the crown of this legislation. As I have said, it is a cruel confidence trick because it is inoperable and it is wrong for any Member of this House to advise unsuspecting housing applicants to opt for such scheme. I should like to explain why that is the case by taking a particular example from my own constituency that is capable of being empirically applied. The facts are straightforward.</P>
    <P>The idea is that the initial facility is there to purchase 50 per cent of the equity of the house, pay the rental at the same time, and during the 25 year period or, more literally at the end of it, there is an obligation to purchase the remaining 50 per cent of equity. What does all that mean for the people who queue week after week to come to my advice centres and to the advice centres of a great many Members of this House? The following are figures I have worked out to give advice in these circumstances, and I would be obliged if the Minister, when replying, would indicate if there is anything in them that is wrong or misleading. Take, for example, a typical house in my constituency of Dublin South West which is capable of being bought for £41,000 &mdash; there is a number of constituencies where <Col N="1372" /> one could not purchase a typical house for £41,000. Let us take it that 50 per cent of that price is funded by a deposit of £1,000 required for fees and so on, and by a mortgage of £19,500. The mortgage repayments on £20,500 at, say, 10.75 per cent interest is £199 per month, to the nearest penny. The rent on the remaining £20,500 at an escalator of approximately 5 per cent is £85 per month. That gives a total repayment, by the person who has been successfully approved under the scheme, of £284 per month. Having regard to the income group we are talking about here &mdash; and Deputy Callely made a very good point about that &mdash; £284 per month is a pretty hefty repayment.</P>
    <P>If that were the end of the story it would not be too bad but it is not. At the end of 25 years that person must purchase the remaining 50 per cent equity which was £20,500, at an escalator of 4 per cent which is the kind of escalator that actuaries work on at present &mdash; it could be more or, in the context of the European exchange rate mechanism, it could be less. People out there who think that they have purchased their house for £284 per month over 25 years will find at the end of 25 years that it will cost them £52,500 to purchase the remaining 50 per cent of the equity. Can Members of this House in all conscience advise housing applicants who come to their clinics and advice centres to become involved in such an entanglement? How is it expected by the Government that the average low income earner, who may indeed have become unemployed by this time, who is nearing retirement age or is at retirement age, will find £52,500 to buy out the remaining equity? No bank will give a loan of £52,500 to somebody nearing retiring age, who may have become unemployed, who is certainly on a low income unless they won the lottery in the interim. How are they supposed to find that money?</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government have seriously thought out this scheme at all. Is it any wonder that the uptake on the scheme is so marginal? Is it any wonder that it misses its target by a mile? Is it any wonder that when I raised this matter in the House on 19 December last not <Col N="1373" /> one single house in the greater Dublin area, where approximately one-third of the people live, had been purchased under the share ownership scheme? People are not fools at the end of the day, and it would be the height of folly to engage in such a scheme.</P>
    <P>People do not understand that what we are talking about here is a double generation liability. There is no way that the average person on the necessary low income in their middle thirties or early forties could, 25 years hence and close to retirement age, take on a second mortgage. It must be presumed that they have offspring who, in turn, will have to get a very steep mortgage in order to, 25 years later, end up owning a very modest house.</P>
    <P>I am not denouncing the concept of a shared ownership scheme. I am not denouncing the multifaceted approach to the housing crisis that is suggested in this Bill. I believe that all the different streams in it are necessary. I believe that the shared ownership concept may indeed have merit. However, as practically structured at the moment, it would be disingenuous &mdash; and I would not take the responsibility &mdash; to advise one of my constituents to embark upon such a scheme. It is high time the Government restructured it and had a look at this situation. When one has regard to the fact that that is such a major part of this scheme and it is so fatally flawed, people who are on the housing list will be tragically disappointed by the impact this Bill will have.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the situation in my own local authority where we have 2,117 people on the housing list. The number of people who could afford even to contemplate the folly of entering into the shared ownership scheme is but a fraction of those 2,117 applicants. Four hundred and ninety-five of them are employed or involved in a FÁS or SES scheme which, admittedly, is a very broad definition of being employed; 15 are on family maintenance; 1,585 are social welfare recipients and there have been no income details from 22. I honestly do not know what kind of world <Col N="1374" /> the Department of the Environment think we are living in or what kind of advice the Minister is getting. Is it that the Minister sets the political parameters and the advisers have no choice? I cannot believe that the advisers would not have brought these facts to the attention to the Minister. In regard to the estimated household income of these 2,117 applicants, 1,002 of them are in receipt of less than £4,000 per annum; a further 543 are in receipt of an income of between £4,001 and £6,000; a further 251 have an income between £6,001 and £8,000. That means that 1,796 of the 2,117 are in receipt of incomes of less than £8,000.</P>
    <P>How in the name of God is it seriously suggested that this shared ownership scheme offers any hope to those 1,796 applicants in my local authority? It offers them no way out of a situation where many of them are walking the streets of Dublin because the requirements in the bed and breakfast accommodation to which they have been allocated requires them to leave at 9.30 in the morning and not return before 5.30 in the evening. This very day I was called out of the Finance Bill committee meeting in the Seanad Chamber to meet a family who have three children, one only six months old. They must get out of their bed and breakfast accommodation at 9.30 a.m. and walk the streets of Dublin until they are re-admitted at 5.30, with that six months old baby and two other small children. They will have to spend a period in limbo, in purgatory, before they have any prospect of being offered accommodation. Nobody, no matter how high their points on the priority housing list, will be housed because we have so many people on the homeless list.</P>
    <P>From what I have heard of the debate I do not think there is any real understanding or appreciation of the housing crisis. I await hearing from Deputy Moynihan and my colleague on my left with regard to the serious problem outside Dublin, a problem which is being swept under the carpet.</P>
    <P>I note that my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, made the remark that at least the unemployed have to queue weekly at the <Col N="1375" /> labour exchange and that one can see the number of people unemployed whereas in the case of the housing crisis one cannot see the people concerned; they are either hidden away behind the four walls of a hostel, in a bed and breakfast establishment, in grossly overcrowded family conditions or in sub-standard private rented accommodation. The Minister can therefore bring forward, under the guise of this Housing Bill or the plan for social housing, as many new-fangled ideas as he likes, some of which have merit &mdash; I endorse and support that &mdash; but unless we get back to building public sector housing again we will continue to have this trail of misery that I have spoken about.</P>
    <P>It appears the Government are waiting for emigration to resume. There is no sign that any serious attention is being devoted to the kind of crash programme necessary. Only a few years ago parties who held out to the electorate the prospect that they would be in Government claimed they they would set out in specific terms the resources that would be allocated for the house building programme. Like so many other things, the fashion has been reversed. A house building programme is apparently the furthest thing from the minds of Ministers; I hope I cannot apply that remark to their advisers, but that would seem to be the situation.</P>
    <P>Last year my own local authority, Dublin County Council, the largest local authority in the country, who cater for the needs of more than 500,000 people received an allocation to build 72 houses. Before the Minister replies, I am aware that they did not build 72 houses. I understand that when the Minister received a deputation from Dublin County Council recently he performed exceptionally well and took them unawares when he reminded them that they did not build 72 houses. For those of us who are members of Dublin County Council, it is a shame that those houses were not built. I have expressed my views on this in very trenchant terms at Dublin County Council meetings on a number of occasions; it is indefensible <Col N="1376" /> and a disgrace that we did not manage to build the 72 houses.</P>
    <P>The bureaucrats will say that they did not receive notice or an allocation until June and that they then had to design plans. One would think that the 72 houses were of a different design &mdash; and I am not defending this &mdash; but a good performance from the Minister will not build one extra house in my constituency. While Dublin County Council are at fault on that aspect the truth of the matter is that the brunt of the case to be made by Dublin County Council is a valid, urgent and critical one and no surefooted performance by the Minister, well in control of his brief, will change the fact that there are 2,117 people on the housing list. That was the position before the Minister received the deputation and it was also the position after they left. Therefore it has changed nothing. This is a shame in a country which professes to care for its people.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to deal briefly with the tenant purchase scheme. I cannot understand all the hype and concentration on the shared ownership scheme. What was wrong with the tenant purchase scheme? What is the reason we do not have such a scheme? I have always supported the idea that local authority tenants should be encouraged to own their own homes. I do not see why we should have this staccato arrangement which has some notional date for the expiry of one scheme before a new scheme can be devised. Why should we not encourage people who are living in rented accommodation to purchase those houses? Apart from anything else in areas of broad public sector housing it automatically lifts the environment that people are living in. Why, therefore, are we holding on to the fig leaf that the 1988 scheme has to expire before we can bring in a new scheme?</P>
    <P>This system of planning a tenant purchase scheme has only created anomalies. I do not think the last tenant purchase scheme was realistic and houses were given away at uneconomic knockdown prices. Tenants who purchased their houses under the 1988 sales scheme are living cheek by jowl with those who <Col N="1377" /> purchased under the previous scheme. For example, there are people in my constituency whose repayments are of the order of £22 per week, say, to Dublin Corporation, whereas those who purchased under the previous scheme are repaying sums of approximately £45 per week. This only gives rise to resentment within the same estate. I do not know who thought up the 1988 sales scheme and, again let me say, on behalf of my constituents, before anyone from Fianna Fáil circulates a leaflet indicating that I denounced the scheme, that many of them have done very well under the scheme and I am delighted about that but it could not have been an economic proposition and it has created this resentment.</P>
    <P>What is required is a well balanced tenant purchase scheme to ensure that tenants have the means to purchase but not at bargain basement prices that were available under the 1988 scheme. Such a scheme would do wonders for a constituency like mine if we could encourage such a concept. As I said, it would greatly enhance the quality of life in the area. I plead with the Government to consider it.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Government introduced the 1988 scheme for the wrong reason; they wanted to get the maintenance costs off their back. It seems we want to get out of providing public sector housing. The maintenance burden is a heavy one. We want to get out and use the moneys for maintenance and other purposes rather than put the money into building new houses and encouraging more people to buy and own their own homes. There is a great opportunity to ease the housing crisis. On the question of maintenance, I welcome the provision in the Bill to involve tenants because, in my constituency, tenants feel greatly alienated from the local authority. It is a positive and welcome provision in the Bill which, I hope, will be put into effect.</P>
    <P>Do the Minister, who is from Tipperary, the Minister of State from Cork or the advisers in the Department of the Environment, who probably only pass <Col N="1378" /> through my constituency on their way to Brittas Bay during the summer, have any appreciation of the kind of constituency which I represent? Do the planning authorities and politicians understand the historical legacy of the expansion of Dublin, 20 or 25 years ago, to the county area and the purchase of land in my area of west Dublin by Dublin Corporation who remain the housing authority although the administrative authority is Dublin County Council?</P>
    <P>Is there any appreciation of the problems posed for my constituents as a result? There has been complete neglect by Dublin Corporation of the housing needs of the people in my constituency who pay them rent. It is all because of the central factor of no democratic accountability to the people, through their elected representatives, by Dublin Corporation. There is no estates management, no proper tenanting policy or no response maintenance of the calibre and quality which the people deserve. The reason is that no elected representative of any party in this House can stand up in Dublin City Council and demand to know from the manager what the situation is in regard to alleged drug pushing &mdash; there are three or four pushers in one street in my constituency &mdash; their lack of control in tenanting policy and casual vacancies and the total absence of estates management. Nobody can ask a manager in a city council to account for that and, as a result, we are the poor relations.</P>
    <P>Problems of anti-social behaviour and problem tenants in other parts of Dublin are dumped in parts of my constituency as a convenient response by Dublin city management to the elected representatives in City Hall. We feel powerless to do anything about it. I am disappointed &mdash; unless the Minister can tell me to the contrary &mdash; that nothing in this Bill will facilitate a resolution of that problem. Do not tell me, as Dublin Corporation have told me in arid documents, that the situation is no worse in Tallaght, Clondalkin or parts of Blanchardstown than it is in Ballymun or Darndale. That is not true and the proof is that, cheek <Col N="1379" /> by jowl with corporation estates in my constituency, there are Dublin County Council estates and the way they are managed and kept, the way tenanting policy is handled and the way tenants' grievances are dealt with, is light years away from the treatment meeted out to Dublin Corporation tenants. It is not a question of a uniform policy or a uniform run-down of services; I know that Dublin Corporation have a major problem in terms of the budget and it is perfectly understandable that their officials respond to the greatest areas of pressure; that is human. If elected representatives stand up in the chamber in Dublin City Hall and challenge the manager it is normal for the manager to respond. However, the situation is getting out of hand in some estates in Tallaght, which is evident if you talk to the inspector of the Garda Síochána, social workers, religious, community leaders or other politicians. This cannot be allowed to continue; I am talking about estates where more than 60 per cent of the people are unemployed and a great many more than that in some areas.</P>
    <P>The £5,000 grant to which I referred earlier cleared out people who are in employment. By definition they had to be employed to receive the grant, they moved out and were replaced predominantly &mdash; surveys showed the figure to be 73 per cent &mdash; by people who were unemployed. Consequently, we have a concentration of unemployed in these areas and as public representatives we seem powerless to respond to the situation. I do not know when this debate will end but I should like the Minister to seriously address this problem. We are talking about 5,000 units of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, assured me in this House that the local government reorganisation Bill would provide a way out but it is almost impossible to get anywhere with Dublin Corporation. They do not seem to think that the solution which suggests itself, that the ownership of local authority houses in a <Col N="1380" /> given administrative area should be vested in the local authority who have that administrative responsibility and that they should have responsibility for housing. The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, in a specific reply to me during the processing of the Local Government Bill suggested that it could be facilitated in the Bill. I wish that somebody in the Department of the Environment would tell that to Mr. Frank Feeley and his managers in Dublin City Council because they do not show any signs of facing up to the worsening crisis. Their argument is that they do not know where they will house their own people if their houses are taken. However, that problem can be dealt with by a common housing list in the greater Dublin area and there is no point in erecting bureaucratic barriers where none exist. There is no will on the part of Dublin City Council to acknowledge this problem; they have a kind of imperial approach to the county which they regard as a somewhat subservient local authority and that it should be administrated as Dublin Council deem correct.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to take time to be advised on this point and to see if we can make any improvements. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I regret that you have entered the House when I am winding up. I have drawn attention to fatal deficiencies in the central core of this Bill which establishes the necessary legislative framework to facilitate what the Minister clearly hopes will be the easy implementation of the shared ownership scheme. There are fatal flaws in the scheme, which I outlined, and I hope they will be addressed. I drew attention to the fact that the tenant purchase scheme should be revised as a priority and that a greater share of the receipts from the tenant purchase scheme should go towards a new building programme.</P>
    <P>Above all, if we are to make any impact on the trail of misery about which I spoke, a crash building programme is necessary. The situation is now where it was in the sixties and it must be dealt with if we are not to have a Brixton, Toxteth or a Los Angeles on our doorsteps. <Col N="1381" /> I am amazed at the tolerance and the acquiesence of people who find themselves on the housing lists. They are not now organised as they were in the sixties but they will be so organised if we do not address the problem.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there are some good measures in the Bill and I acknowledge that there are good measures in the social housing plan but I reject the political con trick that suggests to the people that the Bill is somehow a solution to the housing crisis. It is not.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a greater role for the voluntary agencies. Agencies such as NADCORP have a facility, if the question of resources was addressed, to make a greater contribution to reducing the housing lists.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that, at a time when, in my constituency, there is a trickle of regular home repossessions and a damburst of people on the housing list, battening down the hatches, cosmetically presenting the social housing plan as a solution and hoping that emigration will be revived earlier than we expect is an answer to the housing crisis. The one clear message that I should like to give to the Minister is that the housing crisis will not go away. I should like to hear his reply to that message.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of this Bill to speak on the whole matter of housing. Deputy Rabbitte's comments have brought home to me even more the various difficulties experienced in areas such as the one he represents and the more rural areas such as the one I represent. During a debate such as this, it is interesting to share our ideas about many of the problems we come up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the problems encountered in connection with local authority housing in my area would concern people living in caravans and other mobile homes, people living in very damp cottages and people living in &ldquo;tied&rdquo; houses, that is, houses that go with their employment. In many cases people have been on the housing list for a long time. Some of those at <Col N="1382" /> present living in caravans could wait five years before being housed.</P>
    <P>A particular problem encounted in my area, and I imagine that it relates to Dublin as well, concerns location. Frequently people on a housing list cannot move to another area of a county because of transport difficulties or for other social reasons. For example, a family might have a handicapped child attending the local school and there may be a bus service to the school and other facilities. That family would not be able to chose to move 20 or 30 miles further into County Meath and would be unable to live anywhere other than in their own locality.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised at the contribution made by Deputy John Farrelly, who is also the Chairman of Meath County Council. He made an unmerciful attack on myself and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies from the constituency. I was particularly surprised because the attack has no solid foundation. I do not think the Deputy could possibly have heard the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; on the radio last Monday because he certainly misrepresented the facts. For the sake of the record, it is important for me to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly, as Chairman of Meath County Council, seems to think that I and other people are complaining that the local authority are not building enough houses in County Meath. In fact, the specific debate on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; last Monday morning concerned location and the fact that people from the Dunboyne area of County Meath who are on the housing list are disappointed that of the 25 houses being built in our county this year none is being built in the Dunboyne area. An auctioneer was interviewed on the radio programme, as was an applicant who has been living for five years in a caravan in the area and could not take up the option of moving to Navan, Trim or Kells because of special social circumstances. The case was made for special families who wait on the county council lists for houses to be built in Dunboyne specifically, Dunboyne being a developing area in the county. For that reason, I was taken aback when <Col N="1383" /> Deputy Farrelly alleged double standards on the part of other Deputies. He talked of one being mighty mouse in the constituency and a churchmouse here. I was very surprised at the chairman of the Meath County Council using this forum to vent his anger on an issue and make inaccurate statements in doing so. The Deputy talked of there being double standards on the part of Fianna Fáil Deputies from County Meath but one would have to question his own standards. I suggest that the Deputy tell the House what he is doing for the people he purports to represent rather than criticise the rest of us. I suggest that he is a churchmouse in the constituency when he can do so little for the people he represents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly has a nerve to attack the rest of us and to make an attack based on a programme that he evidently did not hear since his information was so inaccurate. The specifics of the programme related to a particular problem in south County Meath because of its location. As most Deputies would realise, south County Meath is ideally located for those who want to work in the city and live in the country. The difficulties associated with that are an increasing cost of housing and house rents. The auctioneer and others on the radio programme discussed the problem wherby people on the local authority housing list cannot afford to rent a house because of the rents charged, which result from demand for housing. During the programme an appeal was being made to the local authority to locate at least four of the 25 houses in Dunboyne in the south of the county in order to deal with the special cases of people who do not have the option of moving elsewhere. Deputy Farrelly would be better employed trying to do something for those people rather than coming into the House and attacking those who are trying to do something for them.</P>
    <P>Because of the wide-ranging and increasing problems we have, I believe the Minister is correct in seeking to provide more innovative and flexible approaches to individual housing needs. <Col N="1384" /> Among the problems faced is that of marriage breakdown, which poses an immediate housing problem and an immediate dilemma for the families involved. Those involved in marriage breakdown form a special group who, increasingly, are coming on to the housing lists. The time has come when we must accept that it is no longer enough to say that the only way to deal with housing needs is to build more and more public housing. If the Government took that attitude we would continue to concentrate our efforts on the provision of public housing and in doing so would ignore the fact that there are other ways of dealing with the specific needs of individuals.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the voluntary housing scheme option, which should be utilised more. That scheme provides an excellent opportunity for a community to provide for its people within its own area. Local authorities should promote the voluntary housing option more than they are doing and send out the message to the many people in the community who would be prepared to participate in that programme but who may not be aware of it. More and more we need to get the message out to the community that there are options available through the voluntary housing scheme. As most of us who deal with the community know, voluntary involvement in many schemes has a great impact and they should be encouraged. One difficulty we have is in getting the message across to people.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague who gave me some time in this very important debate. I commend the mover of the Bill and the Labour Party for bringing it forward. It is the first time we have had a substantive debate on these issues. When this controversy started it was my sincere objective to work for a consensus on this issue to try to ensure we did not have the kind of division and bitterness we saw in 1983 on this issue. Looking through some newspapers today before coming to the Dáil I noted a cartoon in a February issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> which showed a Supreme Court judge bring a basket with a baby in it to be left at Dáil Éireann. This was telling us to legislate on the issues which surround the recent Supreme Court judgement and that is what we are doing now. We are attempting to legislate for important matters that have arisen as a consequence of the 1983 constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with the issues and the demand for change. I question why the Government cannot accept this Bill given the indication of public concern and support in the recent opinion poll. As I listended to the Tánaiste last night, I was interested in the rather coy way he dealt with the issues. The Tánaiste agreed that the Bill was good, that it had many elements they would like and that they might bring in a Bill like it. In effect, the Tánaiste said the Bill was what they wanted but we should not ask them to accept it now, that they would like to introduce one later.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Labour Party were asked to withdraw this Bill when it is so timely and necessary. I regret also that we were told last night by Government speakers that we must wait for the Government sub-committee to report, a group who are, in effect, the Taoiseach's fig leaf. The sub-committee are giving him the kind of cover and protection he feels he needs. In reality, the Taoiseach does not need that cover. There is nothing to be afraid of. We are talking about two simple measures, the right to travel and access to information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant, when we are discussing an issue of personal and urgent need for <Col N="1386" /> women, that their point of view on this issue is under-represented in this House due to the small number of women Members. As a result there is an obligation on the Government, and on Ministers, to canvas the views of women's organisations who have clear opinions on these issues. The opinions and views of people such as Miss Justice Mella Carroll, of the Commission on the Status of Women and of representations of the Council for the Status of Women should be acted upon. The Government should listen to the opinions of women because their representation in this House is only a pale shadow of what it should be.</P>
    <P>The issue relating to freedom to travel is not the most controversial issue. We all accept that is a basic fundamental right that there is a difficulty with regard to information on abortion. The alarm bells rang for me when I read the White Paper on the Treaty which states that as regards the freedom to obtain and provide information, the member states declare that Ireland remains entitled by legislation to impose conditions on the exercise of this freedom, thus the right of the Oireachtas to subject the provision on information to conditions in the public interest is expressly recognised by member states. That worried me because it matched what the Tánaiste said last night when talking about the right to information.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that information cannot be alien to the values of his country. What on earth was he talking about? How can information be alien to the values of the country. We are talking about information which is facts, statistics, details. Are we looking towards another Irish solution to an Irish problem? Are we looking towards some kind of extraordinary legal gymnastics, under which we will only have information for women who are pregnant and are likely to commit suicide? Will that information only be handed over after a psychiatrist's certificate is produced and so on? I hope we will not go down that road and that women will not be subject to this kind of nonsense which will see entitlement to information being based on specific conditions laid down by the Supreme Court <Col N="1387" /> judgement. That would be nonsense, If the Government are considering such a convoluted provision it will lead to uproar and reaction from women's groups and any right thinking people.</P>

      <P>It is vital that information be made available. Those who talk to groups such as the Well Woman Centre or family planning clinics know how much they are hampered by not being able to give proper information to women who come to them. Withholding comprehensive information from women who seek counselling means that women who may be thinking of an abortion as an option will not seek advice. Not being able to approach skilled counsellors, who often dissuade women from going for abortions, means that women will be pushed towards unskilled people, to perhaps the father of the child who often puts considerable pressure on the woman to have an abortion, or to friends or workmates or other family members who might feel from a distance, that an abortion is right for the woman, and advise it. This is not right and it is a direct by-product of not having proper information available. As a gesture of the Government's goodwill and an indication that they understand what has happened since the Supreme Court judgement, and the injunction debate in the X case, will they consider withdrawing the injunction against family planning clinics about a year ago and allow information to be made freely available? Why not do that, stop this circus that is happening in Europe, indicate that we have gone beyond that and permit information to be made freely available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the main issue, which is the need to legislate on the abortion issue, there are many areas encompassed other than the expressed, apparent ones such as the case of ectopic pregnancies or cancer of the uterus. Therefore discussion is called for and indeed, some doctors have expressed concern to me that we need to examine this question much more <Col N="1388" /> broadly and engage in wide consultation on it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that this Bill seeks to amend the Constitution to deal with certain perceived consequences of the Supreme Court in the case of the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X and, therefore, is set in a context of domestic Irish law, which is, of course, the context within which these matters must be dealt. However, as we are in the period leading up to the Referendum on the Treaty on European Union, I want &mdash; under my that as Minister of State for European Affairs &mdash; to deal with certain European aspects of the matters at issue, that is, travel and information. In doing so, I will be largely reiterating points previously made by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself. But there are one or two new points I want to get firmly on the record.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I understand and can empathise with the strong concern, indignation and anger that many women would have felt about being, as it is sometimes put, locked up in their own country. But, as Deputy Howlin and his party appear to recognise, in their sponsorship of this Bill, these concerns do not stem from the Maastricht-Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Protocol does not take away rights to travel and information under European law which, of course, is applicable in Ireland. All member states, in the Solemn Declaration, have confirmed that this is the proper legal interpretation which the Protocol will have when the Treaty to which it is annexed comes into force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the force of the Solemn Declaration I would point out that the recent second and favourable Opinion of the European Court of Justice on the legality of the EEA agreement pivoted not on the Solemn Declaration but on a mere entry in the minutes. Thus the concern of some in the Labour Party about the Protocol making Irish women second-class citizens &mdash; which appears to relate to the rights to travel and information available under European law &mdash; is also misplaced. These rights are available now and will continue to be available after ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, even with the Protocol in its present form.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, the Protocol, even in its present form, does not take away rights to travel and information under European law. I have no doubt that recourse to the European Court of Justice very probably, even now, would vindicate the rights in any particular case, but it is through action in Ireland in regard to our Constitution and public policy that the availability of these rights can be directly and generally guaranteed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have indicated that this will be done in a further constitutional amendment next November. As Deputies will be aware, there is a <Col N="1390" /> Cabinet sub-committee working and making progress on this matter. I am sure the House collectively would wish them well in that work.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the Bill before the House. I sympathise with the intentions behind it and would not quarrel with the principle of what it seeks to achieve, quite the contrary. However, I strongly suggest to the Labour Party that our experience over the past decade has shown that issues of this type are best dealt with on the basis of all-party consensus. Indeed we have seen consensus within the term of this Government already. Here I might refer Members to the establishment of an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment and to our collective efforts to amend the Protocol. I might refer also to the measures of Dáil reform introduced and another committee established that Deputy Howlin, I and others had been seeking for some time, that is the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and, only this week, a Special Committee on the Finance Bill. Therefore I ask the Opposition to accept that there have been major improvements wrought in regard to Dáil reform in a spirit of consensus. I do not see why the same should not apply here. This being such a sensitive matter it must be addressed by Members across party lines in a considered manner, and it is within our capacity to do so. Indeed I would say that the electorate will not thank us if we do not respond collectively to this challenge.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach indicated in his response to Deputy Howlin's approach to the Bill, the best way to foster this is to wait until the Government are in a position to consult the other parties on proposals that will deal comprehensively with the issues. It is simply logical and common sense to deal comprehensively, at one time, with all the issues arising from the Supreme Court and not pursue merely partial solutions.</P>
    <P>The Government firmly believe that the logical course is to deal with all aspects together. As soon as the Cabinet sub-committee have completed their work and the Government concluded their deliberations, the Dáil, the parties <Col N="1391" /> and the public will be fully informed of their conclusions. I wish to reaffirm what the Taoiseach has said on this matter: if a wording can be made available before 18 June, that will be done. A Referendum will be held in November next, to deal with the travel and information issues which arise and with any other questions which, on completion of the Government's consideration of the issues raised by the Supreme Court decisions, emerge as necessary and are feasible to deal with by consitutional amendment: of course, it may be that any such issues will fall to be dealt with by legislation or by a combination of legislation and constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Protocol and of the Solemn Declaration, any such amendment would have to respect the rights to travel and information, as they exist under European law.</P>

      <P>We can be depended on to deal with the questions of travel and information on which the Government have been unequivocal since these issues first came before us. It needs to be reiterated that, in endeavouring to amend the Protocol and in formulating the Solemn Declaration, the Government's thinking and intentions are very clear in relation to travel and information. That point has to be made in order to make the position absolutely clear. I have known Deputy Howlin for some time. I respect his sincerity and bona fides in introducing this Private Members' Bill. In fact we soldiered together on many humanitarian issues in the past. I would ask him to reflect on the Tánaiste's contribution last evening, a sincere position put by him. I would support the Tánaiste's call that Deputy Howlin consider the option of withdrawing his Bill without prejudice to <Col N="1392" /> his right to move it at a later date. There are great benefits to be had from a cross-party approach, particularly on this issue. We should all avoid any step which would dissipate such benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party's Private Members' Bill is an indication that there is cross-party consensus in Dáil Éireann that every necessary step should be taken to ensure that the courts of this country never again become the venue for proceedings against any Irish woman seeking to deprive her of her rights as a citizen of Ireland, and as a citizen of Europe, to travel out of this country on the grounds that she may, or probably will have an abortion. Likewise there exists in this House a cross-party consensus that if Irish women can travel abroad for that purpose, there is no sound or logical basis for depriving them of access to non-directive counselling.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats' view is that every necessary constitutional and statutory change must be adopted to ensure that there are no more &ldquo;X&rdquo; cases, and to ensure that people in the position of the defendant in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case can avail of non-directive counselling. To that end the Government have decided that there will be a constitutional referendum this autumn to guarantee the right to travel and information. We in the Progressive Democrats make no secret of our view that the issues of Maastricht and abortion should never have been entwined. Ideally we would have preferred to deal with the travel and information rights before the people voted on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union on 18 June next so that there could be no doubts whatsoever concerning the effect of the Maastricht Protocol. However, the important point is that the Maastricht Protocol will not be legally effective until next January, whatever its meaning in the light of the Solemn Declaration, and that prior to that date the travel and information referendum will have been held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason alone the Progressive Democrats believe that people, especially women, concerned about the <Col N="1393" /> 18 June vote can vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to European Union knowing that the travel and information issue will be resolved before the Treaty comes into force on 1 January next. Moreover, the Progressive Democrats are of the view that the referendum on European Union must now be the singular focus of public attention, and every effort must be made to explain fully to the public the positive benefits of a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June next.</P>
    <P>We had argued publicly, and privately within Government, for the travel and information issue to be dealt with (a) separately from the Maastricht issues, and (b) before the Maastricht issues. We were in a minority in Government on that issue but, if opinion polls are to be believed, we belong to a vast majority of Irish people who believe that the Government's wording on the proposed travel and information referendum should be known to the electorate before 18 June.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats will, if necessary, indicate there position before 18 June by issuing a formal policy paper on the matter, including the wording appropriate to the issue for incorporation into our Constitution as Article 40.3.4º. However, we would prefer if the Government as a whole could clarify their position by that date instead.</P>
    <P>Members of this House may recently have received a communication from the Pro-Life Campaign, based in Dublin, but not signed by anyone, which sought to insinuate that the Progressive Democrats were preventing the Fianna Fáil Party from aligning themselves with the so-called Pro-Life Campaign in seeking a referendum to re-write the 1983 Amendment, following its interpretation by the Supreme Court in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case.</P>
    <P>The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in 1983, conferred equal rights to life on the unborn and on the mother. In relation to the equal right to life of the unborn, it declared that the State should &ldquo;by its laws&rdquo; defend and vindicate that right &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;. Clearly this inferred, and was acknowledged to be the case during the public debate surrounding the 1983 referendum, that there would be very exceptional <Col N="1394" /> circumstances where a conflict could arise between the right to life of the mother and her unborn, and that in those very limited circumstances, the right of the mother would have to prevail.</P>
    <P>That was the question which fell to be adjudicated on by the High Court, and subsequently the Supreme Court, in the recent &ldquo;X&rdquo; case. The Supreme Court judgments concluded that where there was &ldquo;a real and substantial risk&rdquo; to the life of the mother, then her rights had to be given priority.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats favour legislation as the means of resolving the situation now prevailing in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment, with a view to defining what would constitute &ldquo;a real and substantial risk&rdquo; to a mother and to decide who are the people who would evaluate those circumstances. We do not believe, on the basis of the expert opinion available to us, that a further amendment to the Constitution on this matter is feasible. We are not ruling out this possibility; we merely think it is a non-runner.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats could not accept a re-wording of the 1983 Amendment, Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, which would have the effect of ensuring that in all and every circumstance, and with no medical exceptions whatsoever, the right to life of the unborn would be paramount. We believe that this would be unacceptable to women in Ireland and that it would be wrong to have an absolute ban on any medical intervention to save the mother's life in circumstances where she faced &ldquo;a real and substantial risk&rdquo; to her life. Furthermore, it would appear that our viewpoint is shared by the vast majority of the Irish people, as reflected in the two recent opinion polls on Maastricht. There is no question of the Progressive Democrats standing between Fianna Fáil and their supporters' views on this matter. Their supporters are clearly part of the great majority of people who, along with the Progressive Democrats, do not want to lessen the rights of pregnant women.</P>
    <P>We accept the principle of this Bill. However, we are bound by a Government <Col N="1395" /> decision to a different order of things. We are convinced that the Irish people do not regard the order in which the referenda on European Union and on travel and information as an issue on which the Government should split and precipitate a general election. In these circumstances, we would ask the House to regard the votes cast this evening by our party as being confined to the issue of timing alone, and not the principle of the Bill, which we fully endorse. We believe that the priority now is to put the Maastricht referendum on European Union beyond dispute and to turn separately to resolving the legal implications of the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case in the autumn, including the travel and information referendum. That will enable the Members of this House to address the issue then with greater objectivity than would be possible in close proximity to the Maastricht referendum.</P>
    <P>In this way, the Progressive Democrats' duty to sustain good government in the interests of people, and our clear position on the travel and information issue will be reconciled. I thank the Labour Party for putting this matter before the House and giving me this opportunity to set out clearly the position of the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>While I may not have the luxury of engaging in a wider debate on these issues I intend to be very forthright in my remarks. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wealth of information before the House to indicate the position of the Government on the issues of travel and information &mdash; the Taoiseach has spoken at length in reply to parliamentary questions and the White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty, copies of which have been laid before the House, spells out on pages 13 to 17, 15 sub-paragraphs in all, the background to the Protocol to the Treaty, the implications of the Supreme Court's decision in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case and the effect of the Solemn <Col N="1396" /> Declaration which has been agreed by all the EC partners.</P>
    <P>The issues of travel and information were dealt with in the course of debate in the House on the Government's Bill to amend the Constitution to enable the State to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. In that debate it was claimed that the Government should amend their Bill to provide for the travel and information issues or, alternatively, support the Private Member's Bill now before the House. The clear message from the Government has been that a referendum on the right to travel and information, and any other issues which may be necessary to be dealt with as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case will be held in November next and that the complexity of the issues arising from the court's decision are such that the Government have decided to deal with all aspects together.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has indicated that the Government's opposition to the Bill is not based on any rejection in principle of what it seeks to achieve, rather the approach of the Government is, to address fully all the issues raised by the court's decision in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case in the most comprehensive way possible.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to introduce not only legislation to enable the Constitution to be amended to provide freedom of travel to and from the State and freedom to give and receive information, as may be regulated by law, about services lawfully available in other States, but also legislation to deal with issues arising from the interpretation by the Supreme Court of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution or legislation to enable Article 40.3.3º to be amended. The details of what might be included in the Government's proposals are being examined by a Government sub-committee.</P>
    <P>I am aware that these issues have been referred to in detail by previous speakers, but I wish to put my views on the record. I have already made my views on these issues very clear. Very early in this debate I spoke clearly and unequivocally about <Col N="1397" /> the right and need for women to receive information on abortion. I said this in the knowledge that there is something very wrong in either politicians or bureaucrats deciding to withhold information from anybody and that there is something particularly galling in either politicians or bureaucrats seeking to withhold information from women as if in some way women were not receptive to such information as they could not comprehend it or may be tainted in any way by it. That is utter nonsense. I remember clearly that Deputy Howlin agreed with my remarks in an article in a Sunday newspaper.</P>
    <P>I have also made it clear that Maastricht must be separated from all other issues. All parties agree that it is an issue of great importance to the country. It is also an issue on which we need to have a very widespread debate. We are about to enter into such a debate. The other issues &mdash; the right to travel, the right to full and comprehensive information on abortion and the Supreme Court decision &mdash; are inter-linked and bound up with one another. I notice Deputy Howlin did not dwell at length on the information issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Deputy said. While I am not saying there was no depth in his thinking, there was no great depth in what he said about the type of information which should be made available, how freely available it should be made and what it should contain. Perhaps the Deputy will elucidate further on these issues later. If so, I will listen as keenly as I listened to his contribution last night. It is obvious that those issues are inter-related. To seek to deal with one or two of them and to leave the main issue until later would distort the full picture of what we want to achieve through this debate. We wish we could all have the luxury of saying: &ldquo;We agree, but we must vote&rdquo;. That option is not open to us. I do not agree with the timing, as regards the two issues but I assure the women and men of the country &mdash; and there are men who are <Col N="1398" /> interested in this matter as well as women &mdash; that my voice, which has been very clear on this issue, will continue to be as clear and concise on it as the debate develops in the autumn.</P>
      <P>My mind is very clearly fixed on the issues, on what should be contained in them and what should be the final outcome, and I shall not be modest about making that known as the debate develops throughout the late summer and early autumn. It is then that we will need to arrive at a consensus because it is then that all the issues which appear to have quietened a little in regard to the European union debate will emerge in ever more strident form. It is then that women and men of courage and of clear sighted vision and logic, politicians as well as people outside the Dáil, will build upon what we have already said and done and will voice our views accordingly.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the question of information and counselling which will, no doubt, form the basis of considerable debate in the coming months. It is an issue which will require a great deal of consensus and I would hope that the debate will be reasoned and balanced. At present, of course, there is not a constitutional right to information about the availability of a service of abortion outside the State unless the information relates to an abortion of the kind covered by Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. The proposed referendum on information will inevitably bring about changes in our laws on information about abortion and this will have serious implications for those who operate in the area of counselling and information. It is they who will work under the new laws, and that is why their view will be of importance in coming to decisions on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Deputy Howlin's instincts are right and that he has put forward this Bill on the basis of those instincts. I do not agree with my colleague, Deputy Molloy, who seems to have a very deep faith in the polls and who quoted them frequently in his speech tonight. If we were to go by them we would be up today and down tomorrow, as would our <Col N="1399" /> tempers. I submit to Deputy Howlin that many people in this House share his viewpoint, but there should not be haste about this matter because we would find ourselves enacting a law which had been hastily put together without the necessary services being made available. As we debate this matter in the early autumn the full implications of what we are doing will become apparent and will be spoken about very freely by many people, including myself. At that stage the professional services and training necessary will be available. It is important that they are in place because we do not want a measure which will leave people traumatised and in difficult circumstances with which they cannot cope.</P>
    <P>The question of information and counselling in its widest context is being examined by the Government and I see the merit of taking all the issues together, including travel, information, counselling and the legal and medical aspects of Article 40.3.3º. Any other approach would not be comprehensive. It might lead to <i>ad hoc</i> measures, and that, I am afraid, could be the position following on this Bill. As I have said, the Bill has been brought forward without consideration of the wider issues and on the basis that the people should vote on travel and information and forget about what should be done about Article 40.3.3º and what legislation is required to deal with the implications of the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X. I hope the Labour Party will have a rethink on their approach and that there might be a basis for consensus when the Government are in a position to bring forward their proposals on all the elements, including travel and information.</P>

      <P>If another party wishes to share my time I will be happy to oblige. The Democratic Left support this Bill. We commend the Labour Party for bringing it before the House thus giving us the opportunity to address an issue which, to a significant extent, the Government, including the Progressive Democrats, despite the speech of Deputy Molloy tonight, have been reluctant to have debated before this House. The amendment to the Constitution proposed in the Bill would effectively ensure the right of Irish women to freedom of travel and to access to information regarding pregnancy termination services available in other EC countries. It is ludicrous to suggest that the Government have not been able, in the ten weeks since the Supreme Court judgment in the X case, to come up with their own formula of words on these two issues.</P>
      <P>If, despite all of the expertise available to them in the Attorney General's office, the Government could not have come up with a wording of their own they had the option of supporting this Bill, but they refuse to do so. There would have been no obligation on this House to process this Bill to its conclusion. It would have been possible to pass Second Stage of the Bill tonight and let it go to a committee of the House where it would be dealt with at the pleasure of the House. The Government have not offered any substantive criticism of the wording proposed in the Bill. All the Tánaiste could offer last night by way of excuse was to express the view that it would be better to deal with the issues of travel and information by all-party consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government did not show much concern for all-party consensus when they announced unilaterally that they were going ahead with the Maastricht referendum on 18 June in advance of the legislative and constitutional changes needed arising from the X case. The Government talk about all-party consensus but they have ignored the fact <Col N="1401" /> that the consensus among four of the five parties in this House &mdash; Fine Gael, Labour, Democratic Left and Progressive Democrats &mdash; representing the majority of Deputies, is that the wording for any proposed amendment from the Government to Article 40.3.3º should be available in advance of 18 June. The Government's plea for all-party consensus &mdash; Deputy O'Rourke re-echoed that appeal tonight &mdash; is simply a smoke-screen. The Government's strategy from early april when they announced that the Maastricht referendum would be held on 18 June was that the wording of any subsequent amendment would not be made available before then. I strongly suspect that the Government, or certainly the Fianna Fáil members of the Government, have a very good idea of what the wording will be, but they are refusing to disclose it to avoid the risk of further upsetting Senator Hanafin and his intolerant friends. For a clue to the Taoiseach's long term strategy we need look no further than to the Taoiseach's reference in his weekly briefing for political correspondents on Thursday last to a package of measures on the abortion controversy.</P>
    <P>I believe that what the Government are planning is a composite amendment to the Constitution which may provide some, probably restricted, right to freedom of travel and information but which would also attempt to overturn the decision of the Supreme Court that abortion is permissible within this country where there is a substantial risk to the life of the mother. Thus the Taoiseach would be able to say to the ultra-conservative element in his own party. &ldquo;Look, we have had to concede a little on the rights to travel and information, but in this amendment we are also closing the door for all time on any possibility of the introduction of abortion in any form in Ireland. You have to take it or leave it.&rdquo; Such an amendment would be a very serious development. It is difficult to see how any amendment to the Constitution aimed at overturning the Supreme Court decision would not tilt the balance in favour of the foetus and consequently <Col N="1402" /> create a totally unacceptable risk to the lives and health of mothers.</P>
    <P>An omnibus amendment to the Constitution along these lines would be dishonest and totally unfair to the electorate. It would, for instance, place in an impossible position those who want to see the right to freedom of travel and information unequivocally established but who support the decision of the Supreme Court. It would be equally unfair to those who want to see the Supreme Court decision overturned but who may in the generosity of their hearts want to grant the right to travel and information to women.</P>
    <P>If the promised referendum is to be conducted in a truly democratic manner then the electorate must be allowed to make separate decisions in regard to travel, information and any proposed substantive changes to Article 40.3.3º arising from the Supreme Court decision. Anything else would be a deplorable return to stroke politics on what everyone acknowledges is an extremely important issue for the vast majority of people.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for the political parties in the Dáil to look beyond the issues of travel and information and to face up to the issue of abortion itself. There have been a series of opinion polls which have indicated a remarkable shift in political opinion on abortion. Gone is the simplistic approach which was dominant in 1983 of &ldquo;No abortion ever, in any circumstances in Ireland&rdquo;. The MRBI poll published in <i>The Irish times</i> on Monday last indicated that 80 per cent of people believed that abortion should be allowed in certain circumstances in this country.</P>
    <P>People have learned a lot in the past nine years. They appreciate that issues can be a lot more complex than the simple way in which they are depicted by organisations like SPUC. The &ldquo;X&rdquo; case came as a great shock to many people. The fact that a young girl, already the victim of a despicable crime, could be subjected to further humiliation and degradation by our legal system caused widespread outrage.</P>
    <P>In fact the polls show that the positions <Col N="1403" /> of most of the political parties in the Dáil have not kept pace with changing opinion. There is now a climate for change, and politicians must face up to it. The position of the Democratic Left, as decided at our founding conference is that there should be a right to abortion in Ireland where the life or health of the mother is threatened. The other political parties should now get off the fence and state clearly what their positions are. We can no longer keep shipping this problem off to Britain; legislators must face up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Neither can abortion &mdash; or the right to travel and information &mdash; be considered in isolation from the broader problems facing women. Virtually every significant advance achieved by Irish women in the past 20 years had been forced on the Legislature either by the courts or by the EC. The right to serve on juries, the introduction of limited family planning facilities, and now freedom of travel and information on abortion have all come from court decisions. Equal treatment in social welfare, maternity leave and equal pay have all been introduced as a result of our obligations as members of the EC. There has been no coherent programme for the advancement of women put forward by any Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The significance of the original Protocol to the Maastricht Agreement, agreed in virtual secrecy last year, takes on a particular significance when considered against the background of the positive role the EC has played in advancing the rights of Irish women. The Protocol was clearly designed to prevent Irish women from seeking recourse to the European Court of Justice to establish their entitlement to equal rights as European citizens. That was the purpose of the Protocol, and that remains its effect, and the solemn declaration has no legal or constitutional impact on this position.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the points made by the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women, Frances Fitzgerald, at their recent conference and I particularly endorse the criticism of many of the male politicians who have been vocal in the <Col N="1404" /> past few weeks on the abortion issue but, have shown little concern for the other concerns of women's lives. These politicians are being very naive if they hope that the passage of a minimalist amendment to the Constitution and further restrictive legislation will allow this issue to disappear.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the 1983 referendum many crocodile tears were shed for the plight of single mothers and much emphasis was placed on the need to improve their position so that fewer might take the option of abortion. Yet ten years on a single mother is still asked to live on an income well below the level recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women &mdash; and, of course, she losses even this pittance if she does a day's work.</P>
    <P>We still have no national comprehensive family planning service. The Minister for Health is required under the 1979 Family Planning Act to provide a natural family planning service, but there is no obligation on him to provide any other type of family planning service. The result of this is that the health boards play little or no role in the provision of a service which is of such vital importance to women's health. A simple Bill to provide for the wider availability of condoms, published last August, still has not seen the light of day in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Proper legislative and constitutional changes arising from the Supreme Court decision would be a step forward, but it will not be the end of the process. What we need now is a more comprehensive programme of reform to deal with the medical, social and economic issues which arise directly from the unique biological function of women. This must include legislation specifying the circumstances in which abortion will be permissable; a comprehensive national family planning service; a wider programme of education on sex in our schools; a community-based childcare service; longer maternity leave and the introduction of paternity leave; and a reform of the social welfare system to provide an adequate independent income for all women not in paid employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> We also need to examine the possibility of a constitutional amendment which would remove ambiguities about the status of women and provide a clear and general prohibition on all forms of discrimination, direct or indirect, which are based on sex, marital status, sexual orientation or family circumstances.</P>
    <P>I thank the Labour Party for bringing this Bill before the House and for the opportunity to speak on it. I propose to share my time with Deputy Michael Higgins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa for giving me an opportunity to speak on this Bill. On behalf of the Labour Party I thank him for his generous response and support for our attempt to bring a little sanity into this whole issue of rights of women in relation to travel and information.</P>
      <P>Standing behind the discussion on this Bill, like some menancing ghost, is the whole issue of the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty. We have had many opportunities for a Government spokesperson to stand up and say who asked for the Protocol, who initiated it and what it was meant to achieve. The answer can be given technically outside the Dáil, to bring article 40.3.3º into the Treaty. Here is the issue that the public have in their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste last evening said we should wait for a package but we want to know whether it is the Government's intention to overturn the Supreme Court decision; to move beyond it or to establish once and for all clear rights in relation to options that are available to women in Europe as citizens of Europe. I had the opportunity of putting some of these questions to members of the Commission dealing with legal affairs. When I raised the question of the value of the Solemn Declaration, one of their most learned people said they can make a solemn declaration, but asked what was the public policy on these issues in Ireland. The Government run away all the time from expressing public policy on this matter. Our intelligence was insulted by a sentence in the speech of Deputy Tom Kitt, <Col N="1406" /> Minister of State, where he has the audacity to say:</P>
    <P>The Protocol does not take away rights to travel and information under European law which, of course, is applicable in Ireland.</P>
    <P>When I was on a television programme earlier this week, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, said he wanted to ensure that European law did not parachute into Ireland. I find it distasteful that so often when it comes to rights issues there seems to be a reluctance to accept the basic reality that women have as many rights as men and that there is nothing in their biological or gender makeup which should stop them having the right of every citizen in Europe. The reality, of course, is that in the Costello judgment the interaction of Irish rights and European law was commented on in such a way as to leave it an issue that travel rights did not exist in an absolute sense. It is very clear that the Supreme Court, while resolving some aspects of the decision in the X case, left other matters on which it did not comment. They know that in Europe and it is an insult to our intelligence to suggest, therefore, that the Protocol is not important.</P>
    <P>There is the suggestion that the matter will be fixed up before the Treaty comes into operation in January. I ask Irish women, and the Irish public, to make their own estimation of the extent to which they can trust the Government and Fianna Fáil in areas of social legislation. I remember the glib, side-of-the-mouth description of the 1979 legislation on family planning and contraception as, an Irish solution to an Irish problem. It was an evasive running away from a basic right and it was an insult to us and the public.</P>
    <P>As we move towards the beginning of a new century I find it extraordinary that a woman by being a woman capable of becoming pregnant has somehow disqualified herself from the information available through scientific advance, medicine and the caring sciences of psychology and so forth. The Government <Col N="1407" /> criticised the Labour Party for not saying more about information but why are the Government prosecuting through the courts those who would provide information, counselling services and would be of assistance to women? The truth of the matter is that the Government gave the game away on themselves by saying that in European law by way of final recourse, having exhausted the mechanisms of law available in this jurisdiction, one might find the right to travel vindicated in some sense. It is easy to give away that which will be taken from you in the final vindication but the Government are silent on the issue of information.</P>
    <P>This Bill stops short of making excessive demands. There are people who want to disentangle the Protocol from the Maastricht Treaty. Were these people, as yet unnamed and who came forward and asked for this form of words in the Protocol, told by the unnamed people who met them that they were putting £6 billion at risk, or were they told that this would be slipped in for them? If it is so important that we cannot talk about it lest we risk the major economic benefits of the Treaty, was it not important then?</P>
    <P>What I find offensive is the suggestion that one should have to balance economic benefits against fundamental rights. The Labour Party's Bill gave the Government the opportunity with the consensus of this House to take out of the realm of debate the issues of travel and information. Why do the Government not respond by saying they would vote for the Labour Party's Bill on Second Stage but discuss the detailed wording later? Instead they said that the timing was not right. Why is that the case? It is because there is a higher moral authority than this House, the Fianna Fáil Cabinet sub-committee. When people canvassed at the doors ask questions about the rights to travel and information I hope they will be enormously carried away when the canvassers say: &ldquo;that is being looked after by a Government sub-committee.&rdquo; We should know, and the public should <Col N="1408" /> know, what proposals the Government intend putting forward.</P>
    <P>I wish to express the greatest reservations about the speeches that have been made so far and the talk of a package. The dilemma is whether the Government will limit the issue of right to travel and to information in their package. Are the Government suggesting that our partners in Europe have solemnly declared they will seek to help us vindicate whatever we may like to ascribe to Article 40.3.3º? It is one thing for the Government to look for a blank cheque from the public but it is another thing for them to assume that our partners in Europe are that daft. The question being put to us again and again in Europe is, &ldquo;what is your public policy on this issue?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's Bill gives the Government the opportunity to say on the dimensions of travel and information that there is consensus in the Irish Parliament. This consensus is being squandered and the opportunity is being missed. It is always very sad that on issues like this, upon which the public have advanced their thinking in compassionate ways, we lose opportunities of legislating to catch the generosity and compassion of public opinion. It is very sad that we are left with such an unwholesome situation in that we cannot discuss a treaty that deals with monetary, economic and political union because, somehow or another, we have decided to put a limitation on the rights of women.</P>
    <P>Why were the people responsible for Article 40.3.3º in our Constitution and who went on to use their influence to have it included as Ireland's Protocol to the Treaty on European Union? If we check the 17 Protocols we can judge the interests diplomatically of the different members of the Community by the items mentioned in the different Protocols such as ownership of homes in Denmark and land in Holland but someone decided that what Ireland wanted by way of Protocol to the Treaty was Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that in this Chamber on 28 November when the Taosieach of <Col N="1409" /> the day stood up to make a major speech on Maastricht there was not one line in that speech dealing with a Protocol. What this Bill is about and what this Bill sought was simply to say: there will be legislation enabling a referendum to equal up rights of women in relation to travel and information. That is being deferred and instead of having a referendum soon that would result in these rights being provided they are asked to trust that it will be fixed up by Christmas. Who knows what will come out of the woodwork between now and December? If people accepted this offer of acting on trust, what would happen if this act was betrayed? There is an opportunity in our Bill to say, once and for all, &ldquo;We want you to know we will not betray your trust because we are going to vote this evening in favour of a referendum for travel and for information&rdquo;. That is what is being rejected. It is an extraordinary arrogance and it is asking Irish women to take a risk. I think Irish women have a right to be concerned.</P>
    <P>As another speaker said earlier, this is not what one would call a woman's issue, it is a democratic issue. It is not just women who are concerned, it is anybody who believes in the democratic rights in the fullness of citizenship and in the fullness of European citizenship. It is regrettable that this Bill is not being accepted in the spirit in which it is offered. It is unfair because of what it will do to the public debate on the other and other more substantive issues.</P>

      <P>The points made by Deputy Higgins help to underline in a very positive way the desirability of having the complex issues involved, and which are of paramount importance, the subject of the Government's considered view. We do not take issue with the principle involved. It is the view of the Government that as a sub-committee are at present dealing with this issue &mdash; with all the services of the State at their disposal and with a number of Ministers involved &mdash; it is desirable that their considered views be on the table before we take a decision on this Bill. That point was made clear not only by speakers tonight but also by a number of speakers last night.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me it would be very difficult to address all the issues raised in this debate. I wish to state clearly that I, as well as many others, commend Deputy Howlin for the time and effort he has put into preparing this Bill concerning travel and information. The Taoiseach and a number of Government Ministers have already pointed out that the complexities of the question involved are such that a Cabinet sub-committee is necessary to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The matters raised by the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case are complex and far-reaching. These issues are being fully examined at present. The Taoiseach indicated on a number of occasions in this House that he intends that the issues arising from the Supreme Court ruling in that case will require either a referendum or legislation or both. The Government have given a commitment in this area. Once the Cabinet sub-committee have completed their work then the Government will be in a position to decide on specific ways to proceed. At the moment our efforts are concentrated on elaborating on the implications for Ireland of the Treaty on European Union and the need for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should remind Deputies that soon to be included in the new editions of the Treaty is the Solemn Declaration agreed between Ireland and all the other member states of the European Community. This Solemn Declaration was negotiated with our European partners <Col N="1411" /> after it became clear that our partners were unwilling to hold an inter-governmental conference for the purpose of amending the Protocol to address the issues raised in the Supreme Court case.</P>
    <P>Our partners' unwillingness to hold another inter-governmental conference had nothing to do with their views on the substance of the issue of the right to life. Indeed, they were sympathetic to our concerns and willing to help us in every way possible. However, it became clear that either an amendment to the Treaty or the deletion of Protocol 17 of the Treaty would have involved a new inter-governmental conference and this they were not prepared to undertake.</P>
    <P>Any such inter-governmental conference would have led to demands in other member states for negotiations on other issues of concern to them. In the memorable words of one Foreign Minister, it would have opened up a &ldquo;Pandora's Box&rdquo;, and this they were not prepared to do. In the event, the Government proposed and won a Solemn Declaration which was agreed between Ireland and the other European States of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Solemn Declaration includes an undertaking by all member states that they will be favourably disposed to amending Protocol 17, if Ireland so requests, in order to extend its protection to any further constitutional amendment concerning Article 40.3.3º. The text of any such amendment of our Constitution would be for Ireland to decide in the context of the outcome of the considerations of the Cabinet sub-committee. The Solemn Declaration was formally adopted by all the member states of the Community on 2 May. It will form part of the documents sent by each member state to its Legislature in order to complete ratification procedures. The new edition of the Treaty on European Union, to be published shortly by the Council and the Commission of the European Communities, will include the text of the Solemn Declaration as adopted.</P>
    <P>There has been some questioning of the status of the Solemn Declaration and <Col N="1412" /> I would like to address these issues briefly. Firstly, the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which came into force in 1980, provides that in interpreting any Treaty any later agreement on the interpretation of that Treaty must be taken into account. The European Court of Justice has accepted the provisions of the Vienna Convention. Ireland also gives effect to its provisions and many of our partners are parties to this convention.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the text of the Solemn Declaration was examined by the legal services of our eleven partners in the European Community as well as the legal services of the Commission. As legal advisers to their respective governments the Solemn Declaration was analysed by these legal services. On the basis of the advice received no government had any difficulty in agreeing to the terms of the Solemn Declaration.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied they have done everything that can be done to allay the justifiable concerns which have arisen out of the Supreme Court judgment, prior to the referendum on the Treaty of European Union which will be held on 18 June. The Government are committed to addressing these issues with specific proposals for either a referendum or legislation or both, later in the year. The point was made by Deputy Higgins of the need to disentangle the vote on the Treaty from the other issues that have been raised. The Government's approach has been to endeavour to disentangle the right to life issue from the ratification of the Treaty on European Union. We need to approach both issues in a considered and dispassionate manner. The people will have the opportunity on 18 June to give what I expect to be a positive verdict on the Treaty; and at a later stage this year will be in a position to give their views on the important issues which have been raised by Deputy Howlin in this Bill. That is a sensible way to deal with this.</P>
    <P>We are all fully aware of the complications. There is a desire on the part of everybody here that the fullest consideration should be given first by the <Col N="1413" /> Cabinet subcommittee, the key people in this whole area, who will put proposals on the table. In the absence of those it would be unwise to proceed further with this legislation.</P>

      <P>If the Treaty on European Union had not occurred in this year the issues of abortion and the right to travel would still have to be dealt with as a result of the judgment given by the Supreme Court. It is most mischievous to try to entwine the abortion issue and the right to travel issue with the Treaty.</P>

The Government have stated clearly that they will not legislate piece-meal, that they will introduce a referendum on the right to travel which is a basic human right. God knows I have had enough petitions in this House signed by people about the right of other people in other parts of the world to travel to see it denied to the people of this country. That right will not be denied to the people of this country and the Government have stated that quite clearly.</P>

He has maintained all along that we must get the Treaty on European Union through first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When all those people talked about the abortion issue not one was able to come up with a form of words that would confer equal right to life as between the unborn child and the mother. That is the difficulty facing the Government and anybody else trying to define equality of right to life whether of the unborn or the mother. The superior right of the mother is recognised by most people. There are <Col N="1415" /> few who do not recognise that right. The only way equality can be conferred in such a situation is when both the mother and the unborn child die and nobody wants that. There is no form of words to confer equality where one must die and the other lives and everybody knows that. The only thing we can do is legislate and that will come about later.</P>
    <P>I can understand the enthusiasm to get on to something that is very popular with the people. Everybody in this House agrees on the right to travel.</P>

      <P>In the interest of remaining calm I will ignore the remarks made in the last five minutes. This House and the country are surrounded by a blanket of confusion in relation to the content of the European Treaty which is to be voted on by the electorate on 18 June. We in the Labour Party have applied ourselves to trying to lessen that confusion at the very least and trying to separate the issues that are tied up inextricably in the Maastricht Treaty. Unfortunately the Government response has not been particularly generous. Quite frankly I am not sure that the Government have taken the issues in this Bill as seriously as they should have been taken over the last number of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is customary in concluding on Private Members' Business to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate over the last number of days. However, there is only one thing that matters at this stage, and that is the vote that will take place here this evening. As I understand <Col N="1416" /> it of now, more than 30 members of this House will not be here this evening to vote; they have other things to do. I find that regrettable. Half of those Deputies are from the Government side and half from the Opposition. I find it extremely hard to understand how so many members can take their leave of this House and show their disinterest in an issue that the people of this country are talking about, are worried about and are confused about. I hope the absence of so many Members of this House during the discussion of such a serious issue will be noticed. Is it a reflection of how seriously these issues are being taken by Government and by Opposition?</P>

      <P>Many people inside and outside of this House have spoken in recent weeks looking for trust on one side and looking to establish how crucial this issue is, and yet they will not be here when it actually counts and we can do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Progressive Democrats has made a career of espousing liberal issues, at least verbally, and one of their Deputies has been on radio on many occasions in recent weeks congratulating herself for her courage in relation to women's issues. I have to ask yet again where is she this evening and what will she be doing when it comes to voting on an issue that she has given her total commitment to? I notice with interest that the heading on the press release of the contribution of the Minister for Energy this evening proudly heralds a &ldquo;call for travel and information referendum before June 18.&rdquo; I find that quite incredible and hard to take. I wonder if the Progressive Democrats are being serious. In a short contribution, sharing the time of the Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs, one of their Ministers agreed word for <Col N="1417" /> word with everything that has been said by the Labour Party and by Fine Gael speakers in this debate, Deputies Fennell and Shatter and with the contribution made by Deputy De Rossa, but at the last minute explained yet again that for various reasons they will not support the principles of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is a reflection on the way we conduct our democracy, but I can see no danger to the stability of Government in relation to supporting this Bill, and I am surprised that the Government party themselves could not accept the Bill in principle on Second Stage. The Taoiseach is on record as saying that he has no wish to preside over a police state and that he has no intention of ever bringing in legislation that would weaken the rights of women. Can it really be the case that the Taoiseach is going to lead his troops, men and women, through the division lobbies to vote down the principle which is up for discussion in the House?</P>
    <P>I do not think we should make any mistakes about what is being done here this evening. We have not asked the Government to hold a referendum on these issues immediately; we have not even said that the formula of words we have put forward is the only acceptable formula. All that we have asked is that the Government come clean now, when it matters, on the principles of the Bill which in fairness most Members of the house seem to accept.</P>
    <P>Last night in this debate Deputy Howlin, the spokesperson for the Labour Party presented to the House a careful, rigorous and detailed analysis of all the issues that have arisen since the Supreme Court decision in the X case. As far as I am concerned it was the most carefully argued presentation of these issues that I have heard in this House.</P>
    <P>He outlined all the options that are available, if we want to do two things: first, if we want to protect in law the rights of travel and information that Irish women are entitled to enjoy as European citizens and second, if we want to address the substantive issue arising from the X case, and the constitutional balance of <Col N="1418" /> rights that is involved, in such a way as to protect and preserve the rights of every woman in this country. I do not believe it is possible for anyone to argue that there is a different way of proceeding than the way outlined in this House last night by Deputy Howlin. I believe the injunction in our own Constitution that it is our solemn duty &ldquo;to promote the common good with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I also believe that if we are to take that injunction seriously, then we, as legislators, have to take our courage in our hands and face up to all the issues with compassion, justice and, most importantly, equality. For ten years we have had a clause in our Constitution which was put there because the people were persuaded that the Members of this House should not be trusted. If we needed any reason for not putting it there we should have established at that time that Members of this House could be trusted and not caved in when the first wave came in during election campaigns. The situation that we are now in, which threatens women and which also &mdash; we should be clear about this &mdash; threatens the unborn, arises directly from the insertion of that clause in the first place. That was a very serious mistake.</P>
    <P>The problem does not arise from Europe. Our problem is not that Europe wants to force abortion on Ireland. Our real problem now is that the Maastricht Protocol, standing alone, can prevent Europe from protecting Irish women. That is the reason in this House last night Deputy Howlin described the Maastricht Protocol as profoundly European and I agreed with him, but as and when this Bill is defeated those of us who believe in the potential of Europe will have to rely on the vague and bland promises of Fianna Fáil in regard to all these issues.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste last night had an excellent opportunity to provide the kind of assurances that we have been seeking Sadly, he failed to take that opportunity Instead he made it abundantly clear, by what he did not say as much as by what <Col N="1419" /> he said, that the Government had no real intention of clarifying their future intentions before 18 June and of clarifying them in such a way that there could be no fudge subsequently. Unfortunately, that still exists despite the attempt by the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs to say that some work is going on and it might be possible to do this. I find it hard to believe that the change has taken place overnight in that respect.</P>
    <P>What this means at the end of the day is that many Irish citizens &mdash; especially, though not exclusively, women &mdash; will find themselves in ballot boxes around the country on 18 June and they will have questions to answer before they cast their votes. These questions are fundamental: can we trust Fianna Fáil if we vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the Maastricht Treaty, and do we believe at the end of the day that they care as much about women's rights as they care about the potential financial benefits of the Maastricht Treaty for this country?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs in tonight's debate once again relied heavily on the so-called Solemn Declaration as his only form of assurance to the women whose rights he is charged with protecting and developing. I find naivety, innocence or a total lack of political determination in that attitude because he knows, as indeed does every Member of this House and people throughout this country with any degree of intelligence, that the Solemn Declaration has no legal force and cannot ever be used to over-rule an article or a Protocol of a treaty.</P>
    <P>I wish there was more honesty in relation to this matter as it has been lacking <i>in toto</i> in the debate on the Treaty. We should at least be honest with the people in relation to the options before them. Sadly, this seems to be the only serious analysis that we can expect. Quite frankly, I think it leaves many Members of this House with serious difficulties in that they are unable to put their hands on their hearts and tell the women of this <Col N="1420" /> country that they can trust Fianna Fáil on this serious issue.</P>
    <P>On a clear analysis of the Government's record on these and related issues, from family planning to social policy, it does not stand up to the critical test. While many things have been done by Fianna Fáil down through the years which indeed could be described as progressive, the Protocol was the first major flaw and we cannot escape from that. It was undemocratic and it had no mandate from either this House or the people of the country. Like the 1983 debate, it should never have happened or have been inserted by the previous Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Perhaps it would not have been inserted if they had consulted with this House and the views of this House had been made known prior to the signing of the original Treaty.</P>
    <P>The response of the Government to the crisis caused by the X case has been confused, muddled, weak and has lacked conviction from day one. That is quite evident, given the attempt by the Government to go in different directions in relation to consulting our European partners. They failed to grasp the issue and they have been in disarray from day one of the X case.</P>
    <P>In relation to the bona fides of the Fianna Fáil Party on these issues, there is one glaring example on the Order Paper of the House which has been there since early 1991 after a speech made by the former Taoiseach at the Ard Fheis which seemed to herald a new attitude on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party to social issues &mdash; he is gone and the attitude seems to have gone with him &mdash; and that is the amendment to the family planning Bill. I think we have had three Ministers for Health since that Bill was published and they do not have the ability, the conviction or the courage to bring that Bill before the House. Since the Fianna Fáil Party cannot bring before the House that simple measure, which is long overdue and which sadly has been neglected, to update family planning regulations, I wonder can they be trusted.</P>
    <P>They would have given some assurance <Col N="1421" /> to the people, in particular to the women of the country, if they had come before the House; accepted the principle of the Bill. They could have said that, as the Labour Party were not forcing the pace in relation to the completion of the Bill, that they had no problem with it; and that, given the democratic and considered manner it had been presented, they would take it in that spirit and would not oppose it on Second Stage. By so doing they would have given ample <Col N="1422" /> evidence to the people that Fianna Fáil can be trusted in relation to their proposals and promises for the autumn but there is a serious worry that they cannot be trusted. I am genuinely worried, despite the slight assurance given by the Taoiseach that he does not want to roll back the rights of mothers, that when the debate opens in the autumn Fianna Fáil will have their own hidden agenda on the subject.</P>

    <Title>Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned I was talking about voluntary housing bodies. I am glad that the Minister is devolving to local authorities his function in relation to the approval of voluntary housing bodies. That will give local authorities closer links with voluntary bodies from the beginning, a move that has positive implications for both local authorities and voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>In relation to the shared ownership proposal, it is right to emphasise that most people wish to own their own home. I welcome the measures contained in the Bill to facilitate people to become home owners.</P>
      <P>At the moment local authorities have approximately 96,000 individual houses, valued at more than £3 billion. More than £70 million is spent each year maintaining those houses. That is an immense allocation of resources and represents a commitment to provide for those in the community who are unable to provide themselves with permanent housing. That being said, there can be no doubt that there is a need for continued action in this area, arising particularly from the recent increase in the number needing housing assistance. This is a particular need that I am concerned about. It is a matter requiring deep consideration. We should be particularly conscious of the location of houses built in the various counties. That is the reason that earlier this week I highlighted the special housing needs of Dunboyne in south County Meath.</P>
      <P>The scheme for improvement works in lieu of rehousing is a good measure that will, it is hoped, make sure that people are not unnecessarily forced to seek rehousing. The scheme recognises that about 45 per cent of those who are approved for rehousing come from unfit, unsuitable or overcrowded accommodation. There is no doubt that many people in that position would prefer to remain in their own home and have their home renovated if the necessary funds were available. The proposal is a good one, not only for the applicant but also for the taxpayer. I hope it will be developed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the measures contained in sections 15 to 20, which give tenants in <Col N="1425" /> the private rental sector greater security. These measures will be welcomed by many people renting private accommodation. The specific provisions that relate to rent books, standards for rented houses and the registration of buildings are desirable.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I again totally reject the allegations made in the House earlier today by Deputy Farrelly. The Deputy does nothing for himself or his party by making such inaccurate allegations. I am sure he does nothing either to enhance his relationship with his party Leader, Deputy John Bruton, who hails from Dunboyne. As Chairman of Meath County Council, Deputy Farrelly should try to identify and recognise the special needs of the people of Dunboyne. Instead, he chose today to ignore their needs and their appeal for locating local authority houses in Dunboyne and to attack myself and other Fianna Fáil Deputies from County Meath. I completely refute his accusations of double standards. I put it to the Deputy that he has no standards and no record of achievement on behalf of the people he purports to represent. Deputy Farrelly attacked me and the other Fianna Fáil TDs from County Meath for highlighting issues of concern to our constituents which is what we have done this week. The issue raised concerned the location of housing in the county and the need to locate at least four of the 25 houses being built this year in the Dunboyne parish. The Deputy's inaccurate statements in the House in relation to the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; do nothing for him or his constituents. Again I refute and reject those statements on behalf of myself and my colleagues.</P>
    <P>As a final remark, I should like to reiterate my belief that the Bill and the plan for social housing are imaginative and flexible. The Minister is doing a good job in trying to identify the other areas that can be developed to encourage and to assist people on the housing lists. In view of the financial constraints which face this Government and will face other Governments, the plan for social housing and the legislation before us is good. I <Col N="1426" /> hope the Department and the local authorities will work actively to encourage participation in the schemes set out in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refrain from entering the discussion between the two Meath Deputies about whatever misunderstanding has arisen between them. I can understand how those things can happen. I am sure the Deputies will resolve their differences.</P>
      <P>I listended with interest to Deputy Callely. He started off promisingly and I thought I would hear a good contribution. Perhaps the Deputy thought it was his duty to castigate Opposition speakers for what he called their negative contributions, for putting on the record the housing crisis as they saw it. It was a pity he went down that road because otherwise he would have made a good contribution. Having praised the Bill and the Minister, the Deputy then told the Minister and his officials what he thought was wrong with the Bill and what could be put right. He drifted into the same trap that we on this side of the House are inclined to drift into.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to anticipate the Deputy and tell Deputy McCormack that I am quite sure he will not drift into that net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not. In reply to Deputy Callely, I would say that money has not been spent in the west on protecting empty houses. The Deputy referred to money being spent in the mideighties in Dublin to protect empty houses. We had no such luxury in the west. The only empty houses in the west were as a result of families being forced to emigrate due to the policies of this Government and to unemployment. Deputy Callely took great pleasure in quoting the first paragraph in the introduction to the Plan for Social Housing where it states that the Government are committed to pursuing housing policies with the broad objective of ensuring that every household has a dwelling suitable to its needs, located in an acceptable <Col N="1427" /> environment, and at a price or rent it can afford. That is a beautiful aspiration, but it is only an aspiration. People dealing with the housing crisis have painted an entirley different picture. That might be the objective of the Government and of the Plan for Social Housing but the Minister and the Government will have to be honest and say that that is only an objective without any possibility of being realised. That is a most misleading opening paragraph to the plan.</P>
      <P>There are some laudable objectives in the Bill and perhaps there will be some benefit from some of its aspects, but it will not solve the housing crisis. Lack of capital is causing the crisis. In the meantime, the housing lists are getting longer and existing housing stock is losing value. While people are waiting for houses they are being forced to live in unsuitable accommodation. It is having a devastating effect on families. It is leading to social problems, to family breakdown and to marriage breakdown. This is too high a price to pay for the lack of finance for the housing programme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callely appealed to Opposition spokespeople not to refer to the capital allocation for housing. Perhaps he is embarrassed by having the figures put on record. However, the kernel of the problem revolves around the capital allocation for housing. To get this into perspective, the entire capital allocation for housing in 1991 was £43 million and in 1992 it was reduced to £41 million. That might sound like a big figure but to get it into further perspective we have to go back in history, despite Deputy Callely's appeal. Deputy Wallace challenged Deputy Callely and I will take up the challenge to illustrate what we did about housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1992 the housing capital allocation was £41 million whereas in 1984 there was a capital allocation of £206.558 million for housing. In case Deputies think I am picking a particularly good year, in 1985 the capital allocation was £197,670,000 for housing. This was when my party were part of the Government. <Col N="1428" /> That is the stark reality. I am a member of two local authorities in County Galway and to bring it further into perspective I will give the capital allocation for housing now compared to what it was when we were building houses and dealing with the housing waiting lists. For example, in 1983 in the Galway Borough area we received £3.5 million for the provision of houses from the then Government and we built 85 houses. Again under the then Coalition Government in 1984 we received a capital allocation of £4.32 million and built 122 houses. I am talking about Galway city alone. In 1985 we received a capital allocation of £2.6 million and built 72 houses. In 1986 our capital allocation was £2.13 million and we built 68 houses. In 1987, when the previous Fianna Fáil Government were in office, we received the miserly sum of £210,000 and we built no houses. In 1989 we received £750,000, comprised mainly of a grant solely for the provision of halting sites for itinerants in our city. That will give the House an idea of the housing situation that prevailed in Galway city previously compared with the present day.</P>
    <P>The position is no better in the county area. For example, in Galway County Council area we received £4.5 million in 1986, and provided 219 houses &mdash; valuable housing schemes for all the rural towns of County Galway, such as Oughterard, Headford, Clifden, Athenry, Gort, Loughrea, Clarinbridge, Craughwell, to retain people in those rural areas. That was the correct policy for the then Government to pursue. I was proud to be a member of the party whose Government provided the necessary finance for the provision of houses for people on the housing waiting lists. I am not ashamed to put those facts on the record as a true and accurate account of what occurred in housing when my party were in Government compared with what is now happening.</P>
    <P>On Monday last I attended a special meeting of Galway County Council devoted entirely to the housing position overall within the county. Having received our allocation for this year and <Col N="1429" /> made provision for hard stands, for the completion of a few houses in course of construction last year and for the preparation of some sites, we had a net sum of £446,000 remaining for the building of new houses within the county this year which would build approximately ten houses. Now we have in excess of 400 people on the housing waiting lists in County Galway, people in dire need and who have no possibility of building houses for themselves. I heard Deputy Rabbitte say that Dublin County Council had received an allocation for 72 houses they were unable to build, that the Minister was able to inform them, on a deputation, that they had not succeeded in spending all of that allocation. That is not the case in County Galway nor indeed in Galway city. In County Galway land has been acquired and housing schemes have been prepared for all of the towns and villages throughout the county. In excess of 120 people have been sanctioned for once-off rural dwellings to be built on their own sites, which have already been transferred to the local authority, who may or may not succeed in building those dwellings. Galway County Council have so far given the go-ahead for the building of five rural dwellings, that is five from a long list of people who have had their sites transferred to Galway County Council for the past five or six years, all legal aspects and so on being in order. Yet Galway County Council simply await the requisite finance to build houses for those people in dire need of them.</P>
    <P>In the case of Galway city we have received an allocation of sufficient money to build approximately 22 houses this year. At present there are 22 houses being completed, the first to be built and completed by Galway Corporation over the past three years. The only other scheme built about three years ago was the valuable in-fill scheme for old people in Whitehall, in a designated area, thus bringing people back to live in the viable inner city area. It is a showpiece comprising <Col N="1430" /> approximately 16 one and two-bedroom apartment-type houses. I would invite anybody visiting Galway to view that scheme, to see how those people have been reintegrated into the city centre. Those were the only houses built over the past three and a half years by the previous Fianna Fáil Government and indeed under the present Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>People I meet in the street or who come to my clinics often ask &mdash; and I feel it my duty to put this question on their behalf as their public representative: how is it that in Galway west, where there are two full Cabinet Ministers and previously a Minister of State, we are unable to obtain a better allocation of houses? Those two Ministers sit around the Cabinet table, one representing the larger party in Government, the other representing what they like to be called, the powerful party in Government. Why are they unable to obtain a better allocation of money for the provision of houses for the people of Galway city? In fact both Ministers were members of Galway Corporation. I had a hard task convincing them to resign their membership and leave it to ordinary members but one continued as a junior Minister and the other as a full Minister for a number of years. Since the last local elections they no longer serve on the local authority. I am sure they receive the same message I do at clinics about the dire need for houses in Galway city.</P>
    <P>As bad as is the position in the county it is more acute in the city. There are now several families living in one local authority house, causing great social problems. Housing conditions in rural areas, in some cases, may be even worse, with no sanitary services and so on. But, within Galway city urban area, there are in excess of 400 families, representing approximately 1,600 or 1,700 people on the waiting lists in dire need of housing. The first houses to have been built in the past three and a half to four years are now being completed in Castle Park. <Col N="1431" /> Always at the weekend when I return home there are people waiting to see me to inquire what is the possibility of their receiving a house. I know in my heart and soul that 90 per cent of the people who come to me, and I assume to every other public representative, have not even a possibility of being given a house, and that they must continue to suffer on in their present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could transmit, through the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace some advice to the Minister about this Bill, its provisions and housing in general. I predict people will not avail of all of the fancy, complex schemes proposed under the provisions of this Bill or in the plan for social housing and any other documents since produced. The Department have made every effort to explain the options, housing choices and so on with very good literature and documentation but I do not think they will be taken up. The reason is that they are not practical schemes and are regarded by 95 per cent of the people on waiting lists as such. These schemes will not take people off the housing waiting lists and provide them with proper accommodation. Neither will they achieve the objectives set out in the document, &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;, to ensure that every household has a dwelling suitable to its needs, located in an acceptable environment, at a price or rent it can afford.</P>
    <P>My advice to the Minister, his officials and the Government is that they should concentrate on two schemes. First, they should reintroduce the fixed interest loan scheme which was operated by local authorities. That scheme was abolished by a previous Fianna Fáil Government. People who wanted to build or buy their own houses were not afraid to look for a loan as they knew that the interest rate would be fixed at, say, 10 per cent. These loans enabled people to build or buy their own houses, the biggest financial commitment entered into by most people. The reintroduction of this scheme would <Col N="1432" /> encourage people to again build or buy their own houses.</P>
    <P>Second, a grant of £6,000 should be given to first-time buyers or builders of new houses. People who buy or build new houses are starting off in life and they do not have the necessary finance or the ability to raise money. A grant of £6,000 &mdash; I picked that figure at random &mdash; would encourage many people to build or buy their own houses. The reason there are so many people on housing waiting lists is that people who only five or six years ago would have been able to buy or build their own houses are not in a position to do so as they are not getting any help or encouragement.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years Galway local authorities acquired much serviced land for housing schemes. They drew up plans and submitted them to the Department. Those plans would meet with their housing requirements for the next ten or 12 years. I compliment the officials in Galway Corporation and Galway County Council for having their affairs in order and if the necessary finance was made available they would be able to start building the houses immediately.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a housing scheme built at Castlepark in Galway city in the mid-eighties. Castlepark is on top of the hill at the back of the Corrib Great Southern Hotel. It would do anyone good to look at this housing scheme and I invite the Minister to visit it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be glad to know I have seen the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad. The view from Castlepark is one of the most magnificent in Galway city &mdash; it overlooks Galway Bay and the Clare hills. Between 1984 and 1986, 334 houses were built in this area. People were delighted to get a house there. At the same time money was being allocated for houses and the number of people on the housing waiting list was reduced to single figures. Fifteen or 20 years ago 20 houses were built <Col N="1433" /> in Hillside park, which is adjacent to Castlepark. That scheme should have worked. Galway Corporation have a good record in the provision of facilities for travelling people &mdash; they built 22 houses in Hillside Park, have housed more than 100 travelling families and built four hard stands in the city and one on the outskirts. When the concept of the Hillside Park village was first mooted a guarantee was given that the travelling people living there would not be allowed to keep horses, dogs or caravans there.</P>
      <P>Section 10 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where, without lawful authority, a person erects, places, occupies or otherwise retains a temporary dwelling in a public place within a distance of two miles from any site provided, managed or controlled by a housing authority under section 13 of the Act of 1988 and the temporary dwelling could, in the opinion of the authority, appropriately be accommodated on that site, the authority may serve a notice on the person requiring him, within a specific period, to remove the said dwelling to the said site.</P>
      <P>While I welcome this provision I should like the Minister to say what will happen if all the hard stand sites are filled. There are about 85 &mdash; I counted them last week &mdash; illegally parked caravans in the Castlepark-Hillside Park area.</P>
      <P>The Minister should visit the area to see the shanty-type town which has grown up there. The itinerants living there have moved from other local authority areas. Those authorities did not play their part in providing hard stands or accommodation for travellers in their areas. The Minister should look at the provision of facilities for travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These itinerants have brought their horses and goats with them and have allowed them wander freely in the area. They are as much trouble to the settled travellers in the Hillside area as they are to the other residents of the area. These animals are allowed to wander all over <Col N="1434" /> the place, destroying what was the most outstanding local authority housing scheme, certainly the most outstanding scenic site that I have seen. That is just one example of what is happening in the Castlepark area where the houses are not yet ten years old. People are losing all confidence in the local authority to solve their problem in that horses are terrorising children, interfering with gardens and goats are jumping over walls.</P>
    <P>At the back of the Corrib Great Southern Hotel is situated St. John Paul's school which caters for the needs of the mentally handicapped of the area. Very extensive landscaping was carried out in that area, but it has been almost completely destroyed by horses and goats. I was responsible for getting from the NBA, who designed the scheme of houses, £1,000 for the planting of hardwood trees. These trees were planted in a circular area and, if allowed develop, would have created a beautiful amenity. The whole area was fenced in, but it is now completely destroyed. I might as well have got a cheque for £1,000 from the NBA and thrown it ceremoniously into Galway harbour. I would have achieved more by doing so because the general public, seeing what is allowed to happen are losing all confidence in the authorities.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment last week and the Minister for Justice replied by saying that he recognised my concern about wandering horses in the Castlepark area but that the position was under control. The position is no more under control than I am in control of what the Minister has said. The horses are still wandering in that area. Three weeks ago the corporation brought a number of horses to the pound in Portlaoise but mysteriously that night they were illegally released and were back on the streets of Castlepark the next evening.</P>
    <P>I am alluding to that matter from the point of view of the wastage of the <Col N="1435" /> resources that have been put into housing in Galway and other areas. Some people in the area bought houses under the tenant purchase scheme. The Minister should consider reintroducing that scheme which presented an ideal opportunity for tenants of local authority houses to acquire their own property. In the Castlepark area there are now &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; signs on a number of houses. People who were breaking their necks to get into Castlepark and who were delighted to have been allocated houses there at the time, are now breaking their necks to get out of the area. The community there was a first-class community which, on its own initiative, built a community centre &mdash; Ballybane community centre &mdash; a worthwhile facility that does not exist in my own area of Renmore. At the entrance to the community centre caravans are now parked and neither children nor adults can go there in safety. The whole spirit of the community has been destroyed by inaction, or apparent inability by the local authority to do anything about the matter. The local authority tell me that they bring horses to the pound, but to take a horse legally out of the pound costs only £18. Therefore, these people have no problem getting their horses back.</P>
    <P>At present, shanty-type sheds are being erected in the area. I would draw this to the attention of Galway Corporation: if I erected in my back garden a shed which did not comply with planning regulations, I would be rightly asked by the planning office to either apply for retention or to remove the shed. Yet within 150 yards of the Corrib Great Southern Hotel &mdash; the refurbishment of which cost £6.5 million &mdash; a hotel that attracts international conferences, which are very welcome, these buildings are being erected without restriction. This is destroying the spirit of the people in this corporation housing estate.</P>
    <P>When those houses were built they were very good value for money because <Col N="1436" /> a social problem was solved. However, a greater social problem is now being created and I do not know what can be done about it. Galway Corporation meet on a regular basis with a view to solving the problem. I attended a meeting recently in Hillside Park at which the settled travelling community were present. These people are as concerned about this problem as are the people of Castlepark and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Throughout Galway city, well-run, well-kept hard-stands have been built, three of which are in my electoral area. These hard-stands provide suitable accommodation for travellers who are waiting to move into houses. Many of these travellers who come to visit me at my clinic and in my home are first-class people who are on the housing waiting list but have no possibility of getting a house unless finance is provided. By not providing the necessary finance we are defeating the purpose we set out to achieve ten or 12 years ago, when we provided hard-stands for travelling people.</P>
    <P>We are not getting value for the millions of pounds allocated to Galway Corporation &mdash; £4.5 million in one year and £3.5 million in another year &mdash; for the building of houses in areas such as Castlepark because law and order has been allowed to break down there. People are losing all respect for authority and for the corporation. They are losing the pride they had in maintaining their area and their houses and in building up a viable, worthwhile community. All the useful work which improved the standards of the lives of those people is now being undone because of the apparent neglect of the area by the authorities. I hope the Minister will be able to spell out clearly how section 10 of the Bill can be implemented. It is only a pious aspiration, not worth the paper it is written on. One cannot move caravans unless there is a vacant position on a hard site.</P>

      <P>Ó fógraíodh Dé Luain seo caite ag Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais go bhfuil siad ag moladh don Aire an stáisiún ginte leictreachais i nGaoth Dobhair a dhúnadh, tá míshásamh mór ar fud an cheantair Ghaeltachta seo agus tá imní mór ar mhuintir an cheantair, má théann an bord ar aghaidh leis an phlean seo a chur i bhfeidhm go ndéanfaidh sé an-dochar do chúrsaí eacnamaíochta agus fostaíochta ansin. Ó bunaíodh an stáisiún sna caogaidí tá sé faoi lánseol go dtí an lá atá inniu ann agus d'éirigh leis obair, fostaíocht agus teacht isteach a chur ar fáil, ní amháin do na daoine a bhí ag obair sa stáisiún féin &mdash; agus tá 25 duine ag obair go lánaimseartha i láthair na huaire &mdash; ach freisin do na céadta teaghlach a bhaineann móin gach bliain agus a chuireann isteach go dtí an stáisiún é.</P>
      <P>In ainneoin na drochaimsire a bhí againn le cúpla bliain anuas d'éirigh leo 1,100 tonna a chur isteach sa stáisiún anuraidh. Anois nuair atá cúrsaí fostaíochta chomh holc sin &mdash; tá 150 post caillte sa cheantar sin le cúpla mí anuas sa mhonarcha ansin agus tá cúlú mór ar chúrsaí fostaíochta &mdash; sílim go mbeidh níos mó daoine sna blianta atá amach romhainn gan obair agus go mbeidh níos mó daoine ann le móin a bhaint agus a shábháil agus a chur isteach go dtí an stáisiún. Is fiú beagnach £1 mhilliún sa bhliain an stáisiún don cheantar Gaeltachta seo agus má dhúntar é agus má chuirtear an plean i bhfeidhm, déanfaidh sé dochar mór, cuirfidh sé leis an dífhostaíocht agus leis an imirce, agus is olc an rud é sin tarlú i gceantar Ghaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Nuair a chuimhníonn duine go bhfuil tionscal traidisiúnta cosúil le hiascareacht ag dul in olcas ó bhliain go blian, sílimse go bhfuil sé níos tábhachtaí ná riamh go gcoinneofaí an stáisiún sin ar oscailt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shock announcement by the ESB on Monday that they are recommending <Col N="1438" /> the closure of their turf generating station in Gweedore has caused widespread regret and disappointment throughout that parish in the Donegal Gaeltacht. If the proposal is implemented it will inflict severe economic hardship on an area already hard hit by high unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the station provides an income in the region of about £1 million per annum to the 25 permanent full-time employees there and to the 150 to 160 families engaged in the cutting, saving and provision of the turf. This is an industry completely and wholly based on an indigenous and plentiful raw material. Every unit of electricity generated there does not add a single penny to our import bill.</P>
    <P>The ESB have been propagating the rumour that the Gweedore station is costing £1 million per annum to the electricity consumer. I reject this estimate and even if it were true it merely represents 0.1 of 1 per cent of the overall turnover of the board which is in the region of about £1 billion per annum &mdash; a mere drop in the ocean.</P>
    <P>The proposal to close the station contradicts and dishonours all undertakings and pledges given by the ESB these last number of years &mdash; to keep the station operational as long as the local contractors and families continue to provide a supply of turf.</P>
    <P>When one considers that about 150 industrial jobs have already been lost in this Gaeltacht region during the past few months and that traditional industries such as fishing are in decline the closure of the station would be a further devastating blow that would most certainly lead to higher unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister and the Government to have this proposal rejected. It is nothing more than a book-keeping exercise without any consideration of what its implementation would inflict on a poor and remote area in the Donegal Gaeltacht. I know the <Col N="1439" /> Minister represents a Gaeltacht area and would have an understanding of the devastation that such a decision would cause at this time of unemployment and economic difficulties there. I personally appeal to him to reject this proposal and to allow the station to continue. It has been renovated and hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent on renovating it. Parts have been brought from various other areas and the station is almost as good as new. I cannot see why it should not continue for another ten or 20 years.</P>

      <P>Is inniu díreach a fuarthas i mo Roinnse an moladh ó Bhord Soláthair an Leictreachais go ndúnfaí stáisiún ginte leictreachais Ghaoth Dobhair agus, dá bhrí sin, ní raibh dóthain ama agam an moladh sin a scrúdú go mion fós. Ba mhaith liom a rá ag an bpointe seo go raibh an tAire Stáit, Pat the Cope Gallagher, ag labhairt liom faoi seo cúpla uair roimhe seo agus freisin Ivan McPhilips, thar cheann Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre. Bhí stáisiún Ghaoth Dobhair ar cheann de cheithre stáisiún a tógadh go deireanach sna caogaidí chun móin bhreise a bhí á cur ar fáil go háitiúil a dhó. Tá dhá cheann de na stáisiúin seo dúnta. Le roinnt blianta anuas tá an soláthar móna do stáisiún Ghaoth Dobhair imithe síos go mór i dtéarmaí náisiúnta. Tá de thoradh ar sin go mbíonn an stáisiún ag feidhmiú ar feadh níos lú ná trí mhí sa bhliain agus tá an dualgas sóisialta a bhí á chomhlíonadh aige laghdaithe go mór dá bharr.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin tá na costais a bhaineann leis an stáisiún méadaithe go mór. De réir Bhord Soláthair an Leictreachais, cosnaíonn sé 16.9 pingin aonad leictreachais a ghiniúint i nGaoth Dobhair. Is é 6.3 pingin meánchostas aonad leictreachais don úsáidire agus, mar sin, tá breis-chostas thart ar £1 mhilliún in aghaidh na bliana á íoc ag úsáidirí leictreachais. Sin é an scéal, an chaoi a bhfuil sé curtha os mo chomhair ag Bord Soláthair <Col N="1440" /> an Leictreachais agus is ar an mbonn sin atá an bord ag moladh go ndúnfaí é. Caithfear féachaint ar an gceist seo go cúramach, ar ndóigh, toisc go mbeadh impleachtaí ann ó thaobh phoist na n-oibrithe sa stáisiún agus ó thaobh na gconraitheoirí móna áitiúla. Caithfear a thuiscint, mar sin féin, nuair a tógadh an stáisiún ginte i nGaoth Dobhair i 1958 go raibh sé i gceist go mairfeadh sé 25 bliana ar a mhéid. Tá sé tar éis feidhmiú ar feadh cuid mhaith níos faide ná sin cheana féin. Ciallaíonn an feabhas atá tagtha ar an teicneolaíocht go bhfuil na stáisiúin ginte nua níos éifeachtaí agus cuireann sé seo leis an bhrú eacnamaíochta na seanstáisiúin a dhúnadh.</P>
    <P>Má tá aon leigheas ar an scéal seo beidh mé sásta é a mheas go cúramach. Go dtí seo níl mórán dóchais agam ón méid atá curtha os mo chomhair, ach beidh mé sásta mionscrúdú a dhéanamh ar aon mholadh faoi seo a chuirtear faoi mo bhráid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to have the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment. It is quite a simple matter to which the Minister may perhaps respond positively.</P>
      <P>As the Minister well knows there has been a great deal of rationalisation of the school transport system down through the years. Obviously some problems have arisen. However, I believe the problem I am referring to can be solved but it requires some flexibility on the part of the Department of Education. There are no inhibitions as to the Department taking action in this regard. In the case in question 14 children will be affected from September 1992 but this gives the Department time to put in place a plan for school transport to Ardfert national school in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the children in question have to walk a distance of up to one mile to meet the connection but I suggest that they could be picked up at Ballyrobert <Col N="1441" /> Cross where there is a turntable. This will not inconvenience the school transport system in the country and certainly those responsible for the service at local level would have no difficulty in complying with departmental approval should it be granted.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise to the Minister of State that the present system causes difficulty and inconvenience both to parents and children, especially in adverse weather conditions. The request I make to extend the transport system is of absolutely minor consequence to the transport system itself and I believe the time available between now and September should be used so that the system may be put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally) Brendan Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Spring for his contribution to this debate. At the outset I would like to say that the Department of Education have a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 165,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout the country. They also have the responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service, approximately £36 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for primary school transport is determined by reference to the nearest school. It is not organised on a parish basis. In order to be eligible for free school transport children under ten years of age must live at least two miles from their nearest school while older children must live at least three miles from that school. If the nearest school is a closed school, children living in the closed school area are eligible for free transport to the school of amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bus Éireann, the agent for the Department administer the primary school transport scheme on the ground. That company assess the eligibility of all primary children seeking school transport <Col N="1442" /> and determine eligibility and routes in accordance with the terms of the primary school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>The school transport scheme was established to provide a basic level of service for children living long distances from their appropriate school. It was never intended that all children would have door to door services as the cost of such a service would add substantially to the current cost of the transport schemes. In the organisation of transport routes by Bus Éireann, some children fortuitously have a home pick-up by virtue of living adjacent to the route of service. This can change from year to year as the routes of service are constantly reviewed by Bus Éireann due to changes in numbers offering for transport, base of the driver-contractor, workload of the vehicle involved and road conditions. Bus Éireann also ensure that vehicles do not encroach into other school areas as to do so could distort enrolments and affect the viability of the appropriate school, or result in the loss of a teacher in that school. In the organisation of services at primary level, Bus Éireann endeavour to ensure, where possible, that no eligible pupil will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to the nearest pick-up point on the service to their appropriate school. It is the responsibility of parents to get their children to the pick-up point on the route of service.</P>
    <P>In this particular case the Department have ascertained that there are approximately 13 children from the Sackville area seeking improved transport facilities to Ardfert national school. Ballyrobert Cross is situated in the Ardrahan closed school area and children from that area are eligible for free transport to Killahan, the school of amalgamation. I understand that a service to Killahan national school passes within 0.2 miles of a number of the families who are eligible for free transport to that school. The majority of the remaining children live less than 2 miles from their nearest school, Ardfert, and only qualified for fare-paying facilities to that school. Fare-paying transport <Col N="1443" /> is allowed on condition that spare accommodation is available on the service after all fully eligible children have been accommodated and provided that no additional State cost is involved.</P>
    <P>The service to Ardfert national school is 0.8 miles maximum from these children. In fact the majority of these children live less than 0.8 miles from the service to Ardfert. This is considered to be an excellent standard of service in the context of the general operation of the primary school transport scheme. The Department do not extend services for eligible children who live similar distances from their appropriate school. To consider making an exception in this case could not be considered in view of the fact that the children currently enjoy an excellent standard of service and children in similar circumstances throughout the country would seek similar improvements. I would also like to add that the Deputy's request involves an encroachment into another school area and this could not be considered as it would be contrary to the terms of the school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the existing arrangement is the most which the Department can offer in this case.</P>

      <P>The postal dispute has escalated as a result of the suspension yesterday of a further 600 staff. With the news that the talks have broken down, we are discussing a matter of serious national concern. There are now 1,300 staff off the pay-roll and with the deafening silence of both the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications and the <Col N="1444" /> Department of Labour I want to ask if anyone is serious about settling this dispute.</P>
      <P>If somebody does not do something quickly the country will be faced with an all-out strike. Having spoken to both parties to the dispute I was delighted to learn there is a real and definite desire on both sides to have it settled. What they need is an input from either the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications or the Minister for Labour to help them bring the talks to a successful conclusion. My fear was that if both Ministers continued to sit on the ditch the talks would crumble, making it impossible to retrieve the progress already made. This has happened.</P>
      <P>We have a responsibility to the people who are suffering immense inconvenience as a result of the postal dispute. Not everybody has a fax or can afford to use the services of a courier. Many recipients of social welfare payments are in extreme distress and are facing poverty. Businesses are also losing out. In general it is destroying the economy. In short, the Ministers must realise that the postal dispute is a nuisance and every possible effort should be made to resolve it.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also realise that postal workers who are working are not receiving their wages or salaries, and the longer the dispute continues the higher the temperatures will rise and the more difficult it will be to reach a settlement. Whatever the rights or wrongs on either side, a genuine attempt must be made by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Minister for Labour to settle the dispute. Unfortunately, they may allow the goodwill that exists on both sides to be dissipated and because of a lack of intervention by either Minister the dispute might reach an impasse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is saddening to learn that the talks have broken down. The Minister should have ensured that neither party would leave the negotiating table without a <Col N="1445" /> settlement being reached but they were left on their own. This dispute will not go away. Somebody must solve it. It is the responsibility of both Ministers to do something positive to end the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for sharing her valuable time with me. Obviously I will be brief. It is a very serious situation that the talks have broken down within the last two hours or so. I had hoped that by the time we stood up here this evening some progress would have been made towards a settlement because the auguries looked good. There appeared to be a fair amount of common ground between the two sides. As I understand it, the union were prepared to accept the recruitment of temporary staff on a <i>pro rata</i> basis and the tribunal's recommendations on overtime. I am aware this is something about which the Minister and many people feel strongly. The union were prepared to accept a phased reduction in overtime. In relation to Sheriff Street, which has been a problem area for a long period, the union were prepared to accept that Dublin districts 1 and 2 be located at the new premises but, unfortunately, that has not been enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help suspecting that the reason it has not been enough is that the two parties did not show equal commitment and effort to reach an agreement. Be that as it may, I have not at any stage felt blame should be apportioned. Eventually a settlement will have to be reached and I hope it will be reached without undue hardship and, therefore, it is wrong to apportion blame. I would ask two things. The first is that no more suspensions follow. It would be a bad mistake if, as a result of the breakdown in these negotiations, suspensions were to take place tomorrow or within the next few days. Secondly, this is an opportune time for the Minister for Labour to intervene in this dispute. We all know that time is crucial. I am led to believe &mdash; and I hope these words are brought to his attention &mdash; that if the Minister for <Col N="1446" /> Labour were to intervene now he could do so with a fair chance of success. I hope he will follow that advice.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch den Teachta Ahearn as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ócáid seo faoi gach atá ag tarlú in An Post faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>This gives me an opportunity to set out the present position for the information of the House. The current dispute affecting the postal service commenced on 27 April last with the implementation, by An Post, of the independent tribunal's recommendations for the recruitment of temporary and part-time staff in the Dublin area to reduce overtime working. On 28 April I gave the House a detailed statement of the extent of An Post's financial problems and of the need for changes in the postal service to resolve those problems. In the course of that statement I expressed the view that the appropriate way to settle the postal dispute is to use fully the industrial relations machinery, including the available adjudication procedures, and that both sides should accept and implement the outcome of these procedures.</P>
      <P>Postal staff continue to process and deliver social welfare payments and An Post's counter staff continue to disburse such payments. The Minister for Social Welfare has made special arrangements to facilitate social welfare recipients affected by the dispute and I am informed they are operating satisfactorily. I am seriously concerned about the disruption in mail services now taking place and I am keeping in close touch with the whole situation and in close touch with my colleague, the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission has met both sides this week for discussions. Those discussions were adjourned today without arrangements for resumption. The chief executive is due to report back to the normal meeting of the Labour Relations <Col N="1447" /> Commission next week. I regret a solution has not been arrived at this week. As I said last week, the only way to resolve this problem is through negotiation or through adjudication and unless all parties are prepared to work at achieving a solution I fear there will be escalating losses to the company and the very future of the company and all their staff will be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Once again I appeal to all those involved to make a realistic attempt to negotiate the necessary changes, to restore the company to break even and I repeat, the Government are not prepared to subsidise a loss-making postal service.</P>

      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter in the house tonight. It concerns the serious situation appertaining at Clonakilty boys' national school, County Cork. Approximately 200 pupils are accommodated in five tiny classrooms under very unhealthy conditions. There are no passageways between the benches to facilitate children going in and out. Apparently there are holes in the floor boards, the ceilings are falling down, the walls are damp and the play ground is completely inadequate, with only a small yard, approximately one eighth of an acre, attached to the school premises. There are no staff <Col N="1448" /> rooms, no general purpose room, lighting and ventilation are poor and heating facilities are limited. The school furniture is obsolete and the building itself is well over 100 years old. On bad days the children are forced to shelter in the small shed in the school yard, which is not capable of holding a fraction of them. The school yard becomes completely flooded on extremely wet days.</P>
      <P>The board of management of the school have made repeated demands to the Department of Education for a new boys' national school to be built to accommodate this large number of pupils. In view of the extenuating circumstances appertaining to their case I would be pleased if the Minister for Education would clearly state his intentions as regards the provision of a new school to accommodate the pupils concerned and I would appreciate an assurance that finance will be made available to carry out the building of this project this year. It is appalling in this day and age that those youths are deprived of the privilege of decent national school accommodation as the present condition of the old boys' school is deplorable.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining the Department's position on the provision of a new boys' national school at Clonakilty, County Cork. The Department had agreed in principle in 1986 to replace the existing school building and this project had reached sketch plan stage. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, it was not possible to proceed at the time because of the large number of projects on hands and the necessary budgetary constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present staffing at the school is a principal and five assistant teachers, with an enrolment of 174 pupils who are accommodated in a building which dates from 1885 and which I accept is outmoded and unsatisfactory. The Department's <Col N="1449" /> primary building unit have been examining the question of a new school in consultation with the inspectorate. I accept there has been some delay which is due to pressure of work. Also there has been some uncertainty concerning enrolments. The matter is now close to finalisation and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities at an early date. In view of the Deputy's interest he will also be advised of developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to say it is a gross discourtesy to the House and the Members that neither the Minister nor the Minister of State at the Department of Education is present to hear genuine points of grievance in relation to education. No disparagement is intended of the Minister of State present who is responsible for his own portfolio. I will be taking up that matter with the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>On 22 July 1991 the College of Marketing and Design, Mountjoy Square, Dublin, issued a letter confirming, in the clearest possible terms, that the college had decided to extend the three-year diploma in marketing administration to a fourth year for the award of the advanced diploma in administration and marketing. The course was to begin in September 1991. The letter further confirmed that there was a submission with Dublin City University for the award at degree status for this course. Thirty-nine students undertook the course. Some of those gave up employment in order to do so. Other even returned from employment in other countries in order to participate. Last week, a mere two weeks before sitting their final examination, the students were informed by the college that their course would not now qualify for award of an advanced diploma or the degree from Trinity. Trinity College have confirmed that, despite the written assurances, no submission was given to them for the award of a degree course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that a major blunder was made and it is obvious that there <Col N="1450" /> was gross mismanagement somewhere. Students' livelihoods and career opportunities are at stake. A clear written assurance was given that these students would be awarded their advanced diplomas and that commitment must now, without further ado, be realised in full.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of the so-called submission to Trinity must also be investigated and resolved this week. It is unjust and unfair to expect 39 students to sit an examination this week while a major question mark hangs over the status and merits of that examination. Such indecision and trauma is bound to have serious and damaging effects on the performance of the students landed in this predicament through no fault of their own due to bungling and incompetence somewhere alone the line.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this is a case for urgent intervention at the highest level. I call on the Minister for Education, Mr. Brennan, to immediately intervene with the College of Marketing an Design, the Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin vocational education committee and Trinity College to resolve this matter once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to apologise to the House on behalf of both the Minister for Education and his Minister of State. They had other business tonight and could not be present. However, I assure Deputy Higgins that they will be made aware of the contributions made tonight.</P>
      <P>The attention of the Minister has been drawn to difficulties relating to the validation of a course in marketing and administration in the College of Marketing and Design.</P>
      <P>The difficulty experienced by the students in this case is a matter of the utmost concern to the Minister. The Department have taken the matter up as a matter of urgency with the City of Dublin vocational education committee with a view to arriving at a resolution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that validation of courses in vocational education committee colleges is a matter for the college <Col N="1451" /> authorities and the relevant validating body. In this case I understand that a three year course in marketing and administration has been in operation for some years. This was validated by the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the college extended the course to a fourth year which students believed would lead to an advanced diploma in administration and marketing to be awarded by the Dublin Institute of Technology. I have been informed that this validation has not yet been granted but that a decision is expected within the next few days.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of a degree award the position is that in certain cases advanced diploma courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology may lead to a degree from the University of Dublin. Such an arrangement is not in place for the marketing and administration course at this time.</P>
    <P>I understand that students were informed that the college could not anticipate the result of a submission for degree status from the University of Dublin. Applications for entry to the advanced diploma were accepted only on that basis.</P>

I ask the Chair to convey the strong feelings of the Opposition at the way we were treated tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational school in Rathdowney, County Laois, one of the finest educational establishments in the midlands, is attended by 516 students with a projected net increase in 1992-93 of a further 80 students. A new building was constructed in the mid-eighties at enormous cost as part of the overall school development. However, the new structure only caters for 250 students, the remainder <Col N="1452" /> attending classes in the old school and prefab structures. The condition of some of the prefab buildings would not be tolerated in parts of the Third World. On rainy days the students have to vacate those classrooms and some prefabs, which are more than 20 years old, are beyond repair. The old school, which is still very much in use, is a fire hazard and lights cannot be turned on in wet weather due to the dangerous condition of the electrical wiring. There is no proper heating system and the toilet and washroom facilities are absolutely deplorable.</P>
    <P>County Laois has suffered the closure of three second level educational establishments under the Fianna Fáil administration. Thanks to the teachers in Rathdowney the students succeeded, under very difficult conditions, in achieving marvellous results in this the only second level establishment left in south west Laois.</P>
    <P>Twenty million pounds was allocated by the former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, on the night before he was unceremoniously dismissed from office, not one penny of which was allocated to County Laois. I urge the Minister, notwithstanding the financial position in his Department, to reach agreement with the board of management on a programme of repair works. We need a commitment that the much needed extension will be provided at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Department have only recently received an application from County Laois vocational education committee for new accommodation to replace existing accommodation in this school, which the vocational education committee consider to be unsatisfactory. This application is at present being examined in the Department and the matter will be given full consideration. It will be appreciated that as this application has only recently been received, I am not in a position to give a more comprehensive <Col N="1453" /> response at this stage. However, when this examination has been completed the Department will be in contact with the school authorities in this regard.</P>
      <P>By way of background I should like to add that this school received a permanent extension as recently as 1988. Further to this the school was also provided with additional temporary accommodation in recent years to cope with a rapid increase in enrolments.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated the matter will be dealt with as soon as possible and the vocational education committee contacted in due course.</P>

      <P>This is the first year of the new junior certificate art examination which requires students taking the honours course to submit five projects and those taking the pass course to submit three projects. When the new curriculum was being introduced the art teachers were told that the work of their students would be assessed <i>in situ</i>, in other words in their school. Before Christmas, at the in-service day for the more than 1,000 art teachers in the country, the teachers were told by the Department that they had changed their mind and now all art work would have to be sent physically to Athlone for assessment.</P>
      <P>Since last Friday art teachers and students have been involved in carefully packaging into separate boxes all the art work of the junior certificate students. Supermarkets and homes have been raided for suitable containers to pack very delicate and carefully constructed work. Over 100,000 pieces of art work will, over the next week or so, have to be brought to Athlone. The sheer volume and logistics of storage and linking one part of the exam with another is mind boggling.</P>
      <P>Examiners will have to travel to Athlone. I know one teacher who has been told to be available to spend three full weeks in Athlone staying, obviously, in a hotel funded by the Department to carry out the assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> The work, which represents enormous effort, emotional and financial input from the Department and the students will be destroyed after the assessment, apart from a tiny percentage of the very best work. A valuable resource will be lost to art teachers for next year's students. One teacher has told me that his school has to hire a van and pay for it; a teacher will have to take one of his leave days to drive the van to Athlone tomorrow and unload 150 boxes of art work from one school alone. Schools have not been told whether these costs will be covered.</P>
    <P>This system must be changed by 1993. For this year I ask the Minister to consider allowing the option to those schools who wish to do so to collect the work of their students. Many young students who wish to go on to art college would like to have their work in their portfolio. I ask the Minister of State to tell the Minister for Education that whoever thought up a system of examination and assessment like this shold have their contract examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">

      <P>The situation referred to by the Deputy is covered by Rule 28 of the Department's Rules for Secondary Schools. The rule states, in brief, that a candidate's worked exercise will not be returned to the candidate or his representative under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Over one million worked exercises of different kinds are marked by the Department's examiners every year. Most of these are written scripts but many exercises in various materials are received in connection with the wood-work, metalwork, engineering and construction examinations, in addition to the art examinations. In the case of the junior certificate art examination, entries have been received from more than 25,000 candidates. Each candidate will produce about five separate pieces, giving a total of 125,000 pieces for marking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, in these circumsances, it is not feasible for the Department to undertake <Col N="1455" /> to return this mass of material or to make arrangements for the material to be collected.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1268" /> propose to take Question Nos. 67 and 188 together. The Sub-Committee on discrimination of the National AIDS Strategy Committee has completed an evaluation of the situation regarding possible discrimination against persons with HIV under the following headings:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Segregation in prisons</P>
      <P>&mdash;Health Care</P>
      <P>&mdash;General Health Services</P>
      <P>&mdash;Welfare Benefits</P>
      <P>&mdash;The Work Place</P>
      <P>&mdash;Insurance other commercial transaction</P>
      <P>&mdash;Housing and Schools and Colleges</P>
      <P>The Sub-Committee consulted a number of organisations, both statutory and voluntary, as part of the evaluation and considered that there is no evidence of institutionalised discrimination. There were some indications however that individuals with AIDS or who were HIV positive had either experienced discrimination or have the perception that there were being discriminated against in their daily lives. This applies in particular to prisoners who were required by some medical practitioners to establish their HIV status before being accepted for elective medical procedures. I am concerned that all persons with HIV/AIDS should receive medical care appropriate to their needs in a non-discriminatory way and I have asked the Medical Council to</P>
      <P>(i) to give the report of the Sub-Committee urgent consideration and</P>
      <P>(ii) to take the action necessary to implement the recommendations appropriate to the Council therein.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Council are examining the matter in the context of their &ldquo;Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour and fitness to practice&rdquo; and will be submitting their views to me in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Insurance, the Sub-Committee has concluded that the procedure adopted for insurance and other commercial transactions are not discriminatory in the ordinary sense in <Col N="1269" /> which that term is understood as they are designed for merely commercial reasons. The Sub-Committee points out, however, that persons with HIV, are placed at a disadvantage in not having access to, for example life insurance or other death benefit cover.</P>
    <P>I am not aware, nor was it represented to the Sub-Committee that prisoners with HIV were discriminated against by members of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>The report of the Sub-Committee on discrimination has been circulated for action as appropriate, to the health boards, the Medical Council, the Department of Social Welfare, Environment and Labour and Justice.</P>
    <P>As Part of the process of ensuring that the recommendations of this Sub-Committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee are implemented I will be meeting the chairman in the near future to review the matter and will consider, on the basis of these discussions, the appropriate next steps to be taken.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the present position can give rise to the type of difficulties mentioned by the Deputy and I will ensure that all of the various options, such as greater use of group practices and the provision of cross cover by G.P.'s working in the same area, will be explored with a view to providing more effective cover at week-ends.</P>

    <P>*The figures shown for 1987 and 1988 do not include expenditure on State Receptions hosted by the Minister for Health in those years. All such expenditure prior to 1989 was funded directly from the Vote for the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The increased amount expended in 1990 was in the main due to Ireland's presidency of the EC.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the amount expended in any year on official entertainment is largely determined by the numbers of distinguished visitors received and the numbers of international conferences (requiring State Receptions) which are held in Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of neonatal deaths, that is, deaths of live born infants aged under four weeks, both the birth and the death of the infant are registered and birth certificates <Col N="1272" /> and death certificates can be obtained as required.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the registration of stillbirths was not provided for in the original registration law which we have inherited from the last century, and it will require a change in primary legislation to achieve this. However my Department have just begun a comprehensive review of the entire code of registration legislation covering births, deaths and marriages. The object of the review, which is a major task of considerable complexity, will be to determine how registration procedures and structures devised in Victorian times can be modified to suit modern conditions and needs. I will ensure that the question of the registration of stillbirths is given humane consideration within the context of the review.</P>
    <P>While the review will be progressed as speedily as resources permit it is not possible at this point to say when it will be completed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 105 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income guidelines which are used in the assessment process are not the sole determinant of whether a person receives a medical card. The legislation provides that full eligibility (i.e. the medical card) shall be given to any person who is, in the <Col N="1273" /> opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the relevant health board, unable to afford necessary general practitioner services and prescribed drugs without undue hardship. A person who exceeds the income guidelines is still given a medical card if medical or other circumstances warrant it. Even where the medical card is not issued, the Chief Executive Officer has discretion to give the person full eligibility in respect of a specific service if the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>These provisions are intended to ensure that no person will be denied necessary services due to inability to pay, or suffer undue hardship in availing of them.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are, of course, entitled to public hospital services at modest cost and to the various schemes providing assistance towards the costs of prescribed drugs.</P>
    <P>The number of eligibility categories was reduced from three to two as a result of the Health (Amendment) Act 1991. This followed the detailed analysis of the eligibility system by the Commission on Health funding and their recommendation of measures to simplify the system and make it more equitable. In particular, the Commission found that the were major problems and inequities inherent in allocating non-medical card holders to more than one eligibility category on income grounds. These problems were removed when the new eligibility system came into effect.</P>
    <P>A graduated system of entitlement for non-medical card holders would presumably have to be based on income and would thus reintroduce these problems. In addition, it would make the system far more complex than at present and could greatly increase administrative costs because of the increased number of persons to be means-tested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October, 1991, the then Minister for Health wrote to the Chairman of each health board to draw their attention to the Government's concern to ensure that the highest standards of personal integrity were being applied by health board members and staff. In this context, each health board was asked to provide details regarding the code of conduct in place in that organisation. The responses from health boards indicate that where a formal comprehensive written code of conduct does not already exist, health boards are guided by similar provisions contained in a variety of documents such as the Health Act, 1970 and boards' Standing Orders. These cover areas such as conflicts of interest and the placing of contracts which the board proposes to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of last year, a draft professional code of conduct was drawn up by Chief Executive Officers of health boards which has formed the basis of discussions between health boards, the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the trade unions concerned. I understand that, following these discussions, this document will issue to each current health board employee to note <Col N="1277" /> its content. Future employees will be required to sign the document. While this document has already issued to staff in the Eastern Health Board, I understand that certain trade unions require clarification of a number of points before the document will issue in other health board areas.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently issued a comprehensive Draft of Standard Accounting Policies for health boards and these policies will be adopted, subject to such changes as may be made following consultation with the health boards. In addition, the guidelines on codes of conduct mentioned in the Deputy's question will shortly issue to all boards under the aegis of my Department, including health boards. I would like to emphasise that these measures do not imply any dissatisfaction on my part regarding the operation of health boards, the members and employees of whom I acknowledge as being dedicated and public-spirited in the discharge of their duties.</P>

      <P>My Department makes final allocation available to the Southern Health Board on an annual basis for the provision of services within its region. It is a matter for the Board to determine how resources should be allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A health board does not allocate funds on a geographcal basis. The allocation is divided between the service programmes, normally, the general hospitals, the special hospitals, community care and central services. The funds allocated to each programme are based on a number of factors such as the range and complexity of services provided, the size of the catchment area <Col N="1278" /> covered and the priority rating attached to particular services.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, where there are competing demands for scarce resources, health agencies including the Southern Health Board, must make difficult choices about the allocation of funds for particular services and I am satisfied that they do this in a manner which is in the best interests of the general public. I am not aware of any inequity in the allocation of resources for health services between Cork and Kerry, having regard to the criteria which are generally applied in the distribution of available resources between programmes.</P>

The question of devising agreed mechanisms to control drug costs emerged as one of the most important <Col N="1279" /> issues of the 1990/1991 GMS Review. The strategy recommended in the Review for dealing with this issue is based on an agreed document drawn up between management and the Irish Medical Organisation and is currently being implemented. The main features of the strategy are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) Educational measures focused on the public and the general practitioner to control prescribing.</P>
      <P>(b) Greater co-ordination between hospital and community prescribing given that a significant proportion of community prescribing is initiated in hospitals.</P>

It is not possible to identify the proportion of the premium which is attributable to any particular aspect of the defence bodies' activities. Therefore, no estimate can be made of the increased costs to be met by the State either by way of reimbursement of Medical Defence premia or tax relief.</P>

      <P>The report of the Working Party on Services for the Elderly &ldquo;The Year Ahead&mdash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo; recommended that&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash; respite care to support caring relatives</P>
      <P>&mdash; facilities for nursing highly dependent or terminally ill elderly patients who can no longer be cared for at home.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the report have been accepted by Government in principle and additional funding of £9 million has been made available since 1991 to improve services for the elderly as recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>A proportion of the additional funding provided for Services for the Elderly in 1990, 1991 and 1992 was used to provide specialist units for the elderly in general hospitals. These units have or are being opened in Tullamore, Ennis, Letterkenny, the Mater and Meath Hospitals. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes a commitment to provide such units in the main general hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proportion of the additional funding made available for the elderly has also been used to improve the quality of long stay accommodation, to provide a range of services appropriate to a community hospital and to provide additional long <Col N="1285" /> stay places for the elderly. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes commitments to extend respite facilities for the elderly and to ensure adequate numbers of extended care beds in those boards experiencing a rapid increase in the elderly population.</P>
    <P>The commitment of this Government to improve hospital services for the expanding elderly population has been demonstrated by the level of additional funding made available for this purpose over the past three years. I intend to maintain this momentum to ensure that the elderly receive as high a quality of hospital service as possible and long stay care when required.</P>

      <P>A considerable amount of research has been and continues to be conducted into drug misuse among teenagers. This consists of both ongoing collection of data and individual research projects. As regards the former, my Department has established a National Drug Misuse Reporting System which includes data regarding teenagers. This is operated by the Health Research Board and collects data from treatment sources, from the Garda crime report statistics on persons charged with drug offences and seizures of illicit drugs, from the Customs and Excise Service, from Hepatitis B data and from methadone consumption. The Reporting System has been in operation since 1989 and had been concentrating on gathering Data from the Dublin area. In line with the recommendations of the Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse, my Department has allocated funding to the Health Research Board to extend the operation of the System to the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>In this context, the process to collect comprehensive data in respect of drug misuse in the Southern Health Board area has commenced and data based on Hepatitis B, which is an indicator of drug misuse, from all health boards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 206 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are 24 trainees in St. Michael's House who this year will complete the three year Level I training programme which is funded by the European Social Fund. The three year limit on participation at this level is an EC requirement. Generally this limit will only begin to affect trainees in other training centres from 1 January, 1993 onwards. The trainees will be assessed as to whether, following completion of the Level I course, they meet ESF criteria <Col N="1288" /> for admission to Level II training. If they meet these criteria then they will participate in Level II training programme for a further two years. If any of the trainees in St. Michael's House fail to meet the ESF criteria, the question of alternative provision can be considered between St. Michael's House and my Department.</P>
    <P>The Regulations governing the European Social Fund provide financial assistance only to vocational training programmes which are aimed at training persons for employment in the open labour market. People with disabilities can only benefit to the extent that they are capable of being trained for open employment. The Fund does not aid sheltered work programmes or the training of people with disabilities for sheltered employment. The current ESF rules remain in force until the end of 1993. My Department will be pressing in the context of the post-1993 situation for a broadening of the scope of eligible activities under the ESF to include training for sheltered or supported employment.</P>

      <P>EC directives provide that general nurse training throughout the EC must be of a certain minimum standard and that the qualification of Registered General Nurse awarded by An Bord Altranais in this country, and its equivalent throughout the EC, entitles the holder to work throughout the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nurses who received their training in another EC member state before these EC directives came into operation must satisfy An Bord Altranais that their training reached the minimum standards laid down by the Board. Where there is a <Col N="1289" /> perceived gap in such training, the Board would require the nurse in question to undergo a back to nursing course before entering on the register here.</P>
    <P>Nurses trained in Ireland, either before or after the directive came into effect, are entitled to be registered to practice under the provisions of the Nurses Act, 1985.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other basic nursing disciplines of paediatric, psychiatric and mental handicap nursing, where no EC directive yet applies, An Bord Altranais must again satisfy itself as to the level of training received, if such training took place outside this country, and can request an applicant for registration to undergo a back to nursing course.</P>
    <P>The effect of this policy is to ensure that anyone who is registered to work as a nurse in this country, regardless of nationality, must have received sufficient training in the appropriate nursing discipline.</P>

Where earnings exceed £30 per week, the maintenance allowance is reduced by the amount in excess of £30 per week. I do not propose to change the regulations in this regard.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for the care of the people with mental handicap currently being cared for by the Brothers of Charity in St. Senan's Hospital, Foynes is a matter for agreement between the Brothers and the Mid-Western Health Board. The Mid-Western Health Board has prepared a long term plan for the provision of mental handicap services in the region. It is the Health Board's intention, in conjunction with the Brothers of Charity, to make available a series of alternative, appropriate accommodation for people with mental handicap. In the case of St. Senan's Hospital, Foynes, the intention would be to transfer the residents to the Brothers of Charity Services, Bawnmore, <Col N="1292" /> and a similar number of residents in Bawnmore would then be relocated in hostel accommodation in the community. The pace of these developments will depend on the availability of resources in future years.</P>
      <P>The Health Board has not yet made a decision about the future of St. Senan's Hospital, or when it will revert to the Board on the termination of the Brothers of Charity's lease.</P>

      <P>I had a most informative and useful meeting with staff and Southern Health Board management at Tralee General Hospital on 2 May 1992.</P>
      <P>A wide-ranging discussion took place with particular reference to the question of junior anaesthetic staff, the appointment of a physician in geriatric medicine and the appointment of a locum obstetrician gynaecologist.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, specific provision was made in the Southern Health Board's financial allocation in 1992 for the development of ENT services at Tralee General Hospital, which had been identified as a priority by the health board and Tralee Hospital consultant staff in the current year. The Health Board has now submitted proposals in this regard to my Department which are under consideration at present. The question of junior anaesthetic staff is being examined in the context of the development of the ENT service. I understand that the appointment of a physician in geriatric medicine at Tralee General Hospital is a priority with the Southern Health Board. This will have to be considered in the light of the Board's overall competing service priorities and the resources available to meet these.</P>
      <P>There are two obstetrician gynaecologists at the hospital. One is on sick leave at present. The Board is endeavouring to secure the services of a locum obstetrician gynaecologist but is experiencing difficulty in this regard.

      <P>Persons with conditions such as asthma who in the opinion of the Chief Executive <Col N="1294" /> Officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses, without undue hardship, may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines and general practitioner services free of charge.</P>
      <P>In the case where a particular child or member of a family is incurring heavy expenditure due to their asthma condition, the Chief Executive Officer may grant a medical card to cover that child or individual, rather than issuing a card to cover the whole family.</P>
      <P>However, no group or particular illness category can automatically be granted a medical card solely due to their medical condition.</P>
      <P>Any person with an ongoing medical condition, such as asthma, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the Drug Cost Subsidisation Scheme. This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month. This scheme is being availed of by many persons who suffer from asthma and the take up in the scheme emphasises the benefits of the scheme for asthmatics in particular.</P>
      <P>The drugs refund scheme ensures that persons with irregular expenditure on drugs and medicines are refunded the balance of their expenditure, in excess of £90 per quarter, on prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>

      <P>First of all I should explain that the admission of a patient to hospital for surgery is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case. Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heart surgery for public patients is performed in three locations:&mdash; The National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital, <Col N="1297" /> Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>Significant additional resources have been allocated to cardiac surgery over the last two years in spite of severe financial restrictions. I have allocated funds for a second post of cardiac surgeon for Cork Regional Hospital. On a full-year basis, the second appointment will double the number of cardiac operations performed. I have also given approval to the planning of a cardio-thoracic theatre at that hospital. In Dublin, the Mater and St. James's Hospitals were invited to submit proposals to increase the number of cardiac operations from 750 to 1,000 per annum. An option appraisal of the two proposals is currently underway in my Department.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as an immediate step, an additional sum of £120,000 has been allocated for the provision of 40 extra open heart operations at the Mater Hospital in the current year.</P>
    <P>With regard to orthodontic treatment, special allocations have been made available to health boards for the development of orthodontic services. £300,000 was provided at the end of 1989 and £567,000 and £1 million was provided in 1990 and 1991 respectively. The health boards 1992 allocations include a repeat of the special provision for the continuing improvement of orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of services as a result of the additional money made available by the Government. Twelve thousand children were receiving specialist orthodontic treatment and a further four thousand were being treated at primary care level by trained dentists at the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>Consultant Orthodontists have now been appointed to the Mid-Western, North-Western and the Southern Health Boards and appointments are expected in the Eastern, South-Eastern and Western Health Boards in the next few months. Where a health board has been unable to recruit a Consultant Orthodontist it makes alternative arrangements with private orthodontist/specialists to provide the necessary services. <Col N="1298" /> The consultants will, in addition to their own direct clinical involvement, have a major role to play in training staff which will considerably enhance the orthodontic services provided by health boards.</P>
    <P>As far as cataract and other ophthalmic surgery is concerned, my Department is at present collating the information collected recently from hospitals in regard to their present waiting lists and I will be in touch with the Deputy in the matter in due course.</P>

      <P>The basic purpose of the national lottery is to generate revenue for designated activities &mdash; sports, culture, the arts, the Irish language, health, welfare and such other activities as may be designated from time to time by the Government.</P>
      <P>Lottery funds have enabled the Government to undertake some important initiatives such as the commitment to a programme of regional and local sports centres. They have also been used to assist many national cultural institutions, and major projects such as the restoration of the GPO and St. John's Castle in Limerick. Charitable and voluntary bodies and activities have also benefited substantially by way of grants of lottery funds.</P>
      <P>As already mentioned, lottery resources have also been used to fund some social expenditures which benefit the community generally or particularly deprived or deserving sectors of society. Some examples here would be the library service, amenity grants, essential equipment for hospitals, and the National Aids Research Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the lottery is not intended as a primary source of funding for the core public expenditure <Col N="1304" /> programmes. Rather it permits spending on certain important but nevertheless more discretionary areas of public expenditure to be maintained or expanded at a time of difficulty in the public finances. To the extent that some of these programmes might otherwise have been curtailed, it has helped to offset such cutbacks.</P>

    <P>My Department has made funds available periodically to certain Vocational Education Committees, including <Col N="1308" /> CDVEC, to assist students who are deemed to be exceptionally talented in the performing arts to study abroad.

      <P>Higher Education Grants for 1992 and subsequent years will include provisions whereby for the award of grants: (i) Mature students who secure a place in a third-level institution will be regarded as satisfying the academic attainment requirements; (ii) the income eligibility of mature students who are not dependent on their parents will be assessed by reference to their own, and, if married, their spouses income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the constraints on Exchequer resources, it has only been possible, in years when there has been an improvement in the terms of the Higher Education Grants Scheme to introduce <Col N="1309" /> and fund the improvements with effect from the years in question.</P>
    <P>Thus in accordance with normal practice relating to improvements in the Grants Scheme, these improvements will apply only to mature students entering third-level education in 1992 and subsequently. Mature students already in third level education must satisfy the terms of the existing Schemes on the same basis as all other students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there have been difficulties regarding the admission of elective patients to St. James's Hospital. These difficulties have arisen mainly from the large number of admissions to the hospital in recent times through the accident and emergency department. This has decreased the number of beds available for elective cases, which has led to the deferral of booked admissions in a number of instances.</P>
      <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that the hospital authorities are taking steps to address this matter and are making an additional 18 beds available. I am also aware that the hospital management is actively investigating how improvements can be made in the internal organisation of the hospital to improve both the efficiency and the cost-effectiveness of patient care.</P>
      <P>My Department has had discussions with the hospital management regarding the matter and the hospital proposes to carry out a study to investigate the underlying reasons which gave rise to this problem. The study will cover the period July to December 1992 and I hope that, arising from the findings, the hospital will be in a position to take positive action to avoid a repeat of these difficulties in 1993.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, in each case, the admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case. Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given according to medical need. Should a patient's condition be causing concern, it is open to his or her general practitioner to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>

      <P>The terms of the Job Sharing Scheme which was introduced by my Department in 1985 for Health Service staff provide that it is a matter for the employing agency having regard to service requirements to apply the job sharing scheme or not in any particular case. An indication of the success of the scheme is shown by the number of those who have availed of the scheme in the South-Eastern Health Board over the past three years. In 1989, there were 191.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192, 193, 217, 237, and 243 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the growing cost of litigation arising from allegations of medical negligence. These costs are rising for a number of reasons. The number of claims against individual doctors and against hospitals is rising; the size of awards made to successful claimants is rising and the associated legal costs falling on the parties to claims are also rising. The result of these developments is a significant increase in the cost of providing insurance cover against the risk of claims.</P>
      <P>At the request of my predecessor, the Government approved the establishment of a working group representing the Departments of Health, Finance, Industry and Commerce and Justice, and the Office of the Attorney General to examine this area and to make recommendations. This group have been asked to produce a report on alternatives to the present system of establishing negligence and awarding compensation. The Group are examining a full range of alternative options including the introduction of a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; system, practice guidelines and a specific scheme for non-consultant hospital doctors. However, I would prefer to make no further comment on the merits of any particular proposal until the group has reported. I expect to receive an interim report from the Group before the end of May.</P>
      <P>The approximate annual cost of refunds of medical defence premia to my Department for the years 1987 to 1991 was £0.49 million, £0.86 million, £2.8 million, £4 million and £9 million respectively. The estimated cost in 1992 is £14 million.</P>

Tougher new penalties for infringements of the Food Hygiene Regulations have been introduced. The maximum fine of £100 has been increased to £1,000 &mdash; with £100 a day for a continuing offence.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 202 together. Before a person with a mental handicap is offered a place in the community, a thorough assessment is carried out by a multi-disciplinary team to assess the person's ability to cope with living in the community. The assessment includes the level and nature of support provided by the person's family. Persons with mental handicap also participate in training programmes designed to ease the transition to community living.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive community services are being put in place at local level in each health board area in line with Government policy as outlined in the Report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap &mdash;&ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;. A decision as to the ability of a person with mental handicap to live in the community, and the suitability of any particular community to receive such people are matters for decision by the Director of Services of the agency responsible for the person.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned. I have made inquiries from the Mater Hospital who have informed me that this person has been on the waiting list for cardiac by-pass surgery since February 1992. The hospital is unable at this stage to give a precise admission date for his operation. However, if this person feels that he needs more immediate attention he should contact his general practitioner who would be in the best position to highlight his case to his consultant.</P>

      <P>There is no formal application form for those seeking national lottery funding from my Department. National groups or organisations seeking lottery grants should write to the Department indicating the purpose for which assistance is being sought and stating the amount required. As a general rule local voluntary groups and organisations should address their applications for national lottery grants to the appropriate health boards. Health boards receive block allocations of lottery funds from my Department specifically for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The amount allocated to my Department from national lottery funds in the current year is £39.8 million. Of this sum a total of £33.65 million has been allocated to date. Of the residue of £6.15 million approximately £5.35 million is already committed, though not formally allocated as yet. Applications for grants from the balance of £800,000 approximately are under consideration at present and I expect to be in a position to make a final decision in the matter shortly.</P>

      <P>The development plan for Naas Hospital provides for a 209 bed hospital, with a range of services including general medicine, general surgery, intensive care, coronary care and psychiatric and geriatric units.</P>
      <P>The developed hospital will have as its catchment area much of County Kildare and a portion of West County Wicklow, with a projected catchment population of 100,000 people.</P>
      <P>The projected financial requirement for the outstanding building work at the hospital amounts to approximately £30 million. While the capital allocation available to my Department for 1992 does not allow for the recommencement of this project in the current year, I will be considering the further development of the hospital in the context of the capital resources available to my Department in future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244, 245 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to the replies to Question No. 336 of 18 February, 1992 and to Questions Nos. 29, 122, 143, 145 and 148 of 25 March, 1992.</P>
      <P>Within the EC, controls arising from the Montreal Protocol on the production and use of CFCs and other ozone depleting substances are operated on a community-wide basis. This regional approach is rational and effective; overall community sales of the main CFCs have been reduced by more than 40 per cent between 1986 and 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CFCs and related substances are not produced in Ireland and our overall use of them is small. The latest figures available to my Department show annual national usage of the main CFCs at approximately 2,500 tonnes; this represents a decrease broadly in line with the pattern in the Community as a whole. My Department has had good cooperation with the CII, FICI and the principal <Col N="1331" /> users in encouraging the earliest possible phase out here of ozone depleting substances.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the agreement reached at the Environment Council on 23 March, 1992, the EC Commission has submitted a draft Regulation providing for the elimination of production and use of the main ozone depleting substances by 31 December, 1995. Ireland has fully supported this timetable.</P>

      <P>The Government are deeply concerned about the military coup which took place in Haiti on 30 September last against the country's first democratically elected President Mr. Jean Bertrand Aristide. We have been active with our Community partners and at the UN in efforts to bring pressure to bear for the return to the rule of law in Haiti and for the reinstatement of the legitimate authorities there. This is called for in several statements by the Twelve including <Col N="1335" /> one of 3 October immediately after the coup, in which the Community and its member states suspended their assistance to Haiti under the Lomé Convention. Later that month, Ireland co-sponsored a Resolution at the UN General Assembly condemning the coup and calling for the restoration of the President Aristide's Government.</P>
      <P>The Government remain concerned at the failure to date to bring an end to the coup and in particular that the agreements of 23 and 25 February signed in Washington, which provide for a return to Haiti of President Aristide and the formation of a new Government, remain unimplemented. With partners in the Community we are currently examining the situation in co-operation with the organisation of American States to see what further measures might be taken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 258 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, each local authority is required to appoint a <Col N="1336" /> wholetime Veterinary Inspector to implement the provisions of the Act and provide such veterinary or ancillary services as are required. In addition, local authority veterinary inspectors are required to carry out other duties in accordance with the relevant enactments in force.</P>
    <P>The full provisions of the Abattoirs Act in relation to the inspection and stamping of meat for human consumption are effective from 1 June 1992. Accordingly, each local authority is required to appoint a wholetime Veterinary Inspector from that date. The Act also includes provision for the sharing of a Veterinary Inspector's services between two local authorities, subject to the consent of the Minister. Local authorities which already employ permanent wholetime Veterinary Inspectors are as follows: Carlow, Cork, Clare, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Limerick, Mayo, Meath, Offaly, Tipperary (S.R.), Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford, Wicklow, Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, Limerick Corporation, Galway Corporation, Waterford Corporation.</P>
    <P>Counties Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon have yet to make such appointments. My Department has advised those counties that the appointment of a wholetime inspector on a temporary basis will be acceptable, provided that such appointment is for a period not exceeding six months and that arrangements are made within that period in relation to the appointment of a permanent veterinary inspector.</P>

      <P>I recently announced details of a scheme for the temporary leasing of milk quotas at co-operative/dairy level. Under this scheme small producers receive first priority in the allocation of any quota which becomes available. By raising the amount of quota which can be leased by a supplier from last year's level of 70 per cent to 99 per cent, the uptake under the scheme will be greater in the current year and accordingly more quota will be available for allocation to small producers.</P>
      <P>Small producers will, of course, continue to receive priority under the various other national arrangements which are in place and I will also be mindful of their quota position in forthcoming negotiations at the Council of Ministers on the future of the quota system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions 280 and 284 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is not payable in respect of any day during which a person is engaged in insurable employment under a contract of service irrespective of the extent of the employment or wages paid. Accordingly, persons <Col N="1344" /> employed as home helps by the health board, being in insurable employment under a contract of service, would not be entitled to unemployment assistance for days during which they were so employed. If unemployed for at least three days in every period of six consecutive days, a person could qualify for assistance for the days not worked subject to satisfying the means test.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Social Welfare Act provided for the exclusion from means assessment of income from employment of a casual nature by a health board as a home help. Accordingly a person claiming unemployment assistance who is employed as a home help on a part-time basis will not be assessed with any means from these earnings; neither will a person be assessed with means arising from income earned by a spouse employed as a home help.</P>
    <P>For unemployment benefit purposes, persons may be regarded as unemployed even though engaged in employment provided this employment is of a subsidiary nature, i.e., employment which could be carried on in conjunction with their normal employment and it does not preclude their availability to take up full-time work.</P>
    <P>To be regarded as unemployed for unemployment benefit purposes, a person engaged in a subsidiary employment must have a total of 117 contributions paid at the Class A rate in the three years preceding the date of claim or have income from the subsidiary employment not exceeding £10 per day.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of an old age contributory pension of £66.70 per week. This includes a living alone allowance awarded from the date of her husband's death. In addition she is in receipt of free electricity and free telephone rental allowances, a free travel pass and weekly fuel allowance during the winter season.</P>
      <P>The rate of old age contributory pension payable is determined by the person's insurance record and is not affected by fluctuations in the overall income of her household. Consequently, the pensioner is not entitled to an increase in her rate of pension arising from the loss of her husband's occupation pension and his old age contributory pension following his death.</P>
      <P>Payment of six weeks pension to the spouse of a deceased pensioner is made only in cases where (a) the deceased pensioner was in receipt of an adult dependant allowance in respect of his spouse or (b) where the deceased pensioner would have been in receipt of such an allowance but for the fact that the pensioner's spouse was in receipt of an old age contributory pension or a carer's allowance in her own right.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned was in receipt of an old age contributory pension in her own right at the time of her husband's death, she is not entitled to the payment of his pension for the six week period following his death. She is receiving her correct entitlements.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of an old age contibutory pension is that the claimant must have entered insurance before the age of 56 years. Accordingly self-employed persons who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over will not qualify for the old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>However, social welfare contributions payable by the self-employed also give cover for widow's contributory pension to which entitlement can arise after three years insurance.</P>
      <P>Where a person enters insurance for the first time after the age of 56 years he or she may be entitled to a refund of the pension element of any contributions paid provided they do not qualify for a non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing the conditions for refund of contributions in these cases to see whether any changes are required to cater for particular anomalies to which the present arrangements may give rise.</P>

    <P>*The occupational injuries fund and the redundancy and employers insolvency fund were amalgamated with the social insurance fund on 1 May 1990, but expenditure under these funds for all years has been included in the tables, for ease of comparison. The redundancy and employers insolvency payments schemes are administered by the Department of Labour.</P>
