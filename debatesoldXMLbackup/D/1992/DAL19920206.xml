      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Garland.  Perhaps the Deputy would now state the matter of which he has given me notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I hereby request that Dáil Éireann adjourn today to discuss the impending demolition of Howth House, Howth, County Dublin, which is located at the base of St. Mary's Abbey separating Abbey Street from Harbour Road. It is imperative not to alter the form and mass of this triangular site but to confer on it the status of a focal point, a place which invites people to rejoice in its history, part of Howth's history, which is the motor vessel <i>Asgard</i>, which should be returned to Howth and given its place of importance on the Howth House site, the only suitable site on the waterfront.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach, on effectively his last day in office, as a master manner and conservationist, to use his good office to allow this debate proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to bring the House back to talking about the drudgery of the 1992 budget.  In the two minutes available to me I will conclude on the points I was making when the House adjourned on the budget debate last evening, that the Culliton report has tremendous economic potential.  I sincerely hope it will be implemented quickly and that the task force which the Government have decided to set up, to ensure its implementation, will be given every assistance from the various Government Departments.  One of the fundamental recommendations is the splitting up of the IDA so that there will be an organisation for job creation for home-based as well as for foreign industry. Over recent years we have come to the conclusion that, because of the reduction in mobile international industry it is ever more difficult to attract foreign investment.  Therefore we must revert to the main thrust of the Telesis report that indigenous industries should be given every assistance and support from the appropriate Government agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the whole area of taxation the task force have a major responsibility to ensure that the recommendations in the Culliton report are implemented.  The <Col N="1343" /> main tax reform recommendations have been highlighted under seven headings. I compliment the Minister for Finance who has been moving in the direction of equitable tax reform.  If the Culliton report recommendations in the area of taxation are implemented, then we will see for the remainder of the nineties a much more equitable tax structure and, whereas up to now the PAYE sector have been carrying the burden of computerised control on their wage packets all other sectors will henceforth pay their fair share.  That is what the budget did and can therefore be commended to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> This is my third occasion speaking on the budget in the Dáil.  Each year Members who have spoken have continued the myth which is so untrue but has been repeated each year.  It is incredible that the same ráiméis is being repeated so regularly.  I have said before that the year 1987 was not the start of our freedom; it was the year in which a country was handed over in good shape to an incoming government and whose backbenchers, in particular, and sometimes its Ministers were telling us about the catastrophe of 1987.  I want to stitch a few facts into the record because they are very important.  Deputies such as Eric <Col N="1344" /> Byrne do a fair amount of research and, perhaps, in 50 years time he will come back, read the records and find that these were gems of wisdom.</P>
      <P>The following are the facts.  In 1981 after four years of Fianna Fáil Government, inflation was just over 21 per cent. As I said before in this House, that figure would nearly lead normal people to commit suicide rather than taking on the running of the country.  This year and in the past I have heard Fianna Fáil people talking about how well this Government had got inflation under control.  That is the greatest load of codswallop of all time.  This Government did not get inflation under control.  Deputy Garrett FitzGerald came in with a group of brave people who took on the running of this country when inflation was at 21.4 per cent.  In that situation where would the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> be?  What would have happened to the social welfare recipients who received an increase of 4 per cent if inflation was 21 per cent?  Inflation was reduced gradually to 17 per cent and when the Government left office in 1987 inflation had been reduced from 21 per cent to 4 per cent.  What could be a greater achievement than that?  Nevertheless, year after year here, even the media go on talking about 1987 as if it was a disaster.  I want to have it recorded clearly for the third year running that inflation at 21 per cent in 1981 was a direct result of four years of Fianna Fáil Government.  For Fianna Fáil to claim at this stage that they have got inflation under control is playing around with truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second statement I wish to correct was made by a Fianna Fáil TD and I was surprised, knowing he was educated in a very good college.  He claimed credit for the balance of payments situation.  I should like to put on the record, for the third year running, that in 1981 the trade balance was in deficit to the tune of £1.8 billion.  By 1985, which for those who do not want to do a calculation comes before 1987, it had been turned around and was in surplus by £315 million.  It has been in <Col N="1345" /> surplus ever since.  That is another lie nailed.</P>
    <P>Let me mention a third fact.  In 1986, for the first time ever the balance of payments was in surplus and has been in surplus ever since also.  Therefore, on taking up Government in 1987, Fianna Fáil had one great advantage &mdash; inflation had been brought under control, having been reduced from a rate of 21 per cent to 4 per cent, while the balance of trade and balance of payments were both in surplus.  It is unbelievable therefore that people should come along and claim credit for bringing this about.  Even if the Exchequer borrowing requirement was high, it had been reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent in the 1987 budget.  It should also be borne in mind that in the years 1977-81 prices were out of control. We should therefore deal with the facts and face up to reality.</P>
    <P>I suppose tomorrow the newspapers will be full of reports about the election of a new leader.  That is fair enough, but it would be nice if there was a heading &ldquo;Browne blasts bogus bragging&rdquo;&mdash; this has to happen to highlight the bogus bragging about getting things under control &mdash; or &ldquo;Fianna Fáil fiction fairly flattened&rdquo; which would also get across a message. However, those headlines will not appear; it is just a dream that they would appear with the result that if these bogus claims are repeated people would say that this is wrong and had been contradicted in the newspapers.  For some strange reason we cannot seem to have it contradicted. Indeed, a former Member of this House, Mr. Paddy Cooney, had to write a letter to correct the position and sort out this hassle.</P>
    <P>There were repeated statements that we were facing doomsday in 1987.  Not only were the Government of 1982-87 confronted with economic difficulties, they were also confronted with the difficulty of an Opposition who at that time opposed everything that moved.</P>
    <P>Last evening in the House a Fianna Fáil Deputy asked us what our policies were on unemployment.  This was laughable when one considers that this Deputy <Col N="1346" /> is a member of a party who had no policies between 1982-87 and who opposed everything that moved and, if something did, their policy was to clobber it.  As it happens he must not have been listening to Deputy John Bruton, who has so often outlined what our policies are.  Indeed I think Deputy Bruton's suggestion, that an all-party committee on unemployment be established, should be taken up.</P>
    <P>When we consider the present position in relation to health care, or the lack of it, recall the slogans which appeared around the countryside, take note of the number of unemployed at present and think of the days when we had posters around the country showing queues for passports at a time when there were only 200,000 unemployed &mdash; it is now heading towards 300,000 &mdash; it is obvious people do not care about what they say and prefer to continue to talk ráiméis.  Given the scandals that have taken place, the inquiries and internal problems within the Fianna Fáil Party, who are to elect a new leader, no one appears to be able to talk about the dreadful state that the country is in at present.  Therefore, they are getting away with a certain amount. I do not want however to reply to the same nonsensical statements in the debate on next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The budget has been described as many things by many people.  We have been told that the influence of the Progressive Democrats is very much in evidence. I suggest that the influence of Saint Augustine is also in evidence because by turning around his prayer slightly the Minister for Finance came up with the idea &ldquo;Lord, make me pay, but not this year&rdquo;.  As far as I can see, all this budget has done is postpone some of our bills until next year.  For example, an extra £350 million will have to be found for public service pay in next year's budget.  Furthermore, £22 million only is being provided in this year's budget under the heading &ldquo;equal pay&rdquo;, an issue ongoing since the mid eighties, when it is possible a figure of around £200 million may be required.  By allocating such a figure we are postponing the evil day. Farmers, who are almost on their knees <Col N="1347" /> at present, were due to get an extra £12 million in headage payments, but only £2 million is to be made available.  They, too, will have to wait until next year.  So far as the farmers are concerned it is a question of maraigh capall agus gheobhair féar.  Má mhaireann siad ní bheidh féar ar bith ann dóibh.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties is that all these issues are being postponed.  As far as I can see, the Government will face an impossible task in framing next year's budget because we have pushed away the issues that we should be dealing with now.  I am not dealing here with the changes in VAT which will have to be made &mdash; under the heading of VAT at the point of entry £200 million alone will disappear &mdash; or the doing away with DIRT, but these issues are waiting for us in 1993.  One could define it as &ldquo;Government by postponement, of postponement and for postponement&rdquo;.  They are not facing up to reality.  Furthermore, on top of what we had planned an extra £51 million will have to be borrowed, while it has been claimed that an extra £45 million will be raised by making the tax collection system more efficient.  I do not know whether this is fact or fiction, an aspiration or inspiration, but it seems that we are on very shaky ground.</P>
    <P>I have used the term &ldquo;oxymoron&rdquo; before in this House.  At this stage we could say it is a paradox as well.  We all remember that in 1977 no one had to pay car tax.  This was a great gimmick and it won an election, but we found ourselves with all kinds of problems.  This year car tax is to be increased by 20 per cent. Indeed, the figure is now much higher than it ever was.  Perhaps Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame thought of this when he said &ldquo;A paradox, a paradox, a most ingenious paradox&rdquo;.  The idea seems to be do away with car tax in a particular year and really clobber it the next year.  There seems to be no continuity, or is it the case that we have become used to U-turns being taken?</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the cost of petrol is to come down by 9p a gallon in May.  In the case of a 1600cc car, the tax on which <Col N="1348" /> is to go up by £40, by simple mathematics, dividing £40 by 9p.  I discovered that to balance out the two one would need to do 13,000 miles at 30 miles per gallon or 18,000 miles at 40 miles per gallon.  I have no doubt that the Minister sitting opposite me will make a big splash, that is if he is still in the same Ministry, when he announces petrol prices will be reduced.  It is amazing to think that a motorist will have to cover 18,000 miles when one considers that the average motorist covers around 10,000 miles. While the provision appears to be all right in the budget, people will lose out.  If we take into account the increase in VAT to 16 per cent on car maintenance then it is clear that the cost of running a car will increase.  Indeed, the people who have company cars are very unhappy at present, and rightly so.  It is difficult to know if the budget is just a facade to make it appear that things are being done.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare there was a boastful statement that allowances had kept up with inflation. Imagine a 4 per cent increase to someone who has nothing.  No matter what you hear from people who do not know what it means to be on social welfare, the vast majority are barely surviving.  The 4 per cent increase will mean that they are still trying to survive.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the budget will do for the aged in hospital.  Old people in hospitals are treated as objects and their relatives as millionaires.  Our old people should get the best treatment possible.  If they are in hospital because they are sick they should be treated fairly, because they founded this nation and put up with all kinds of hardship, difficulties and lack of facilities when they were working.  It is outrageous &mdash; and it is becoming quite common &mdash; that relatives are being asked to take patients home even though they need medical care.  I do not see anything in the budget which will guarantee better hospital care for the elderly.  It should be a priority in any nation that the elderly are looked after.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the budget has <Col N="1349" /> done for people who are queueing for operations.  In my own county, for the third time in a short time, there has been a private collection to pay for a heart bypass operation for a person who urgently needs it.  These people would not undergo an operation in time to save their lives if they were relying on public health care.  In 1987 one party had the slogan that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.  However, we are now worse off than ever.  Last night the Minister for Health, in her usual pleasant way, praised all the medical staff, doctors and nurses.  We all appreciate what they do, but our worry is that they are not given the facilities or back-up to help them in their work.  Nobody blames the medical staff in any hospital; they are under pressure and cannot admit people. Cutbacks and delays are not their fault and the Minister should provide the facilities for them.</P>
    <P>The allocation of third level grants is a scandal.  The Minister set up a commission &mdash; and may have received a report &mdash; but it is time that the reality of the difficulties regarding third level education are faced.  There are many intelligent children who have very high standards of education &mdash; in one case I know of someone who attained four As in honours leaving.  The parents are about £500 over the limit for receiving a grant and the child could not avail of third level education even though he has so much to offer.  On the other hand, four Cs may be a qualifying requirement and someone who is not a PAYE earner cannot get third level grants.  We do not seem to be prepared to face this inequity and it is an injustice which cannot be tolerated any longer.</P>
    <P>This budget will not do much for remedial teachers despite what was promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I never know whether the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a promise or an aspiration to achieve something.  There is a myth that remedial teachers are not really needed down the country, that there are parts of the cities which are badly disadvantaged and that therefore <Col N="1350" /> they must be looked after.  While some teachers may be appointed in country areas the emphasis will always be on disadvantaged areas in the cities.  I do not have a quarrel with any part of the country getting remedial teachers as long as it is done on a wide basis.  Having taught, I have a particular interest in this subject. It is obvious that remedial teachers can do so much for children who, for several reasons, might have got a bad start in life and fallen behind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an unfortunate tendency in recent months to talk down the performance of the Irish economy during 1991 below what is justified by reference to the facts.  The predominant reason for this, I believe, has been a certain insularity of approach &mdash; a tendency a look at developments in Ireland in isolation from the position in the European Community or the wider international economy of which we form part.</P>
      <P>International trade is the lifeblood of Irish economic development.  Exports account for over 60 per cent of our gross domestic product and in 1991 the growth in world trade fell to 3 per cent compared with 5 per cent in 1990.  Output in the total OECD area grew only marginally by 1 per cent in 1991 and in the EC by only slightly more.  Output in the UK &mdash; by far our largest export market &mdash; fell by over 2 per cent accompanied by a significant fall in employment levels and a corresponding increase in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short, this country's economic performance in 1991 must be judged in the <Col N="1351" /> context of an international recession which, as indicated in the most recent ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary, threatens to be among the most prolonged for many years.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is wrong of many commentators and of spokespersons for the Opposition parties not to recognise fully the very creditable performance of the Irish economy in 1991.  The alarmist projections of a number of commentators during the course of last year served to undermine business and consumer confidence to an extent not justified by the facts in by the eventual outturn.</P>
    <P>Economic growth in Ireland in 1991, for example, was twice the OECD average. The overall public finances outturn for the year was very close to budget estimates with an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 2.1 per cent of GNP compared with an original budget estimate of 1.9 per cent.  This is almost wholly explained by the higher than anticipated increase in the live register and associated unemployment payments.  It compares well with most other European countries which experienced a deterioration in their budgetary situation in 1991 because of the slowdown in economic growth. We remain well on target to achieve our objective of reducing the national debt-to-GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993.</P>
    <P>Exports of manufactured goods, increased by an estimated 8 per cent in volume terms and by more in cash terms &mdash; a considerable achievement at a time of international recession.  This impressive export performance was widely spread across the manufacturing sector and not simply confined to the branch plants of multinational firms which has often been the basis for good export performances in previous years.</P>
    <P>The latest indications are that a modest increase in employment took place in the sectors outside agriculture in 1991.  This is a considerable achievement in the circumstances and contrasts with the situation in countries such as the UK, the <Col N="1352" /> United States and Canada where significant falls in employment levels have taken place.  But we must do better, given the annual natural increase in the labour force of some 25,000 and the considerable reduction, or even reversal, in net emigration which took place during the past year.</P>
    <P>Our 1991 performance, in difficult circumstances, shows that the Irish economy is in a good position to make considerable advances in output growth and employment creation as the international recession lifts.  Previously, a slow-down in international trade in our main markets of the dimensions that occurred last year would have resulted in a considerable fall-out in employment here in Ireland and a major deterioration in our public finances.  The fact that we weathered the storm so competently in 1991 is a result of the more realistic approach the Government and the other social partners have taken to the management of affairs in recent years.</P>
    <P>In particular, we have major strides in improving our competitiveness under the pay agreements of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  When taken together with the increased productivity of the industrial sector, these improvements are an important explanatory factor for the increased market share we have achieved in many of our export markets in recent years.  They have underpinned our performance in riding out the down-side of the present international recession reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Provided that we maintain a similar discipline to income growth in the period ahead, and not just on the wage and salary side, the prospects for a rapid employment increase as the international recession lifts are considerable.  The 1992 budget will make a significant contribution to maintaining such discipline through the reduction in income tax rates and the widening of the standard rate income tax band which was announced.</P>
    <P>This year's budget has taken a decisive step towards realising the goal of creating a tax system here that is simple and straightforward, equitable and fair as <Col N="1353" /> between various taxpayers, and one which is also transparent.  I believe we have smashed a major psychological barrier by getting our income tax system down to two rates and also by cracking the 50 per cent barrier now that the highest tax rate is 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course, the progress made in relation to income tax is only one part of the overall tax reform agenda of the Progressive Democrats, and of this Government.  I have highlighted in the past how perverse it is that labour should be taxed to such a penal extent in a society suffering an unemployment crisis, and the absolute necessity to transfer some of the tax burden from work, employment and enterprise to other sectors and other forms of activity.</P>
    <P>I am rather bemused with some of the criticisms of the tax reform measures in this year's budget, notably that of the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, in last Saturday's <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he sought to take the Progressive Democrats to task for their emphasis on income tax reform and, in particular, for our desire to see the top rate of tax reduced.  His criticism, and that of some other commentators, fails to take into account the overall balance in the measures being pursued in the Government's tax reform strategy on the one hand, and also reflects an ostrich-like attitude to the debilitating effects of high marginal tax rates on work and effort, and the inevitable recourse by people to various forms of tax evasion and avoidance in a bid to avoid such excessive liabilities.</P>
    <P>It would appear that Deputy FitzGerald blithely ignores the added 7.75 per cent tax burden of PRSI on workers. As a result, the marginal tax rate encountered by people on medium to higher incomes &mdash; in this context medium even means the average industrial wage for a single person &mdash; even with a top income tax rate of 48 per cent, is still a cumulative 55.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is still far too high in my view, but it certainly contrasts very favourably with the situation which pertained when the <Col N="1354" /> Progressive Democrats were founded six years ago.  At that time, Deputy FitzGerald led the very discredited Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, in which the likes of Deputies Noonan and Quinn &mdash; two of the other foremost critics in the past week of this year's budget &mdash; played notable parts.</P>
    <P>In 1985, under Deputy FitzGerald's Government, the top marginal income tax-PRSI rate facing workers in Ireland was 68.5 per cent, and the standard income tax rate affecting every worker was 35 per cent.  Clearly some of our critics on the Opposition benches have not yet learned the lesson of their past failures and the extent to which they totally depressed the economy in the mid-eighties.</P>
    <P>Now, following the budget, the standard tax rate faced by every taxpayer in the country will be 27 per cent &mdash; that is an 8 per cent improvement on the position which obtained under Deputy FitzGerald's Government.  It as also worth nothing that the standard rate tax band is also being extended this year to £14,950 for a married couple &mdash; that is an increase of £1,550 &mdash; and to £7,475 for a single person.  Moreover, in the last couple of years, the standard band has been extended by over 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course, we also know that down all the years when penal rates of personal taxation applied here every possible ways and means of avoiding and evading tax was resorted to, and benefits-in-kind of every variety were resorted to by companies to pay senior executives in particular. The Government are now proposing to introduce a comprehensive fringe benefits tax to tackle effectively those forms of payment which, up to now, have not been brought within the tax code, and a year's notice has been given to employers and employees to regularise their employment contracts in the light of this change.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind the philosophy behind moves like this, which apply also to the proposed taxing of short term social welfare benefits.  It is that all forms of income, whether they derive <Col N="1355" /> from wages, fringe benefits or welfare payments, should be treated in the same way under the income tax code.</P>
    <P>It not only means greater equity as between all citizens but it also broadens the income tax base, and a kind of virtuous circle is induced.  As tax rates become more fair and reasonable, there will be a greater willingness by people to comply with the tax system.  It is quite amazing that some Opposition politicians and indeed some commentators fail to realise the simple equation at work here. But the message is being picked up by ordinary taxpayers and citizens, save perhaps for a few tax consultants.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the comments of many of the Opposition contributors to this debate, but this is hardly surprising when we remember that when Fine Gael and Labour were last in Government together the top marginal tax rate was 68.5 per cent, and that they pushed the upper VAT rate to 35 per cent.  Furthermore, whereas the Exchequer borrowing requirement this year is set to be just under 2.4 per cent, and will be reduced further to 1.5 per cent next year, the EBR in 1985 under the Fine Gael-Labour Government of that time stood at 12.7 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously some politicians still hanker after that era of high taxation and high borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lower tax rates mean fairness, equity and transparency: they lessen the inducements and the opportunities for avoidance and evasion.  Bolstered by measures like the proposed benefit-in-kind tax and the taxation of short term social welfare <Col N="1356" /> benefits, it means that the perversity of people being better off by deliberately absenting themselves from work, as frequently happens now and of particular forms of remuneration, especially for the higher paid escaping any tax liability at all, will both be tackled decisively.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the tax reforms advocated by the Progressive Democrats, and now part and parcel of Government policy, is the necessity as part of the base broadening to achieve a greater tax take from the corporate sector.  In 1985 corporation tax stood at £217 million and accounted for just 3.4 per cent of all revenue.  When we first entered Government in 1989, corporation tax accounted for just 3.9 per cent of all revenues.  This year, however, the corporation tax take is set to rise to £678 million and it will constitute 7.3 per cent of total revenue. This has, of course, been helped by the expiry of export sales relief in April 1990. Here again is a further instance of the tax reform strategy of broadening the base, and shifting some of the excessive burden of tax from work and enterprise.  It enables us to make the reductions in income tax, to which I have already referred, and by doing so reduces the pressure for higher wages which can undermine the competitiveness of firms.</P>
    <P>Of course, the whole tax reform strategy is merely a means by which to generate greater enterprise and employment in the Irish economy.  Of itself it is not sufficient.  The unemployment crisis assailing this country requires every possible initiative to be pursued.  The average number on the live register increased by over 29,000 in 1991 to its highest-ever level of 254,000.  The undermining of living standards and of simple human dignity that underlines these figures is a challenge to the Government and the whole community.  I take no comfort from these figures nor do my colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>As the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group which I instituted last June, makes plain, it has to be tackled on a range of fronts &mdash; including infrastructural costs like transport, energy and telecommunications: job training and <Col N="1357" /> changes in the education system and, of course, the development of our indigenous industrial base.</P>
    <P>One quote from the review puts the tax reform agenda in the wider perspective of industrial development and job creation.  It states succinctly: &ldquo;in no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation&rdquo;.  This is the view of successful industrialists.  We would ignore it at our peril.  The Progressive Democrats and, indeed, the whole Government fully endorse those sentiments.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation the group recommend a fundamental reform on a phased but consistent basis.  The tax reform measures announced in the budget and to be included in the Finance Act are fully consistent with the recommendations of the group.  The standard rate band has been extended to reduce the number paying high marginal tax rates.  This will improve the incentive for well-qualified young people to stay and work in Ireland.  It will also help employers to hold on to good workers who contribute to the productivity and competitiveness of their firms.</P>
    <P>The range of special tax exemptions, reliefs and deductions which have grown over the years in an <i>ad hoc</i> and frequently inconsistent way have also been reduced to release resources for tax reform which supports productive job creation.  Wear and tear allowances have been simplified and changed to better reflect economic and commercial reality in the depreciation of asset for the business sector.</P>
    <P>Further restrictions on section 84 loans were announced before budget day to deal with serious tax avoidance activities which were coming to light in this area at the time.  The measures that had to be put in place to deal with these activities pin-point a major defect in our present taxation structure &mdash; namely, the encouragement of some of the best qualified private sector expertise in the country in essentially, non-productive, tax avoidance activity and the allocation of equally <Col N="1358" /> scarce, high level public service expertise to counter these activities.  This nonsense must stop.</P>
    <P>The solution is the establishment of a more straightforward and simple taxation structure through the type of fundamental reform process on which we have started over the past two years.  The 1992 budget is a major step forward in the reforms that are necessary, but it is a beginning and not an end.  It is a process to which both parties in Government are committed and which both accept are an essential foundation to achieve the radical improvement in employment creation that is required.</P>
    <P>Industry has consistently called for a reduction in the tax wedge to reduce the cost of labour.  Employers and employees alike have called for lower marginal rates of tax to encourage effort.  Investors have called for greater fiscal stability and low inflation to protect investment.  This budget, coupled with the decisions taken at Maastricht last December on monetary union, deliver on these requirements.  The domestic economy will be more conducive to both long term investment and increased employment.  Sustained economic growth will occur if society as a whole, and industry in particular respond to these developments and invest in our mutual future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by taking up words used by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, in the last sentence of his speech where he spoke about &ldquo;our mutual future.&rdquo;  It is very useful to reflect on the word &ldquo;mutual&rdquo;.  There are many people outside this House, including the unemployed and others, but particularly potential emigrants who will be interested in discerning the degree to which people such as Deputy O'Malley and those he represents identify in any mutual sense, as he put it, &ldquo;with their future&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I begin my contribution I would like to reflect on the kind of moral vision that lies behind this speech.  It is a very interesting one, a theory of humanity of the individual, isolated, alone, atomised, <Col N="1359" /> continually conducting some kind of moral calculus, but the moral calculus is curiously reminiscent of a primitive original sin theory &mdash; that the tax rates are too high, therefore I must evade tax; the tax rates are too high, therefore I must emigrate; the tax rates are too high, I must consult my accountant for a tax evasion scam.</P>
    <P>Let us compare that with other pieces of anti-human ignorance that have been put into print lately such as an article by a person called Mary Ellen Synon who, in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 12 January 1992, wrote these little gems: &ldquo;Profit is the finest, and only moral, reason for one man hiring and another man working&rdquo;. Earlier she stated:</P>
    <P>For no politician, so far as I can see, has the moral courage to say that what the Government must do is urge its citizens to work first for profit for themselves; not to work for the common good (whatever that is), certainly not for `others' (whoever they might be), absolutely not so that the poorer can get what they have not earned, and get it at the expense of those who have earned (why should they?).</P>
    <P>In another part of that article she said: &ldquo;Peter Cassells always touches my heart with such talk&rdquo;&mdash; about the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash;&ldquo;but then: Cassells wants the phasing in of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, which would be like tossing Finance's cheque book out the window to the mob&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We should think hard about the kind of moral vision that lies in these statements. How different are they from the famous and discredited statement from Mrs. Thatcher that there is no such thing as society?  The views of Ms. Synon and the Progressive Democrats of the person alone at home trembling and saying: &ldquo;The tax rate is too high, I think I will emigrate&rdquo; are empirically nonsense because figures have never been produced to show the number of people who emigrate as a result of such tax.  About 70 per cent of the people who emigrate <Col N="1360" /> from my constituency &mdash; I have been studying this matter for about 20 years &mdash; would stay if they had any job at all. However, the Progressive Democrats believe that people emigrate because the top rate of tax is too high.  The O'Malley theory of humanity seems to be justified on the basis not that you are much by being human but that you have much.</P>
    <P>There are some absolute gems in the speech we have just heard, such as its reference to our mutual future.  The Minister Deputy O'Malley, spoke about the debilitating effect of high marginal tax rates on work and effort, but that is an old chestnut.  There are some new ideas also in his speech.  He introduces a new concept called the virtuous circle.  The idea is that down through the years penal rates of personal taxation applied in this country, all possible ways and means of avoiding tax were resorted to and benefits in kind were used by companies to pay senior executives in particular.  What a sordid view of society and of the connection between morality, politics and economics.  It is a pathetic view of mutuality. How could he insult our intelligence by saying that there can be any such thing as our mutual future when we are all apparently to be motivated by such values?</P>

      <P>I can readily understand the wish of this House to express its views on the present dreadful situation that is developing in the North of Ireland. It is only natural that we would wish to place on record, at least, our total condemnation of these latest atrocities. Our hearts go out to the people of Northern Ireland.  They deserve much better. To all the people of Northern Ireland let me say they have our deepest sympathy and understanding at this state of affairs that prevails throughout the Six County area.</P>
      <P>We have all now become hardened to the statistics, but perhaps it is no harm to mention them again in their entirety. Over the past 20 years almost 3,000 people have died.  What we would like to do, apart from expressing our sympathy to all those who have been affected in one way or another by this appalling violence, is to appeal for an end to it all.  It is quite clear to everybody that it has now assumed a self-feeding spiral dimension and nobody can now attempt to forecast where it will end.  We can only hope there are enough people of goodwill who have enough influence to try to ensure that some sanity will be restored to that demented part of our country.</P>
      <P>I think we must also say &mdash; although this is no time for recriminations by anyone in this House &mdash; that we expect the British authorities to take every possible measure open to them, to take all the steps available to them within the law, to bring this period of horror to an end and to protect the lives and welfare of people on all sides of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Words are lightly spoken and we must be very careful not to say anything here that would in any way exacerbate or inflame the situation.  Nevertheless we all wish to send our message of deepest sympathy to all the people in Northern Ireland and to express a hope that the agony to which they are now and have been for the past 20 years subjected will <Col N="1362" /> sooner rather than later be brought to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful that we now have the opportunity of expressing our views on this matter.  I wish to make it clear that in making my remarks &mdash; and I am sure this is true also of the Taoiseach and other contributors &mdash; this House is expressing its horror not just at the murders that took place in the past two days but also at the appalling premeditated murder by the IRA of a number of workmen at Teebane, County Tyrone.  Our sympathy goes out to all those who lost their lives in this way.</P>
      <P>It is important that the House should recollect that this campaign of murder is a propaganda campaign.  Each murder is timed deliberately for political publicity effect.  Those who are killed are simply instruments in a propaganda campaign that is callously and carefully planned. In most cases these are not the acts of mindless people or those who are insane. These are acts of people who are making cold, political calculations that the best way to obtain publicity for their cause and to create desperation among the general population which will allow a situation to be created in which people will concede to their demands is to commit murders. They consider that the more horrible the murder the better, because it makes for more effective propaganda.  Therefore, it is very important that all of us in democratic politics should take steps to deny these groups the publicity gains they hope to make.  Clearly, the most effective way we can do that is by creating structures for proper constitutional political dialogue within Northern Ireland.  In that way people in Northern Ireland will have other channels in which to express their legitimate concerns and in that way the attention that these violent organisations seek to get for their demands through murder will not be granted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that we in this House do everything we can to create conditions for the resumption of active political discussions between the political parties in Northern Ireland.  For my part, I have been meeting recently with all the <Col N="1363" /> political parties in Northern Ireland with a view to expressing my party's concern that we will do anything we can on this side of the Border &mdash; including looking at the provisions of our Constitution &mdash; that would be helpful in creating a sense of mutual confidence among politicians in Northern Ireland so that they can get together and start working constructively and building a democratic future together.  In that way the vacuum that these calculating murderers are using for their political ends will be removed.</P>
    <P>It is obviously important, however, that there be adequate security measures to bring the people concerned to justice.  I appeal to everybody who has information about any of these murders, or who committed them, to give that information to the security forces on both sides of the Border.  Furthermore, anyone on this side of the Border who is aware of where IRA arms may be hidden on this side of the Border should immediately give that information to the Garda Síochána.  It is only if the arms which are being used &mdash; some of which may well be stored on this side of the Border &mdash; are identified and confiscated by the Garda that we can be absolutely sure that the logistical supply network which keeps some of these terrorists organisations in operation will be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I believe the majority of the crimes originate entirely within Norhern Ireland but, to some extent, there is a cross-Border dimension.  To the extent that there is a cross-Border dimension, it is important that we have complete extraordinary arrangements that work fully and effectively between both parts of the island and cross-channel.  I know the Government now share this view and that there is a promise that legislation will be introduced in the near future.  I urge the Government to introduce this legislation straightaway.  I urge the British authorities to do whatever they can of a legislative nature to facilitate that matter.  I understand there are actions that they need to take on their side.</P>
    <P>It is important that people have complete confidence in the security forces on <Col N="1364" /> both sides of the Border.  That requires that the security forces for their part do everything they can to create conditions so that that confidence will be freely given.  One provision of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was that &ldquo;save in exceptional circumstances there would be an accompaniment of all UDR patrols by RUC members, by the civil power&rdquo;.  I hope this provision will be fully implemented and that the Irish Government will use their influence to ensure that that happens so that the co-operation and information will always be given by everybody to ensure that the perpetrators of those murders are brought to court and tried in the normal way.</P>
    <P>There should be complete co-operation not just between the Garda and the RUC but also between the military on both sides of the Border to ensure that there is no opportunity for people to use the Border in any way as a means of avoiding detection or apprehension if they have been involved in crimes of that kind.</P>
    <P>This is not the occasion for a detailed exposition of the policy measures that need to be taken.  I hope that it will be possible for a comprehensive debate on Northern Ireland to take place in the House in the near future so that Members can indicate our willingness to do everything in our power to bring the appalling cycle of deliberate murder to an end.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to convey to the families concerned the heartfelt sympathy of the people on this side of the Border for the loss that they have suffered. We all know what it is to lose a loved one.  The sense of numbing loss that individual communities must now feel and their sense of apprehension that this is just this week's horror, that there will be another horror next week and yet another horror the week after, must stop. That sense of tragedy combined with hopelessness is something that must be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I appeal to everybody, politician and ordinary citizen alike, who can do anything to bring the tragedy to an and &mdash; and every citizen has a responsibility <Col N="1365" /> because every citizen may come into possesssion of information which could lead to the apprehension of those involved &mdash; to do all in their power to bring the appalling cycle to a close.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I first thank the House for so speedily responding to the unanimous request that we be enabled, in however inadequate a manner, to express our sentiments on this day.</P>
      <P>The first thing we have to do is convey without exception and without preference our total and utter sympathy to all of the victims and to the relatives of the victims right across the six counties of Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is a small community and there is not a single family within it that has not been touched by the appalling litany of carnage that has occurred during the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>In the view of the Labour Party, violence is the manifest result of the failure of politics to solve the problems of the communal sharing of the space of this island.  The continuation of violence &mdash; and I say this in this democratically elected assembly &mdash; is a reflection upon politicians not just of this House but of the elected Houses of these two islands, who together share the ultimate responsibility for finding the political framework within which some form of democratic politics can emerge, some form of democratic politics that can provide political space for every type of aspiration and communal value.</P>
      <P>To that extent, while we are not directly touched by the violence that has wreaked havoc in Northern Ireland, we are continually affected by it and I appeal to all, not just in this House but also in the other Houses that have responsibility on these two islands, and in the houses that are empty today because of the failure of the political process to fill them. If we do not renew our efforts to find a formula that will accommodate the political process &mdash; however difficult that might be &mdash; then all that we can promise to the victims of violence is the reality of more violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish <Col N="1366" /> to address the Unionist community in Northern Ireland on two fronts.  I say to them that over a long period on this side of this island a House that was originally divided on the question of relations between Britain and Northern Ireland finally came together under the guise of the New Ireland Forum and worked out an honourable historic compromise which retains the legitimate aspiration to national unity and the unequivocal disavowal of the use of violence as a means to achieve it.  Having done that, the Unionist population, who are an integral part of the Irish nation and the community which shares this island and who have made a unique contribution to its culture, have nothing to fear from the people of this side of the island and their elected representatives.  I further wish to say that the Provisional IRA do not act in our name, do not draw any mandate from our institutions or our traditions &mdash; of which I am justly proud &mdash; and in no way can derive, in any sense, shape, size or form, a justification for murder from the history of our Constitution or from the Proclamation of 1916.  Indeed, the 1916 Proclamation calls upon anybody who acts in the name of Ireland not to despoil that name in any manner that would result in rape, murder or any other kind of violence.</P>
    <P>I say to all people who share my dream of a nationalist coming together on this island broad enough to encompass the traditions of everybody who lives on this island, whether they be here for a thousand years or for 30 years, that they can find only within the democratic process, and only within the political space that we as politicians must create, an alternative to the violence that has wreaked havoc on so many families.</P>
    <P>I conclude as I must, as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, by recognising the small but significant contribution that has been made in Northern Ireland by the trade union movement there in attempting to keep some of the violence that spills over into the communal areas of life out of the workplace. There is some flicker of hope that if that can be achieved in that small portion of <Col N="1367" /> the lives of those people lucky enough to be at work in Northern Ireland, then perhaps the abilities that combine in that area might combine in a communal sense to find a solution elsewhere.</P>
    <P>My last word is addressed to my fellow professional politicians of both these two islands off the mainland of Europe &mdash; the only mainland that I recognise.  We have to renew our efforts, we have to put aside prejudices and perhaps in some cases cherished traditions that are effectively preventing us from providing the political framework within which the real progress of politics can be made.</P>
    <P>This has been a necessary opportunity for this House to say to the people is this island, north, south, east and west, and, in a broader sense, to the people of this island who no longer have the possibility of living on it, whether they be in England, North America or anywhere else, that we will renew our efforts to find some form of political solution and to provide a glimmer of hope to the people who have been the victims of the dreadful carnage.</P>

      <P>If there were any people, north or south, who had become dulled by the regular, almost ritualised, killings in Northern Ireland throughout the past 20 years then they must surely have been shaken out of their apathy by the horrific events of the past few weeks. There have been 11 deaths since the weekend and 27 deaths since the beginning of the year.  For two days in succession Belfast has been hit by acts of sickening violence which repel all decent people, north and south.</P>
      <P>There can be no winner from this appalling cycle of violence, which has degenerated into new depths of viciousness in recent weeks.  Each act of sectarian violence by one side is met by an equally vicious response from the other side: the Provos massacre building workers at Teebane, the UFF bring death and suffering to customers in a bookie's shop in the Ormeau Road.  The entire community are the losers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> The majority of people, who have shown so clearly that they oppose the carnage, must take a stronger stand against the paramilitaries.  The demonstration against violence in Belfast on Tuesday organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should be only the start of a massive campaign to deliver a clear message to the gunmen to get off the people's backs.</P>
    <P>While all paramilitaries must be opposed with equal vigour, citizens in the Republic must recognise that we have a particular obligation to take on and defeat the Provos.  People in the Republic, including politicians, cannot stand aside and remain indifferent to the violence and terror in Northern Ireland. Bomb attacks against the people of Belfast must be viewed with the same seriousness as if bombs were being placed in O'Connell Street or Grafton Street. The murder of Protestant workers in Teebane or of Catholics in Ormeau Road must be viewed in the same light as if they were happening in Tipperary or on the North Circular Road in Dublin.  It is time the people of the Republic followed the courageous example set by the people of Cooley last summer following the murder of Thomas Oliver.  All democrats must shun the Provisionals and all those who would offer any excuses or act as apologists or offer them any comfort, direct or indirect.  We must challenge them and what they stand for, from the local authorities, from the trade unions, from community groups, residents associations, sporting clubs and anywhere else they are found.  The Provos and all paramilitaries must be treated as a common enemy by all democrats.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the current events surely the democratic politicians in Northern Ireland must now accept that they cannot stand aside and allow the sectarian gunmen to continue to submerge Northern Ireland in a sea of blood. The people of Northern Ireland are crying out for political leadership and statemanship.  Instead, they have got politicians who appear to believe that posturing and preservation of their positions is more important than the pursuit <Col N="1369" /> of peace.  They may well now have a matter of weeks, if not days, to prevent Northern Ireland from enduring a level of violence and death not yet contemplated. They must now review political dialogue as a matter of urgency and ensure that progress is made on establishing the democratic structures so necessary if terrorism is to be isolated and defeated.</P>
    <P>None of us is under any illusion that dialogue or even agreement between the parties on democratic structures would automatically bring an end to the horrific violence, but without progress on these matters the prospect of freeing the people of Northern Ireland from their terrible ordeal becomes even more remote.  If politics is not to lose all relevance and meaning for the people of Northern Ireland, the party leaders must either do the job for which they are elected or stand aside and make way for political leaders who will.  When I say that we in the South must recognise the realities, I include recognising the reality that it is a political myth to believe that the Unionist people regard themselves as part of the Irish nation and recognising that it is a political myth to believe that they can be cajoled or persuaded to join a united Ireland as a lesser evil than the violence they are now enduring.  It holds out a false hope for people North and South if that is presented as an option, because it is not an option.  We must face realities. There are two communities in Northern Ireland and they are divided in their political loyalty, by their history and by how they regard themselves with regard to the Republic of Ireland and with regard to Britain.  We in the Republic must face that reality if we are ever to have any hope of undermining the Provisional's position and the politics they stand for, because basically that is what they argue. I do not pretend to know or understand all the complexities of the situation but I appeal to all politicians to try to understand the nature of the problem in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to convey my sympathy to the families and the community of those people who are being slaughtered and who will continue without doubt to be <Col N="1370" /> slaughtered in the next few days.  It is as inevitable as night following day that there will be more deaths in Northern Ireland in the coming days and weeks.  I offer my sympathy to those communities and families whose loved ones are being taken from them in such an irretrievable and brutal way.  We are rapidly reaching a point when democratic politicians have to decide on the balance of protecting the lives of our citizens and protecting the freedom of those who may be engaged in that kind of activity.  As a former victim of internment I do not like to consider that as an option, but the authorities North and South must actively put that on the agenda and consider whether that may be an action which may be necessary to protect the lives of people who are entitled to go about their daily business in Northern Ireland without let or hinderance or the threat of death.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks I said that it was very important to try to discern from the budget how it viewed certain social problems that affect our people.  I invited any political commentator or any Member of this House to carefully read the text of the speech of the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, to look for where &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; occurs in the speech.  One will find in the speech an obsessive concentration on this theory of humanity that I described before we adjourned briefly, this concentration on individuals motivated by tax breaks to either stay in the social system or to leave it, individuals disposed towards being <Col N="1371" /> moral or otherwise, depending on their tax breaks.  I described such a vision of humanity as a rather blinkered vision, one that cannot be squared with any definition of society, and it is close to the abandonment of society to the thinking of the departed and discredited Mrs. Thatcher.</P>
      <P>This is one of the few opportunities I have to address this.  The comprehensive rejection of any social responsibility in the Minister's speech apart from the tedious throwing in of a comment on our mutual futures, does not constitute the acceptance of the responsibility of being a member of society with the necessary implications for solidarity.  I cannot stand up here and say that it is a good thing if people on the top incomes make £60 per week out of the budget and people on the bottom incomes make 60p out of it. That is an indication of how one thinks society should be structured.  The budget can always claim to be more than it is, but people should come out openly and say where they stand on this moral political economic question.  I pay tribute to the Progressive Democrats because they are an honest party.  They simply say that society is not important for them, that they do not want to be bothered by any daft egalitarian notions, as they would put it, that they do not want to be bothered with dragging everybody up, as they put it.  They say that their focus is on reducing tax and that then investment will break out and jobs will return.  Then there is the need for them to say something about the unemployed, in case a few branches get nasty.  That is how one could summarise this Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech was un-Irish, anti-social and it rejected social solidarity.  The speech is based on a crass thick advancement of individualism.  That policy marches us steadily backwards to a time before we had such things as the welfare state in its day, in Britain, and so on.  I give the Progressive Democrats credit for honestly purveying these views.  What is harder to see is the views of the other parties and where they stand in relation to this.  It is worthy of some investigation. <Col N="1372" /> I have very little time, but I would emphasise that we have just heard powerful emotive statements about events in Northern Ireland.  They should remind us above all else about the ultimate connection there must be, in any society that is going anywhere in terms of developing itself, between language, politics and action.  The horrific level of death in Northern Ireland seems to focus the minds of people here to the point when we have had a rare expression, in which the language fits the events that they are describing.  When is this to happen in relation to the economy, in relation to society?</P>
    <P>I have been speaking of this for 11 years.  In 1981 I stood here and said there was such a concept as the de-peopled economy, which could be doing well.  I defined it as an economy with low interest rates, low inflation rate, good export levels by comparison with imports, balance of trade figures and balance of payment figures.  I called that version of the economy a de-peopled economy.  In speech after speech from the Government side they tossed out these mantras such as &ldquo;in this difficult economic climate in which we find ourselves when at last the Government finances are being got right&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>Always there was an emphasis on creating a climate of investment.  The public know that the climate of investment for which they were asked to sacrifice pay levels, to pay high taxes and to sacrifice their children by way of emigration was not investment of the usual kind.  It is being said that we are all affected by the current scandals.  We are not all affected by them.  The scandals of the past year were precisely those which came from people who put personal interest before national interest.  The scandals derive from a version of investment which was about speculation, not production.  The chickens are coming home to roost.</P>
    <P>The people who got the adulation during my time in politics were those who made money, irrespective of how they did it.  People acquired funds through <Col N="1373" /> purchasing companies and getting involved in asset stripping.  They were praised week after week by people who did not want to know how many employees were dismissed when the balance sheet was cashed in.  The Fitzwiltons and the others went through the Irish economy and closed down one company after another.  Then we had described in the papers, by appalling low level journalism, their consumption patterns.  They have all been in the headlines during the past 12 months.  These people are not committed to Ireland or to Irish society. They are the worst kind of people.  They are the people being lauded according to the ethics I have heard this morning, the people whom people like me should worry about keeping in the country.</P>
    <P>A number of people trained like me in economics noticed an interesting omission from the budget.  I can guarantee the Government would have support if they said they would make it illegal for offshore companies to purchase shares quoted on the Irish stock market or in the lesser markets or if they decided to impose an 80 per cent tax where it was discovered to have happened in the past two years.  Here is the moral question put to me.  I am supposed to accept the suggestion from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, and others that I cannot do anything about unemployment unless I make it attractive for that kind of scum to stay here pretending that they are part of the human economy when they are just speculative scum about whose departure ordinary decent people would not shed a tear if they saw the whole bloody lot of them soaring off in some jumbo jet.</P>
    <P>The budget is an illusion.  Most of the decisions are taken in relation to the Book of Estimates, but people are offered this ritual of the briefcase and the arrival and the quasi-secrecy of the whole thing as if, as is said in the case or royalty or the pigeons in Britain, there were some historical continuity in it.  It is about the same level.  I welcome the closing of some loopholes in relation to scams involving share options, for example. This is what the Republican Fianna Fáil <Col N="1374" /> and the new realism of the Progressive Democrats have presided over, as had their friends in Fine Gael in their day. One could be given a share option as part of one's income and could wait until that 50p share was worth £600 and then exercise the option to purchase.  Was not that a sweet arrangement?  &mdash; no 19th century gombeen man buying the cattle at the fair and leaving them to be fattened for three months.  It is from that tradition it came.</P>
    <P>If there is not an expression in the elected component of the system towards problems of unemployment, poverty, low incomes and degradation, there will be solidarities forged outside this House which will not have much patience with the kind of thinking we heard this morning. We are elected by people who know that we have a health system where one cannot grow old with dignity, where one will walk past a notice saying that one must have ones money before they will look at one.  Nowadays the debt collectors will go after a person who forgets to fill in a form which is not available in the hospital anyway.  Health, the elderly, educational participation, emigration and the submission on poverty made by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors &mdash; what attention is paid to these?  These are problems in society.</P>
    <P>Any Minister for Finance or member of Government, any person taking decisions which are political, must answer the fundamental question: do the people exist to serve the economic structures, that is the economy viewed in a de-peopled way, or is the economy a complex set of instruments to serve social priorities?  Are these social priorities motivated by a theory of individualism or by some kind of solidarity?  The honesty of Deputy O'Malley's position is that he is a naked individualist.  All his individuals have a mutual co-existence in the future in their greed.  He is not too worried about it.  To turn politics around one has to be willing to give way on the concessions on the higher rates, even in the short term, if it means expanding the bands to enable more lower income people to escape paying tax.  One must <Col N="1375" /> be willing to carry the cost of the transfers that are necessary in terms of social expenditure to raise the conditions of society.  Nobody worth his salt who is progressive, not to speak of being socialist could do that.  That is what socialism always was, a celebration of the solidarity at the heart of things.  It was a comprehensive rejection of individualism which was centuries earlier.  It was that to which the original impulse of socialism expressed itself before its deformed expression.</P>
    <P>Cúrsaí eile atá tábhachtach ná an imirce, an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht. Níl éinne i mó dháilcheantar nach dtuigeann fadhb na himirce.  There is no moral support here for the continual failure in trying to restore the level of overseas development aid.  There is a generosity in the heart of the Irish people.  There is support on this side of the House for anything the Minister may want to do to try to meet our obligations in relation to overseas development aid. For the fifth successive year its allocation has been cut in this budget.</P>
    <P>Then I look at what has happened in relation to the money that was available to emigrants in the United States and think of its being cut from £200,000 to £50,000.  When I asked about it I was told, now that some of those people had visas, the problem was not as great, whereas everyone who has ever been an emigrant knows that it is precisely now, when one has either failed to get a visa, or when some of one's friends or neighbours have got one, one becomes more marginalised than ever.  There is this miserable rejection of the Irish abroad, in the case of our emigrants.  The rejection of the moral impulse of the people who want to reach out to the poorest of the poor countries of the world is something that belongs within the technical thinking of an economy without people but which, I suspect, indeed I know, does not have support among the majority of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>In contributing to this budget debate I shall confine my <Col N="1376" /> remarks specifically to the areas for which I have responsibility.</P>
      <P>On my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health, the Government gave me special responsibility for the delivery of child-centred services. In particular I was given the task of co-ordinating the efforts of the Departments of Health, Education and Justice. I was also given the task of improving the level of accommodation and services for young homeless people and young offenders.</P>
      <P>It was becoming increasingly apparent to the Government, to the Taoiseach in particular, that, because the delivery of child-centred services was spread over three major Government Departments, Health, Education and Justice, on occasions there was a tendency to encounter difficulties in the smooth and efficient provision of those child-centred services.  The Taoiseach and the Government recognised the need, early in 1991, to introduce a mechanism to achieve co-ordination in the provision of these services, resulting in my appointment.</P>
      <P>Throughout 1991 I have engaged in a considerable amount of preparatory work in terms of researching the problems obtaining, meeting the statutory and voluntary agencies involved and identifying the steps needed to be taken to effect improvements in this area.  Resulting from my actions in this regard a number of initiatives are coming to fruition which will result in a much needed improvement and expansion of the services in this area.  I might add that my various meetings with the statutory and voluntary agencies were extremely productive and informative.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to all those working on the statutory side, and in the voluntary sector, who provide services of one kind or another for our children.  Having met them on many occasions, both on an individual basis and as representatives of the voluntary organisations, I have been struck by their dedication, commitment and ability to involve themselves in the provision of child-centred services from a wide range of sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> Turning to the matter of homeless children, I have been working closely with the health boards and voluntary agencies with a view to effecting substantial improvements in the availability of services and accommodation for young homeless people.  I contend it is totally unacceptable in a modern society such as ours that youngsters should be homeless, vulnerable to nefarious influences. Therefore, my immediate objective is to ensure that additional hostel places and other forms of accommodation are provided for them so that no young person should have to sleep rough on the streets of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that, since my appointment to this special position, considerable progress has been made over the past year.  New services are being developed, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Athlone, Galway and Sligo, involving the provision of extra places for young homeless people.  Considerable progress has been made also in providing new services and accommodation in the Eastern Health Board area where the problem was most acute.</P>
    <P>Among those important new developments there is a new emergency hostel, providing ten places for homeless girls at Sherrard House.  We are about to open a new therapeutic unit for eight difficult adolescents, boys and girls, to be operated by the Eastern Health Board, located near Naas, County Kildare.  Most of the senior and middle managment staff have already been recruited.  We expect to open this facility around Easter. Essentially it is the first of its kind and has long been sought by professionals working with homeless and disadvantaged young people.  Indeed, it is welcomed by both the voluntary and statutory sectors.</P>
    <P>There is to be a new residential unit for ten boys, to be run by the Los Angeles Society, due to open in Dalkey in County Dublin in April 1992.  The existing hostel for homeless boys at Percy Place, which has been run by the Catholic Social Service Conference, will be relocated to refurbished accommodation at Eccles Street within the next few weeks, a total of ten places being available there.  In <Col N="1378" /> addition a new after-care service for up to four boys leaving that hostel has been established at Lennox Street which will work closely with the Eccles Street hostel.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Eastern Health Board are taking a number of other initiatives. These include establishing an &ldquo;after hours&rdquo; social work service to deal exclusively with the young homeless, a service not available heretofore.  At my various meetings, in particular with the voluntary agencies, they pointed consistently to the absence of such a service which meant, essentially, that if any young persons found themselves out of home late at night or in the early hours of the morning, there was no organised facility available to meet their needs at that time.  The Garda also mentioned the fact that occasionally they would come across a young person on the streets late at night but there was no statutory facility available to which they could bring such person.  The after hours social work service now being provided by the Eastern Health Board will meet this need and will link in with the voluntary sector, working closely with them in this regard.</P>
    <P>There will be also a &ldquo;carers for young people&rdquo; scheme to provide family care for adolescents who have experienced difficulty in adapting to other settings. We are recruiting families to take young adolescents into their homes on an emergency basis.  This is an endeavour to meet the needs of young persons who, for various reasons, may be unable to remain living in their family homes.  We are endeavouring to recruit families so that young people will not have to be institutionalised in order to meet their accommodation or housing needs but rather be placed with a suitable caring family, affording such young people and the statutory services an opportunity of resolving the difficulties that led to such a young person having to leave home in the first place.  The Eastern Health Board are also developing other short term accommodation such as sheltered flats and semi-independent living accommodation. We are also developing, through the health boards, a special <Col N="1379" /> foster care programme for young travellers.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a series of meetings, under my chairmanship, with the Eastern Health Board and the main voluntary agencies involved with the homeless.  I cannot over-emphasise the need for close and harmonious relationships between the health boards and the voluntary sector, indeed among the voluntary agencies themselves.  Co-operation and liaison are essential for the most effective delivery of services and efficient use of resources. The voluntary sector has made an invaluable contribution to the development of services in the past, and, I hope, will continue to do so in the future.  A number of new services approved last year are being developed by voluntary bodies in co-operation with the health boards.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, urgent steps are being taken to increase the number of hostel and other places available for young people.  In the longer term the objective must be to identify the underlying reasons for homelessness among young people and set in place preventive measures to tackle those problems at their roots.  In that regard I am totally committed to the new thinking emerging within the various health boards around the country on meeting the needs of young people finding themselves out of home.  In referring to young people I am confining my remarks to people of 18 years and under, thereby meeting the provisions of the Child Care Act which was passed in July 1991.  The community-based response to this need has to be the ability by the statutory and voluntary agencies to provide places for young people who find themselves out of home within their own community.  For that reason the establishment of hostel facilities and care of families will go towards meeting that need.  I believe it is unwise to take young persons out of their own community just because they cannot live in their own family home and to place them far away from friends, schools and other connections they would have in their original home-based area.  Consequently, I am happy to say that two such <Col N="1380" /> hostels one in Tallaght for boys and the other in Ballymun for girls are proving extremely successful.  Part of the success is based on the commitment of the staff in both of those hostels.  Young people who cannot remain in their family home should be accommodated and provided for within their own community setting. That will allow the young person to continue going to school in their own local areas and to continue to have contact with their own friends and in some cases with their own siblings.</P>
    <P>The problem of youth homelessness is not, of course, confined to Dublin.  I have had discussions with the chief executive officers of the other health boards concerning appropriate measures to assist the young homeless in their areas.  The aim is to ensure, as far as possible, that each health board is self-sufficient in terms of the availability of residential placements for young homeless.  This is fully in keeping with the Child Care Act and the new obligations it imposes on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children.  Progress is being made on a number of fronts in this regard.  A new hostel for homeless youth is being established in Athlone by a voluntary group in association with the Midland Health Board.  A new residential service for eight to ten adolescent boys is being developed near Limerick by the Mid-Western Health Board; it was to open during 1991 but has been delayed because of local objections.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to make a plea to local communities, when health boards and voluntary agencies are attempting to provide accommodation for young people, to think carefully before objecting and before taking any action which might delay the provision of such facilities.  When such facilities are planned and provided you can rest assured they are needed in that area. Also, additional places have been provided in County Donegal for children and adolescents with behavioural problems. A new hostel for homeless youngsters is being developed in Sligo by a voluntary body with support from the North-Western Health Board.  The building of a new <Col N="1381" /> residential unit for teenage boys in Cork city is nearing completion and will open early in 1992.  A specialised foster care programme for difficult children is also being developed by the Southern Health Board.  A new hostel for homeless girls is being developed in Galway by the Western Health Board in association with a local voluntary group.</P>
    <P>Solvent misuse is one of the problems associated with young people who are detached from home.  On 1 December last, my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Rourke, introduced new controls on the sale of solvents to young people which were brought into operation.  It is now an offence for retailers or others to sell or make available any substance that he or she knows or suspects a young person will use for glue sniffing.  The penalty is a fine of up to £1,000 and/or up to 12 months imprisonment.  The Garda have also been given new powers to seize substances in the possession of young people in a public place which they believe are being misused. The new controls complement the work which is being undertaken by the health promotion unit of my Department to educate young people, their parents and those who work with them on the hazards associated with the misuse of solvents.</P>
    <P>The need for improvements in services for the young homeless is but one aspect of the essential improvements required in our child care services.  In 1991 a sum of £1 million was made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and a further £0.5 million from the national lottery to initiate a range of developments in our child care and family support services.  These developments include: the recruitment of 30 additional social workers; the provision of new children's residential centres in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Donegal; additional hostel places &mdash; to which I have already referred &mdash; for young homeless at Dublin, Athlone, Galway and Sligo; and new child psychiatric services in the North Eastern, South Eastern and Mid-Western Health Boards.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was made available <Col N="1382" /> for child care in this year's budget and will be used to fund the implementation of substantial elements of the Child Care Act during the current year.  Many people interested and working in the area of child care have expressed concern about the Government's commitment to expedite the implementation of the provisions of the Child Care Act.  There can be no greater proof of the Government's commitment to speedily implement all the provisions of the Child Care Act than their action in including funds to continue the excellent progress made last year in developing our child-centered services and the provision of child care.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to bring into operation most of Part II of the Act which contains many of the preventative and service delivery provisions.  Section 3 imposes a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and empowers them to provide a comprehensive range of child care and family support services.  Section 5 imposes a statutory duty on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children.  Section 6 requires health boards to provide or ensure the provision of an an adoption service in their area.  Section 7 requires each health board to establish a child care advisory committee to advise and assist them in the performance of their functions under the new legislation, and sections 9 and 10 enable health boards to make arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide services on their behalf and to grant aid them for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I have made arrangements for the provision of a national lottery grant of £75,000 to the Eastern Health Board for the replacement of its mobile health clinic for travellers.  Since this facility was introduced some years ago the service has proved tremendously successful in bringing health care directly to travellers living in halting sites and other encampments. The new vehicle, which is being specialy built for the purpose, will be staffed by two public health nurses.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in this regard it is extremely difficult from a health point of <Col N="1383" /> view to deliver adequate and sufficient health care to travellers, and particularly to the children of travellers, when the basic facilities required in terms of accommodation are not available.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Health to provide health care for travellers and we are endeavouring to concentrate additional resources in this regard &mdash; I have already referred to one specific provision for the Eastern Health Board.  The sad fact remains that too many travellers are on unauthorised sites despite the fact that, through the Department of the Environment, moneys are available to local authorities to provide accommodation and to meet the needs of the travelling community.  From a health-delivery point of view I appeal to all those with responsibility in this regard to ensure that basic accomodation, whether halting sites or whatever, is provided as quickly as possible for the travelling community.  Only then can effective health services be provided for travellers and particularly for their children.</P>
    <P>In regard to young offenders, a new centre for boys was opened at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin on 30 September 1991.  Difficulties arose at one stage in recruiting a sufficient number of suitably qualified staff which necessitated a phased introduction of the new facility. It currently has a capacity to take ten boys on remand and a further four boys on long term detention.  Over the next two months this will be increased to twelve remand places and 24 long term places.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware of the media attention to this issue which has concentrated, to some extent, on the lack of adequate accommodation for young offenders.  The development of Oberstown, Lusk, will go a long way to meet this need.</P>
    <P>A new long-stay unit for girls was also opened at Oberstown on 30 September 1991.  This unit now forms part of the girls' centre there and complements the existing remand and assessment facility for seven girls.  The new long-stay unit has a current capacity to take four girls <Col N="1384" /> on long term detention and this will increase to eight long-stay places when the additional staff referred to become available for duty.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, it is proposed to transfer the girls' centre from Oberstown to a new purpose built facility which is planned for construction at Finglas.  That facility is scheduled for completion in mid-1993 and will have accommodation for eight girls on remand and a further 12 on long term detention, including three places in a secure unit.  I have been advised that this number of places will be sufficient to meet the need in this regard.</P>
    <P>The transfer of girls from Oberstown will release additional capacity for use by Oberstown boys' centre.  Apart from providing a significant number of additional places for boys a fully operational Oberstown boys' centre will provide for greater flexibility in accommodating young male offenders. This is particularly the case where, for example, a secure place is required and not immediately available.</P>
    <P>I should point out in regard to young offenders that it is our aim to take whatever measures we can in the community to prevent young people getting into trouble with the law in the first place.  In that regard I was very pleased with the commitment given by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, who indicated that he would be bringing forward a juvenile justice Bill during the course of 1992 to allow for greater flexibility in accommodating young male offenders.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy to prevent drug misuse is being developed.  I am the chairman of a special committee who are dealing with this matter.  I wish to thank in particular all the members of the committee working with me.  Since the strategy was published I have chaired a number of meetings of this committee who are working actively to oversee the implementation of the various recommendations across the different Departments and agencies involved in the prevention of drug misuse.  I would like to express my appreciation to them for the <Col N="1385" /> long number of hours they have put into his development.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the Estimates £3 million was provided for the provision of child centred services and to fund the new developments which had been put in place in 1991.  In this year's budget an extra £2 million has been placed at the disposal of my Department for the improvement of child centred services and for the development of new facilities. This means that this year alone we will be investing £5 million specifically for the provision of child centred services and to implement important sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, fine legislation which the Government are committed to implementing fully as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the new Minister for Finance on his appointment and on the presentation of the budget. Unfortunately, I cannot congratulate him on the contents.</P>
      <P>I searched in vain in the Minister's speech for any proposals that the Government might have to tackle the problems of the west.  Indeed, I searched in vain for even an acknowledgment that these problems exist.  What is new, the Minister might ask, about the problems of the west?  The west has always had its problems.  From the time of Cromwell through the great Famine, through successive waves of mass emigration, it has always been a struggle for survival but always the resilience of the people, their determination and their love of the land ensured survival.  I am not sure that this will be the case in this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of the present crisis can be seen in cold statistics.  During the past 65 years, between 1926 and 1991, Connacht lost 24 per cent of its population.  At the same time the population of Munster grew by 4 per cent while the population of Leinster grew by 62 per cent.  Even these figures do not tell the sad story of the decline of the west.  The forces of depopulation did not strike evenly. Within the overall figures the population of County Leitrim, for instance, fell by a frightening 55 per cent during that same period.  Some areas in my own native <Col N="1386" /> south Sligo and across the border in Mayo suffered an even greater haemorrhage of their people.  In County Sligo as a whole the massive decline of some areas is consistently camouflaged by the growth around Sligo town.</P>
    <P>That is the sad story as relayed by the statistics but those who have lived there do not need statistics.  We experienced the mass exodus of the fifties.  I was part of it for a while.  We have also had the mass exodus of the eighties.  This is not folklore and it is not history.  It is what is happening now.  The out-migration is naturally severest among the young.  One recent study has shown that in the eighties quite a number of areas lost over 60 per cent of the people in the 17 to 30 age group.</P>
    <P>In 1969, I did an RTE &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; television programme on emigration in south Sligo when I interviewed a great old gentleman called Davey Hegarty, then aged 82.  I asked him a general question on the extent of emigration in the area and his reply was:</P>
    <P>The way it is here, Mr. Nealon, when I go into the town of Aclare on a Friday evening to draw my pension and they ask me how are all the men in Tourard, my answer is you are looking at them. I am the oldest man in the townland and the youngest.</P>
    <P>There have been many Tourards before that and, unfortunately, many more since.  The result is a seriously imbalanced population profile, a potholed road profile, with most of the middle missing where all the action and all the traffic should be.</P>
    <P>Once the British economy improves as the economies of the United States and mainland Europe improve, we will witness a further exodus from the west such as we have never seen before.  That is what is happening and this budget does nothing about it.  It does not even make an attempt.  Can the west then continue to survive?  The answer is no unless the Government produce a major, massive and planned programme for its survival. Sadly, there is no evidence of this in the budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> Unless we have an acknowledgment by the Government of the problem, a commitment to do something about it and a strategic plan we will have, for a great part, a province without a people. Perhaps it will be a prosperous province for those who remain but what is a land without its people, with tourists being shown around the houses where we grew up, just as they are now being shown around the megalithic tombs at Caramore or the Ceide fields of Ballycastle?</P>
    <P>For any kind of progress the first step must be a recognition by the Government that action is needed, then the political commitment to deliver on that action.  So far that recognition and commitment is absent among politicians.  It is present, however, among the Bishops of the west who are leading a campaign and drawing up their own plans.  The huge attendance at their meetings is an indication of just how close they are to the feelings of the people.  They are striking a responsive chord.  Why should it be left to the Bishops? After all, we are the people who have been elected to do this work.</P>
    <P>Previously we could rely on farming to sustain some population to at least keep the west alive.  It has to be said that the early days of the European Community in the seventies brought considerable advances to the farming community but, unfortunately, they did not last long enough.  We now have the threat of Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT negotiations.  I predict that if the Common Agricultural Policy reforms go through resembling in any way the present proposals, we are witnessing the last generation of small farmers.  People will be supplanted by trees.  Those remaining will have to use the telephone to bid good day to a neighbour and they will have to look up in the air from the surrounding forests to see whether it is day or night.  Forests are all right but not forests from the Shannon to the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>In the area of forestry development there is something important the Minister can look at and that the Government can do immediately for the west, that is, to ensure that the woodpulp industry, which <Col N="1388" /> will come soon, is located in the north west and not on the east coast as some of the planners would have it.  We are regularly reminded that there will be generous compensation cheques in the post from Brussels to make up for income loss arising from the Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  The young people will not be satisfied with this kind of compensation, however generous and however long guaranteed.  They want to be able to make a decent living from the fruits of their work and from the marketplace, not from cheques in the post.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Finance &mdash; and to his colleagues who will be conducting the final negotiations on GATT and the Common Agricultural Policy reforms &mdash; to use the veto if the survival of the west is at stake, as I believe it will be, if we accept the present proposals. Surely the survival of the west is a vital national issue.</P>
    <P>The help coming from Brussels so far under regional and structural plans is ineffective and fragmented, a plethora of schemes without any central direction. As John Hume told the meeting of Bishops in Galway, real regional planning must become a reality in the west of the future, with the development of regional structures and decentralisation of power and decision making all properly resourced.  I was very disappointed that the budget speech and the budget provisions did not contain a single suggestion that the Government might be thinking along those lines.</P>
    <P>In the west we are on the periphery of a periphery but no major effort has been made to improve access which will become vital in the Europe of 1993.  The nearest a Euro route goes in our direction is as far as Kinnegad; we had virtually to revolt, not just to get a half decent train service to Sligo, but to save the existing line from being scrapped.</P>
    <P>In tourism, where our great potential lies, we have only been tinkering round the edges.  The only initiative we have heard very much of so far is in agri-tourism. This is something which will benefit the odd farmer with a big house <Col N="1389" /> overlooking a lake, a river or a picturesque valley.  It will not do much for anybody else.  A properly developed tourist industry in the west, with all its special attractions, could give employment to 25 per cent of the population.  I hope that the new tourist study group, headed by a civil servant of great imagination and inventiveness, will acknowledge this potential and recommend to the Government the ways in which it can be developed.  I mentioned earlier the danger of the whole west of Ireland being turned into a heritage centre but that does not mean that a major folk park on the lines of Mellon Folk Park or the Cultra Folk Park in Northern Ireland should not be developed.  The west needs major attractions to make it a destination for tourists that no decent tourist guide book can omit.</P>
    <P>In all these developments, in the exploitation of our natural resources, there must be someone to take the initiative and with the financing to do so.  Some local authorities have done just that, with excellent results.  They have been very enterprising and they should be encouraged and financed to become much more involved in this development work.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation of Government Departments is another area of considerable potential.  With improved communications there should not be any insurmountable difficulties as they can be placed anywhere along the west coast, as far as Kerry and west Cork.  Here I must pay tribute to my predecessor, Commissioner MacSharry, for his work in bringing the pensions section of the Department of Social Welfare to Sligo.  I have seen its effects, which have been considerable, on the town and hinterland.</P>
    <P>One of the most depressing sights travelling through the western counties are the recently vacated houses going to ruin with maybe a cow staring out a window between the remnants of the still hanging curtains.  Nothing deteriorates as fast as a deserted and locked house.  These houses have all the existing services, all the infrastructure is in place, with local schools and churches in danger of closing because <Col N="1390" /> of lack of people.  Surely there must be some way, some mechanism, whereby these houses could be purchased, by the local authorities perhaps, preserved and made available to people who would live there &mdash; this would sustain the local population &mdash; instead of seeking houses, where none exist, in the towns.</P>
    <P>The possible remedies about which I have been talking are only isolated examples, they will not solve the problems of the west.  What is needed is the regionalism about which John Hume spoke when he addressed the meeting organised by the Bishops in Galway.  A real political commitment and a major plan are needed.  The west can be saved but it will not happen by accident.  It can be done despite all the forces ranged against it.  The greatest of all lies in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy because, if it goes through, as I said earlier, we will be witnessing the last generation of small farmers.</P>
    <P>The reaction to the Bishops' meeting in recent months shows that the resilience, and the determination of the people of the west, which showed up in every generation in the past, is still there.  They will do the job but the odds against them are so great that on this occasion they must be helped by central Government, a regional plan and by politicians.  It is a fact that we, despite all our efforts, have consistently failed to get over to our city colleagues what is happening in the west. I hope that the Taoiseach-in-waiting &mdash; a man born on the west bank of the Shannon &mdash; will not waste any time in supplying the help to which I referred.  The budget does not even acknowledge that special help is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget introduced last Wednesday by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, provides once again, in a significant way, for the implementation by the Office of Public Works of Government policy in the areas of public sector accommodation, arterial drainage, development of inland waterways, conservation of national monuments and historic <Col N="1391" /> properties, management of national parks, the protection of flora and fauna and the operation of the Government Supplies Agency.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should acknowledge at this stage, the tremendous contribution which the Office of Public Works have made to Irish life since they were established over 160 years ago.  There is hardly a parish in the country which at some stage or another has not benefited from the operations of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago some concern was expressed about the office's handling of certain projects and there were calls for radical measures.  It would have been easy to go with the tide but the Taoiseach, with his usual foresight, saw that the Office of Public Works had a vital role to play and that what was necessary was a fine tuning of their operations with greater focus on achieving their targets on time and within budget.  As usual he was right and it can hardly have escaped the notice of the Members of the House that the Office of Public Works have put their affairs in order and now enjoy the confidence of Government and public alike.</P>
      <P>The budget makes provision for the continuation of work of the highest standard in the provision of State accommodation. I could be said to be a visitor to Dublin and I can see the great improvements that have been carried out to our public buildings in recent years. Dublin's upsurge architecturally can be traced back to the work of the Office of Public Works as agent of this Government. Dublin Castle, the venue of our Presidency of the EC in the first half of 1990, the Custom House, and the former College of Science now Government Buildings, are a testimony to this &mdash; and we have not finished yet.  I was particularly proud of the major contribution made by the Office of Public Works to Dublin's year as Cultural Capital of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget provides for a continuation of works at Dublin Castle at the Treasury Building in the lower castle yard.  It also <Col N="1392" /> provides for the continuation of the Garda building programme as well as the completion of phase II of the major upgrading of Templemore Garda Training Centre.  New courtrooms are being provided in the Four Courts this year as well.</P>
    <P>In order that the unemployed can transact their affairs with dignity we have a programme for the provision of new and improved employment exchanges. This year the budget provides for the completion of the new exchange at Finglas and I hope that work will start later in the year in Tallaght, at the Navan Road, Dublin, and on the adaptation of Carlow employment exchange.</P>
    <P>I am particularly proud of the role being played by the Office of Public Works in the Government's programme of decentralisation.  As the House is aware, the decentralisation programme is a major policy objective of this Government. It is based on the need for a more widespread location of public service jobs and job opportunities.  Over the years, many provincial regions suffered considerably from the effects of emigration of its people, particularly the young generation, to Dublin to work in the public sector.  While they maintained strong ties with their native areas, there were little or no opportunities to return on a permanent basis.  The decentralisation programme is giving that opportunity to substantial numbers of people.  There is also the very desirable long term objective of helping to reduce regional imbalances and the pressures on the Dublin region.  As a rural Deputy I cannot emphasise too strongly the importance of this programme, to which Deputy Nealon also referred in his contribution.</P>
    <P>Phase one of the programme was completed in 1989 and saw the transfer of some 850 staff to Cavan, Galway, Sligo and Ballina.  Phase two is well on the way to completion: offices at Letterkenny, Killarney and Athlone are occupied by over 500 staff and projects are under way in the remaining three centres, Ennis, Nenagh and Limerick.  The building in Ennis has been completed and the building in Nenagh will be completed shortly. <Col N="1393" /> The building in Limerick is scheduled for completion at the end of the year.  Over 900 staff of the Revenue Commissioners will occupy the three buildings.</P>
    <P>Phase three of the programme was announced last June.  It involves moving sizeable sections of nine Government Departments to eight important provincial centres &mdash; Cork, Longford, Tullamore, Kilkenny, Wexford, Portlaoise, Dundalk and Waterford.  The number of staff to be moved will be in the region of 1,500.  A contract has been entered into in respect of accommodation in Kilkenny and work has begun on site.  Tenders will be received this month for the offices in Longford and Cork and construction work is expected to begin in the summer of this year.  Preparatory work in relation to the other centres is in hands.</P>
    <P>It has been possible to implement and maintain this major capital programme through an innovative and imaginative partnership between the private sector and the State.  It has resulted in a design-build-finance arrangement which is a novel approach in the context of State building development in this country.  A competitive tendering arrangement results in the successful developer providing a new building for the State on a deferred purchase basis over a period of 20 years.  The cost of the accommodation provided so far compares very favourably with the cost of rented space in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is the towns which have been selected as locations for decentralisation which will benefit most from the programme. The local economy of these towns has received a considerable boost by the injection of, on average, about £3 million annually in wages and salaries. This has major spinoff effects for local business, shopkeepers and house builders.</P>
    <P>The benefits are not confined, however, to economic ones; there are important social effects which impact on the regions.  The arrival of upwards of 200 people in a particular area will play a very important role in the regeneration process of that region and will help in no small way in the future development and vitality of the region.  Immediate benefits <Col N="1394" /> will be felt by the various sporting, cultural and social organisations and outlets.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation programme helps to maintain and expand employment in the building industry.  It is reckoned that the completion of seven projects so far has resulted in capital expenditure of some £14.75 million.  Jobs in progress at present and those scheduled to start in 1992 will involve further capital expenditure of about £22 million, and the remainder of the current programme will result in expenditure of the order of £12 million.</P>
    <P>This substantial capital expenditure has been achieved through the use of the design-build-finance arrangement at a time when the Government are committed to reducing the debt burden.  It shows the Government's support for the building industry and their determination to maintain jobs in the industry using a novel approach to the State's building programme.</P>
    <P>The Government are proud of what has been achieved by decentralisation. The towns to which public service staff have already been moved are reaping the economic benefits of the programme.  A welcome shot in the arm has been provided to the business, commercial and social life of the communities and to the building industry generally.  This budget will ensure that the remainder of the programme will be carried out with similar success and with similar benefit to all concerned.</P>
    <P>It is no idle boast to say that the Office of Public Works was &ldquo;green&rdquo; long before that term became fashionable.  I know from experience that the Office have pursued an enlightened and imaginative approach to the protection of our environment, both built and natural.  Perhaps the Office foresaw the growth in visitor numbers to this island and their capacity now to deal with the large inflow is evidence of that foresight.  While always conscious that conservation of the resource is the primary objective, this has nevertheless always been balanced with <Col N="1395" /> the need to provide for access to monuments, or landscapes through the provision of appropriate infrastructure.  I will have more to say about this later.</P>
    <P>The conservation of areas of outstanding landscape quality and representative types of ecosystems is the most important function of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Five national parks have been established and to date 71 nature reserves, five refuges for fauna and 68 wildfowl sanctuaries have been designated.  Suitable sites for conservation purposes will be acquired as they become available.  Additional funds are being provided for this purpose in the current year and I expect further funds will become available through the EC later in the year under new regulations.</P>
    <P>As all will be aware, there is an increasing interest in all sections of the community in the conservation of our environment.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service are playing a major role by identifying areas which need to be conserved as part of our natural heritage. These areas have been classified as Areas of Scientific Interest, ASIs, and include such areas as peatlands, dune systems, wetlands, grasslands, bird sites and marine areas.  For some time past the National Parks and Wildlife Service have been reviewing their policy on ASIs and a report will shortly be presented to Government on this important issue, taking account of the recent High Court judgment.</P>
    <P>In the area of international co-operation the problems and challenges which face wildlife conservation are common to all states and do not recognise national boundaries.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service service a number of international conventions in this area. The EC Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds is implemented in Ireland by the National Parks and Wildlife Service under the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended.  The Council of Environment Ministers of the member states of the European Community agreed in December 1991 to a new Habitat Directive.  This is very important for <Col N="1396" /> wildlife conservation and places an obligation on member states to protect habitats and species of European importance. I know that there are those who will express concern when EC Directives place strictures on us and impose new obligations.  Very often local communities feel an extra burden is placed on them.  Yet in the overall European Community and national interest these are necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one or two projects in this area which are provided for in the budget.  The provision of a new interpretative centre in Coole Park Nature Reserve, County Galway, is nearing completion and will be opened to the public later this year.  The interpretative centre at the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve in County Wexford has recently been upgraded and fitting out works will commence shortly.  Works are continuing on the establishment of a nature park at Doneraile, County Cork.  Nineteen ninety two will see the completion of the new park interpretative exhibition and information area at Muckross House in Killarney National Park.  It will be open in time for the main summer season.  Further improvement works are to be carried out in the area surrounding Muckross House, in particular the main car park which will be landscaped.  A further contract for the eradication of rhododendron ponticum from the park will be carried out this year.  This will be supplemented by summer workcamps of voluntary conservation workers.  This &ldquo;introduced&rdquo; shrub threatens the continued existence of the native woodlands in the park and must be eradicated if this important element of our natural heritage is to survive.</P>
    <P>Ireland's countryside has to a great extent been preserved intact partly by traditional farming methods and late industrialisation compared to other European countries.  All of us have a responsibility to pass on this unique and valued heritage to future generations. The National Parks and Wildlife Service will continue to preserve this heritage and promote the conservation of our flora <Col N="1397" /> and fauna.  I need not stress the importance of a clean environment and preservation of our natural heritage.</P>
    <P>This budget provides for the erection of a number of major interpretative centres.  At this stage I want to say how extremely disappointed I am that our actions in the Office of Public Works are misunderstood.  We are, after all, the Government's principal heritage conservation agency and we have no intention of bringing about a deterioration of the great fund of national assets which we have painstakingly built up over many years.  Everything we are doing at our heritage sites is a continuation of a well-defined policy relating to the management of public access to the heritage landscape.  What we are doing fully conforms with Government policy in the matter, as enunciated by the Taoiseach when he opened the Council of Europe Colloquy on &ldquo;Access to the Heritage Landscape&rdquo; in Dublin Castle last September.</P>
    <P>While the identification and conservation of our heritage, both natural and cultural, must remain a priority, this in itself is not enough.  This heritage belongs to the people and it is essential to provide public access to that heritage where this can be done in sympathy with traditional usage and presentation.  To this end my office have continued to seek control of heritage areas through acquisition and management agreements with landowners.  However, conservation cannot be successful through the actions of the State alone.  It is vital to inform and educate the general public so that every citizen will be aware of the importance of conservation and will approach the management of his or her own property with an eye to conservation. Interpretative centres are a key element of our strategy to inform and educate the public.  At these centres the public will be given an experience of an element of our natural or cultural heritage and an interpretation of the importance of that element and what conditions are necessary so that it will survive for future generations to see and experience.</P>
    <P>The Government have provided <Col N="1398" /> money in this budget to enable work to start this year on interpretative centres at Dún Caoin, An Blascaod Mór, County Kerry; Wicklow National Park, Corlea Bog, County Longford and Boyne Valley National Archaeological Park, County Meath.  These centres have been designed with great sensitivity, to the highest standards and subject to strict environmental controls.  Independent environmental impact statements have confirmed in the first three cases that these centres will not cause any significant adverse environmental impacts. The independent environmental impact statement on the Burren National Park Centre will be published this week and I would be surprised if it does not show that there will be no adverse impacts arising from this project.  Should that be the case, I would expect that having gone through the appropriate public consultation process, we would be able to commence work on this centre before the end of the year.  An environmental impact statement is being prepared for the Corlea Bog Centre and this will be published in due course.</P>
    <P>I had the honour, on behalf of Ireland, to sign the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage. This was done at the Third European Conference of Ministers responsible for the Cultural Heritage held in Malta on 16-17 January last.  The convention aims to ensure a common Europe-wide approach to the protection of the archaeological heritage based on sound scientific principles and the best international standards.  The main provisions of the convention require: statutory protection of archaeological remains and the establishment of inventories of sites, support for maintenance and research, regulation of archaeological excavation and the movement of artefacts, integration of conservation policies into the planning process, promotion of scientific study and public awareness and the exchange of information and expertise with other states.  I am glad to say that Ireland, mainly through the activities of the Office of Public Works, <Col N="1399" /> conforms with these requirements and that, following the proposed legislative changes to give further protection to archaeological artefacts, we will have a very sound statutory basis for the protection of our archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's conference also welcomed the participation of several of the newly-structured Eastern European countries and resolved to assist them by providing technical support and advice, as it is recognised that one of the most effective ways of integrating with the West is through the areas of culture and heritage.  Ireland, through the Office of Public Works, will contribute to this process by offering to make available its expertise gained over the last 30 years in archaeological survey techniques.  Other means of encouraging pan-European co-operation in the cultural heritage field will also be explored, including participation in exchanges of experts, professional workshops, training, studies on the effects of pollution on antiquities, archaeological research and projects to raise public awareness such as the annual European Heritage Day.</P>
    <P>A sum of £16 million is being provided this year for national monuments and historic properties.  This covers a wide range of activities reaching every corner of the country.  It includes archaeological survey and excavation, conservation work on national monuments, ongoing maintenance of monuments and parks and the provision of improved facilities for the public at selected sites.</P>
    <P>I am happy to announce that the first stage of an accelerated programme of archaeological survey will be completed this year and sites and monuments records for each country will be available. This will enable the various planning authorities and other organisations such as Coillte and the Farm Development Service to ensure that our archaeological heritage is protected from inappropiate development.  With this programme drawing to a successful conclusion the Office of Public Works has now commenced an inventory of our entire post 1700 A.D. architectural heritage.  This is <Col N="1400" /> a necessary prerequisite to establishing the mechanism which will ensure the survival of this important part of our built heritage.</P>
    <P>This year's budget also provides over £6 million for the maintenance and development of inland waterways. Deputies will be aware that the Canals Act, 1986, transferred responsibility for the Grand and the Royal Canals and for the Barrow navigation from CIE to the Office of Public Works.  This was most important legislation since it conferred on the Office of Public Works the duty to develop these waterways as a public amenity.  The Commissioners set about this task with enthusiasm with the result that today the Grand Canal is fully navigable from Ringsend to the Shannon and the Barrow, which is connected to the Grand Canal by a stretch of canal known as the Barrow Line, is fully navigable to St. Mullins and all the way to Waterford for more experienced boatmen.  Steady progress is also being made on the restoration of the Royal Canal, which many people had feared would prove impossible. Already navigation is possible from Mullingar to the suburbs of Dublin and it is expected that the eagerly awaited breakthrough to the Liffey will be made towards the end of this year.  Restoration work is also proceeding steadily westwards from Mullingar towards Longford and the Shannon at Clondra.  There are major obstacles to be overcome including low bridges and other crossings which would obstruct navigation and the availability of an adequate water supply is a critical factor.  All of these matters are under active consideration in the Office of Public Works and I have every confidence now that the target of opening navigation along the full length of the Royal Canal will be attained.</P>
    <P>An enormous amount of progress has been made in the six years since the Office of Public Works assumed responsibility for the system and it is hard to believe that not so long ago these waterways were regarded as derelict and there were proposals to fill them in and turn them into roadways.  The maintenance and development of these waterways for <Col N="1401" /> amenity purposes is a multifaceted project. In addition to navigation they can and have been used for fishing, walking, swimming and canoeing.</P>
    <P>The canals in particular have the potential to become very important coarse fisheries with a significant tourist potential as well as providing enjoyment for the local angling clubs.  Significant progress is also being made on the development of the fisheries aspect of the waterways.  The Office of Public Works have engaged the Central Fisheries Board to undertake a five year development programme involving restocking of the canals, weed control and water quality monitoring.  The All-Ireland Coarse Angling Championships were held on the Grand Canal in Dublin last year and there are a number of international angling competitions being established on both the Grand and Royal Canals.</P>
    <P>The potential of the waterways as walking routes is virtually unlimited, passing as they do through so many towns and villages.  There is a great diversity of flora and fauna to be found and enjoyed throughout the system.  The Commissioners have engaged botanists for the past number of years and propose to do so again this year to survey the system to identify scientifically and environmentally important areas.  The policy of the Office of Public Works in managing the system is to conserve species by facilitating natural growth and development to the maximum extent possible.  There are instances from time to time where the clearing of areas is essential but in such cases the areas will be allowed to regenerate naturally.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of such a network is not, of course, without its difficulties. Deputies will, I am sure, recall the major breach which occurred on the Grand Canal at Ticknevin near Edenderry in County Offaly in 1989.  This was quickly and expertly repaired.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have been developing facilities on the Shannon on a progressive basis for many years.  Projects which were completed last year included major repair to Victoria Lock and Meelick Weir and the provision of a <Col N="1402" /> new pier at Portrunny.  Work is currently under way on the construction of major extensions to Terryglass Pier and the harbour at Banagher.  The extension of navigation to Ballinasloe along the River Suck is in progress and work will start shortly on the re-opening of Lough Allen Canal to extend navigation to Lough Allen.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on a major cross-Border project to re-open the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  This work, which is jointly sponsored by the British and Irish Governments, is being undertaken under a special arrangement with the ESB.  It is due for completion late next year.  The Office of Public Works have commenced the task of preparing a management plan to ensure that they will be in a position to maintain and operate the canal to the highest standards once it is re-opened.</P>
    <P>A survey of the Erne navigation was undertaken last year and work to remove some obstructions will be undertaken later this year.</P>
    <P>I look forward eagerly to the day in the not too distant future when the cities and towns of Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Ballinasloe, Enniskillen and Belturbet will all be linked at the extremities of a fully navigable waterways network.</P>
    <P>Following an extensive process of consultation, the Commissioners will shortly introduce by-laws for the control of the Shannon Navigation.  The proposed by-laws are designed to improve the operation and enjoyment of the system for everyone.  In carrying out their responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the waterways system the Office of Public Works work in very close co-operation with voluntary organisations, local authorities and State agencies.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I have demonstrated that this is a sound budget, particularly in so far as my area of responsibility is concerned, and I commend it to the House.  I have touched on many aspects of the work of the Office of Public Works.  The range of their operations is vast and today one will not find many serious critics of their work or the <Col N="1403" /> way they go about it.  The Office of Public Works occupy a unique place in Irish life. They are a faithful trustee of our heritage and a loyal guardian of our environment, and that should always be the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking in this House in the last few years I have tried to facilitate the press by preparing my speech in written form and making it available, but I then felt I had been confined to my text.  Many of us have fallen into this trap and the quality of debate in the House has suffered as a consequence. Therefore, regardless of whether a word I say appears outside, I intend to speak in a more informal manner today.</P>
      <P>The economy of this country has a unique characteristic at present on which nobody has commented.  More than any other country on which I can find information our balance of payments surplus is increasing to a point which is phenomenal. The figure in the budget for the balance of payments surplus is 6.75 per cent.  In Japan it is only 2 per cent and in all other countries for which figures are given in the ESRI bulletin there are minus quantities for a balance of payments deficit.  A country in our happy position is free from constraints.  We have often had the experience in the past of having to limit domestic consumption and hold back the growth in living standards because of our balance of payments difficulties.  We are now in a position where, if we had the means available to us, we could encourage and stimulate consumption.  We cannot do this by monetary means because of the dominance of the Deutschemark and our links to it.  If we reduce interest rates there will be an outflow of capital, which we could not afford.  We do not have &mdash; no more than any other country in Europe &mdash; freedom in this respect.  We are constrained to maintaining our interest rates at levels linked to the Deutschemark.  The Deutschemark is in difficulties, Germany is in difficulty and therefore we do not have that weapon open to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other weapon which could enable us to stimulate the economy is the fiscal <Col N="1404" /> one, that is reducing taxes, releasing money for and encouraging spending, but we cannot do this because this Government in their mishandling of the budgetary situation over the past two years have tied themselves up in such knots and have increased the level of borrowing so much that they do not now have the freedom to reduce taxes and stimulate growth, an option which is more open to us than any other economy at present.  That is the ultimate mess for a Government to make &mdash; to be unable to stimulate growth when all the means are there had they not got themselves into budgetary difficulties.</P>
    <P>That happened last year because the then Minister for Finance &mdash; who within two hours may be Taoiseach &mdash; decided, for reasons never explained and which I frankly do not understand, to virtually double the rate of borrowing when there was no great pressure on him to do so. In last year's budget he increased the underlying level of borrowing from 1.5 per cent of GNP, to which it had fallen in 1990 under the good husbandry of both Mr. MacSharry and himself in his first budget, to a figure of 2.85 per cent for 1991.  That was masked for the time being by a delay in payments coming in from the EC and by putting the fortuitous, once-off privatisation money from the Greencore privatisation into the Estimates.</P>
    <P>It thus looked as if the rate of borrowing had remained unchanged.  It was not unchanged, however.  It had almost doubled, but that was hidden by these fortuitous events.</P>
    <P>Why the then Minister for Finance had allowed himself to be tempted into such an inappropriate policy, when there was no pressure to do so, merely because he had the chance to cover it up by the late arrival of moneys from the EC I do not understand, but the effect is that the present Minister for Finance &mdash; a different Minister &mdash; has to face the task of trying to reduce borrowing and he has managed to get it one-third of the way back down to the figure it was in 1990, that is to 2.4 per cent.  But doing that, he <Col N="1405" /> has been unable to stimulate the economy. This is a neutral and not a stimulatory budget.</P>
    <P>In terms of our budgetary position it is inadequate, for it has not done enough to get us back to the point where we were at on the way to eliminating borrowing, which we would have done this year if the original budgetary strategy had been maintained; and in terms of what is needed, it does not stimulate the economy.  It is exactly the wrong budget both ways.  The Government have managed to get themselves into the position where they are doing the wrong thing because they did not have a tight enough budget to get the debt-GNP ratio down rapidly enough, and at the same time are not able to stimulate growth, and this is an uniquely undesirable position for the Minister for Finance to find himself in. The budget is in both ways an inappropriate budget.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to get our debt-GNP ratio down to 60 per cent by the year 1999 or to be approaching that figure in a consistent and continuing manner in order to qualify for entry to the single currency.  The opportunity to do that was there but it has been thrown away. Because it is unlikely now in the light of the demands left to be fulfilled in 1993 that we will get back to the 1.5 per cent debt-GNP figure next year, it seems as if we will have lost four years and that it will be 1994 before our borrowing level is back to the 1.5 per cent that had been achieved in 1990.  To lose four years when one has only nine years to reach the target does not seem to be sensible and whereas we had made sufficient progress towards the target that, had we not been diverted in 1990, we would be able to release some resources to stimulate growth, we cannot now do that either.  We have lost out both ways.  By any standards that is bad budgeting.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Reynolds is elected leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and selected as Taoiseach next Tuesday there will be a certain poetic justice about the fact that it will fall to him as Leader of the Government to face into the difficulties in 1993 of getting the budgetary situation under <Col N="1406" /> control and that it is he who will have lost the possible benefit of growth stimulation as a result of taking the wrong action in 1990, whereas if he had done the right thing he might be able at this stage to use the leeway provided by the balance of payments surplus to stimulate the economy in order to mark his assumption to the office of Taoiseach, which I am sure he would have liked to do.  There is some poetic justice about the fact that he cannot do that.</P>
    <P>Next year he will not be able to take that course either because he will have to face the problem of VAT harmonisation. We now have six rates because in addition to the rate of 12.5 per cent, we now have the rate of 16 per cent, and we still have to face the whole process of rationalising the VAT rates for, as the Minister said in the budget he intended to &ldquo;rationalise the coverage of VAT&rdquo;. The top rate of VAT is pitched too high because it is 3.5 per cent above the British rate and if we leave it at that level we could be back to the position where we may see a migration of shoppers to Belfast on a scale that would be very damaging to our Border areas.  Money has to be found to reduce the top rate of VAT first.</P>
    <P>The DIRT tax problem has to be sorted out.  I hope that can be negotiated in part, at least, in Brussels and that the failure hitherto to agree on a deposit interest retention tax system throughout the Community can be overcome, and that we do not have to eliminate it, even if we have to reduce it.  There is likely to be a loss of revenue in that area and it is possible that it will be quite substantial.</P>
    <P>We need to reverse the payment of VAT at the point of entry and nothing was done about that this year.  All the radical changes in the system required for the Single Market in 1993 have been left to the 1993 budget.  Nothing has been done about it to date.  Everything will have to be done together and God help the Minister for Finance who will have to face that problem when the time comes.</P>
    <P>We all recall that VAT at the point of entry was introduced in the phoney budget of March 1982 when Fianna Fáil <Col N="1407" /> came back into power again and wanted to abolish some of the taxes we had proposed in the January budget and, hey presto, they brought forward £140 million from 1983 to 1982 by introducing VAT at the point of entry, knowing perfectly well that it could not last indefinitely and would have to be reversed in time because of the EC requirements. That little conjuring trick which produced £140 million that enabled the huge gap in the Fianna Fáil budget of March 1982 to be apparently bridged has now to be done away with and of course there will be an equivalent loss of revenue of the order of £200 million to be faced up to.</P>
    <P>These problems will have to be faced on top of paying the 1992 as well as the 1993 public pay increases in the next budget.  This is a tall order.  Certainly it is very hard to see that in 1993, any more than in 1992, the Government will be able to offer a stimulation to the economy, which they otherwise could well afford because of the absence of a balance of payments constraint.</P>
    <P>We will find that our economy will grow slowly in 1992 and grow slower than it should in 1993 and perhaps up to 1994 because the Government failed to continue the policies which they carried out successfully between 1987-90 but which they reversed for no good reason, in fact stupidly, in 1991.  This is a most unfortunate result of bad Government policy.</P>
    <P>I think it needs to be brought out into the public gaze that we cannot take advantage of the extraordinary performance of our industry and agriculture in exporting on such a scale as to create a balance of payments surplus that has to sit there unused because the Government have not the capacity and the freedom of action to encourage and stimulate demand.  This is very disappointing.  The increased resources would stimulate domestic demand and domestic consumption, which is more employment-intensive than exports.  The exporting firms have done their job.  They have produced exports on a massive scale and we now have this huge surplus.  If we <Col N="1408" /> were free to stimulate growth, we would have growth in demand at home for domestic goods.  Employment would be created in domestic industries, because true employment comes from a demand for the goods that we use ourselves.  We would see a growth in employment in the less capital-intensive industries, and this would be a great relief in the present circumstances.  The Government have thrown away the opportunity they had to do something about unemployment as a result of the way they handled their affairs.  I think that needs to be said.</P>
    <P>I now wish to talk about tax reliefs in the budget.  Frankly, I consider them to be perverse.  The influence of the Progressive Democrats on Fianna Fáil has made Fianna Fáil even worse than they were.  Even before the Progressive Democrats went into Government Fianna Fáil were busy reducing the top tax rate and not concentrating on the threshold of the standard rate and on the basic allowances.  The money was already being put into reducing taxes for people who were better off.  With the Progressive Democrats coming into Government all of the concentration is in that area.  Of course, there is talk about doing something about the threshold, and there has been a small increase in it this year, but there has been a total failure to use the resources available to look after the overtaxed people in the lower tax bracket.  A huge amount of the resources has gone towards looking after those who are better off.</P>
    <P>In total, some £200 million has been used to reduce the top tax rate by 10 per cent in the past few years.  That £200 million could have been used in other ways.  One way in which it could have been used &mdash; although I am not saying it is the only way &mdash; would have been to abolish the 48 per cent rate completely and to put everyone on the 48 per cent rate or the 27 per cent rate.  In that way, 120,000 people would have had their tax rate reduced from 48 per cent to 27 per cent, rather than have to face an absurd marginal tax rate, including PRSI, of 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>That was not done.  Instead, this <Col N="1409" /> budget has done something that must be unique in the world, it has produced a marginal PRSI/tax rate for a worker on one-quarter less than the average industrial wage that is higher than the marginal tax rate for millionaires.  I do not think that has ever been done, in even the most reactionary country in the world.  The PRSI rate is higher for employed people than it is for a self-employed millionaire. The single man earning one-quarter less than the average industrial wage is now on the same 48 per cent tax rate as a millionaire but he pays more PRSI.  Does that make sense?  Is that social justice?</P>
    <P>That is the perverse influence of the Progressive Democrats in Government. I do not know whether Fianna Fáil on their own would have gone quite so far although they had already been putting money towards reducing the top tax rate. Of course we need a lower top tax rate; it is a little on the high side, but this is not the major problem.  Those who pay tax at the top rate are people whose jobs, on the whole, are reasonably interesting, and who have an incentive to work because of the kind of work they are doing.  Some of them are also making money, and that is a good incentive to work hard.</P>
    <P>Those who need relief are the ordinary workers on the factory floor who do routine repetitive work and who have 56 per cent of every extra pound earned taken off them.  This budget has done very little for them and we are left with the extraordinary position that single workers who earn less than the average wage pay a higher marginal tax rate than do millionaires. That is absolutely absurd and the issue needs to be brought out in this House.  I challenge any Deputy from the Government side to defend that system and say why that has been done.  The only defence I can recognise is that the Progressive Democrats wanted it.</P>
    <P>It is known that the supporters of the Progressive Democrats come from a particular category and I can see that the Progressive Democrats might have a political reason for wanting such a tax system, but they ought to have some sense of responsibility in pressing Fianna <Col N="1410" /> Fáil for changes that are so much against the general social interest.  The Progressive Democrats are an unusual party. For the first time in this House there is a party whose support comes mainly from people who are better off.  Hitherto Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil drew their support from across the spectrum and the Labour Party and The Workers Party had support from the less well-off sector.  The Progressive Democrats are the first party in this House whose primary voters are people who are better off.  The Progressive Democrats are in a position to use that leverage cleverly with Fianna Fáil to reduce the top tax rate at the expense of people lower down the line. The Government are not a good Government from that point of view.  One would not need to be an extreme left-winger to feel that there is something wrong somewhere when such policies are being adopted.</P>
    <P>The budget has done nothing to increase child benefits.  Do people realise what has happened to the child benefit? When Fine Gael were in office between 1981 and 1986 we increased the child benefit for the first child two-and-a-half times, and for other children by two-thirds. That meant that even though the cost of living was rapidly increasing in the early years of our Government &mdash; because we had inherited a 20 per cent inflation rate from Fianna Fáil, which we brought down to 3 per cent by the end of our term in office &mdash; there was a big increase of one-third in the benefit available to a family with two children and a somewhat lesser increase for a family with more children.  What has happened since we left office?  There has been a 75 pence increase in the child benefit rate, an increase of 5 per cent.  It is true that the cost of living is increasing less rapidly, but during the six years from 1986 to 1992 it has risen by about 20 per cent, about 3 per cent per annum.  The children's allowance has been devalued by 20 per cent or more under this Government in six years, whereas our Government increased the purchasing power of the benefit by 30 per cent.  That is an extraordinary contrast and I do not understand <Col N="1411" /> the philosophy behind it.  I do not understand why in a country where children are cared for, where people are child-oriented &mdash; thank God &mdash; and where there are many children, any Government would concentrate their negative actions on that sector by reducing the value of the child benefit year after year.  That is indefensible.</P>
    <P>I hope second thoughts will prevail and that perhaps the Progressive Democrats will let up a little and give Fianna Fáil a chance to do something in that area although I have to point out that even when the Progressive Democrats were not in Government, Fianna Fáil did damn all about the child benefit.  That has to be one of the worst social features of budgeting under this Government and their predecessor since 1987.</P>
    <P>I now wish to talk about a very different aspect of the budget, the attack on profit-sharing.  I have to declare an interest here.  I am a director of GPA, a company that has profit-sharing arrangements with their staff.  Three-quarters of the staff of GPA are shareholders of the company, which I have thought to be an ideal situation &mdash; I wish it applied elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Having said that, this budget proposes to remove the profit-sharing tax incentive. Perhaps second thoughts will prevail before enactment of the Finance Bill. The sum of money involved is about £1.8 million, a relatively small sum.  The budget also removes the tax relief on interest for people buying shares.  It may be that that relief needs to be limited in some way, but if the Government want employees to become shareholders in their workplace &mdash; and I think that should be encouraged &mdash; then the staff will need help to purchase shares.  Such share-holding arrangements are in the interests of the workers and in the interests of society, a society in which people have a real interest in their work and where management/labour conflict is eliminated. I have not heard before that Fianna Fáil are against that idea.  Staff need some form of help to buy shares under such an arrangement because in an <Col N="1412" /> ordinary industrial company the dividends paid on shares are low compared to the returns from investment in gilts, for example.  Sometimes the dividends paid are as low as 2.5 per cent.  Even if workers have money, they cannot easily afford to invest it for such a low return in the short-term, even though the value of the shares would increase over time. That is why the tax relief is justified and why it is very damaging to remove all of the reliefs together.</P>
    <P>I have only a limited amount of time left available to me but there are a number of points I wish to make.  I deplore the decision to cut the allocation to library services.  Last year £3.5 million was allocated to library services and only £2.15 million was spent.  The Government saved £1 million last year, so this year they have cut the allocation to £2 million &mdash; a cut of 40 per cent.  The damage done to library services in the past few years has been appalling.  Libraries are not opening and there are years going by in which they buy no books.</P>
    <P>The failure to do something about the housing problem is also to be deplored. The extent to which the Government have reduced the provision for public housing to a tiny fraction of what it was is totally unacceptable.  There are now 30,000 on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to give an assurance that the extra teachers to be employed will be put into disadvantaged areas only.  If the extra teachers were spread around the country and the pupil/teacher ratio was gradually lowered from 26:1 to 25:1 and then in a few years to 24:1 there would, no doubt, be a marginal benefit in having marginally lower numbers in classrooms.  But that should be compared to the benefit that would occur by concentrating the extra teachers in disadvantaged areas.  Classes could have half the number of pupils per teacher and the effect there would be astonishing.  If classes could be cut from 30 to 15 in disadvantaged areas we could really begin to make progress for the children who need help.  The benefits would be well beyond anything that could <Col N="1413" /> be achieved by a marginal reduction in class numbers across the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I deplore what has happened to development aid.  The development aid figure now stands at 0.17 per cent. When Fine Gael left Government the figure stood at 0.256 per cent.  Each Government in which I was involved increased development aid.  This Government reduced it.  In a country in which there is such remarkable private generosity to the Third World, the Government take advantage of that private generosity to cut public funding to the Third World.  It is intolerable and totally against the wishes of the people. There must be some relationship between what governments do and the strong sentiment of the ordinary people of the country.  The persistent reduction in this aid is another deplorable feature of this budget and of previous budgets from this and the immediately preceding Government.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the budget.  It has continued down the road we have travelled since 1987.  Our economic policies are clear and consistent and they will maintain low inflation and interest rates and will generate confidence in the country.  With regard to our economic performance last year, we had inflation of 3.2 per cent, a growth rate of approximately 2 per cent and a rise in non-agricultural employment of 7,000 a year.</P>

    <P>Because we are generally a caring people any Government here is a caring Government.  I am glad the Minister for Social Welfare has ensured that the less well-off people will be protected.  I welcome the number of significant social welfare improvements announced in the budget.  There has been a general increase of 4 per cent in all weekly social welfare and health board payments, along with a special increase of 6 per cent for short term unemployed people.  There has been an increase of £10 per child in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  There has been an extension of the over 80 age allowance to those in receipt of an invalidity pension and so <Col N="1414" /> on.  Social welfare increases above the rate of inflation ensure that people can have an adequate standard of living.  It would be better if we had jobs for the people but unfortunately the present climate is not right for creating the number of jobs we would like.  It is important, therefore, to protect social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The budget supports people who want to employ workers.  In stimulating employment we must have regard to the fact that the money must be there to back up the stimulus we may give.  The Minister in the budget recognised the need to help small employers to create jobs.  A subsidy of £54 per week for 12 months for up to 15,000 additional employees is available for people who have been on the unemployed register for at least two months.  Employers must keep people employed for an extra six months.  I hope employers who avail of this incentive will not let employees go when the scheme is finished, but will employ them permanently.  In the past, a number of employers availed of training schemes and FÁS schemes only to let the people go when the scheme was finished.</P>
    <P>In the last few years the Government created an economic climate which is good for job creation but the business people have not responded by creating jobs.  Many business people creamed off massive profits because the economy is on the right track.  The least they should have done was created a significant number of jobs, but that has not happened. Unemployment is our biggest social problem.  Problems of broken homes and other social problems can be directly linked to unemployment.  In many areas fathers, sons and daughters have not worked, and down the road, grandsons and granddaughters may not even work.  That should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>County Wexford is rich in agricultural resources and in many natural resources which have not been tapped.  Wexford has the highest rate of unemployment in the country.  Practically every Deputy who has spoken has said that his county has the highest rate of unemployment but <Col N="1415" /> over the last three or four years Wexford has had an alarming rise in unemployment figures.  We did not get any help or support from the IDA, the Department of Industry and Commerce, FÁS or the Department of Labour in creating jobs.  In other counties special emergency task forces were set up when industries closed down but in south-east Wexford we do not seem to get any support from the different Departments.  This should not be allowed to continue.  We want our share of the national cake, our share of the jobs on offer.  Every year the IDA produced glossy brochures saying that 30,000 jobs had been created and that 40,000 jobs had been created and that the IDA had reached their target.  I do not know where the jobs are, they are certainly not in Wexford.  If those jobs are being created in other parts of the country, we are getting a raw deal.  This should be corrected by the Minister and the State agencies.  I would ask the Minister to take a direct interest in County Wexford and ensure that we get our share of what is on offer.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is one of our major industries. I welcome the announcement of the Minister for Agriculture in the last few days that following discussions with Teagasc a number of centres scheduled to close will not close because the Minister has announced the provision of an extra £1 million pounds for Teagasc to ensure that research and development will continue at Grange, Athenry, Belclare, Kinsealy, Oakpark and Clonroche. Clonroche and Johnstown Castle are in County Wexford.  I hope they will be protected in the future.  At the moment we are hearing a lot about GATT and Common Agricultural Policy and farmers are being encouraged to diversify.  It is essential to have research and development in agriculture to help farmers, particularly small farmers, to diversify.  The Minister mentioned the possibility of joint responsibility with other State bodies for Johnstown Castle.  Will the Minister spell out what he has in mind?</P>
    <P>Agricultural research was founded at <Col N="1416" /> Johnstown Castle.  I hope that the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works will help to develop the castle, which has tremendous potential for tourism development and environmental and agricultural, research.  It could be a one-stop shop for a number of Departments and would have the additional benefit of creating jobs in the county.</P>
    <P>Small farmers throughout the country are finding it difficult to make a living for their families.  Their income is too low and it is practically impossible for them to survive.  I have raised this issue in three successive budget debates.  We hear much talk about keeping young farmers on the land, but most young people have no interest in remaining in small farms because of the low income.  I suggest that a family income support scheme for small farmers would be of great assistance.  This type of income support is available in the PAYE sector and I cannot see why it is not possible to extend it to small farmers. We should be able to secure funding at Brussels, possibly for a pilot scheme initially.  My experience of pilot schemes, however, is that they benefit only one or two counties.  If we make a strong case to Brussels to finance such an income scheme I expect that support will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I welcome the continuing reduction in tax in the PAYE sector.  Since 1989 the standard rate has been reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent, a reduction of approximately 25 per cent.  The higher rate is down to 48 per cent, which is a substantial reduction on the rate prevailing in the period 1982-87.  It is right that the Government should give an incentive to work and help the PAYE sector.  For ten or even 20 years the tax burden on the PAYE worker was a scandal. Others who could afford to pay were allowed to slip through the tax net.  I hope that next year the lower rate will be reduced to 25 per cent and that the bands will be widened further.  This would give a welcome incentive to work.  Employers say that during the past few years it has been practically impossible to get people <Col N="1417" /> to work because of the disincentives in the tax system.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has introduced a number of worthwhile schemes under the social housing plan. There is great interest in the shared ownership scheme.  Many people feel they would be able to purchase their houses if they could avail of the shared equity system which consists in part loan and part rental subsidy.  The Minister stated that 1,200 applications have been received and that a high level of interest continues to be shown in this innovative scheme.  I would ask him to speed up the decision-making process.  Only 20 per cent of the 1,200 applications have been approved and only 23 transactions have been completed.  We have the highest level of home ownership within the EC and those who wish to become home owners should be given every encouragement. Substantial amounts of money should be provided.</P>
    <P>Money should also be made available through the voluntary housing organisations. In the south east an organisation called Respond are building houses in a number of counties.  The allocation of £11 million in 1992 for voluntary housing will assist this process.  While shared ownership and voluntary housing are good ideas, we must also increase the number of houses being built by local authorities. A significant number of people will not be able to purchase their own homes and will need local authority rented dwellings. I would ask the Minister and the incoming Taoiseach to ensure that there is a substantial increase in the allocation for local authority house building.  In the major urban centres increasing numbers are seeking housing and local authorities are unable to meet the demand.  A cash programme is needed to reduce existing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on employment states that in 1991 65,000 students sat the leaving certificate examination and 51,000 applied for third level places. Eleven thousand failed to get the necessary minimum results to get a third level place.  The Department of Education recently announced a decision to means <Col N="1418" /> test ESF grants because people on very high incomes can avail of ESF grants in third level colleges.  In the case of middle income families the only hope of a grant for their children is through the ESF.  This group have been crucified by taxation and PRSI and they now find that they are not to qualify for these grants. This matter must be seriously considered. If there is to be a means test, the base must be substantially increased.  The current base is only £12,000.  Families on social welfare are getting that much.  An income up to £35,000 should be allowed before a grant would be disallowed.  If this is not the case there will be major problems for the children of middle income families.  I would ask the Minister for Education to examine this, the real issue at present.  It is one which will cause many problems for our young children. If we are not in a position to offer them jobs, then we must ensure that they can avail of third level education.  Indeed, since 60 per cent of the funding comes from Europe, I contend means-testing those grants is not the right direction in which to go.</P>

      <P>I agree with many of the points made by Deputy Browne in regard to housing in that, in addition to the shared ownership scheme and so on, there should be a positive housebuilding programme.  I sympathise with Deputy Byrne's disappointment that, although the climate had been created for additional jobs, they did not transpire. Rather, the Administration pocketed whatever funds they could lay their hands on, leading to even higher unemployment figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main concerns <i>vis-à-vis</i> these budgetary provisions are in the areas of education and energy.  Its most obvious omissions are what one might well have expected to have been the Government's main priorities at present &mdash; some plan for employment, for the creation of jobs, and some plan to alleviate poverty in our society, much of it stemming from lack of employment.  Nonetheless, poverty in our society is reaching crisis proportions. <Col N="1419" /> Merely maintaining social welfare payments in line with the prevailing rate of inflation will not pull anybody out of the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the housing crisis.  Always Fianna Fáil were regarded as the great benefactors of the construction industry.  It is all the more disappointing that there is no provision in this budget for any progress in local authority or private housing.  It must be realised that we are in the middle of a major housing crisis, there having been practically no local authority houses built since 1987, when Fianna Fáil resumed office and ceased all such housebuilding. There are no plans in any of those areas announced in this budget, an area to which I will revert when I have dealt with education and energy.</P>
    <P>The only comment I want to make on taxation, which most people perceive the budget to be all about, is that I cannot understand why such great concessions should be given to taxpayers on the top rate of income tax.  I cannot understand why the lower income tax band cannot be widened even to a figure of, say, £30,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Certainly, executives in State companies, doing an excellent job, earn £50,000 and £60,000 annually which is not an overstatement of their value.  But when one reaches the earning levels of, say, £120,000, £130,000 or £160,000 annually obtaining in the private sector &mdash; one of the main incentives to executives of State companies for privatisation &mdash; it is grossly insulting to people in receipt of lower incomes to maintain that such executives' top income tax rate should be reduced below the level of 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why there cannot be a top rate struck, thereby ensuring that no single person earning less than, say, £5,000 annually will be liable to tax. It is unbelievable that anybody must pay tax on an income of approximately £75 weekly or, in the case of a married <Col N="1420" /> couple, £140 weekly.  It is unbelievable that anybody in receipt of such income, almost within the poverty trap, must pay tax.  I cannot understand why that anomaly has never been addressed since I have been reiterating it over the past four or five years at least.  The exemption ceiling is raised annually, it being now at £3,500 for a single person, £7,000 for a married couple, and one is taxed on every penny above those figures.  I cannot follow that type of thinking.  I do not think anybody should be taking any great pride in our present income tax levels as representing any great tax reform, because they do not.</P>
    <P>There is the impression given that fantastic progress is being made in education in this budget in the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio to 25:2, which the Government were obliged to effect under their commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is amazing that people are under the impression that this reduction means that henceforth there will be no class sizes above 25:2.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There will continue to be thousands of pupils in classes of over 40.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Education a parliamentary question on 4 February, when he informed me that the statistics I had been seeking were not available.  The statistics available to us last year indicated there were 26,000 pupils in classes of over 40.  There are tens of thousands of pupils in classes of over 30.  I had sought information in regard to classes in excess of 30, 35 or 40 pupils but was informed that such statistics were not available.  We are told that there are 534,000 enrolments and 20,688 teachers employed in national schools, giving an average of pupils per teacher of 26.5.  Of course, there are class sizes of 13, 16, 17, and so on in small rural areas, but there are also class sizes of 40 and 45.  What we have been unable to ascertain from the Minister is how many of those classes will be reduced in size.  Unfortunately, these high class sizes, of 35, 40 and more, appear to be located mainly in what are described as disadvantaged urban areas. I do not like the word &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo;. <Col N="1421" /> I prefer the description &ldquo;deprived urban areas&rdquo; since they are deprived of jobs, facilities and so many other things.  When children in those areas enter school they are deprived because their families tend to have larger numbers of children.  This means there are greater numbers of children in those areas, thereby leading to higher class sizes so that from their entry into school they are deprived; their school is deprived and they are deprived. It is for those pupils there are supposed to be all these special facilities.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of remedial teachers, psychological services or guidance counsellors in this budget, services which had been growing in the early eighties and which it would seem have totally disappeared.  There is talk about &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo;, but the children attending schools in those areas, because of the very nature of their family homes, in which there would be up to 70 per cent unemployment, because of the nature of the school they attend with its high number of pupils per teacher, they are deprived from the day of entry.  It is true to say that such children's lives are mapped out for them from the day they enter school in that they are directed into a narrow, dull, draughty tunnel from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape as they progress through school into later life.</P>
    <P>One of the primary defects in the areas of education in this budget is that no special attention was devoted to remedial teaching, the allocation for which has been dramatically cut back over the part four to five years.  Indeed the provision of such remedial teaching is essential in schools with higher pupil/teacher ratios located in deprived areas.  This means that the problem continues into second level education, particularly in vocational schools, who do not stipulate any restrictions on entry.  They do not specify that a prospective pupil must have a certain qualification; they do not pick and choose; all children can seek entry to their schools.  From the day children enter those schools, having left primary school, the teachers and everybody are at a disadvantage because of the amount <Col N="1422" /> of remedial teaching required to bring them up to a reasonable standard where they can learn something.  Ordinary reading and writing is so deficient in schools of large class sizes in disadvantaged areas that a whole year could be spent at second level in trying to bring them to a standard where they can avail of the teaching which is available.</P>
    <P>Because of the enormous social problems in these areas the remedial and psychological school services are absolutely essential.  I know of some primary schools where the first couple of hours are spent in warming up and feeding children.  It is absolutely essential in these areas to have a psychological service as well.  Children who cannot avail of it and who have problems at home will be scarred for life, but with a proper remedial service and a psychological service they can be helped.  I would ask the Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, to press the Minister for Finance for money for those areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Browne and others said with regard to the means testing of ESF grants, which will have enormous implications. The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, of which I am a member, and some of the third level colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology have estimated that up to two-thirds of their intake next year will be affected by the means testing of maintenance grants.  It will have an enormous effect on enrolment.  It will not reduce the enrolment but it will reduce the enrolment of those who have attended appropriate levels of education to take advantage of the courses but have not got the money to do so.  Those who have the money will get in and those who do not have the money, no matter what their qualification in the leaving certificate or any other area, will not be able to gain admittance.  That issue will have to be re-examined to see whether increased funding can be got from Europe, where we are restricted to 19,000 students being able to avail of ESF funding.  The matter will have to be tackled either in Europe or here at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> I come now to energy and immediately I come face to face with the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, and his ban on the ESB using the billing system for sales of electrical goods.  I was shocked at that measure and I condemned it immediately and issued a statement on it.  I think its effects were not realised by the Minister, especially its effects on low income groups whose only method of purchase of electrical goods is through the ESB system, simply because they cannot obtain credit elsewhere.  The do not have the cash so they go to the ESB where they do not have to pay a deposit but take away their fridge or other appliance and pay for it regularly on their ESB bill. If all the ESB shops closed down in the morning none of those people would be rushing into other electrical retailers to buy goods.  Not one extra fridge would be sold in those shops because those people do not have the cash and they cannot obtain the credit.  Therefore, they cannot purchase their cooker, washing machine, fridge, heater or whatever appliance they require.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister took into account either the effect this would have on jobs in the ESB.  There would be an enormous effect throughout the ESB because the loss of 150,000 customers purchasing on their bills would result in the shops being closed down.  It is easy for the Minister to say they have the same advantage as every other electrical supplier: they can purchase the goods at competitive prices and sell them the same as everybody else.  A whole market is lost, 150,000 consumers of electical goods would be gone and the market would be confined to those selling for cash.  What the Minister did not understand also was the effect it would have on industry and the factories that produce these electrical goods.  The ESB's particular preference for Irish produced goods would lead to the Dimplex factory in Dundalk not being able to continue in business without the ESB.  As with other areas they would all import their heaters from Britain, which would probably be cheaper, but <Col N="1424" /> the ESB are able to keep these factories going.</P>
    <P>In the constituency of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, Krups are also dependent on the ESB for the sale of their goods.  Wang, who have recently made an arrangement with the ESB to sell computers, are on the road to recovery.  This method of selling electrical appliances has been of enormous benefit in the area of job creation all along the line.  I am glad to note that the Minister has climbed down on the date and now on the decision and said he was misrepresented.  I do not think he was misrepresented, the meaning was very clear.  I am glad he has climbed down somewhat and he is apparently making some arrangement with the ESB for some method of billing separately.</P>
    <P>The reason I am worried about the action of the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, is that it indicates a dangerous attitude of ideological paranoia with the ESB and a gross ignorance of their role in society and in the communities.  The reaction of consumers has been enormous in this regard.  I include the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, with the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, in this because in the debate on the Competition Act last June he actually began this campaign against the ESB and said he would speak to his Minister for Energy to see what they could do about this matter.  Instead of preparing the ESB and everybody else for 1992 &mdash; about which we have been warned for the past six or eight years &mdash; they are told to be wide open for competition from all over the world. I should say the major electrical retailers &mdash; McKennas, Power City and DID &mdash; have no crib with the ESB whatsoever. Instead of strengthening their position the Minister is putting shackles on them, tying their hands behind their back, before the major competition era enters. It is time Ministers faced up to the fact that we have to change our attitude to jobs.  It is the job and the responsibility of Government not only to create the climate but to do things to create jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> I had been advocating for years that the forests be taken out of the hands of civil servants and I thought it was a good move to set up Coillte Teoranta.  I hope the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, will not adopt the same attitude with them and that when some sawmillers in the west cry out about competition he does not put shackles on Coillte Teoranta because this is an area where not just thousands but tens of thousands of jobs can be created in the whole processing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the budget.  There is a number of issues I would like to refer to. As Opposition spokesperson on Tourism, I am very disappointed that the real problems facing the tourism industry have not been dealt with in the budget. Around this time last year I said that, while 1990 was the year of the invisible tourist, 1991 would fast become the year of the invisible Minister for Tourism. This turned out to be the case.  I made that comment because although many developments were taking place within the tourism industry, one of our most important industries, the Minister was not responding in the way he should.</P>
      <P>The 1992 budget is deflationary, destructive and demoralising.  Indeed, tourism only merited a few short paragraphs in the 60 page script of the Minister. The budget contained a proposal that £1 million be provided to tackle the problems facing the car hire sector, but I believe that the only way in which that sector can be helped is through the postponement of import duties on new cars bought by fleet owners until such time as those cars are resold.  In view of the fact that the car fleet industry is 2,500 cars short, we will reach a stage where many cars for hire will have to be imported, which is what happened in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism industry is an incredible money earner for the State.  During the past 12 months it earned nearly £500 million. It benefits all regions, most notably counties along the west coast, which have few other advantages to support economic or social developments.  It also spans a multitude of spinoff economic activities, from cottage crafts to high technical industries.  On the evening of the budget my party spokesperson on finance asked why the potential of that great industry was not unleashed in the budget.  Indeed what is the reason the problems facing the industry have not <Col N="1427" /> been tackled and dealt with?  On 22 January, in a statement, I called on the Minister to deal with the problems facing the car hire sector and to postpone all import duties due on new cars purchased by car hire companies until such time as the cars were resold.  That is the position in Denmark and I see no reason the Minister cannot deal with the matter in that way and use the £1 million to offset the loss.</P>
    <P>Dining out constitutes a very important part of the tourism industry and sustains 17,000 jobs.  I asked the Minister for Finance, when he came to consider changing the VAT rates, to seriously think about reducing the VAT rate from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent on meals to ensure that this service continues to be subject to the lower rate rather than the higher rate of between 14 per cent and 20 per cent post-1992. It is quite obvious in the light of the decisions taken by the Minister in the budget that the higher rate of VAT will be around 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to job creation, the budget will do nothing to create one job in the economy or stimulate the level of growth required.  At present one out of every three jobs is created in the tourism industry.  For instance, a substantial number of bedrooms were built by taking advantage of the business expansion scheme and every hotel built means that permanent jobs are provided in the industry.  The reintroduction of the business expansion scheme to include the refurbishing and building of hotels ouside the greater urban areas would mean that the Government had their priorities right.</P>
    <P>The grant to Bord Fáilte has declined every year, from £28.4 million in 1988 to £21.9 million in 1991 and there is a further reduction in the Estimates for 1992 to £21.5 million.  In terms of the amount the industry required to implement the Government's five year plan in 1987 it is not enough as it was proposed that the industry required an extra £5 million per year to ensure that Ireland could be sold in the marketplace and that the target &mdash; 15 per cent growth on a continuous basis <Col N="1428" /> over five years &mdash; would be met.  We are all aware that the growth lasted for only three years.  The figures released in relation to tourism underline the truth which everyone, except the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, understood.  Most people realised that if you do not allocate sufficient funds for the development and marketing of tourism there will not be many golden eggs laid for the benefit of the State.  It is quite clear that the Government's five year plan up to 1992 has collapsed and that all targets for 1991 were not achieved.</P>
    <P>On Monday, the Minister announced that a new forum would be set up to look at the tourist industry.  That would not have been necessary if the numbers of tourists coming into the State had been correctly interpreted and if the tourist industry had not ceased to develop for the reasons we advanced last year on the night of the budget when the business expansion scheme was abolished.  That certainly decimated the job potential and investment in the industry.  The Culliton report &mdash; all 110 pages of it &mdash; did not devote even a single line to what is fast becoming the single biggest industry in the State, tourism.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the Minister took fire brigade action on Monday.  He did so for two reasons.  First, he mentioned a new forum to deal with tourism and to come up with proposals and plans for the future; on Tuesday, the Minister announced possible changes in the Shannon stop-over and on Wednesday he announced a new rail link in the city.  He reminded me of someone who had not been around for 12 months, who came back and saw many things with which he should have dealt over the last 12 months. He realised that there would be a change of Taoiseach and that his job might be in jeopardy so he decided to announce new initiatives.  I said in the House 12 months ago that serious action was required to deal with the problem of the figures in the industry and the problem in regard to investment and marketing.  I mentioned that not enough funds were being made available by the Government to deal with <Col N="1429" /> the problem.  When the Minister for Finance introduced this budget in the House last week he ignored and insulted the industry.  He seemed to be totally unaware that one in every three jobs has been created in the tourist industry in the last few years.  The Government have missed a golden opportunity to lay the foundations for a major job expansion in the area.  The introduction of a range of restricted business expansion schemes is vital to the industry and many small family hotel owners require such assistance to ensure that the fabric of their towns and villages is maintained and that they can benefit from the numbers of people coming to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the problem of car hire and my solution for it.  The marketing abroad of this industry is most important.  I was interested to note that three of the main banks have provided people to sit on the new commission which will look at the industry.  For a long time I have been of the view that the main banks should facilitate and provide special loan arrangements for people who want to invest in the tourist industry in the provision of accommodation and leisure facilities which are badly needed in different parts of the country.  If you take into consideration the profits which the main banks make it is right and proper that some of them should be reinvested in the State.  They should not be used to pay bad debts as a result of decisions the banks made in other countries.  There has been too much of that over the last few years and people in the local economy are now being put under severe pressure, on a continuous basis, because of the way the banks have been working and dealing over the last while.  A report should be drawn up containing proposals to deal with some of the points I raised.</P>
    <P>In setting up this new commission the Minister excluded any representative from Bord Fáilte, the main marketing board.  Will he clarify, at the earliest possible date, why he did that?  Has he decided to abolish Bord Fáilte, as has been the case in relation to other areas for which he has responsibility?  Why has <Col N="1430" /> this decision been made?  Have the Government agreed with it?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some other aspects of the budget.  It has been decided to end the perks which can be given by companies to their employees, for example, company cars and the option to buy shares in the company &mdash; a policy introduced by the Leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton, in 1986 when he was Minister for Finance.  Under that scheme people were given the opportunity to invest in the companies for whom they worked.  This gave them a return on their investment and an interest in the company.  Under the budget the benefits available to employees, which amounted to £38 million, have been done away with.  This has left workers in the position that they will no longer be able to benefit from such investments.  This is a move against the concept of worker participation.  In view of our level of unemployment, I find it hard to believe that the Minister and the Government have made this decision.</P>
    <P>The decision to cut back on those perks will mean that in future companies will treat their managing directors differently. They will probably introduce a system similar to that which applies to civil servants, that is, managing directors will have to provide their own cars and will be paid on the basis of mileage.  This is probably the right thing to do.  I believe civil servants had a major input into those aspects of the budget.  The decision to end the perks given by companies to their employees is a retrograde step in the context of worker participation.  When one considers just how popular worker participation has become I cannot understand why the Government agreed to this proposal.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to the Minister for the Environment at Question Time yesterday, local authorities are often asked to introduce policies without being given the necessary funding to enable them to employ additional staff to provide extra facilities to carry out that work.  The Government introduce legislation of benefit to the majority of people yet they do not allocate the necessary funds to local <Col N="1431" /> authorities to enable them carry out the necessary work.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to all of this. Many local authorities have inadequate facilities which need to be replaced or upgraded.  However, no money has been forthcoming from the Department to enable them to carry out this work.  I believe there are plans to provide new water schemes and new sewage treatment facilities in County Meath which will provide work for a substantial number of people for up to ten years.  The Government introduce legislation which every individual in the State must obey but they do not allocate the necessary funds to local authorities to enable them to put their house in order.</P>
    <P>As of today, Meath County Council have not been notified of their allocation for road grants; they do not know whether their allocation will be up or down on last year's allocation.  If this money is allocated in the same way as the rate support grant, Meath County Council will be in the position all local authorities were in at the end of last year when they were short of money to meet the 3 per cent requirement in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government decided last January that this money would have to be found to keep pay in line with inflation. Many local authorities found it extremely difficult to deal with their estimates.  The only way they could raise this money was by increasing water charges or rates on commercial properties.</P>
    <P>The Government are not treating local authorities, and other agencies who are trying to get people to co-operate with them, in a fair way.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment who is present introduced some of the legislation to which I referred.  I ask her to try to influence the Minister for the Environment, whoever that may be, to ensure that the necessary funds will be made available to these bodies.  The Government should stop introducing legislation if they are not going to allocate the necessary funds to local authorities to enable them to implement its provisions.</P>

      <P>As in the case of most budget debates, there is about as much interest in this debate at this stage as there is in the matter of where Santa Claus went last Christmas.  This is one of the greatest wastes of parliamentary time.  It is important that all Deputies are given an opportunity to express their views on the budget but there must be a better way of doing this than the present system.  This debate makes a clear case for Dáil reform &mdash; there are only three Deputies out of a total of 166 present in the Chamber.  Obviously, we need to reform the way we conduct our business.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of specific issues &mdash; it is impossible to refer to all the proposals in a debate such as this.  There are 270,000 reasons why the Government should tackle the unemployment problem in an honest, imaginative and meaningful way.  I listened to the entire Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance. While the budget contains some good proposals &mdash; I will refer to them in a moment &mdash; basically it was a non-event.  I believe that the morning after the budget many of the 270,000 people who are unemployed asked themselves what exactly the budget had done for them.  I am sure that employment opportunities in other parts of the country are no better than they are in the west of Ireland.  I do not wish to be pessimistic but I believe that the programmes, plans and strategies which have been announced over the past two years are unlikely to provide jobs in the foreseeable future for the 270,000 who are unemployed or for children who will come onto the labour market in a few years time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two major problems facing this country &mdash; there are many problems facing us but we have to take them in order of priority.  Obviously the terrible atrocities being committed in Northern Ireland affect the hearts and minds of all right thinking people.  I wish to extend my sincere sympathy to both communities in Northern Ireland who are suffering as a result of the actions of maniac paramilitaries &mdash; obviously these people have lost the run of themselves.  They are not carrying out these atrocities in my name <Col N="1433" /> or in the name of my colleagues on all sides of the House.  While this problem will be very difficult to solve, I believe it can be solved.  When one considers that most of the major conflicts throughout the world have been resolved, one has to ask why can we not find a solution to the problem in a little corner of Ireland?</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to unemployment. The greatest single tragedy in a family apart from illness, is the loss of a job by the bread winner, be it the husband or wife.  It appears that there is a case for a national forum to deal with unemployment.  As Opposition spokesman on social welfare, I would be expected to find fault with some of what the Minister for Social Welfare said on the budget, and I would be justified in doing so because there are some glaring omissions in that area.  There must be a national approach to unemployment. That is why my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, called for a national jobs forum.  Basically, everybody should unite to find a solution to the problem.  Actions will have to be taken that will not be palatable.  The opinion polls will vary, but we should decide that this is our priority and give more than lip service to the thousands of young people who have been and will be looking for jobs.  I accept that everything we do will not be right but at least if we all work together progress should be made in this area.  No Government came to grips with unemployment. What is needed is a system of collective expertise of people from all sides of this House and then hopefully in the next five or ten years the numbers unemployed will be reduced.  Anybody who believes that the short-term strategy of this budget will change the face of Ireland in a couple of months is living in cloud cuckoo-land.</P>
    <P>At present there are three and a half million people in this country, we owe £26 billion to foreign bankers and there are 270,000 people out of work.  We pay out about £1 million per year in child benefit and a huge number of people are in receipt of the old age pension.  It is the people at work who have to provide for the young and the old because that is the <Col N="1434" /> way society is structured.  The reduction in income tax rates was a step in the right direction, but let nobody get the idea that he or she will be much better off.  I understand that the total take from income tax this year will be higher than that for last year and therefore some people will have to pay more.  However, there will be more disposable income at the end of the day and people will have some say in how it is spent.</P>
    <P>I have always subscribed to the view that a Government do not create jobs despite the general perception that they do.  They create the environment for job creation.  This Government are the type of Government we would prefer to read about in far away countries and not one that governs this country.  The people did not vote for this type of Government. Anyone who has been in politics for nine or ten years will never forget the events of the last six months, with one scandal after another, and each one worse than the other, resulting in a &ldquo;High Noon&rdquo; situation in the parliamentary rooms of this House at 3 p.m. today.  The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, is extremely useful in more ways than one in the Government today because if she was not here there would be no member of the Government in the House for the debate. I sincerely hope that Fianna Fáil will be able to put their house in order, that the Government will make a concerted effort and that progress will be made in the next 12 months, or whatever length of time they will be in office.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesperson on social welfare I want to say a few words on that subject.  Given the problems that exist it is reasonable to assume that there is a limit to the amount of social welfare payments that can be made.  The pool of money is not limitless and one must understand that in order to pay out money we must first take it in.  As I said earlier, it is the working people who have to contribute this money.  There is no doubt that there is much poverty in this country.  Some people say it is self-induced and that people could do better <Col N="1435" /> if they wished.  However, there are thousands of people who genuinely want to work but the jobs are not available.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister how he expects a family with three children to live on £124 per week, which is the new rate for the short term unemployed. Parents of teenagers find it even more difficult to live on that amount of money. Even though these people receive medical cards and rent allowances, it is still very difficult to live on £124 a week.  Let nobody tell me that society is fair while people are living on such a small sum of money.  On the other hand, I am fully aware that because sufficient income is not generated it is not possible to do as much as we would like.  There is no doubt that there are many black spots in the system, and I will refer to those later.</P>
    <P>One of the most cost-effective and best targeted social welfare allowances is the children's allowance or child benefit as it is now termed.  It has been of considerable assistance to thousands of families down the years.  I know families whose mothers wait anxiously for the first Tuesday of every month when the child benefit is paid.  There is no doubt that 99 times out of 100 this money is used for the purpose for which it is intended, to buy children's shoes, school bags, clothing and so on.</P>
    <P>There has always been an argument about who should and who should not get child benefit.  I subscribe to the view that all women caring for children, irrespective of their spouse's income, should be entitled to child benefit.  I have some reservations about a tax clawback on child benefit when the spouse is a high income earner.  That does not, however, take away from the central point that child benefit is money well spent.  It has been borne out by many studies that 40 per cent of children live in poverty stricken homes.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able to initiate discussion on a better way of administering child benefit.  As Members are aware, social welfare recipients got an increase of 4 per cent and the areas that were prioritised got an additional 2 per cent, <Col N="1436" /> but the Minister omitted to increase child benefit.  I find that very difficult to understand. The Minister is new to the job, but I have no fault to find with him.  I believe he has his ear to the ground, but I cannot understand for the life of me why there was no increase in child benefit.  Were the children and their mothers not entitled to the 4 per cent increase, the same as everybody else?</P>
    <P>About two years ago the former Minister for Social Welfare made great play of the fact that he was introducing a carer's allowance.  We pride ourselves, and long may it continue, on our attitude and ability to care for the aged.  There is no doubt that in the worst of times, when we experienced real poverty, Irish people prided themselves and aspired to look after their elderly and the handicapped. The carer's allowance was born out of the prescribed relative's allowance.  At that time I formed the view that the carer's allowance would be reasonably easily obtained.  The responsibility falls on our women folk.  The unsung heroine is usually the daughter-in-law, because I think she is crucified with the care of the elderly and usually the woman who has no blood relationship with them ends up looking after the elderly parents of the man she married.  Demands are made on her time 24 hours a day.  The geriatric hospitals are not able to cater for any more people because they are already overcrowded.  Unless one had a reasonably good job and qualified for a good pension one could not afford to stay in an old persons' home.  Basically, the only alternative is home care.  I asked the Minister for Social Welfare how many people now receive the carer's allowance. I was told that in round figures 9,000 people approximately applied for the allowance in the past year, half of which, 5,000 were turned down and of the remaining 4,000 only 2,000 qualified for the full allowance of approximately £50.</P>
    <P>I understand that approximately 70,000 to 80,000 people are potentially eligible for the carer's allowance if we were able to pay it, yet only 4,000 are paid the allowance.  We will have to look at this further.  I have no doubt that this <Col N="1437" /> is a cheaper way of providing care than by building geriatric hospitals, where in some cases, the patient does not want to be in the first place.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate to comment this afternoon, when I face so many empty benches, on the way the Government have tried to govern the country over the past six to eight months. They have failed dismally; they have not governed.  The budget is the yardstick on which the economy will be assessed over the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>The leadership battle for control of Fianna Fáil starts at 3 o'clock.  The budget shows that more thought was given to the leadership of Fianna Fáil than to the leadership the people need.  The budget is neutral.  The new Minister for Finance has a safe pair of hands and he kicked for touch at every opportunity he got. However, this country needs a far seeing and strong budget.  This country needed leadership but the budget failed dismally to provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember speaking in the House on last year's budget.  I honestly do not know what school of economics was attended by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds &mdash; probably we will find that out in the next month or so &mdash; and I certainly do not know what school of economics the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, went <Col N="1461" /> to, but it is obvious that the two men did not go to the same school.  The economic vision has changed drastically during the past 12 months from what the Government were hoping to do last year compared to what is hoped for this year.  Such shoddiness in economic and budgetary development can only mean that the Government have not been aiming for a co-ordinated and far-reaching approach for the betterment of this country.</P>
    <P>Last year the former Minister for Finance gave much emphasis to economic growth.  Despite there being several experts in the House, the former Minister for Finance came into the House last year and arrogantly stated that there would be economic growth of 3 per cent to 4 per cent, that the economy would develop as a result and that jobs would be created. We all know that the economy grew at about 0.5 per cent, that the number of jobs decreased rather than increased and that we now have 270,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>If two Ministers for Finance from the same party cannot agree on a projection for the way forward economically then it is time for them to put the mandate to the people so that real leaders might be elected.  The people need a Government that will tell them clearly where the country is to be led through the next three, four or five years rather than a Government that tries to lead the country one day at a time, which has disastrous consequences.  For example, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was negotiated last year and it was then left for the new Minister for Finance to try to cobble together a new deal with the unions in order to prevent complete economic betrayal on the streets.  A deal had to be struck that would encourage all public service union members to stay at work rather than go out to protest against the Government's intention to break a promise they made last year based on budgetary figures.  This year's budget gives no incentive for the creation of new jobs, which is the major need in our country.  The Minister, Deputy Ahern has made a promise to the public service unions pertaining to next year and up to <Col N="1462" /> 1994 that he will uphold the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> promises made last year, which means that extremely harsh economic decisions will need to be taken in the next 12 months. The Minister has failed to face that reality in the budget.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Government will fail to increase the number of jobs.  I do not mean to be pessimistic but the budgetary strategy for the next 12 months gives no guidance for an increase in the number of jobs.  The garage industry provides a good example.  In the budget the Minister for Finance decided to reduce excise duties on new car sales; that was a laudable decision and one that was needed.  However, many garages have new cars in stock that they purchased before the announcement in the budget and the Minister is not willing to forego the excise duty on those cars retrospectively. There were more than 1,000 job losses in the garage industry last year, and if the Minister is not willing to show any leniency towards garages in retrospectively foregoing excise duty on the cars to which I have referred then more job losses will occur.  That would certainly be a bad way to start the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the budget that he would increase the price of a packet of cigarettes by 16 pence.  The reason given for that was that he had the health of the Irish people foremost in his mind. I am not a smoker and I have never smoked, but I find that statement rather ironic in that three or four pages further on in the Minister's budget speech he announced his decision to put a 21 per cent VAT charge on commercial bodies providing exercise facilities such as gymnasiums. All of the Health Bureau's advertisements tell us that exercise is very important, so it is obvious that it was certainly not consideration for people's health that was behind the increase in the price of cigarettes.  That move was just another attempt to increase the take of the central coffers.  Small inconsistencies such as the one to which I have just referred show that the Government put no great thought or plan into their budget strategy. <Col N="1463" /> It was a retrograde step for the Minister to put a 21 per cent VAT charge on commercial sports enterprises.  Those bodies give a service that is provided by the State in most other European countries. In this country it is private enterprise that provides such facilities and we have new hotels equipped with excellent gymnasiums, swimming pools and leisure centres.  The State has failed to provide any of those facilities, but now private enterprise is about to be taxed on the provision of such facilities.  That is not giving the private sector an incentive to create employment.  Many Government Ministers state that the opportunity for employment in the tourist industry is incredible &mdash; apparently the potential for job creation could be compared to a bottomless well if we were to believe all of the statements made by different Government members &mdash; yet here the Government are about to put a 21 per cent VAT charge on one part of the tourist industry that has been successful in creating jobs.  The increased charge is an incredible hike, it will add more than one-fifth to the price for people using the facilities.</P>
    <P>I come from County Leitrim, which is a part of the country, along with surrounding areas, that has suffered greatly from lack of economic planning.  In Arigna, which borders Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim, there has been an ongoing struggle to try to save mining jobs.  More than 250 people were employed in the mining industry in that part of the country when the ESB decided that it was no longer economically viable to provide a power station at Arigna.  In fairness to the Minister for Energy, I should point out that he did commission an independent report to determine whether coal could be produced in Arigna and then brought to the power station so that electricity could be produced at an economic level.  Several coal merchants in the area have stated that they can provide coal at a very much reduced price.  The Minister was given a copy of the report on 7 January but, <Col N="1464" /> unfortunately, we have not yet heard what the report states.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to ask the Minister for Energy to make this report public.  The people in the Arigna catchment area are awaiting it with bated breath.  Their jobs are on the line.  I hope the report will be positive and that mining can continue in the Arigna area of Leitrim and Roscommon and that the Arigna power station will be kept open.</P>
    <P>There have been many initiatives over the last couple of months by various organisations in the west.  For instance, the western alliance of Catholic Bishops called a number of meetings in the west to try to co-ordinate efforts by people who are extremely concerned about the appalling lack of economic planning in the region.  They are trying to save the west of Ireland as an entity.  This gives the Government an opportunity to co-ordinate efforts by the interested groups in developing a positive policy for the west.  As the next Taoiseach will probably be a namesake of mine &mdash; he is probably the only Reynolds who will ever become Taoiseach &mdash; and as he comes from Roscommon, I hope he will appoint a Minister with responsibility for western development.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Minister, and his civil servants, seem to indicate that everyone involved in business is dishonest. Because of the major business scandals in Greencore and the Goodman group of companies a number of initiatives have been taken which will hinder the growth and development of small and medium size businesses.  Business people have not been given any incentives to create employment.  We should be trying to provide more jobs through small and medium enterprises.  With a proper economic climate they would create jobs.  The Minister seems to have the idea that most people involved in business are on the make.  It is sad if that is the perception we have of business people.  The Progressive Democrats have always preached the gospel of free enterprise, that business people have a major role to play and I am surprised they would allow that sort of message go out after the budget.  It will <Col N="1465" /> have far reaching consequences on job creation and on initiatives in business.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, a number of speakers referred to the fact that the rate support grant to local authorities was the same this year as last year, which in real terms represents a cut of 3 per cent.  The increase of 20 per cent in motor tax was a soft option taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints about the condition of our roads.  The Minister has not made much money available for our roads programmes and this will have dire consequences for our economy.  Transport costs will increase and this will have a knock-on effect on employment.  When we seek EC money we make the case that we are on the periphery of Europe and that our transport costs are higher than those of the countries in mainland Europe.  That argument will be strengthened by the advent of the Channel Tunnel.  At meetings of Heads of State we made that case to try to win special concessions, but the Government are imposing a major increase in transport costs.  There is not any economic sense in that.  If our transport costs are higher our exports will be more expensive.  I do not know what line of economic vision the Minister is using. Having studied economics, I know it is neither micro nor macro economics.  It must be the philosophy of the Ahern school of economics.  The increases will make transport more expensive and cost jobs.  This further increase in costs will hinder the development of industry.</P>
    <P>The Government have a poor record on housing.  There is not any good news in the budget in the form of extra money for housing which is badly needed.  The situation in Dublin is deplorable but it is bad also in Sligo and Leitrim, the two counties I represent.  Money has not been provided in the budget to enable local authorities build more houses.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to be totally negative about the budget.  There are a number of aspects of it I welcome, for instance the reduction in the income tax rates which is a step in the right direction.  However, it did not give us any economic hope for the future.</P>

      <P>At this stage of a budget debate, repetition often creeps in.  I will try to avoid that.  I compliment the Minister on bringing his first budget before the Dáil and I wish him well in the Department of Finance.  The biggest problem facing the country is unemployment and the budget did very little to deal with it.  Unemployment brings with it the major problem of poverty, affecting both urban and rural areas.  The Conference of Major Religious Superiors have already made known their views regarding the failure of the budget to deal with this question.  I am speaking about people on very low incomes depending on social welfare assistance.  I often wonder how people on very low incomes can rear families, pay for light, heat and rent and look after their children as well as they do.  I thank the Minister for the provision of £25 towards the cost of uniforms for school-going children of low income families and £50 for children attending secondary school.  Although the amount is small, the measure is welcome.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for the provision of £3 million for the mentally handicapped.  It is extremely sad to come across an ageing father or mother seeking a residential place for a mentally handicapped child for whom they have cared so lovingly.  Very few places are available and I hope the £3 million will be invested by the health boards to provide more residential places for people with mental handicap.  The Minister has also provided £2 million for the elderly and £1 million for child care.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget fails to look after that sector of the community who try to provide for their families by their own efforts and are not a burden on the State.  People who are just above the qualification limit for a medical card have to pay for everything they get.  A large number of people are in that category, rearing large families and having to meet food and clothing bills.  This budget does very little for them.  The increase in VAT will not help and if they have life assurance they lose tax relief.  One of the costliest aspects of the family budget is health care.  In <Col N="1467" /> October last year the Government changed the drugs subsidisation scheme in such a way that the year is divided into four quarters.  The new scheme has two main disadvantages.  Under the original scheme those who paid over £32 per month for prescribed medicines were entitled to a full rebate.  Now a patient spending £120 in October but nothing in November or December will get a refund of £30, over £50 less than the £88 which would have been refunded under the original scheme.  The second disadvantage is that expenditure on drugs cannot be transferred from one quarter to another.  A person spending £90 in December and £90 in January, the two months when people are most likely to fall ill, will not get a refund.  That hits very hard at low income families who cannot qualify for a medical card.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, that the housing situation in Dublin is deplorable.  At one time when a vacancy occurred people asked if they could be considered for that vacancy.  The stage was reached some years ago that when a person went into hospital inquiries were made about a possible vacancy. We have now reached the position that when a person dies there is immediately a request for the house or flat which the deceased person had occupied.  There is a terrible need for housing in Dublin, especially in the inner city.  A husband, wife and three children can be living in a one-bedroomed flat.  We have returned to the conditions of the early eighties. The Government must provide money to enable local authorities to build houses for people who cannot afford them.</P>
    <P>The State also has an obligation to help those who wish to purchase their houses but are unable to do so without assistance. Under the shared ownership scheme a local authority will allow one of their applicants to buy a house; they will provide a full mortgage, half of which will be taken up by the tenant, and the other half will be rented from the local authority.  That is an excellent way of helping people to purchase their own <Col N="1468" /> houses but unfortunately it requires legislation. A Bill has been promised every month for the past six months.  The Minister indicated that £35 million will be made available this year under that scheme but we still await the legislation. Many people come to me who could avail of that scheme if it were fully operational. A pilot scheme is in operation but that is not the answer.  People are anxious to obtain housing at their own expense with the help of the local authority and I call on the Minister to bring the Housing Bill before the House as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused yesterday to hear some Deputies opposite speak about the economic miracle which has occurred over the past few years.  It is hard to understand what they mean by an economic miracle when almost 300,000 people are out of work.  Deputy Power and Deputy Hilliard raked over the record of the Coalition Government between 1982 and 1987.  They made the political charge that during that time the Government doubled the national debt.  If they had researched their figures a little better they would have discovered that Fianna Fáil trebled the national debt between 1977 to 1982.  That was the real problem with which we had to grapple in 1982 and we did it very well.  The unemployment figures in those years certainly did not resemble those of today.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has completed an agreement with the public sector unions regarding the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which effectively postpones the expenditure of £100 million until the 1993 budget.  This has helped the 1992 situation, but does nothing for overall commitment to expenditure in the medium term.  I predict the 1993 budgetary exercise will be very difficult, given the task involved, especially in regard to the £200 million VAT revenue to be foregone at the point of entry, an amount that must be found from some source.  The Government must ensure that indirect taxes are sufficiently close to the levels obtaining in the United Kingdom to prevent adverse effects on trade with the free movement <Col N="1469" /> of goods and services, and the disappearance of custom borders.</P>
    <P>The year 1992 can be seen as a critical one for our economy since, at its end, we shall have a Single Market not only throughout the European Community but throughout this island.  These changes will have a significant impact on our industry.  This budget should have been framed with an eye to the difficulties of the ensuing year but it was not.  For example, its provisions should have aimed at an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 1.5 per cent of gross national product, which would necessitate the trimming of some expenditure. Failure to have tackled that issue this year will render the expenditure base in 1993 that much larger in the light of the movement to a single currency and its attendant discipline.  We cannot allow our public finances to revert from their path of rectitude.</P>

      <P>As I contribute to this debate more important events take place in another room in this building, that is from the point of view of the Government. I make these few comments on behalf of the people I represent.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday evening I was asked to comment on this budget.  I predicted then that when the hype of budget day had died down, the photographers moved away and the gloss worn off the Minister's statement, this budget would be perceived as a non-event, a failed opportunity on the part of the Minister for Finance and the Government to respond in any meaningful or positive way to the needs of thousands of our people awaiting its provisions with a certain sense of hope and expectation.  Had they expected that these budgetary provisions would constitute the beginning of progress to greater equality within our society their expectations will have proved to have been unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the morning following the introduction of this budget I went into a local shop to purchase a newspaper.  I was served by a girl of approximately 19 years of age &mdash; somebody I would not have anticipated having any comments to <Col N="1470" /> make on politics, or have made any in the past &mdash; who commented that the only hope remaining to young people here, following the introduction of this budget, was to get the best education possible and then emigrate.  We face a huge problem if that view is representative of many young people.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to various statements about this budget, particularly those of the Progressive Democrats.  I am glad to note that one of their members, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, is present this afternoon.  I also listened to the comments of many economists who contended that this was a tax reforming budget.  It may be for a small section of society, the better off, but it is anything but progressive for the majority of taxpayers. This will become very evident when they examine their first pay packets after 6 April next.</P>
    <P>This budget's main beneficiaries are the high income earners, which has been the case over the preceding three years. For example, a married man with an average industrial wage will gain approximately £150 annually as a result of the income tax changes proposed in this budget, against which he and his family must face a 20 per cent increase in car tax.  One might well ask why did the Minister find it necessary to do this?  In many areas in this country possession of a car can no longer be classified as a luxury but rather a necessity, given the lack of commitment on the part of this Government to public transport.  I was appalled that there was no reference whatsoever to public transport in the Minister's Budget Statement, particularly since the Progressive Democrats had made a public commitment in that area.</P>
    <P>Less well-off families &mdash; generally those who must avail of public transport &mdash; are to be the subject of an additional financial imposition on their household budgets occasioned by VAT increases on a wide range of essential commodities, such as clothing, footwear, transport and communications, personal services and maintenance services, to mention just a <Col N="1471" /> few.  As a result of these budgetary provisions the average taxpayer will be worse off, that same group of taxpayers who have made a major contribution over the years by way of PRSI deductions from their salaries.  To those who claim this is a reforming budget I say that those less-well-off families can justifiably ask what type of reform is this.</P>
    <P>As Labour spokesperson on youth affairs I am very concerned at the Government's decision to apply VAT at the standard rate on all commercially organised sports and leisure functions. Perhaps the Minister of State present would take note of my comments and bring them to the attention of her Cabinet colleagues.  Indeed, I warn the Government that I will be seeking a commitment from them that voluntary community organisations will be exempt from VAT, particularly on necessary fund raising activities which may be held in commercial type sports halls.</P>
    <P>I object strongly to the Government decision to abolish income tax relief on shares allocated to employees under approved profit-sharing schemes.  Is the Minister not aware that this relief was introduced by Fianna Fáil following protracted negotiations between the trade unions, certain employers and with the full consent of the Revenue Commissioners? The scheme proved enormously successful, leading on the part of thousands of employees, to greater involvement in and commitment to their companies.  This was fully acknowledged by their employers.  I know from representations I have had to date on this issue that it is having a very damaging effect on the morale of staff in many such companies.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine this proposal with a view to its revision in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government's response in the Book of Estimates and in this budget to the housing crisis is pathetic.  Were the problem not so critical their response could be perceived as something of a cynical joke.  The Labour Party must highlight the reality prevailing on the ground in this respect throughout the <Col N="1472" /> length and breadth of the country, since there are up to 30,000 applicant families living in deplorable, overcrowded conditions. If my comments are seen by the Minister and Government to be something like a long-playing record, so be it.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy in regard to homelessness must be changed if we are to deal with the major problems of inequality and growing divisions in our society.  I hope the Government take on board the concerns expressed by all local authorities about the crisis.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Government's policy document on social housing I should like to ask the Minister to consult with her colleagues regarding the possibility of the State providing further technical and financial assistance to housing co-operatives.  I hope more housing coops will be formed by suitably qualified applicants on the local authority housing lists to avail of the subsidised site scheme announced in the policy document on social housing.  I make this appeal as a former member of a housing co-operative who benefited from the assistance of State agencies such as the NBA and others.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed reduction in the pupil/teacher ratio from September next but it must be said that following those changes we will still have the largest class sizes in Europe.  I welcome the allocation for disadvantaged areas.  However, it is only a proportion of what is required.  I ask the Minister to bring to the attention of the Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, the need for more remedial teachers.  That is most important at primary level particularly for pupils in rural areas.  In my constituency &mdash; I do not like being parochial &mdash; the villages of Ballyboughal, Garristown and Naul have been seeking, for the last three years, a shared remedial teacher.  I ask the Government to consider favourably schools in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need for new school buildings in my constituency and I was appalled at the cutback in the allocation in the budget for primary and second level schools.  Problems exist in two schools in my constituency.  Fingal <Col N="1473" /> Community College is cluttered with prefabricated buildings and there is a need for an additional school.  The Minister should ensure that the necessary finance is provided to enable the promised improvements for Fingal Community College and Coláiste Colm in Swords to proceed to the next stage this year.</P>
    <P>The major social problem in Ireland is unemployment.  The report of the Government's industrial policy review group, which was published recently, stated something we knew for some time, that there is no national strategy for job creation.  The most important issue we must address is unemployment.  At present the unemployment figure stands at 270,000 and is rapidly rising.  This is totally unacceptable in any society given that unemployment is at the core of many fiscal problems.  It is also at the core of the grinding poverty which afflicts thousands of families and at the core of many of our mounting health bills that have not been effectively dealt with in the budget. It contributes to thousands of cases of depression, stress-related conditions, violence in the home, alcoholism and a host of other conditions.  Above all unemployment is at the core of our equality crisis.  It is not an accident that unemployment is at a peak in many of the alienated suburbs of our large cities and towns but particularly in the Dublin area. The budget will do nothing to stimulate investment in job creation.  The best thing we can give to many of those people is a sense of hope but unfortunately, there is not very much in the budget for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to horticulture, a market-led industry with great potential for employment, particularly for young people.  It has a low capital cost per job and compares favourably with any other sector of agriculture.  The Government should invest in the horticulture industry because there is great potential for local consumption and exports.  There is potential in the mushroom industry, the nursery stock industry and amenity horticulture.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the major difficulties which Teagasc are experiencing. <Col N="1474" /> In my constituency there is the research unit in Kinsealy and I am pleased the new Minister for Agriculture and Food, Dr. Woods, has given a commitment to keep open that centre.  However, the commitment he has given is not enough.  The allocation in the Estimate of £1 million does not go far enough to deal with the major problems.  We have great potential if only we invested in research and development.  We have the expertise and the technique.  I fear that when the Minister says the research unit is safe he may still sell the family silver &mdash; the assets, the resources, the 60 acres of land &mdash; that could be cultivated and utilised to improve the whole industry in north County Dublin, Meath and Louth, a natural region for horticulture.  I fear there is a hidden agenda to sell that land which has an extra value at a giveaway price.  I will not accept lands being sold off to individuals or groups who are waiting in the wings.</P>
    <P>I could refer to many aspects of health care.  Has the budget done anything to reduce the waiting lists for people seeking hospital care?  Has the budget done anything to ensure that community health care is provided?  There is nothing in the budget to deal with that major problem. A health centre is long awaited in Swords, County Dublin a town which has a population of 25,000 people.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare announced in the budget barely keep pace with the rate of inflation and this is at a time when social welfare recipients will be hit by increases in VAT rates and in differential rents.  The budget is only one vehicle available to the Government to bring about greater equality in this country. The Government, through the Estimates and the budget, can shape the type of society we want.  Unfortunately, having listened to the contributions of the Minister and other speakers it is clear that this Coalition Government have little or no commitment to bringing about greater equality. On this basis, it gives me no great joy to say that I have no confidence in the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the Opposition speakers that I have been listening to mentioned the need for Dáil reform.  I concur with all the remarks made in that regard.  As one of my colleagues, who is not present in the House, said on many occasions we spend our time talking to the wood and the leatherette.  Ordinary Members of the House find the manner in which we arrange debates frustrating.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to carry out major reforms.  It is urgent that that commitment is implemented as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, it was not met before the deadline of the end of December last.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we look at our archaic voting procedures, the speaking arrangements for Members who wish to contribute to debates and, in particular, the way this House and the Seanad deal with the legislative process.  As someone who has been trying to pioneer a Bill through the Oireachtas for the past 12 months, I am well aware that Ministers find it extremely frustrating that they have to negotiate with the various Whips, in seeking to have a major Bill put through the House, to have time allocated to deal with that Bill and amendments to it in a rational, logical and coherent fashion.  Indeed, one is lucky to get one hour or one day.  This is not an adequate way to deal with important legislative matters.  Before this House is forced by outside influences to reform itself it is important that the commitment in the Programme for Government is implemented as quickly as possible.  The Progressive Democrats, as a partner in Government, are anxious to ensure that Dáil reforms are carried out during the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority of the Progressive Democrats and the Government as a whole is to tackle the appalling level of unemployment. We must, as politicians, explore every possible avenue and every means of doing this.  The comprehensive tax reform proposals contained in this year's budget, which have been widely hailed as the most radical and most <Col N="1476" /> reformist ever introduced in this country, will undoubtedly play a huge part in helping to generate employment opportunities. There is no doubt right across the developed world that lower rates of personal tax not only benefit those at work but significantly improve the climate for enterprise and job creation. The consequent reduction in the cost of employing people will make it far more attractive for employers to take on extra workers.</P>
    <P>The broadening of the tax base is another Progressive Democrats policy priority.  During the past three years we have seen the tax take from the corporate sector double to over £700 million, or 7 per cent of the total tax take.  It is still not enough but at least we are moving in the right direction.  Furthermore, the proposed fringe benefits tax allied to the proposed taxing of short term social welfare benefits is intended to ensure that all forms of income, whether from wages, perks, or welfare, are treated equally under the tax code.  This is the sensible way forward.  It is what every expert study of our taxation system has recommended. We have had a number of such studies, the results of many of which have been left to wither away on library shelves all over the country.</P>
    <P>The question of taxing short term social welfare benefits has brought much adverse comment in this House from members of the Opposition parties.  Let me say this: I do not think there is any Deputy in the House who is not aware of the fact that as we approach the end of each tax year the old pain in the back seems to become more prevalent.  It is true that in January, February and March, at the end of each tax year, it seems that far more people suffer from the old pain in the back than during any of the other months of the year.  There is no doubt that if it proves to be more beneficial for an individual to work nine months and claim social welfare benefit for three months, because they would be substantially better off as a result, many people will opt for that system.  All forms of income from whatever source, be it from welfare, direct work or perks, must <Col N="1477" /> be treated on the same basis and nobody must be given a tax advantage simply because he or she earns income from a different source.</P>
    <P>When this country has a simple, fair, easy to operate tax system and when it becomes clear that tax evasion scams of every sort will be strenuously punished we will be on the road to equity and enterprise.  Thanks to the implementation of a significant proportion of the Programme for Government agreed between the two parties in Government, the 1992 budget is a reforming, radical budget which sets us well on the way towards having a fair, simple and coherent tax system.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the substantial decreases in the personal rates of income tax, with the higher rate coming down by four percentage points to 48p and the lower rate by two percentage points to 27p, leaving us with just two tax bands, are being funded by changes in the tax system.  This is appropriate and is the right approach.  It would be inappropriate to fund personal taxation changes through borrowings, decreases in public spending or cutbacks in health, education or welfare services.</P>
    <P>Welcome as these reforms are and while undoubtedly they will improve the prospects for greater employment, on their own they are not enough.  That is the reason it is also essential that the Government implement as a matter of priority the recommendations of the Culliton industrial review group.  This report was produced in record time by their practitioner committee.  They were appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to review industrial policy last June and given a six months deadline.</P>
    <P>To further underline the Minister's determination to promote radical change in the industrial reform area, the committee were comprised solely of people from outside the realm of the Government's own jobs and industrial policy agency.  This is no reflection on the sterling efforts that they have made during the years but it is all too painfully obvious that industrial policy, as practised and <Col N="1478" /> promoted in this country over the past two decades, has been an abysmal failure and the 270,000 unemployed people are grim testimony to this.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly saw that if industrial policy reform was to be in any way meaningful it had to reach beyond the orthodox definition of industrial policy as we have known it.  Hence, the Culliton review group were given broad terms of reference.  Their report underlines the interdependence of such factors as infrastructural costs, telecommunications, job training, our education system and much more.  Their sweeping recommendations for change must be undertaken with urgency and the task force which my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has recently appointed must approach their task with this in mind. Clearly, this is one report which must not simply gather dust.  The Progressive Democrats are determined that decisive and speedy action in implementing it will proceed immediately.</P>
    <P>Sadly, however, the bottom line is even if the industrial review is implemented from first to last inside a couple of years the scourge of long-term mass unemployment will still dog our society.  This is the reason orthodox responses alone will not adequately ensure that every able-bodied person in our society, eager and willing to work and participate in worthwhile activity in this society, can be looked after.</P>
    <P>We must then look to other measures, such as expanding social employment schemes, looking at the incidence of overtime in both the public and private sectors, promoting job-sharing on a wider basis and other initiatives that will spread the inadequate supply of work in our society as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>We must be imaginative and find worthwhile activity; we must be far more willing to look outside the traditional definition of what constitutes worthwhile employment if we are to give people meaningful things to do.  In that regard all parties in this House, the social partners and the Government have a part to <Col N="1479" /> play and we must not reject any suggestion, from whatever source.  We must all be involved in a partnership in trying to look at this problem realistically and honestly and trying to ensure that we, as elected representatives, do not play party politics in our endeavours to win a few votes from each other.  It is important to see the jobs crisis for what it is and that we do not make false commitments which cannot be honoured.  We all have a responsibility to be far more open and honest with each other.  We have long passed the stage, in terms of unemployment, when the Opposition oppose simply for the sake of opposing.</P>
    <P>The revised Programme for Government negotiated last October placed a very heavy emphasis on protecting the living standards of all social welfare recipients.  We want to develop support for families with children and to promote greater equality between all categories of social welfare recipients.  The budget makes significant progress in meeting these criteria.  Besides the general 4 per cent rise the rate of increase for the lower level short term allowances, including unemployment benefit, disability benefit, short term unemployment assistance and the supplementary welfare allowance will be increased by 6 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>The allocation to the Combat Poverty Agency, the additional allocation to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and the money being allocated for schools in disadvantged areas for the provision of caretakers and secretaries are very important and significant steps in helping the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society.  There is no doubt that, even when one thinks in terms of unemployment, an educated unemployed person is far better off &mdash; and has a much greater chance of being able to cope &mdash; than an uneducated unemployed person. Education is the key to equality in society and we must place great store and emphasis on ensuring that we do not allow the disadvantaged to become more disadvantaged, particularly in times of economic difficulty.</P>
    <P>As a woman Deputy, I particularly <Col N="1480" /> welcome the allocation of £22 million this year towards the implementation of equality treatment under the European Community Directive.  The Minister for Finance has given a commitment that further allocations will be made in 1993 and 1994 to meet back payments due under the directive relating to equal treatment of men and women in matters of social security.  This arises because whereas the date of implementation of the directive was May and November in 1986, it should have been implemented by the deadline of December 1984.  These payments will cover the period in between for people who were entitled to them and it is right and appropriate that they should be paid.</P>
    <P>There is also the very welcome measure in relation to back to school payments which are being increased by £10 per child next September.  It means that for primary school children the payment goes to £35 and to £50 for second level children.  This measure will cost £2.2 million this year.</P>
    <P>The scheme being introduced for adoptive mothers must also be welcomed by all Members of the House.  Maternity leave for a ten week period on the same basis as existing maternity leave will now be available for mothers of adoptive children. This is a very progressive measure and, with the full implementation of the equality directive, indicates the Government's commitment to ensuring that women are treated fairly and equally.</P>
    <P>The payments being increased under the family income supplement amount to between £9 and £11 per week and they are also welcome.  It is very important, if we want to tackle the poverty trap of low pay, to ensure that people lucky enough to get employment, do not lose out financially <i>vis-á-vis</i> a person on social welfare. The overall limit to qualify for the family income supplement is being raised by between £15 and £18 per week, depending on the number of children in the family.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the announcement of the Minister for Finance that he will spend more on publicising the family income scheme so that many people who <Col N="1481" /> are entitled to it &mdash; but who have not availed of it because of a lack of information &mdash; will be encouraged to make application for what they are entitled to. The provision of £3 million for services for the mentally handicapped is also welcome. It is appalling that the parents of mentally handicapped children have had to take their campaign for greater improved service and places for their mentally handicapped dependants to the streets.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to my own area of interest, the environment.  It is important that when the State becomes involved in developments, it adopts an approach consistent with the highest environmental standards.  This is particularly true in the case of the interpretative centres proposed for the Dingle Peninsula, the Burren, the Wicklow Mountains and the Boyne Valley.  I am deeply concerned that the approach being currently adopted to these centres takes little account of the legitimate concerns of local people for the environment.</P>
    <P>I am in favour, in principle, of the idea of developing tourism infrastructure, and interpretative centres in the right location should be part of that infrastructure. However, in areas of outstanding natural beauty, the State in particular must ensure that it carries out independent environmental impact assessment studies and ensures that the centres are located in the most appropriate areas.  In the case of the Dingle Peninsula, for example, it is plain that this area has reached full capacity in terms of tourist numbers.  Many, if not all, those tourists are high spending, car borne tourists.  Experience in this country and elsewhere tells us that interpretative centres of the scale proposed in Dingle will attract large numbers of coaches and change the emphasis from high value to low value mass tourism.  Far from benefiting the local economy the interpretative centre currently proposed may actually discourage the type of tourist on which that economy now depends.  It is vital, if these centres are to go ahead in specific locations in Kerry, Clare, Wicklow or the Boyne Valley, that their <Col N="1482" /> development is consistent with an overall management plan for the areas.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works that he is considering a request from Wicklow County Council to refrain from going ahead with the visitors' centre for the Wicklow mountains national park until a major study of the county's upland region is completed.  This move will be of benefit in ensuring that these developments are consistent with the protection of the environment and appropriate tourism development.  A similar management plan for the Dingle Peninsula, the Boyne Valley and the Burren is urgently needed before any steps are taken to proceed with the construction of the proposed centres.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the announcement made yesterday by the Minister for Tourism and Transport regarding the reopening of the Harcourt Street line as a bus-way.  The Minister agreed that there is widespread acceptance that the Harcourt Street line should constitute a central element of any overall network solution to Dublin's public transport problems.  The Minister will also agree that our experience with the DART and Dublin Bus systems have shown that people will simply not get out of their cars for any type of bus.  The time for a piecemeal solution to our transport problems is over; the city of Dublin needs an integrated approach to public transport and that approach must encompass the construction of a light rail system.  The funding of this system from the European Community and the private sector will be available in the short term and to talk of an interim solution, such as a bus-way, will only delay the day when we have a successful light rail system for Dublin.  It is essential that any money which might have been earmarked for the eastern bypass, which would destroy the natural amenity of Dublin Bay and areas like Sandymount, should be diverted to putting in place in the city and county of Dublin a proper light rail system such as the one recently introduced in the city of Manchester, which is similar in size to Dublin.</P>

      <Col N="1483" /> This year's budget is not just a reforming one in terms of the tax measures taken, it is not just one which will further encourage enterprise and reward initiative; it will give people more in terms of take home pay and allow them to make the kind of decisions about their own life as to how they will spend it.  It is a budget with a strong social dimension, it helps welfare recipients and seeks to treat everyone on the same basis.  It seeks to set in place a fair and equal society because I believe that ordinary people object to &mdash; not so much the level of tax &mdash; but the fact that some sectors of the community, because they are paid by way of perks or whatever, pay a lot less tax than those in other sectors.  The disparity and unfairness of that is what causes such unrest in our community.  The measures in the budget announced by the Minister for Finance last week go a long way towards levelling the playing pitch so far as ordinary taxpayers and ordinary people are concerned.  The budget is the beginning of a process: it is the Government's intention that the commitment in the Programme for Government to a standard rate of tax of 25 per cent and a higher rate of 44 per cent will be met in next year's budget.  The Progressive Democrats look forward to participating in Government and seeing to it that those measures are introduced.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment may be interested to hear that white smoke has been seen coming from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party rooms on the fifth floor.  I wish to congratulate Deputy Reynolds on having been elected Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I wish him well in the future.  Barring unforeseen circumstances presumably he will take over as Taoiseach next Tuesday but he will face a very difficult task in trying to turn around the economy.  I wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I refer to the measures in the budget, I wish to refer briefly to the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, in regard to Dáil reform. <Col N="1484" /> She summed up the position very well.  It is disappointing in debates such as this to see one Deputy after another basically talking to himself or herself.  This makes a mockery of democracy.  Dáil procedure needs to be reformed urgently.  The committee system needs to be expanded so that the talents of all Members can be utilised.  Even though the Government have to take precedence, they do not have all the answers to the problems. An expanded committee system would enable Members to put forward their suggestions so that they can be debated and, hopefully, acted upon.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the Taoiseach and his Cabinet meet next week, they will realise that the central issue facing the nation is job creation.  I am sure most Members who have contributed to this debate have referred to the need to make job creation a priority.  Having analysed the 1992 budget, I have to ask what it will do to reduce the level of unemployment. Will it have led to a reduction in the number of people on the dole queues by the time the 1993 budget is introduced?</P>
    <P>The Government Estimates for 1992 make provision for a continuing level of unemployment of 270,000.  This speaks for itself and does not indicate any great confidence in the Government about their ability to create jobs.  Speaker after speaker on the other side of the House has claimed that the budget is a landmark in terms of job creation, that somehow it will take us down a new road and that jobs will flow.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some progress in the budget in relation to tax reform.  I am sure that, like me, every citizen would like people to pay less tax.  The budget continues the reform of our tax system initated in the 1987 budget and continued perhaps more strongly in the 1989 budget.  However, we have to ask if the results will be any different.  Even though tax was reduced in the 1987 and 1989 budgets, unemployment continued to rise.  There is no clear-cut guarantee that the tax reform proposals in this budget will result in jobs for everyone.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, the issue of job creation must remain the primary concern <Col N="1485" /> of the Government.  Apart from a weekly social welfare cheque, approximately 270,000 families have no income.  The cost to the State of increased social welfare payments and tax foregone is enormous.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage where social chaos and disorder cannot be far away.  Almost 20 per cent of our working population are unemployed, over twice the EC average.  If we believe that people will continue to suffer in silence we are taking a very innocent view of things.  All the indications are that unemployment will continue to rise in 1992 and that it will not be too long before 300,000 people will be officially unemployed.  Some years ago, the then Taoiseach.  Mr. Lynch, stated that if unemployment reached a level of 100,000 he would feel duty bound to resign.  The incoming Taoiseach is facing the possibility of unemployment rising to 300,000 during his first six months in office.  I do not know what action he will take between now and then to deal with the problem but I certainly hope he will make it a priority.</P>
    <P>While the tax reform measures in the budget may be of some help in reducing the unemployment level they will not produce the dramatic results now required.  We cannot continue to accept the present taxation system.  The Minister has merely tinkered around with the system in the budget and has not introduced any of the radical reforms needed at a time when there is an unprecedented level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and many non-political groups have called for the setting up of a national jobs forum.  I want to be associated with this request.  The Government do not have all the ideas on how to create jobs &mdash; if they do, they must be very limited.  Many political parties and interest groups have views on how to resolve our unemployment problem.  If the Government ignore the suggestions of these people, they will do so at their peril.  I hope the new Taoiseach will make the setting up of a jobs forum a priority. For some strange reason the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and I wish him well in his retirement, opposed the <Col N="1486" /> idea of a national jobs forum.  He seemed to believe that the Government had all the answers.  However, as we know they do not have all the answers.  The new Taoiseach should take into account the views of all groups on job creation.</P>
    <P>The Government need to seriously examine their job creation record and the cost of job creation to date.  Thousands of millions of pounds have been spent over the past number of years in job creation measures.  While some jobs have been created, an equal number of jobs have been lost.  A jobs forum could look at the cost of job preservation as well as at the cost of job creation.  I am sure many Deputies know of small factories, cottage-like industries, which have closed down with the loss of five or six jobs.</P>
    <P>Many of those factories closed simply because they could not afford to pay the £20,000, £30,000, or £40,000 they owed to the Revenue Commissioners or to third parties.  The cost of cheap loans to keep those factories open would be minimal in comparison with the cost of unemployment payments to those people or of setting up new industries, which in many instances would amount to £30,000 or £40,000 per job.  I hope job preservation and job creation will be discussed in more detail by the Government and interested parties in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, and other Deputies said the tax reform measures in the budget would turn the tide of unemployment.  I do not totally disagree with that analysis, but at the end of the day work is taxed as a luxury rather than a necessity.  Tax on work is higher than tax on capital or profits, and that is a matter we should consider.  There is no incentive for employers to employ extra workers.  The incentive is to purchase a machine rather than employ a worker.  While that practice continues we will have high levels of unemployment. The tax reform measures will not make a substantial difference to unemployment in the early and mid-nineties.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker for the Opposition, Deputy Ryan, expressed disappointment at the changes in relation to profit-sharing.  His analysis is correct in <Col N="1487" /> that worker-participation should be encouraged.  One of the best ways of doing this is through profit-sharing schemes.  To do away with those schemes would be a retrograde step and I am disappointed the Minister has moved in that direction.  The changes will result in a minimal saving to the State and will do nothing to encourage profit-sharing or job creation.</P>
    <P>No dramatic changes have been made in the social welfare system.  Annual increases in social welfare have been in line with inflation.  I welcome the increases but, unfortunately, according to the groups who deal with those marginalised in our society, thousands of Irish families live below the poverty line. The increases as announced last week are not sufficient to turn the tide as far as those people are concerned.</P>
    <P>The red tape surrounding the social welfare system is almost an industry in itself.  There are too many social welfare schemes.  We should aim at introducing basic social welfare schemes, whether for the unemployed, disabled or separated people.  There are so many schemes that one would almost need a Ph.D in English to understand all the documents involved.  I hope the Minister for Social Welfare will consider streamlining social welfare schemes with a view to making them more meaningful and responsive to the needs of the people.  He should eliminate the red tape which in many cases prevents people applying for social welfare.  The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, referred to the family income supplement.  This excellent scheme is under-utilised because people are unaware of its existence.  The streamlining of social welfare schemes would result in payments being made sooner to those in need.</P>
    <P>I agree in principle with the carer's allowance but I am not happy with the operation of this scheme.  I had hoped that the Minister would have announced changes in this scheme but he did not do so.  Many questions have been put at Question Time to the Minister for Social Welfare on this matter but the response <Col N="1488" /> has not been positive.  The carer's allowance is an excellent scheme but at present only 3,500 people qualify for it.  I was present in the Dáil Chamber when it was announced in a budget speech and the Minister estimated at the time that 28,000 people would qualify for it.  As the take-up is less than anticipated the scheme should be brought back on track.</P>
    <P>Carer's allowances enable people to care for their elderly relatives at home and result in huge savings to the State. We are all aware that the cost to the State of keeping a person in a State-run home or hospital is £300 to £500 per week. Considering that the carer's allowance is £55 per week it makes sense not just socially but also economically to expand the scheme and make it more readily available to those who are willing to care for their elderly relatives in the comfort of their homes.  I appeal to the Minister to see if changes can be made even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the health budget.  It appears that health boards will continue to stumble from crisis to crisis in 1992, with thousands of people remaining on hospital waiting lists.  The suggestion was made by the Fine Gael spokesperson on Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and has been made by numerous interests throughout the country, that a large proportion of surplus national lottery money should be spent on health in 1992, specifically to cater for those awaiting hospital treatment. I fully support this view.  At a time when national lottery money is allocated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and is spent on questionable projects, it is difficult to explain to people who have been waiting 12 months or two years for an operation why some of this funding cannot be made available to alleviate their plight.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, to ensure that national lottery funding is made available as part of the health budget for 1992 so that thousands of people on waiting lists can be treated. We must remember that by the time hip or joint replacement operations are carried out they will cost more to the State. <Col N="1489" /> National lottery money should be used to speed up this process.</P>
    <P>I intended to speak on the housing crisis.  I was amazed to hear the Minister state yesterday that a crisis did not exist when 20,000 people are waiting for council houses.  During 1992 we will build approximately 1,200 houses, which is totally inadequate.  As a result of the housing crisis every health board is paying tens of thousands of pounds weekly in the form of subsidies to assist people in private rented accommodation.  This problem must be addressed by the building of more public housing as well as by making grants available, such as the £5,000 surrender grant which was paid to people who left their council houses, and I suggest the new house grant which was set at £2,000 back in 1980-81 be increased, if it is to be of meaningful assistance to young married couples.</P>
    <P>The 1992 budget may be a move in the right direction but if we are to solve the unemployment and housing crises and to face up to the problems in social welfare and agriculture, we need to go much further.</P>
    <P>The election of a new Taoiseach and the formation of a new Government offers the opportunity for a new beginning. We must note the public disquiet about politics and make a new beginning. We must put the issues of unemployment, emigration and housing on the top of the political agenda.  Let us hope that the issues and not the scandals will be discussed in Dáil Éireann during the remainder of 1992.</P>

      <P>As I rise to speak, the House is buzzing with the news that Deputy Albert Reynolds has been elected Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and as such is Taoiseach-elect.  I am delighted to congratulate my constituency colleague and wish him luck in the difficult job that is ahead of him.  I hope the incoming Taoiseach will put behind him the squabbles and internal turmoil in the party over the past couple of months and will now get on with the job in hand and address the difficulties that face the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> This is the third budget I have had the opportunity to speak on as a Member of this House.  While I welcome certain aspects, the budget has been a disappointment overall.  I welcome the reduction in the rates of personal taxation. The reduction in the standard rate from 29 per cent to 27 per cent is worthwhile and will benefit a certain number of people.  It will be of marginal benefit to the lower paid who are paying tax at the standard rate.  I understand that in the region of 61 per cent of the working population are presently taxed at the standard rate only.  The 2 per cent reduction will be a small benefit to them. However, 39 per cent of the working population pay at the higher rates of tax, that is, 48 per cent and 52 per cent but now they will all be in the 48 per cent tax band.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the tax bands were not widened.  While the benefits that will accrue, due to the reduction in the rates of tax, are marginal at the standard rate, a person with an income of £30,000 a year will benefit to the tune of approximately £1,000 a year.  That is quite a substantial amount of money to somebody on that income.  The benefits are greater for those higher up the ladder.  I was talking to an accountant this morning and he pointed out that somebody with a taxable income of £400,000 per annum &mdash; that seems a huge amount of money and I was absolutely staggered when he told me that quite a number of people earn those kinds of salaries &mdash; will now pay tax at 48 per cent and as a result of the reduction from 52 per cent he will be better off at the end of the day by £16,000.</P>
    <P>This raises the question of tax bands. Is it not very strange that somebody on an income of £19,000 a year will move on to the high rate of tax at 48 per cent while somebody with a taxable income of £400,000 will pay the same rate of tax?  Is it right that they are both taxed at the same rate?  Is his contribution to society so much better that he should get those extra benefits from the Department of Finance?  Is there not something radically wrong when somebody earning less than <Col N="1491" /> £400 a week with a take-home pay of somewhere in the region of £250 a week would pay tax at the same rate as somebody earning £8,000 a week?</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the new Minister for Finance did not look at that aspect of the budget.  Perhaps, instead of reducing the top rate from 52 per cent to 48 per cent the Minister could have used this money to widen the tax band at the bottom of the scale and reduce the percentage of people on the higher rate of tax.  I understand that up to 100,000 taxpayers would come into the standard tax band if the top rate of tax of 52 per cent had been retained and the 48 per cent rate abolished.  That would be a tremendous achievement and we should move towards that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance introduced taxation on benefits-in-kind.  That raises all sorts of queries.  We are all familiar with benefits-in-kind, for example, the company car, but people are already taxed on that.  What about the situation where the company pays the VHI subscription for their employees, and I understand that a number of the large companies do that?  Will they continue to pay it, bearing in mind the extra cost to them?  What about people who avail of the VHI group schemes?  One that comes to mind straight away is my own profession of teaching under which there is a reduced premium.  Will this be deemed now to be a benefit-in-kind?  Will an extra tax be placed on us because as teachers we avail of the group scheme? Teachers have reduced rates for car insurance.  Will that now be considered a benefit-in-kind?</P>
    <P>We hear that if the company provide a car parking space that other people would have to pay for that is a benefit-in-kind and that tax will have to be paid on it.  That raises the question: what is the position of Members of this House, who are privileged to have an exclusive car parking space in the centre of Dublin at no cost?  Will that mean that an extra burden will be put on our employer, the Minister for Finance, who will have to impose a tax on himself?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> Some employers provide subsidised restaurants.  That is a benefit-in-kind.  We could consider the position right across the board.  People employed by Irish Rail get free travel or special rates on travel. Is that to be classed as a benefit-in-kind and, if so, how is it to be taxed?  What about many of those who work in some of the chain stores and who can buy goods at preferential rates?  Will there be a tax placed on them in that respect?  The tax that is being placed on benefits-in-kind will have to be borne by the employer, so it will cost the employer more to give those benefits.  As a result of the employer facing increased cost his workers will cost him more, and the inevitable result of that is a reduced number of jobs.  Therefore, this tax is another tax on jobs.  If an employer takes away benefits from his staff or reduces benefits will the result be industrial unrest and many disputes because of employees wishing to maintain benefits to which they have become accustomed?  We may well ask whether this change will lead us into a turbulent period in Irish industry? The Minister will have to consider the position very carefully when drafting the new Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking about a reduction in the number of jobs, but one has to remember that, unfortunately, thare are approximately 270,000 people on the dole queues.  Will the budget do anything to help them?  Will the various tax measures introduced in the budget create more jobs?  The Government must be fairly forthright in indicating that we have to look to the private sector to create jobs.  The Government are busily shedding jobs in the public sector so we have to encourage the private sector to create the necessary extra jobs.  Will the measures introduced in the budget create any jobs?  Is the budget not going to be a burden on jobs and result in more unemployment and more emigration?</P>
    <P>It is important to put on the record that somewhere in the region of 150,000 people, a tremendous number, have left this country since the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey came into office <Col N="1493" /> in 1987.  The latest census of population shows County Westmeath, to be one of the areas very badly hit by emigration. Westmeath would not generally be viewed as an emigration blackspot but the preliminary census figures show that our rate of emigration is the third highest in the country.  That is a very frightening statistic, yet one can see evidence of that when one visits some of the villages in north Westmeath; there are houses locked up, empty and falling into disrepair.  Unfortunately, that is the sign of the times.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the effect of the budget on the motor industry.  The owners of company cars will face a substantial increase in tax on those cars.  They have been paying tax on the cars for a while but the budget will increase the rate substantially. Employers who have given their employees company cars will now try to find some way around the increased tax so that an employee is not penalised for having a car.  I am sure that new systems will be devised whereby an employee buys out the vehicle and is then paid travelling expenses.  The increased rate of tax will have the effect of reducing the number of cars purchased each year because industry and business generally buy a large proportion of the total number of cars purchased.</P>
    <P>I suppose that the nine pence reduction on the price of a gallon of petrol would be regarded as a tremendous benefit. However, it will mean to a person, driving an average of about 8,000 miles per year, a saving of about £18 a year, an insignificant amount.  At the same time as the cost of petrol is reduced by £18 per year for the average driver, he or she will have to pay an increased car tax of approximately £40, irrespective of whether they use their car.  On that front, the average driver will come out rather badly.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister Deputy Harney is in the House because I know of her great concern for the environment. On the question of the reduction in the price of petrol, I am disappointed, though, that the reduction in petrol was not matched by a similar or <Col N="1494" /> an even further reduction in the price of diesel on the grounds that diesel is more environmentally friendly.  Perhaps that is a matter that the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues could examine and do something about.</P>
    <P>Another worrying aspect in relation to the motor industry is that there will now be a registration fee for imported cars. Heretofore when importers brought in cars from Japan or elsewhere they had to pay up front the full value of each car, whether it be £3,000, £4,000 or some other figure.  There will now be a change in that importers will not have to put as much money up front in order to bring in the cars, and they will therefore have more money available to bring in imported cars.  Because the extra charge will be made at the point of registration, importers of foreign cars will receive an added bonus and will thus be able to flood the market even further and the number of ordinary sales will reduce.</P>
    <P>The difficulties faced by the motor industry as a result of the budget will further reduce jobs in that industry.</P>
    <P>I suppose we would all welcome the reduction in excise duty on new cars, but that will deal a very severe blow to dealers holding new cars in stock before the announcement of the reduction in duty.  A dealer in my locality had 40 new cars in stock on the day of the budget.  He estimates that he will lose aproximately £16,000 as a result of the overnight reduction in the cost of new cars.  I suppose that is a problem dealers will have to put up with but it is indeed very disappointing to those who face such losses.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention very briefly the implications of the budget for education. The education budget has been increased by a small amount this year. Unfortunately, that increase will only just keep pace with the payment of salaries and so on.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the amount provided for capital expenditure has not been improved to any great extent.  I recall that in 1986 when the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, was in Opposition she criticised the then <Col N="1495" /> Minister for Education for the amount of money that was being put into capital expenditure on schools, on new schools and school repairs.  It is sad to reflect that the amount being spent on new school buildings this year is less than half the amount that Deputy O'Rourke said was inadequate in 1986, and that is not taking into account inflation.  At the opening of a new school some time ago I heard the Minister Deputy O'Rourke declare her ambition to rid the schools of the prefab villages that surrounded them. How does such a statement carry through when the capital expenditure allocated in this budget is so dismal?</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of education that have not been addressed.  The free book scheme is very inadequate for dealing with the needs of pupils.  As more people are caught in the poverty trap, the provision of school books is a major problem.  The sum provided by the Department of Education is miserable. It does not do a great deal to encourage children from less well-off families to improve their education.  The capitation allowances in schools has not been substantially improved and this creates great problems.  In my area there is a continuous round of dances, fund raising events, table quizzes and so on to raise money to keep schools going.  I am disappointed that provision was not made in the budget for that contingency.</P>
    <P>This budget is anti-family.  There is nothing in it to build up families.  There is not any mention of the family and there is not any specific help for families.  Life assurance relief has been abolished.  Life insurance was taken out by the head of the household to cater for his family in the event of his death.  Child benefits were not increased and that too was disappointing as that was one of the few ways we had of aiding a family.  About 40 per cent of Irish children are in households that are short of money.</P>
    <P>The housing programme is totally inadequate and the social housing programme launched 12 months ago has been a tremendous disapppointment.  I welcome the 4 per cent increase in social welfare <Col N="1496" /> benefits but it is not adequate.  Although it was not elaborated on, I welcome the fact that the FIS scheme is to be extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This year I hoped the budget would have been jobs driven. Last year the Fine Gael Party and our leader proposed that all parties should come together to form a jobs forum in an effort to attack unemployment.  We have reached the highest level of unemployment in the history of the State. Having refused the offer to partake in a jobs forum I hoped the Government would take the opportunity in the budget to create an environment conducive to job creation.  This did not happen.  From the point of view of job creation the budget is a major disappointment.</P>
      <P>Some people believe that changes in the tax system automatically lead to job creation, but the tax changes in the budget only continue the policy of previous years which has been proved to be useless.  Under the regime of the past two years unemployment has dramatically increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fortunate that we have natural resources and are able to produce some of the finest agricultural products in the world.  Yet, we have not capitalised on that resource or created the necessary jobs spin off from agriculture.  The Minister in his budget speech did not mention the agriculture industry.  His only reference to agriculture was when he dealt with the proposed taxing of co-operatives. The Minister said that since the introduction of the exemption many years ago, co-operatives had undergone radical transformation and that the distinction between the co-operatives and other commercial entities had almost disappeared. The Minister then proposed the introduction of corporation tax on co-operatives. This will seriously affect the farming and fishing industries.  The Minister proposes to impose a 40 per cent tax on all co-operatives.  Farmers, as a result, might receive much reduced prices for their products from the co-operatives and the goods purchased by them from the co-operatives will be sold at a higher cost <Col N="1497" /> so that the co-operatives can meet the corporation tax demand.  That is a very short-sighted view in regard to job creation.  In this sector there was an opportunity to implement job creation policies.  Instead of encouraging initiative, the budget stifles it.</P>
    <P>The fishing areas which also happen to be the severely disadvantaged areas will now be affected by the 40 per cent corporation tax on co-operatives.  Some of the co-operatives were only set up in the past ten years and as they will now be under more pressure from the Department this will stifle their initiative and hamper progress.</P>
    <P>In addition, agriculture co-operatives are having difficulties with the milk quota buy-out scheme.  They are being encouraged by the Department to reduce the overall milk quota by 1.9 per cent.  The problem is that more farmers than anticipated are offering their quotas for sale and, in some instances, up to 12 per cent of quotas are being given back to the co-operatives who are bound to accept them.  There is not any clear indication from the Department or the EC as to how they will deal with that.  The co-operatives are in a quandary in relation to the buy-out scheme.</P>
    <P>Those factors, coupled with the fact that the Minister has given an assurance to pay £2 million of the headage grants due for 1991 in 1992 and a commitment to make further payments in 1993 and 1994, not the £10 million outstanding, leave questions to be answered.  How much does the Minister intend to pay, in 1993 and 1994?  This combination of factors is a serious blow to the farming community and the Government are blind to what is going on there.  Over the past year farmers have suffered one of the most serious income cuts ever experienced.  Average farm income has reduced from £12,000 to £8,000 and many have been forced to apply for assistance from the Department of Social Welfare. This is happening at a time when the Government should be exploring ways of creating jobs in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget which needs to be questioned is the Minister's <Col N="1498" /> promise to introduce equality payments. For this year the Minister has allocated £2 million for equal pay to women.  I understand that this will only cater for payments to 4,000 or 5,000 women while more than 40,000 women should benefit from equality payments.</P>

Last week saw the 20th anniversary of the tragic events of Bloody Sunday in Derry when 14 people were shot dead, 13 on the day, one later dying of his injuries in hospital, and many more injured by the British Army Parachute Regiment.  To many people this was the most significant event in the conflict in the North, coming as it did at a crucial stage in that conflict.  It is now widely accepted that one of the immediate and direct results of the events of that day was that it motivated many young people in the Nationalist community in the North and indeed many more in the South to join the Provisional IRA.  When a peaceful civil rights march was met with local military force, it convinced many young people that in future such military aggression could only be met by armed struggle.</P>
      <P>The view is still widely held in Nationalist areas in the North, most particularly in Derry's Bogside, that as long as the injustice of Bloody Sunday remains without redress, then condemnations of violence directed against British forces in the North are pointless. That is part of the legacy of Bloody Sunday.  The grief of the people of Derry's Bogside and in particular of the relatives and friends of those who died remains deeply rooted today, 20 years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That grief is compounded by the fact that the dead are officially held to be the guilty ones, officially held responsible, while the whole of Nationalist Derry knows that they were innocent, unarmed <Col N="1499" /> civilian participants in a civil rights march.  Indeed, thanks to the BBC and Channel 4 the whole world now knows that.  Significantly, as in the cases of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, it was British television that drew attention to the dreadful injustice of Bloody Sunday, not our own RTE.</P>
    <P>If the unfortunate people who died had instead been given life sentences in prison we would today no doubt be demanding their pardon and release, yet the very fact that their young lives were so brutally taken from them must make it all the more urgent that the truth be established and their names cleared.  That is the very least that should be done.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the role of the Catholic clergy in Derry in the events of Bloody Sunday.  I am sure we all vividly recall Father Edward Daly, now Bishop Daly, holding the white handkerchief trying in vain to protect the wounded and the dying.  On the British television programmes we heard the same clergy say they saw in front of their own eyes unarmed, defenceless, innocent people murdered by the British Army Parachute Regiment.  We cannot ignore this; it simply will not go away.</P>
    <P>Already members of the British Parliament from both the Labour and Conservative Parties have called for a new inquiry.  The Minister and the Government must not remain silent.  This House must not remain silent.  The Minister must state quickly and urgently what steps he and the Government intend to take to ensure that a new inquiry is held to establish the truth and see justice done.</P>
    <P>Both the BBC and Channel 4 programmes contained new evidence which strongly suggests that the Widgery Tribunal was nothing more than a whitewash &mdash; a cover-up by the British establishment. Widgery was a chief justice. Now in retrospect from the cases of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four we know just how prejudiced the British judicial establishment was and how willing they were to cover up the most appalling injustices against Irish people, <Col N="1500" /> whether by the British police or in this instance the Parachute Regiment and those who directed that regiment.  Widgery refused to believe the eye witnesses, the people and priests of Derry.  Widgery ignored the evidence that showed that unarmed people holding their hands up were shot dead.  Widgery accepted forensic evidence that undoubtedly would not be accepted today &mdash; that traces of lead on three of the bodies came from guns and not from other lead sources or indeed as a result of manhandling of the bodies by soldiers resulting in cross-contamination from the lead on the soldiers' own hands.  Widgery simply chose to believe the paratroops, regardless of all this.  To do otherwise would have been to accept &ldquo;an appalling vista&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The new evidence presented by British television destroys the Widgery findings. There are admissions by the paratroopers' own sergeant major that members of the regiment were out of control and that one individual soldier fired in excess of the ammunition officially given to him but could not identify any armed targets at which he was firing.</P>
    <P>An independent inquiry must be set up to re-examine all the evidence and all the circumstances.  The Minister and the Government must ensure that this happens, if necessary by appealing to the European Community to sponsor the inquiry.</P>

      <P>I sincerely thank Deputy Gregory for the opportunity to reply in regard to the tragic events which took place in Derry on the afternoon of 30 January 1972 when 13 people were shot dead and 17 others wounded.  As he stated, one person subsequently died.  These tragic events had the most profound implications for the people of Derry as a whole and for the subsequent evolution of the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those killed had been taking part in a civil rights march organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to protest against internment.  The needless <Col N="1501" /> deaths in Derry on that day evoked a deep sense of outrage and revulsion at the actions of the British Army unit involved, which was felt throughout Ireland and in the wider international community.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government made immediate and vigorous protests to the British Government through diplomatic channels. The then Government also took steps to bring the Bloody Sunday killings before the European Commission of Human Rights in the context of the interState cases which the Government brought against the United Kingdom in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>The British Government, in the aftermath of the killings, commissioned a tribunal, chaired by the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, who published their report in April 1972.  The terms of reference and findings of that report were regarded as inadequate by many including the Irish Government of the day.  In particular, the tribunal's findings could not be reconciled with the facts as known to a large number of responsible observers.  The then Taoiseach stated, in response to the publication of the Widgery report, that he found it difficult to see how Lord Widgery reached the general conclusions he did, even on the evidence set out in the report itself.  This reflected the widespread scepticism and unease which greeted the report, most particularly in Derry itself.</P>
    <P>Particular exception was taken by the relatives of those killed to the finding that some among the deceased were suspected of having been engaged in terrorist activities.  No independent evidence to support this contention was then, or has since been adduced.  Indeed the report itself admitted that &ldquo;none of the deceased or wounded is proved to have been shot whilst holding a firearm or bomb&rdquo;.  The already widely-held belief in the innocence of those killed has been further reinforced by recent television and media reports on these events.</P>
    <P>The findings of the Widgery Tribunal and, in particular, the presumption of complicity in violence, added greatly to the distress of those who had been bereaved.  Although the subsequent <Col N="1502" /> decision by the British authorities in 1974 to pay compensation to the relatives was accompanied by a statement to the effect that all the deceased should be regarded as having been found not guilty of the allegation of having been shot while handling a firearm or bomb, this did not remove the imputation left by the report's conclusions.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have consistently believed that those killed in Derry on Bloody Sunday were engaged in peaceful protest and were not involved in violence.  The Government appreciate that an acknowledgment in this sense by the British Government, even after the period of time which had elapsed, would be welcomed by the families concerned. The Government have noted with interest that a number of Members of the House of Commons, referred to by Deputy Gregory, from both main parties, have tabled motions requesting that the issue be re-examined, including a re-opening of the Widgery Tribunal and a review of the forensic evidence considered by the original tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Government welcome developments in this direction and hope that these can be translated into actions which will meet the legitimate concerns of all, including the Irish Government which have been voiced in this regard.  They believe such would contribute both to establishing an accurate record of what transpired on 30 January 1972, of itself important in enhancing the credibility of the system of justice, and to undoing a wrong to those families &mdash; referred to by Deputy Gregory &mdash; who have already suffered enough.  Such course of action would serve the cause of justice, contribute to the promotion of peace and reconciliation, and turn a new page in the life of a city which has shown a remarkable capacity to rise above adversity and unite in the interests of all its citizens.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Proposed Amalgamation of Dublin Schools.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me this opportunity to raise <Col N="1503" /> an issue of concern to many people in Crumlin, Drimnagh and Maryland districts.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday evening last I was present, with other public representatives, at a public meeting attended by in excess of 300 angry parents who had gathered to express their alarm and outrage that the plan to create a single co-educational second-level school in the parish of St. Bernadette in Crumlin had collapsed. Indeed it collapsed as a result of the Minister reneging on a commitment to contribute at least £150,000, a pittance, to facilitate the proposed merger.  Is the Minister concerned that back in February 1991 the parents' council and the school authorities had agreed a new name for the proposed amalgamated school and had gone so far as agreeing on the new school colours for its pupils?  Indeed the boys are today wearing the new colours, navy and blue, the original being grey.</P>
      <P>It appears the Minister neither knew nor cared just how far matters had progressed before his bombshell struck the community that the promised funds would not be made available.  Naturally, the Marist nuns considered the merger project then to be a dead duck.  Very quickly thereafter the Christian Brothers came to the same conclusion, that without funding there could be no merger.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain to me how it was deemed originally that approximately £1 million was required to convert a relatively new or modern school?  I am talking about Coláiste Caoimhín on Parnell Road, Dublin, 12 which is approximately 25 years old, which was to accommodate the girls from the Marist school?  How could such a building be deemed to be structurally unsound?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister does not agree now to pursue the amalgamation with the necessary determination and vigour the parish of St. Bernadette will lose not only two second-level schools but the very existence of their two primary schools will be threatened.  One might well ask: why? The reason is that most parents prefer their children to attend a school where their education will not be interrupted <Col N="1504" /> between primary and second-level, such interruption involving hassle for the children and parents who will have built up relationships between their student friends and teaching staff.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, in responding, will not inform me that there are 1,028 surplus places in second-level schools in the area, that the children can attend the vocational education committee schools &mdash; which is not where they want to go &mdash; or that they can go to the CBS school at Drimnagh Castle, the School of the Assumption in Walkinstown, St. Paul's at Greenhills or Loreto College, Crumlin. At present those four schools are overcrowded with long waiting lists of students endeavouring to gain entry.</P>
    <P>In an effort to rectify matters I appeal to the Minister to meet the parents' committee and representatives of the parents of the area, to work out with them a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the matter raised by Deputy Byrne I must point out, first that my Department indicated to the school authorities that the level of grant-aid being sought for the work envisaged would not be available in 1991 but that the Department were prepared to keep the matter under review.</P>
      <P>It might be helpful to sketch the background to this case in order to illustrate that the increased costs involved prevented my Department from giving a firm commitment as to when grant-aid would be available.  The amalgamation of those schools was raised in 1988.  Initially the plan envisaged was to base the amalgamated school in the boys' school. However, when it emerged that it would require almost £1.5 million it was evident that such costs could not be justified for a combined school of just over 400 pupils and the expectation that such numbers would fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such circumstances an evaluation was prepared of the likely cost of basing the school instead on the girls' school <Col N="1505" /> site.  In June 1990 the Department indicated that such a development could proceed on the basis of providing the minimum additional accommodation that might be required.  This was established to be accommodation not exceeding £150,000 in cost.  It was emphasised to the school authorities, at a meeting held in the Department, that the provision of the accommodation must be kept within the specified costs limits.</P>
    <P>When costings for the work were received from the schools' consultants the figures were far in excess of what were approved &mdash; £287,000 for new accommodation and £115,000 for work to existing buildings.  At a meeting in the Department the school authorities were informed that the costings were far in excess of what had been agreed and that the Department could not allow the project to proceed on that basis.  Apart from the fact that such sums had not been budgeted for in the Department's financial planning, the question of whether such a level of expenditure would be justified at all would have to be examined. The level of expenditure indicated was not acceptable.  Therefore, the school authorities were informed that grant-aid would not be available in 1991.</P>
    <P>I must stress that, while the Department wish to facilitate this amalgamation on educational and economic grounds, they contend it would not constitute priority for funds in view of the extreme shortage of capital for school work and the fact that, first, the schools' enrolments are declining, second, the schools &mdash; especially the CBS &mdash; occupy accommodation in excess of their requirements and, third, in view of the many other urgent priorities facing my Department.</P>
    <P>In the general area comprised of Crumlin and Drimnagh there is a large amount of surplus accommodation due mainly to declining numbers of pupils at primary level.  Even after the closure of these two schools there will remain a surplus of accommodation.  In the circumstances I am satisifed that no undue inconvenience should arise for pupils and parents in the areas concerned.  I might add that nothing <Col N="1506" /> the Deputy has said this afternoon convinces me of the contrary.  Given there are so many priorities, some in the Deputy's part of the city, I consider it reasonable that this proposal should not hold the order of priority the Deputy advocates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair, for affording me the opportunity of raising this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been prompted to raise this matter because of a report in one of yesterday's newspapers in relation to a Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday last at which it was reported there was a proposal advanced that the present status of Shannon Airport, Ireland's only transatlantic airport, be changed.  Can the Minister say if that proposal was presented to the Cabinet and if so why?  To have such a proposal carried at Cabinet would result in serious and lasting damage to the economy of the mid-west and the west.  The status of Shannon is a matter of national interest, not merely of regional or local interest.  There are over 8,000 jobs directly resulting from the present status of Shannon at present.  If the Minister were to suggest any change this would seriously threaten the future of those jobs.  In addition there are thousands of part-time jobs throughout the west, the south and in the midlands that would be affected if such a change were to come about.  The rather erroneous report which was presented in one of yesterday's newspapers undermines Shannon.  While such reports continue in the media the confidence of the business sector in the mid-west region will continue to be undermined. By being part of this type of campaign the Minister is acting against his own semi-State organisation, Aer Rianta, who are attempting to develop Shannon as a hub airport.  The behaviour of the Minister and those associated with him in the pro-Dublin lobby group is reprehensible in the national interest because, undoubtedly, if he were to change the present status jobs would be lost and there are no guarantees that jobs would be created elsewhere.  The <Col N="1507" /> Minister is fully aware of the cost and the difficulty involved in creating employment. He is aware that the unemployment figures have increased dramatically so we should be doing our best to protect existing jobs.</P>
    <P>A report in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> outlined the Government guarantees and provisions in relation to Shannon &mdash; to increase by 15 per cent the traffic through Shannon in the coming year and ensure that more transatlantic flights would go through Shannon.  How does the Minister propose guaranteeing such increases?  The people in the mid-west and west know full well that the only guarantee for employment in Shannon, and in the entire region, is through the retention of the present bilateral agreement with the US.  If the Minister undermines, departs from or breaks that agreement it will be a free for all and no guarantees can be given and nothing can be binding in law.  That is the reality.  Neither the Minister nor anyone else will succeed in any effort to mislead the people of the mid-west with assumptions and propositions. I am asking the Minister this evening to put an end, once and for all, to the nonsense that has gone on for the past year, by giving us an assurance that the status of Shannon will be maintained, that the advantages that can accrue from our existing bilateral agreement will be extended and improved, that fifth freedom rights will be developed at Shannon and that Shannon will be developed as a hub airport.</P>
    <P>We have a facility and an infrastructure in Shannon which is underdeveloped but there is a great opportunity for further development against that in Dublin where there is an overcrowded infrastructure and further investment would be required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> The reduction which the Government have been obliged to make in this allocation reflects the current difficult budgetary situation here as well as changed circumstances in the United States.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the reduction in the grant level may have some impact on the activities of certain immigrant welfare groups.  However, given the reduced numbers of Irish people emigrating to the US, and recent changes in US immigration legislation, particularly the introduction of the Morrison visas it may be anticipated that over time there will be an easing of the need for the services provided by these groups.</P>
    <P>In view of this, and given that the grants provided to date have allowed many of the groups to become better established and more active in fund raising on their own behalf, the Government believe that welfare concerns in relation to immigrants will continue to be met. The situation will however be kept under close review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The deadline for implementation of EC Directive 79/7 which provided for equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security was 23 December 1984.  The necessary measures, which are provided for by way of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, were subsequently brought into force in two phases in May and November 1986.</P>
      <P>As I announced in the House on 4 February last, the Government have decided to provide the equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay in implementing the Directive.  The retrospective payments involved would be made on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994.</P>
      <P>Under the first phase, all married women who received a reduced rate of benefit during the period of delay will receive the higher amount in 1992.  At the same time married women who exhausted their entitlement of 12 months to unemployment benefit during this period will be paid for the additional three months subject to appropriate evidence of unemployment in respect of any such period.  The cost of this first phase is estimated at £22 million and the necessary provision has been made by the Government in the 1992 budget.</P>
      <P>Details of the payments to be made under the second and third phases will be announced within the next few weeks as soon as the overall proposals are finalised. I intend to make the necessary legal provisions immediately thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until such time as the overall proposals are finalised, it will not be possible to <Col N="1443" /> quantify the full entitlements of any individual claimant.  At that stage my Department will make the necessary arrangements to ensure that potential beneficiaries are made aware of the provision for retrospective payments.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free electricity allowance scheme, which costs in excess of £23 million this year, is to ensure that participants, who are generally elderly or disabled persons of limited means and living alone, always have access to electrical power for basic cooking, lighting and heating purposes.  The scheme covers the cost of normal standing charges and up to 1,500 free units of electricity each year.  Under existing arrangements, it does not cover the cost of extra standing charges applicable to night storage heating and where such heating is used the free allowance covers the cost of day units only.</P>
      <P>My Department have been engaged in discussions with the ESB for some time with a view to extending the free electricity allowance scheme to cover the operation of night storage heaters.  Any decision on such an extension must await the outcome of those discussions.</P>

      <P>The detailed information sought by the Deputy is not routinely collected by my Department.  Under the terms of item 1 Circular 21/85 which governs the referral abroad scheme, the chief executive officer of the referring health board can approve cases without reference to my Department where the total costs involved are less than £10,000.  Applications made to my Department are always treated in an expeditious manner and decisions are conveyed immediately to the health board concerned.  I am unaware of any difficulties associated with the operation of this scheme.</P>
      <P>Arrangements which are made outside the terms of the EC regulations, such as the referral of a patient to a non-EC country or where arrangements are made for private treatment of a patient in any country abroad, must be regarded as being outside the terms of the circular. Health boards have no obligation to meet any part of the cost involved but they may, in exceptional circumstances, consider contributing towards the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind I would be glad to have details in <Col N="1449" /> order that it can be discussed with the health board concerned.</P>

Each health board are responsible for determining the funding needs of the individual hospitals under their management and for the establishment of priorities within the approved allocation for the board's area.</P>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that my Department have recently advised the South-Eastern Health Board that there was no objection to the acceptance of the recommended tender for the development project at St. Luke's.

      <P>Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are not limited in the category of persons they can assist at home and may charge for the service. The health boards consider individual cases on the basis of need and in the light of resources available to the scheme. <Col N="1451" /> About half of the home helps are provided by voluntary organisations with funding from health boards, while the remainder are employed directly by the boards.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that no individual in need of a home help service would be refused a home help on the basis of his/her means.  However, while a medical card holder would be exempt from charges for the service, people of certain means would be expected to contribute a small amount.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, I would be glad to take the details and have the matter examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>Asthma is not a notifiable disease and most cases are treated by general practitioners rather than in hospital.  Detailed information on the number of people suffering from the condition is not therefore available.  In addition, it is difficult to determine a precise medical definition of asthma; the term can cover a range of respiratory diseases including bronchitis.</P>
      <P>The Health Research Board is currently funding a study of asthma as part of an EC concerted action programme. The Irish element of the study is examining the prevalance of and risk factors associated with asthma in both rural and urban Ireland.  The board allocatd £9,000 to the study in 1991 and £15,000 in 1992. The question of funding in 1993 will be considered by the board later this year.</P>

    <P>In addition to the reliefs outlined for &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; and external leaving certificate candidates, my Department also implements a scheme to provide alleviation of fees in the case of any pupil attending school who is experiencing particular hardship.  The amount of the reduction in the case of any individual pupil concerned under this scheme is determined at the discretion of the school authorities subject to the total amount of such deductions not exceeding the specified amount notified to each school.  I should add that a candidate attending school with a view to repeating the leaving certificate and who was already due to pay a reduced fee arising from possession of a medical card, could have the fee further reduced under this scheme at the discretion of the school authority.</P>
