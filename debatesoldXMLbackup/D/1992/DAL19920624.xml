      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies Deasy, McCormack and Creed.  I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  Therefore, I call, first, on Deputy Deasy to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek permission to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the imminent loss of £30 million to Irish farmers because of the proposed reduction in the ewe premium.  The House should be advised by the Minister for Agriculture and Food as a matter of urgency of the steps he intends to take to ensure that the proposed cut in sheep farm incomes does not materialise in view of the extreme hardship which would otherwise be caused for many farm families.  I should say that all of us regret the incident which occurred yesterday in Agriculture House but it should not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 14, 15 and 16.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight; No. 14 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings of Committee Stage of No. 15, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Education and that the proceedings on Report and Final Stages of No. 16, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and <Col N="951" /> which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed, notwithstanding anything in the order of the Dáil of 11 June, that the two divisions demanded on Vote 32 and on Votes 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11 to 18, inclusive and 44 which were deferred on Friday, 12 June shall be decided by one division which shall be taken not later than 6.45 p.m.  Private Members' Business which shall be No. 23 shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 15, the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991, is a very complicated Bill.  There is a total of 128 amendments to be taken, of which only 25 have been discussed so far.  The Government now propose that we deal with 100 amendments, plus the substantive sections themselves, all before lunchtime.  That is no way for this House to conduct its business.  We object strongly to this.  The solution appears to be to use Special Committees to deal with legislation which is not acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the taking of Item No. 15 may I seek an assurance from the Taoiseach that, subject to this Bill being completed by this House within the next few days, the Minister for Education <Col N="952" /> will not seek to circulate his remarks on this Bill to Fianna Fáil members of vocational education committees as he has done in the case of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  Will the Taoiseach say whether he is aware of what the Minister for Education has done &mdash; tried to compromise the chief executive officers of the vocational education committees in relation to the Regional Technical Colleges Bill &mdash; and get his assurance that this will not happen in the case of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the ordering of this business, we should get an assurance that the Minister for Education will not seek to send documentation to Fianna Fáil councillors through the chief executive officers of vocational education committees, which compromises their positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is similar to that made by Deputy John Bruton in regard to the time being allowed to deal with amendments tabled to this Bill.  It is quite extraordinary that this Bill is being dealt with in this way, given the considerable number of amendments the Minister himself has already introduced. It appears to me that more time should be devoted to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I must now ask if the proposal to deal with item No. 16 is agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  This is the Criminal Evidence Bill which concerns giving adequate powers to the courts to deal with the problem of child sexual abuse, a major problem in this country, and it is obviously very important that any legislation to deal with it be properly considered.  I understand there are 54 amendments to be dealt with, apart from the legislation itself.  It is the view of this party that legislation of this sensitivity and importance should in no circumstances whatever be subject to a time limit.  My party believe it may well be possible without a time limit to complete the legislation within the time provided, but we object in principle to a time limit on legislation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably one of the most significant developments of our law in recent times and many of the amendments which are yet to be discussed have not been discussed on Committee Stage and probably will not be reached in the time available tonight to complete this Bill.  We must register strong opposition to dealing with important legislation in this peremptory way.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to allow whatever time is needed to complete discussion of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments regarding this Bill made by Deputy Bruton and Deputy De Rossa.  This highlights once again the urgent need this House has to refer Bills of that nature to a Special Committee as is to be done later this morning on the Solicitors Bill.  If ever a Bill was appropriate to a Special Committee it is the Criminal Evidence Bill.  Perhaps even at this late stage the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip might consider <Col N="956" /> the advisability of referring the remainder of this Bill to a Special Committee so that all the important amendments which are there can be teased out properly in a committee room, which is the proper place for it rather than on the floor of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that it is a very important Bill and that it is desirable to get it through both Houses before the summer recess.  In all 13 hours and 15 minutes were allocated to the Committee Stage debate and five hours have been allocated for Report and Final Stages today.  Additional time was asked for and given.  As we move towards the summer recess we may have this type of objection every morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to have a debate.  As Deputy Bruton said, 54 amendments have been tabled for Report Stage of this Bill.  We cannot have a conveyor belt system of legislation.  This is important legislation.  We have indicated to the Taoiseach that it may be possible to complete the debate by 10.30 p.m.  I ask the Taoiseach not to divide the House on this matter but to allow the Bill to be taken in the time allocated and if we need additional time, perhaps one or two hours, it be allocated between now and the time this House rises.  This is serious and important legislation.  I hope the Minister for Justice agrees with me that this is legislation to which the Opposition parties had a substantial and constructive <Col N="957" /> input.  Indeed, some of the amendments we will consider today derive from amendments tabled by the Fine Gael Party and some amendments tabled by Deputy McCartan on behalf of Democratic Left.  I ask the Taoiseach to remove the guillotine.  Obviously, we will do our best to complete the Bill in the time allocated. The Fine Gael Party will agree to additional time on some other day if that is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter pertaining to the Order of Business, Sir.  It is pointless in us conducting our business in this House if the public to whom we are ultimately accountable cannot deliberate and read our proceedings.  We referred the Finance Bill to a Special Committee, a move that was acclaimed by all sides and initiated by the Minister for Finance. I have been reliably informed that the proceedings of the Special Committee &mdash; approximately 20 hours of debate &mdash; which are of immense importance to the financial community will not be read until September.

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to extend the time allocated for the Report and Final Stages of the Criminal Evidence Bill.  I think he will agree there is an atmosphere of haste on the part of the Government in regard to the enactment of legislation.  I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not yet brought into effect sections of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986, the Companies Act, 1991.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that where legislation is passed through this House in haste the relevant Ministers will bring it into effect with equal haste so that we will not have examples similar to the one I cited in respect of just one Minister where legislation passed in haste has not been brought into effect six or seven years later?</P>

      <P>Almost a year ago the Government circulated the Family Planning (Amendment) Bill and since then, though it is hard to recall, I think there have been three changes of Minister. We have repeatedly asked the Taoiseach when it is proposed to progress this Bill through the House or if it will be withdrawn and a new Bill brought forward. Can the Taoiseach indicate at this late stage, and before the anniversary of the original Bill, when it is intended to have this Bill progressed through the House?  May I also ask him if he has had an opportunity to discuss with the new United States Ambassador to Ireland the results of the referendum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I recall, we were finalising section 5 which deals with the awarding of degrees.  I dealt last evening with the main queries from Opposition in that regard.  I responded to Deputy Higgins as to the reason subsection (4) is being removed and explained in so far as I could why I decided to retain the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f).</P>
      <P>Deputy Therese Ahearn mentioned last night that a number of amendments have been accepted by me.  This is now a better section as a result of our discussion last evening.  I have accepted a number of suggestions from Deputies.  I appreciate that Deputies have accepted my explanations in a number of areas and particularly my target of granting degree-awarding powers to the Dublin Institute of Technology within a 12-month period. The debate we had last evening has resulted in section 5 being a better section than it was when I brought it before the House and I thank Deputies for that.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (2) (a), line 30, to delete &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically the rationale behind this amendment is in line with the whole principle of equality and the need for equality, not alone in the spirit of the Bill but also in the letter of the Bill.  I understand there are some legal difficulties with the alteration of the word &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo; to &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo;.  If we are serious about equality throughout the whole education system we should dispense with terminology which is in any sense sexist. There is other terminology in the Bill which is archaic and Dickensian, for example, the phrase &ldquo;officer and servant&rdquo;. I would ask the Minister to agree to change the word &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo; to &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo;.  The arguments in favour <Col N="966" /> of doing so do not need to be elucidated. It is a clear-cut case of demonstrating clearly that equity in terms of the gender of people involved in the whole area of education, particularly in the area of the Dublin Institute of Technology, should be beyond reproach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am an avid supporter of equality I do not support this amendment.  It is almost condescending to believe that a woman who may be elected as chairman of a committee cannot realistically accept that terminology. After all, we are all part of mankind and I see no reason a woman cannot be addressed as &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo;.  The fact that this amendment has been put down and that this is an area that is often under discussion, proves that it is only in recent times that women succeeded in getting to positions of chairmen of committees. It is for that reason that it is only at this stage that this type of debate emerges.  Despite their potential and qualifications, unfortunately because of tradition and lack of opportunity of equality, it was only on rare occasions that women succeeded in being elected to positions such as chairman.  As a woman, I would have no problem with being addressed as chairman.  I would consider it a privilege to be elected to that position. I believe I would be entitled to be addressed as &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo; just as chairmen before me were so addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally agree with gender equity.  To change the terminology in order to cover a position on which a woman may be successful is almost condescending, although I know the Deputy did not mean that in his amendment.  The word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; is acceptable to both sexes, just as in the Irish language the word &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; is acceptable.  The word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; does not show any lack of recognition of gender even if the position is held by a woman.  The need to change such terminology has only recently emerged and proves the lack of progress of women in those positions.  If we had a tradition of having women in those positions, we would not be discussing this terminology now.  I am happy with the <Col N="967" /> term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; whether a position is held by a man or woman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Ahearn's attitude.  I thought she would have welcomed the change.  However, she is entitled to her view and if she feels comfortable with the title &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, that is her right.  Many women feel very uncomfortable with the title &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. I wholeheartedly support Deputy O'Shea's amendment.  It is very important to encourage people to think in terms of the possibility of a woman being appointed as chairperson in any organisation. To use the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; implies that it will almost certainly be a man who will hold the position.  When a chairperson is selected the person becomes either a chairman or a chairwoman. It is absolute nonsense for a woman to be called a chairman.  A woman could be called a chairperson but it would be better if she were called a chairwoman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting and important debate.  This issue is debated in clubs and at meetings throughout the country.  Many people do not like the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; and I agree that many women do not like to be called &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Shea referred to a legal difficulty and I would be interested to hear what it is.  In this House we refer to the &ldquo;Chair&rdquo;.  There is no reason we should have &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo;, or &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  The title of the office should be &ldquo;the Chair&rdquo;. We have here &ldquo;chairman and 17 ordinary members&rdquo;.  A chairmember is closer to what the job entails than &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;. It is important to make a decision on this.  The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; seems to come into everything and wherever &ldquo;man&rdquo; comes into a word we want to change it to &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  This is nonsense in some cases.  What the office should be is an important point.  The word &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; in the Irish language is very useful but there is no similar word in the English language.  Certainly, &ldquo;chairmember&rdquo; would be much closer to what the office entails than &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> Changing from &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; to &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo; according to who is elected does not give a particular name for the office.  I suggest either &ldquo;the chair&rdquo; or &ldquo;chairmember&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Garland that, while Deputy Ahearn may have no objection to the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, there are women who would object to it.  I would like to hear the Minister's ideas on this, about the legal problems involved and so on.  In this House we have used &ldquo;Chair&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; on all occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion is a little bit like the discussion on the mode of dress that is appropriate to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A lot of this should be left to the discretion of the individual rather than having inflexible, stultifying rules which state that in the Houses of the Oireachtas dress must be of a particular form and, in the case of the use of language with regard to what title is used to describe the chair of a body, it must be of a particular form.  Much of this should be left to the discretion of the occupier of the position.  I do not get worked up over this issue.  In many respects, Deputy Ahearn is right, in that there is a great degree of tokenism in the whole debate about &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  It is interesting that where the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; is used almost exclusively a woman is the holder of the office.  I have rarely seen the term used when a man is in the chair.  Even where people genuinely use the term, when a man is occupying the chair he will be addressed as &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and when a woman is occupying the chair she will be addressed as &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  That is bringing tokenism to its ultimate.  It does not matter what one calls the position.  The important thing is that there is gender equity in the occupancy of these positions.  That is probably the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first tabled amendments for a Bill in this House I used &ldquo;he/she&rdquo; in relation to a number of amendments and when they were printed the word &ldquo;she&rdquo; had disappeared.  I was told that this was because of the 1937 Interpretation Act and that &ldquo;she&rdquo; does not exist, that &ldquo;she&rdquo;<Col N="969" /> is presumed to be &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  It is almost like a form of language that was invented before the spare rib.  The word &ldquo;he&rdquo; is presumed to include &ldquo;she&rdquo;.  The Interpretation Act needs to be looked at so as not to have this rigid and insulting form of language but to allow a more flexible use of language such as &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo; or &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  The occupiers of the position should be able to state their preference for a particular word.</P>

      <P>(b)  <i>Masculine and feminine.</i> Every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the feminine gender;</P>
      <P>My layman's view on reading that is that it does not prevent us from inserting the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, but that is the way it has been interpreted up to now.  I think we could take another interpretation, in that if we decided to put in the contrary, the opposite will apply.  That is my interpretation of it as a layman, even though I am not sure I have that freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to stick to that in this legislation, if for no other reason than it is the way it has been done throughout all legislation since the 1937 Interpretation Act.  It is something we should tackle, however, as it is important to get the <Col N="970" /> phrase right.  There is substantial disagreement on what phrase to use and how we should address the Chair when the office holder is a woman, whether we should use the phrase &ldquo;Lady Chairman&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lady Chairperson&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chairwoman&rdquo;, or just simply &ldquo;Chair&rdquo;, as has been suggested.  Incidentally, may I point out that in the Second Schedule to the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991, section 2 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Governing Body shall have a Chairman who may be designated by such title as the Governing Body, with the concurrence of the Minister, may determine.</P>
    <P>That allows the Dublin Institute of Technology to call the person occupying the Chair by any title which they wish and they do not have to use the word &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo;. Obviously they will consult with the person occupying the Chair and then decide on the appropriate title to address the Chair.</P>
    <P>This is not the legislation in which to make a major departure on this point.  I think it would be better to tackle the Interpretation Act itself.  As I have said already, we have allowed the person occupying the Chair of the Dublin Institute of Technology to be addressed by whatever title the governing body decide.  On a more general note may I point out that in the Green Paper being published tomorrow and in amendments Nos. 45 and 50 of this Bill I have specifically written in a responsibility to approach gender balance on the governing body?  I have specifically introduced the concept of gender balance in this Bill.  I did so to be consistent with the philosophy of the forthcoming Green Paper.  This should help to redress the balance somewhat.</P>
    <P>I am very sympathetic to Deputy O'Shea's amendment.  While I would like to do as he suggests, on balance I do not think this is the legislation to tackle this matter.  We need to take a broader approach to it.  However, this does not stop the Dublin Institute of Technology from dealing with the matter as they can <Col N="971" /> address the Chair by whatever title they decide.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister said in response to the debate on this amendment, I will not press it at this time.  Gender equity is a two-way street as it concerns both men and women.  The term &ldquo;person&rdquo; relates just as much to men as to women and therefore when we are drafting legislation it is not tokenism to make the change I suggest.  For instance, Members who are on the frontbench are now referred to as &ldquo;spokespersons&rdquo;, as is only right and proper.  While individual women may have a problem with the use of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;, the majority favour it and it was on that basis that I tabled this amendment. The Minister makes it possible for the Dublin Institute of Technology to describe the person holding the office of Chairman if they so desire, but I ask him to make efforts to ensure that the Dublin Institute of Technology are influenced to use a term that reflects gender equity and in my view &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo; is preferable. I ask the Minister to show his goodwill to my amendment by conveying these sentiments to the Dublin Institute of Technology at an early stage.</P>

This is a matter however for the governing body.  While the members of the governing body will be nominated by other bodies, and mainly the vocational education committees, the Minister has to approve formally the full list of nominees.  I will have no hesitation in returning the list if there are not substantial attempts to ensure a sound gender balance.</P>

      <P>We should try to get through this section as quickly as possible as we have a great deal to do before 1.30 p.m.  In this amendment I propose that the number of ordinary members be increased from 17 to 18 to allow for an extra student to be nominated to the governing body, as I propose in a later amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the governing body is vitally important from the point of view of the success of and the genuine democratic input into the college.  The collective will is to ensure that the governing body is as representative as possible and yet not unwieldy.  Representation is very important.  I accept the Minister proposes to increase the number from 17 to 18 to allow for an increase in the representation of the vocational education committee.  I believe it is vitally important that we increase the number on the body and any number fewer than 20 would be acceptable.  I also made this point in relation to the Regional Technical <Col N="973" /> Colleges Bill.  Indeed the former Minister, Deputy Davern, proposed that the number be increased to 22, which was acceptable.  The membership should be as representative as possible and we should have the greatest number possible on the governing body.  Indeed I am trying to achieve the same in my amendment when I seek to increase the number to 19, as we would like to see an additional student and a member of FÁS on the governing body.  We will advance our case in due course when we reach our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two points on these amendments which deal with the membership of the governing body. The first relates to the nomination of six members by the vocational education committees.  Will the Minister clarify whether the grouping arrangements which were made in respect of local authority and vocational education committee nominations will apply in this case?  When the vocational education committee come to nominate their members to the governing body, a majority of the membership of the vocational education committee will belong either to one political persuasion or to a group of political persuasions who have come together for the purpose of constituting a majority.  Will they be nominating all six members of the governing body?  Will interests who find themselves in a minority on a vocational education committee come together as a group and claim the right to nominate some of those six members?  That would be important in the interests of balance on the governing body.  The issue has not been addressed to date in relation to this Bill or the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point relates to the election of student members to the governing body.  This matter was touched on briefly in the debate on the other Bill.  It would make sense if the student members of the governing body were specific officers of the student union of the institute or of the group of student unions making up the student body.  Perhaps that could be prescribed in some way.  Normally there <Col N="974" /> are annual elections for union officers and a second set of elections would constitute duplication.  That point needs to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put two brief questions in relation to this section.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has left in the nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This matter was voted on in the context of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill last week when an amendment was introduced to delete that nomination.  Why is it appropriate to have a nominee of the ICTU on the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology and not appropriate to have a similar nominee on the governing body of the regional technical colleges?  I strongly argue that there should be such a nominee.</P>
      <P>Section 4(a) states that two members of the academic staff of the institute shall be nominated by the staff.  Will the Minister clarify exactly how this nomination is to take place?  Will these representatives be nominated following an election involving the whole academic staff, or is there to be some group system? Six persons are to be nominated by the vocational education committee.  Does that mean that the vocational education committee can nominate people who are not members of the vocational education committee?  Is there any distinction between the public representatives and the other members of the vocational education committee?  Is a quota to be allotted to elected members of the vocational education committee as against those appointed by other means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with the composition of the governing body. My amendment No. 27 proposes to increase the number of ordinary members from 17 to 18 in order to take on an additional student.  The Bill originally provided for one registered student of the institute and it is proposed to increase that to two, making the total number of ordinary members 18.  The chairman and the president will bring the total membership of the governing body to 20.  We <Col N="975" /> arrived at this figure in trying to get a balance.  My belief is that 20 is too many and I would have been happier to have fewer.  However, I can live with 20.  I would be very much opposed to going beyond that figure because it would not be manageable.  In terms of accountability and responsibility a tighter number is better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins mentioned the persons nominated by the organisations decided by the vocational education committee. I concur with the remarks he made. Speaking on the Regional Technical Colleges Bill on 4 June he suggested that the vocational education committees should bear in mind the needs of vocational education and talented graduates and take a broad view of their own nominees.  I join with him in that suggestion to the vocational education committees.  Once they have nominated their own representatives they will seek additional ones from representative organisations and they should ensure that the spirit of the legislation is carried through.  Such organisations shall be representative of industry, agriculture, commerce, the professions and other interests appropriate to the activities of the institute.  It is particularly important that those sections are represented and I know the vocational education committees will take a responsible view.  The vocational education committee will nominate six persons directly and will have a strong say in an additional five in that they will select the organisations who will nominate the persons to be appointed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore asked about student elections.  It is perhaps safer to leave it the way it is.  Representatives will be nominated by registered students in accordance with regulations made by the governing body.  I am almost certain that this means elections from the student body.  If the Deputy feels it needs to be more tightly specified, I will look at it before Report Stage.  I presume sensible regulations will be made for the election of students to the governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will examine before Report Stage the question of grouping at vocational <Col N="976" /> education committee level.  I had not proposed to tell them that the six persons nominated should be members of the vocational education committee, public representatives or not, or to specify that they should come from groupings.  My instinct is to stick with what we have and not to dictate to the vocational education committee how they might appoint their six representatives.  I am sure they will make their own decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea raised the matter of a representative of the ICTU.  We took the view that it was unwise to remove that provision and I intend to restore the ICTU representative on Report Stage of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  I will be proposing to the House that it be put back into the legislation.  There is nothing underhand about its proposed removal.  It was an attempt by myself &mdash; I take responsibility for it &mdash; to try to tidy up the board and to keep it as tight as possible.  I felt that staff members of the vocational education committee and others nominated from industry, agriculture and so on, would already be members of unions and that that was, perhaps, unnecessary.  I accept the argument that the ICTU are anxious that it be included and, in that case, I am happy to accommodate them.  It is being put back into the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and will be retained in this Bill also.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea asked about staff.  It is stated in the Bill that staff will be nominated.  I am not proposing in amendments Nos. 35 and 36 to change the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; to &ldquo;elected&rdquo; so that the staff nominees would now be elected to the governing body.  That is the mechanism the Deputy asked me to describe.</P>

      <P>one person, being a registered student of the Institute, shall be nominated by the registered students in accordance with regulations made by the Governing Body;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In amendment No. 39 the Minister seeks <Col N="977" /> to delete the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;elected&rdquo;.  May I take it he is changing &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; to &ldquo;elected&rdquo; in the other paragraphs?</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) (b) states:</P>
      <P>two persons, being members of the academic staff...</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 34, in the name of Deputy J. Higgins, seeks to insert the words &ldquo;one of whom shall be a woman,&rdquo;. The principle is already accepted in general school boards and soon, where there are parent representatives that one must be a mother.  The Minister's amendment No. 45 states:</P>
      <P>...the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented...</P>
      <P>This is an opportunity, if he accepts this amendment, to ensure that the two academics on the board would be male and female but, on the other hand, they could be two women.  At least one should be a woman and the Minister should not have any difficulty in accepting that.</P>
      <P>In regard to subsection (4) (d), even with the change of the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; to &ldquo;elected&rdquo;&mdash; I welcome the fact that there will be two students rather than one &mdash; much power is being given in this section to the regulations that will be made by the governing body.  I would like the Minister's assurance that the governing body would ensure that all registered students would be eligible to stand for election.  Difficulties can and may arise between those on the two year certificate courses and those on the three year diploma and degree courses.  I would like to be sure that any registered student would be covered under this section and that there would be no element of elitism or change in status of one type of student from the other.  Nowadays any qualification from these colleges is excellent.</P>

      <Col N="978" /> Many years ago, when my mother was appointed to the first NCEA board, no courses, other than those in universities, were given any status or recognition.

      <P>I welcome the general thrust of the amendments.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is moving in the direction of increasing the membership of the governing body from 17 to 18.  I welcome also the general tenor of his remarks that a number in excess of 20 would be unacceptable.  I hope he might accept 19 ordinary members when he listens to the reasons advanced on the composition. I welcome the Minister's amendment No. 31, which is related and seeks to increase from four to five the number of persons nominated by the Minister.  In regard to amendment No. 34 it is important, as Deputy Owen said, that we go beyond the bland prescription of talking about gender equity and be specific.  On the basis of discrimination in the past and indeed at present in relation to the representation of women, we should specify &ldquo;one of whom shall be a woman,&rdquo;.  When we discussed the Regional Technical Colleges Bill I named the nine regional technical colleges and pointed out that there is not one female principal or vice-principal in any of those colleges.  The same applies in relation to the six Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and that is something that leaves much to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we state here in specific terms, &ldquo;one of whom shall be a woman&rdquo;.  I accept the point that that may lead to an imbalance, as Deputy Owen said in that we are leaving open the possibility <Col N="979" /> that both may be women.  That is something we can examine in the light of the numbers.  Can the Minister give us a breakdown, if that is possible, of the balance within the academic staff of the colleges, of the number of female and male members in the six Dublin Institute of Technology colleges?  My understanding is that in the region of 20 per cent of the academic staff in the colleges are female which would add substance to the argument that we need to enshrine in hard terms the female representation.</P>
    <P>I should point out that not one Secretary of a Government Department is female.  Across the whole spectrum of the public service there is a gross under representation of women, particularly in senior management positions.  When discussing the sister Bill, the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, we mentioned that in relation to principals and vice-principals at second level, and particularly at primary level, the imbalance discriminates heavily against females.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that amendments Nos. 35 and 36 are being co-sponsored by the Minister; in other words that he is accepting the principle of &ldquo;elected&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;nominated&rdquo;.  In regard to amendment No. 37 I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted the spirit of what we are trying to achieve, to have two student representatives rather than one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, thank you Deputy.  It is the same principle in the later amendment.  I cannot agree to that amendment on this occasion even though I would like to.  Six persons are nominated by the vocational education committee, two by the staff, the student representatives, the University of Dublin and so on and those nominated by the vocational education committee from organisations.  If we are to be consistent we would have to include that in all the sections.  We could not merely say that half of the representation of the staff should be women and then proceed to ignore all of the other components such as the vocational education committee. It would be inconsistent if the same requirement were not laid on the vocational education committee.  I consider that I have dealt with the matter in my own amendment No. 45, which reads:</P>
      <P>In making appointments to the Governing Body pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented and shall ensure an appropriate gender balance as determined by the Minister from time to time.</P>
      <P>My amendment, if agreed, would place a statutory duty on the Minister to ensure an approprite gender balance, which is a better method.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is quite simple.  I, and any future Minister, I presume, would simply return the list.  The entire list has to be approved by the Minister. In many instances that is merely a formality because most representatives are nominated or elected and the Minister has little discretion but to approve them.  There will be an exception in this case and if the Minister is not satisfied that there is an appropriate gender balance he or she will be able to return the entire list and refuse to make the appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> In the introduction to the Green Paper and in the full paper which will be available tomorrow I have laid great stress on gender equity.  I have made gender equity a major aim in the Irish education world.  Tomorrow Deputies will note that, in the document I have proposed, all boards of selection comprise a very sound gender balance and stipulates that provisions be put in place to ensure that all governing bodies and boards of management of schools throughout the country have such a balance.  A debate should take place in the next few months as to the way in which we might achieve that.  In the Green Paper I have put forward some ideas as to the way in which it might be done.  I should like the process to be completed so that gender equity may be developed across the country at every level of education.</P>
    <P>I am happy that this Bill places a statutory duty on the Minister to ensure an appropriate gender balance.  I feel that it is a better proposal in that my own amendment does not apply only to staff but also to the entire governing body of the college.  It would be wrong if we picked out the staff component and said that half of that component should be men and half should be women but then proceeded to ignore the six appointments of the vocational education committee and did not make any stipulations in relation to the organisations that nominate representatives.  I support the good intentions and the thinking behind the proposal.  It would be misinterpreted as some form of tokenism if we were to select one constituency of two and decide that half should be women but then proceeded to ignore the other 18 constituencies making up the total number of 20.  I consider amendment No. 45 preferable as it places a statutory duty on the Minister to ensure gender balance.  It would be the Minister's duty to return the list if it did not meet that requirement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen asked about the election of students.  I agree with her comments, and certainly it would be my wish that all students be eligible to vote.  The Deputy wanted me to make sure that the regulations <Col N="982" /> were clear in that regard.  I shall make it clear to the governing body that our wish is that all students would vote. I had to think a little about the question of part-time students and discuss that aspect with the governing body.  I see no reason why all students should not vote, but it would depend upon the extent to which they were involved with the college.</P>

      <P>And apprentices, yes. I think we have to leave the matter to the good sense of the governing body.  I shall express the wish that in general all students should vote but if there are categories of students that are very much casual, then I would understand if the governing body and the student body decided that they should not vote.  That is an issue that could be developed, rather than laid out on day one.  The governing body will have to be left some flexibility in relation to the extent of the franchise. I shall express the strong view of the House that in general all students should be permitted to vote.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins asked for some figures.  I do not have them available now but I shall find out whether figures can be compiled and given to the Deputy as soon as possible.  My own impression is very similar to that of the Deputy.  Not only in the third level sector but throughout education there is a much larger percentage of women than men but the management level of education is dominated by men.  In the Green Paper I have very clearly sought to redress that imbalance. When Deputies read the document they will note dramatic proposals in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mr. Owen Mr. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I must come back to the Minister's amendment No. 45.  I recognise that the Minister has their best interests at heart.  However, the method proposed is not practical.  What will happen if there are only three women members on the board when the Minister gets the list of 18 &mdash; or 19 if the figure is increased &mdash; and then decides that there <Col N="983" /> is not an appropriate gender balance? If the whole list is sent back constituencies would have to hold elections again in order to create the appropriate gender balance?  The system would be very unwieldy.  For example, would the Minister say that he was happy that three of the six vocational education committee members were women but was not happy with the balance on the academic constituency and so on?  There is no need for the stipulation suggested by the Minister. There will be six representatives of the vocational education committee, for example, and when six people are elected there is a very good chance that the system of natural selection will result in the nomination of some women.  The same is true of the five persons nominated under section 6 (4) (g).  Of the five nominated there is a very good chance that at least one would be a woman because the teachers in such sections of the college as hotel management and domestic science are predominantly women.  An appropriate balance would be achieved through natural selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good and all as the Minister's intentions are, I do not consider that the system proposed under amendment No. 45 would work; it would be desperately unwieldy.  When the list came in the Minister would have to ask himself whether three women was sufficient, whether four women was sufficient, whether the number should be five and so on.  Where would the Minister make a cut-off point? The system would have to be built in, even on a trial basis, to determine its effectiveness.  The Minister may not recognise the difficulties that his system would present.  I am a Chair of a vocational education committee community college myself, and the only other woman on that committee is the parents' representative.  There is a provision laid down that of the two parents' representatives one must be a woman. The principle is already in existence and is working on school boards.  I wonder why the Minister is not prepared to follow that principle in this Bill.  I hope that he will reconsider amendment No. 45 <Col N="984" /> and agree with me that the system would not work.  I saw the Minister smiling when I made my point earlier.  In practice, I really do not know how the system would work.  I should like to know at what point the Minister would decide to throw the whole list back to the governing body.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the election of student members of the governing body.  As I understand it, the student members of the governing body will serve for a term of one year.  Already under the arrangements for the election of officers of student unions an annual election is held in which each registered student is entitled to vote.  I am anxious that the student body do not spend half a year holding elections.  If there were one set of elections for officers of the student union and then another set of elections for membership of the governing body, the students would have more elections in a year than we have referenda.  The whole purpose of serving on the governing body could be defeated. The two elections could be dovetailed in the universities, for example.  Under the existing arrangements for representation on college councils and so on, normally the president of the students' union &mdash; and if there is a second person, usually the vice-president of the students' union &mdash; is an <i>ex officio</i> representative for that year on the governing body, the college council or whatever.  I should like that system to be followed.  I give notice of my intention to table an amendment on that matter on Report Stage.  I consider it important that that be defined.</P>
      <P>I am not happy that this would in some way be at the discretion of the governing body because if a conflict or controversy arose one would not want a situation where a governing body could devise an arrangement which would circumvent the normal representative structures which students have for representing themselves and find some other method of having students appointed to the governing body.  I am simply drawing the attention of the Minister to this.  I hope he will rectify it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>There is a practical problem in relation to section 5 (4) (b) and (d) concerning the regulations which would be set down by the governing body for the nomination &mdash; or the election as it will now be &mdash; by the staff of two persons to the governing body and the election of students to that body.  How can the governing body draw up regulations when the body do not exist?  In other words, the governing body will not be a full governing body unless the staff and student nominees are part of it. What concerns me is that the regulations in relation to staff and student representatives would logically have to be drawn up by the governing body in the absence of any nominees from the staff and student body.</P>
      <P>I also want to ask a question concerning the regulations made by the governing body for the election &mdash; as it will now be when subsection 4 (b) is amended &mdash; because the governing body could limit the electorate as they see fit.  Bearing in mind that these regulations would be put in place before any staff members would be members of the governing body one could suggest that a strong director could influence the board to come up with a set of regulations which would not necessarily serve the spirit of the representation of staff members which is inserted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I will be brief, I do not want to repeat myself as I do not have that much to add.  Deputy Owen asked me to reconsider the amendment. However, I am fully convinced that it would not make much sense to just pick two from the 20 to ensure a gender balance in that small constituency and not apply it to the other 18.  I would prefer had the Deputy sought to make it across the board in relation to the 20 and not just in the small area of staff because, if we take that route, the same responsibility should apply to the vocational education committees and students.  It would not be wise to select the staff for a gender battle and let the rest follow.  It is an argument but I am <Col N="986" /> opposed to just doing it in one area of the governing body.  The Deputy also asked if the names on the list were all those of men what the Minister would do.  There is a statutory duty to ensure gender balance and if that is not the case the list would be sent back to the vocational education committees, students and staff and they would be asked for the reasons for not electing women to the governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That might not be necessary.  For example, the vocational education committee might oblige immediately and say it was not their intention not to have women members on the body.  The nominating bodies may appoint five members and they might also oblige immediately.  In that way it might be possible to get a strong gender balance but, if not, they would be ordered to hold another election.  I would not have any hesitation in that regard.  The Deputy should remember that it is not just at the whim of the Minister, there will be a statutory duty in the Bill to see that it happens.  Perhaps I should not say this but I am not very keen on quotas, I prefer the gender balance approach because in some boards it is appropriate to have more women than men, depending on the activity, and on other boards it is more appropriate to have more men than women.  It should reflect the number involved in the area of activity concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore suggested he might introduce an amendment on Report Stage and, if he does, I will certainly consider it.  We have removed the phrase &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;elected&rdquo;. The reason the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; was inserted was to address the kind of thing about which the Deputy is worried, to prevent a whole spate of elections.  As we have opted for the election route students will probably have to face them. However, the Deputy is right, we should try to dovetail the elections so that the election to the governing body does not <Col N="987" /> take place one month and an election for the president of the students' union the following month.  I do not want to tell the governing body how to run their affairs.  If it is the wish of the Dublin Institute of Technology to have two elections &mdash; just as the country has decided to hold a number of referenda from time to time &mdash; I do not see any difficulty. There is no reason for the regulations of the governing body not to stipulate that whoever is elected &mdash; the president or secretary of the students' union &mdash; should be the persons on the governing body.  I am sure that the students' unions elections could be the governing body elections if they choose to do that.  However, I would stop short of telling them that is the way it should be done because we want to give the governing body as much say as possible.  I suggest to the governing body that they should seek to co-ordinate the students' union elections with the governing body elections.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea raised a very intriguing point in relation to the students not being on the governing body before the regulations are made.  Section (6) (3) provides for a governing body to hold office for a period of one year, a sort of start-up governing body.  They would obviously make the regulations in the first instance but they could subsequently be changed when the formal governing body came into operation.  Under this subsection I will be able to nominate five members, three members of staff and two students, which would probably allay the Deputy's concern.  I appreciate the point the Deputy is making but, as I said, I will be appointing five members which means that there will be a mix on the governing body at that stage.  I hope that will ensure the regulations will reflect the views of staff and students.  The safety net will apply when the full governing body are in operation and if staff and student representatives are not satisfied with the regulations they can seek to have them changed at that time.  I am satisfied that the governing body will comprise staff and students and, therefore, they will have an input to the regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> Deputy O'Shea was also concerned that the governing body might try to limit the electorate.  I do not think that will be the case and, if it was, there would be a substantial backlash when the full governing body took office.  At any rate there will not be a start-up governing body without staff or students which means they will have a direct say in that area.</P>

      <P>This amendment and consequential amendments Nos. 117, 118, 119, 120 and 121 deal with the office of chairman. When dealing with the corresponding section of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill it was said that the chairman of any body had the potential to give essential status to that body and that what was required was the widest range of persons to be considered for appointment to the post of chairman.  For these reasons and also to bring the position more into line with that in other comparable institutions it has been decided that the chairman of the governing body of the institute should be a ministerial appointee.  The recommendations of the vocational education committees in this matter will of course receive the fullest consideration in this regard.  Amendment No. 30 also deletes the word &ldquo;director&rdquo; and substitutes &ldquo;president&rdquo;.  This matter was discussed when we dealt with amendment No. 2.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is aware, it was a major bone of contention on the morning Committee Stage of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill was due to be taken that a considerable raft of amendments was submitted.  A number of these dealt with the role of the vocational education committees.  Yesterday the Minister threw down the challenge very forcefully to the vocational education committees and others who raised the question of decentralisation and subsidiarity; he drew attention to the need to give as much autonomy as possible to the vocational education committees and asked where the vocational education committees stood.  The Minister asked if we wanted to hand over control to the vocational education committees or to the colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational education committees seem to have a legitimate grievance in relation to the manner in which they have <Col N="990" /> been culled from large sections of the previous Bill and this Bill, and particularly in regard to the decision to delete the right of the governing body to nominate the chair from their existing membership. As the Minister will be aware, it led to representations to the Tánaiste on last Thursday week; the matter was also raised at his own parliamentary party meeting, and subsequently assurances were given.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that it should be left to the membership of the governing body to nominate the chairman from within their membership having regard to the fact that it will be a broadly representative body made up of many constituent groups, including members of vocational education committees, members of other organisations and interest groups nominated by the vocational education committees &mdash; we have already referred today to the various commercial organisations which will have a legitimate input &mdash; the trade union movement, the student body, the academic council, etc.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the reason the Minister cannot accept that there may be a competent person within that body who could act as chairman.  I also fail to understand the reason the Minister has decided to take unto himself the plenipotentiary power to nominate a chairman &mdash; this is what probably will happen &mdash; from outside the existing membership of that body.  The vocational education committees and the IVEA complain constantly that they are under-represented, that their role has been under-valued while their role in education has not been acknowledged.  Deputy Mac Giolla and others have challenged the Minister to instance one case where a vocational education committee misappropriated funds or abused their powers.  I contend that they have not and that they have been extremely responsible and judicious. While the link will be a tenuous one at least they will have a positive role.  There will also be the possibility that at some stage during the term of office of the governing body a member of a vocational education committee &mdash; they will have <Col N="991" /> six representatives on the governing body &mdash; could be appointed chairman.  If the Minister were to do this at this juncture he would allay many of the fears, anxieties and legitimate grievances of the members of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I have just received a note indicating that my office has had a torrent of phone calls from vocational education committee chairpersons and IVEA members the length and breadth of the country who feel that their role has been under-valued and diminished by the decision of the Minister both in the previous Bill and in this Bill to take unto himself the power to appoint a chairman.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Minister spoke at length with some sincerity and conviction about the need for himself, the vocational education committees and the religious orders to cede power and give it to the governing bodies.  I agree with everything he had to say but what is stated in this section amounts to a total contradiction and flies in the face of what he had to say yesterday.  As a result there is enormous tension within the vocational education committees.  On section 5 we argued that terminology such as &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo; should be deleted.  The Minister agreed to accept many of our amendments but decided to retain this phrase in two areas.  He justifiably claimed that he had to keep a measure of power so as to avoid putting expense on the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Minister what is the reason he has taken unto himself the power to appoint the chairman?  Yesterday he spoke about the need to cede power but this is a perfect example of someone grabbing power.  The Minister got his claws on this power and he is holding on to it but this is not in keeping with what he said yesterday.  I can see no logical reason the Minister should not have confidence in the governing body which will be charged with the responsibility of running our colleges, or conclude that there is not one person <Col N="992" /> among the governing body who is fit to hold the position of chairman.  Can he put forward a logical argument for retaining this power and privilege for himself because what he is saying is that the chairman cannot be selected from within the existing membership?  It is an insult to the members of the governing body that the Minister has decided that he must appoint someone from outside the existing membership to be chairman.</P>
    <P>I should warn the Minister, irrespective of whoever is appointed, that it will be seen as a political appointment and will not be in the best interests of education.  I await the Minister's reasons for grabbing this privilege, power and authority for himself and for deciding not to leave it to the members of the governing body to select a chairman, as originally intended.  I agree with what my colleagues have had to say.  The vocational education committees and the IVEA have a legitimate crib about this section of the Bill in that it was here the Minister took over ensuring that it will be he who will make that appointment.  I am anxious to know the grounds on which he justifies that decision?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed similar circumstances on the Regional Technical Colleges Bill I made the point that amendment 117, proposed by the Minister, left the appointment of the chairman subject to political patronage.  That is not good nor will it be to the benefit of the Dublin Institute of Technology sector.  I do not make that criticism specifically of the present Government but of any Government.  As a former Minister for Education once said, all things being equal, the party nominee will be appointed.  We should be legislating to utterly rule out any such possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need only look to the events of yesterday.  I should like the Minister to clarify whether the fax issued to vocational education committees nationwide &mdash; which information was to be specifically transmitted to Fianna Fáil members of vocational education committees &mdash; was sent to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The <Col N="993" /> Minister stands condemned for issuing a document to be circulated specifically to members of vocational education committees of a particular political affiliation, placing chief executive officers of vocational education committees in a most invidious position, introducing party politics into the vocational education committee sector and, by extension, the regional technical college and Dublin Institute of Technology sector. The Minister's actions yesterday support the argument being advanced here that, taking the appointment of the chairman on the recommendation of the vocational education committee entirely out of the hands of the vocational education committee &mdash; in other words removing it completely from any vestige of local democratic control &mdash; is a most retrograde step.  It is absolutely at variance with the position adopted by the Minister in the House last evening, not only in relation to this Bill but also, as he described to us, the philosophy underlying the Green Paper on Education to be published tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to press this amendment, thereby allowing democratic control over the appointment of this premier office in the formation of the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally mystified at the reason the Minister is doing what he proposes here.  It begs the question of where is the pressure emanating from to effect this fundamental change.  Might it emanate from the fact that, within the Department of Education, there are not that many perquisites or favours to be handed out?  My understanding is that the colleges, their directors and so on have no objection to the chairman being elected from among their elected members.  If the Minister is willing, rightly so, to allow the natural selection of members representing the various sectoral interests in the colleges, why does he not extend that trust and allow them select one of their members as chairman? It begs the question of how much trust the Minister has in these members, and <Col N="994" /> is utterly inconsistent with the other selection process of the governing body.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it calls into question the meaning of the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; which we have not discussed.  Is the Minister now saying that he perceives the other members as very ordinary people, none of whom he would consider to be sufficiently qualified to chair their members' activities throughout the year?  There have been the most dramatic changes in vocational education in the past 60 years.  The whole perception of vocational education has been lifted out of the doldrums and given its rightful respect and status, due primarily to the excellent people who served on vocational education committees.  Is the Minister attempting to say to them that we are very glad we had them to effect these dramatic changes but now they can go.  Is he saying he does not really consider they are sufficiently qualified or experienced to select one of their members on the governing body?</P>
      <P>What type of person does the Minister envisage will become this powerful chairman of the governing body?  For example, will that person be some former party worker, some former chairman, who may have fulfilled a useful role in some other semi-State or other body who happens to be close to the Minister of the day?</P>
      <P>The Minister must recognise that, in inserting this provision, he is giving rise to the continued lack of respect for such political appointees, creating circumstances in which their power will be undermined because he or she will be a political appointee.  The Minister should let the natural selection process continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, is the Minister worried that the time may come when a student representative would become chairman? That would be a very innovative idea.  I do not predict that would occur in the immediate future but, so what, if it did. Would it not be wonderful if a student representative proved to be a worthy person to hold the office of chairman?  I grant it would be a dramatic change.  Is somebody pressurising the Minister to the point of saying we could not contemplate <Col N="995" /> the day when a student would become chairman of the governing body?  From my information there is no pressure coming from the colleges.  Will the Minister tell us from where it is emanating and give us an example of the type of person he envisages as the supremo of these governing bodies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not think the last amendments with which we dealt were moved and accepted.  I am worried that the Minister's amendments changing &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; to &ldquo;elected&rdquo; have not been agreed.  I refer to amendments 27, 31, 34 to 37, inclusive and 39, 41, 42, 43 and 45 with which we dealt earlier.</P>
      <P>We are now dealing with amendments 30 and 117 to 121, inclusive, the fundamental change the Minister effected in this Bill, which worried everybody with regard to central control being retained by the Minister, eliminating what he appeared to refer to as the bureaucracy of the vocational education committees. In this case it is more blatant.  I am not alleging any desire on the part of this Minister to appoint any particular person.  I do not know what may have been in the mind of whoever suggested that this be done, whether the Minister, the draftsman, somebody in his Department, or whoever.  It is seen to be a bad move democratically within the education system.  It is seen to be a demeaning rather than a raising of the status of the Dublin Institute of Technology and its constituent colleges.  The governing bodies will perceive it as demeaning their status that their chairman must be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this procedure were to be adopted by the Minister in relation to the existing universities there would be an absolute outcry, a major liberal uprising of academics all over the country who would repudiate the right of the Minister to interfere in any way like that in academia. Of course, as the Minister says, we are only dealing with an institute of technology here, we are not really dealing with universities, they have not the same <Col N="996" /> status and they will accept this type of nomination by a Minister of the chairman of the governing body.  It is really not good &mdash; let us put it that way.</P>
    <P>I must say the Minister has been very sensitive to the mood of amendments etc. put down and has accepted a considerable number of amendments and made many amendments himself.  In this area it is certainly not good to have the Minister making the appointment. Deputy Owen and others have said the governing body, who are partly appointed and partly elected, should elect their own chairperson.  The original draft of the Bill prior to these amendments provided that the chairperson be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the vocational education committee and may be removed from office by the Minister on the recommendation of the vocational education committee.  In each area where &ldquo;on the recommendation of the vocational education committee&rdquo; appeared in the Second Schedule in regard to the appointment of the chairperson, the Minister has put forward an amendment to eliminate that, so the Minister solely hires and fires the chairperson and can fire at any time just as he can hire at any time.  If the chairperson is to resign he must resign by letter to the Minister, and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on at greater length on it, but it would be far better if the Minister left the draft as it is or allowed the governing body to elect their own chairperson.  The appointment by the Minister is not a good move.  I hope he will seek to amend it, perhaps drop the amendments that exist or alter his amendments either now or on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am a little taken aback by some of the comments on my amendment No. 30 which I stand over. There are 20 persons on this governing body.  It is an institution that is almost wholly funded from the public purse and the Government of the day are proposing to appoint, albeit an important appointment, one person out of a total body of 20.  I do not fully understand why that should cause so much difficulty.  It has happened in University College, Limerick, and in Dublin City University when it was being established from the old NIHEs.  Those are two good precedents. It is working there and there is no political interference.  There are excellent chairpersons in both.  They are working well with the academic staff and are highly respected.  Therefore, the first point I want to make is to reject the phraseology used by one Deputy about grabbing power.  If you wanted to grab power, allowing the Government of the day to make one appointment out of 20 is a feeble attempt to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are coming to that.  It is the only direct Government or ministerial appointment from a total of 20.  It happens in DCU and in University College, Limerick.  This is an institution that is substantially funded by the State, not just by the taxpayers of Dublin but by the Irish taxpayers as a whole.  There is a role for a national representative also.  As I said last night, the Dublin Institute of Technology is not just a local institution but a national institution of technology of which the whole country will be proud.  Therefore, it is <Col N="998" /> not appropriate for a total local view to be taken of it.</P>
      <P>The president of the Dublin Institute of Technology is not being appointed by the Minister.  The Dublin Institute of Technology president is an extremely central key appointment and is being made by the governing body.  It is important that we understand that the very senior post of president of the Dublin Institute of Technology will be appointed by the governing body of the institute and not by the Minister.  The chair is a separate post.  The purpose is to reflect the national involvement and the fact that something over £30 million of not just Dublin funds but public funds will go to the institute.  That is an approximate figure; I can get the exact amount if anybody wants it.</P>
      <P>As the institute matures fully like, say, Limerick University and the DCU, there is no reason that we could not move on to a situation where the chairperson is elected.  I have no difficulty with that.  It is a philosophy I will be actively seeking to develop and which is reflected in the Green Paper.  Electing those people is far better than appointing them.  However, I came to the conclusion that at the beginning of these new institutions, or recast or reorganised institutions, one State voice out of a total of 20 is not unreasonable. In fact, it is very sensible if you are a taxpayer in any part of the country other than Dublin.</P>
      <P>One Deputy asked me what kind of person will be appointed.  All I can say is we will be looking for somebody who can reflect the stature of the institute and, it is hoped, could, by his or her stature, national or international, add to the already fine reputation of the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was not referring to me because he knows I would not dream of interfering in academia, but he suggested some Minister might like to do that and that is what is behind having a chairperson.  I am a little amused, talking to national politicians here.  Why is it all right for a county councillor vocational education committee appointee, of whom there are certainly six on this body, to dabble in academia but it is not all <Col N="999" /> right for the nationally elected Minister for Education to have some say, considering that he or she has responsibility for some funds?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy thinks councillors are more important than Ministers.  I think I got that message earlier, but there is a national perspective here.  I just cannot understand the thinking which says six county councillors can sit around a table and discuss courses, funding and academia but if the Minister for Education of the day, whoever that may be, given his or her responsibility for funding, attempts to have an eye on that ball, that is regarded as interference in academia. I think it is a double standard and playing somewhat to the local electoral gallery, if I may say so respectfully to the Deputies.</P>

      <P>That is all I have to say about that.  I was a councillor and I have great respect for these people, as I have for Deputies, Ministers and national institutions.  I fully stand over the proposal that the Minister appoint the chairperson because, as I said, it is only one appointment out of 20.  This proposal is not necessarily cast in stone, it can be changed.  Indeed, I should like to see it changed over a period.  The chairperson would be a legitimate national voice around the table of a very important institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because we are anxious to register in the strongest possible terms &mdash; by calling a vote &mdash; our non-acceptance of the Minister's logic in regard to this proposal. There has been a clear change of mind on the part of the Minister in relation to the governing body and the appointment of the chairperson.  The Regional Technical <Col N="1000" /> Colleges Bill clearly provided that the chairperson could be elected from within the existing membership.  However, a ministerial amendment was introduced to change that provision and give the Minister power, exclusively and without recourse to anybody, to nominate the chairperson.  This logic has been carried into the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to be trying to allay our fears in regard to this issue very much in the same way as he tried to allay our fears in relation to the right of these colleges to award degrees.  Yesterday evening we tried to insert a provision in the Bill which would give colleges the right to award degrees.  The Minister bought off our good faith with a down the road promise that this time next year he would look at the possibility of giving the colleges full degree conferring rights. What the Minister is saying now smacks of the same mistrust of the ordinary elected members of the board.  I use the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; advisedly in the context of what Deputy Owen has said.  The Minister is again making an attempt to buy our support for this amendment on the basis that, at some stage in the future when the members have proved themselves and have had a good apprenticeship, he might consider allowing them to nominate the chairperson from within their membership.  I submit to the Minister that this is not good enough.  A wide cross section of interests is represented on the board &mdash; people nominated by the vocational education committees, people elected on behalf of the academic staff, people elected on behalf of the non-academic staff, student representatives, a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and people from five different interest groups in this sphere of industry and commerce who will have a genuine and legitimate input to make. Surely it will be possible to elect from that collection of people a person competent to hold the position of chairperson. The Minister's proposal smacks of mistrust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the point that this would be a national organisation.  The representatives of the Irish Congress of <Col N="1001" /> Trade Unions and the various commercial organisations will represent national or local organisations.  The academic people can be from any part of the country.  I submit to the Minister that he cannot give the governing body power at some stage in the future to nominate their own chairperson because section 6 (2) (a) specifically refers to &ldquo;the Chairman and...&rdquo;.  Therefore, the chairman is additional to the ordinary members of the board.  I contend an amendment will be required at some stage if the Minister wishes to do what he is buying our good faith with, that is, give the governing body the right, after a proper apprenticeship, to nominate the chairperson from within their members.</P>
    <P>As a token gesture to the vocational education committees for their contribution to vocational education and in recognition of the fact that they have never put a foot wrong or had to be hauled before the Minister or any tribunal to answer for themselves &mdash; indeed the reverse is the case; they have done great work in the most difficult circumstances and helped pioneer third level technical education &mdash; I ask the Minister to provide that the chairperson be elected from the membership of the governing body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the argument that there is any worthwhile justification in giving the Minister power to appoint the chairperson.  The Minister justified this argument to some extent by saying that the chairperson is only one person out of 20 and, to use his own phrase, it will give the Minister an opportunity to keep his eye on the ball. I find that concept somewhat mind boggling because when a chairperson is appointed either by the Minister on the recommendation of the vocational education committee or appointed by the Minister on his own, surely he is independent and not answerable to any political master as such.  The Minister has not answered the point about political patronage.  I suggest that the nature of politics in Ireland is such that it would be highly unlikely for the Minister to <Col N="1002" /> appoint a chairperson who was not of his own political persuasion.  I am not singling out the Minister for any special attention but I believe that is how Ministers act in such situations.  Unfortunately, I regard the Minister's proposals as part of the political patronage syndrome; it will be another job for one of the boys, or girls, at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not responded to my point about the communication signed by him which was sent to vocational education committees yesterday.  This document contained the clear instruction that it was for circulation to Fianna Fáil members of vocational education committees. I should point out that it did not refer to Fianna Fáil councillor members but Fianna Fáil members.  The chief executive officers were put in the position of having to ascertain the political allegiance of all the members of their committees if they were to conform to the direction issued by the Minister's office.  I ask the Minister to clearly state in the House whether such a communication was issued by his office to the City of Dublin vocational education committee or whether it is his intention that such a communication should issue.  I would go so far as to say that it shows the Minister's contempt for vocational education committees that he regards them, on the basis of the communication issued yesterday, as a vehicle to be used in a blatantly unforgivable party political way.  This shows total disregard for local democracy and puts the chief executive officers of vocational education committees in a highly invidious position.  The Minister should apologise here to each chief executive officer for the reprehensible action he took yesterday.  I believe the type of mentality which gave rise to that communication is what is essentially behind this proposed change in the Bill which effectively will remove one of the real powers the City of Dublin vocational education committee have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the explanations given by the Minister as to why this amendment was put down.  He has not said anything which convinces me that there was anything other than a political <Col N="1003" /> inspiration behind it.  Will the Minister tell the House where the inspiration for this amendment came from?  Why has such a basic amendment to be suddenly made to this Bill which has had a long gestation period?  I ask the Minister to please tell us why this amendment is necessary.  His statement that he wants to keep his eye on the ball is not much of an explanation because the chairperson will be appointed either on the recommendations of the vocational education committee or by the Minister himself. Once the chairperson is appointed he has to act in an independent capacity and his loyalty has to rest with the institution and not with the Minister of the day.  Perhaps what the Minister is saying, with tongue in cheek, is that if the chairman &mdash; I have to use that term because we cannot get another change &mdash; wears the right political jersey, the bush telegraph will operate and the Minister of the day will be acquainted with all the facts in relation to the conduct of the affairs of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>I utterly reject this whole move.  It is totally undemocratic and is hypocritical having regard to what the Minister told us last night. He virtually lectured some of us that we could not have it both ways.  This is totally at variance with the principle of subsidiarity which, in the recent debate on Maastricht, was seen as an important development in the growing European economic and monetary union in the Community.  People should be allowed to have an effective say in all the affairs that are important to their lives and their development.  The Minister should convince me and the House that there is a real administrative reason like efficiency or whatever for this amendment which would change the Bill profoundly.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Higgins who have spoken at length on this topic, I would like to add my criticism to these ministerial amendments. They are not acceptable to me or to the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas. <Col N="1004" /> They are another example of centralisation, putting undue powers in the hands of the Minister for Education of the day.  We had an adequate debate on this point when dealing with the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  Therefore I will not detain the House any further except to say that I am totally opposed to these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond very briefly, particularly to Deputy O'Shea.  I want to make it clear that the chairman or chairperson could be nominated from among the members of the governing body.  There is no provision in the Bill that one of the members could not be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the wording between now and Report Stage to make sure that that is laid down.  It is my wish that the appointment can be from the governing body, although it need not be so.  That would depend on the ability and expertise available on the governing body.  I have no reason to distrust any member of the governing body and they would be prime candidates for that post.  I repeat that the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology is appointed by the governing body and reject the notion that there is any attempt to interfere by providing that the Minister makes one of the appointments to a very large institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the circular. I have been trying to get some information on that this morning but I have been occupied in the House.  The circular was not a direction to anybody but was a briefing note which was requested by the Fianna Fáil members of vocational education committees throughout the country on my view in response to a circular from the IVEA.  Some of the language in that circular is ordinary, trenchant political criticism which I fully accept &mdash; I have been around long enough to take that &mdash; but some of it is personally abusive. I am not prepared to take that from <Col N="1005" /> them and I decided to make a circular available to my party members on the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Because this matter was urgent and a number of meetings were taking place yesterday the circular was sent by my office to the chief executive officer's office for onward distribution.  I regret that the matter was dealt with in that way because it is not the correct way to proceed.  I have now instructed that the document be made available to all members of the vocational education committee, thereby removing any hint that there was an attempt to compromise the chief executive officer.  I understand that the circular was inadvertently distributed in that manner, but had I been in a position to deal with the matter personally it would not have happened that way.  I apologise to any chief executive officer who may be upset by what happened. I have asked that the chief executive officer pass the document to all members of the vocational education committee if they choose to do so or indeed to reject it.  Incidentally, I have great faith in chief executive officers.  In the Green Paper that will be published tomorrow there is a whole section on their future.  They are very strong managers in the Irish education system.  They have a key rôle to play in the future development of Irish education and I will talk to them about that during the process of the Green Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It contained my arguments as to the reason I tabled my amendments.  Some of my party members were, quite rightly, concerned about some of the amendments.  Because of my absence from parliamentary party meetings due to illness I was unable to explain it to them personally and I undertook to let them have a briefing note.  That is something I do for all members of my party in regard to legislation, and I am sure the Deputy does likewise for the members of his party around the country in regard to his position on legislation <Col N="1006" /> that comes before the House.  The document was a routine briefing note from the Minister to his own members, which inadvertently was distributed in the wrong fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I accept responsibility for that and I regret that it happened in that way.  It was not intended to embarrass chief executive officers and I am sure they are hard-necked enough not to be too embarrassed by it.</P>
      <P>Every Government Minister and Government appointment is open to the charge of political patronage.  The same charge could easily be made about vocational education committee appointments. Deputies have been appointed to the chair of vocational education committees and they and vocational education committees have made appointments as principals of colleges. That could be a political charge, to which there is really no defence by any politicians. All you can say is that you make every attempt to select the most suitable people for the posts.  It is a waste of time for any politician to try to defend the charge of political patronage because it is so wide and selective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The persons appointed to Limerick and Dublin have proved to be outstanding and have brought additional stature to those institutes.  For example &mdash; I am only speculating and do not wish to be held to this &mdash; a Government of the day could wisely consider that a national or international educational figure who is prepared to give time to this institute or another institute, a person with strong Irish roots and a strong commitment to Dublin, be appointed.  Such a person would give additional international stature to an institute, but that is not to say that some local councillor who is appointed to their chair would not bring similar stature to it.  They would have the integrity and the local support and experience but would they have the international or national perspective or reputation <Col N="1007" /> which may be needed to give the institute a certain standing in education internationally?  I am just thinking out loud about that; I am not saying that is the direction one would necessarily take. Every member of the governing body would be considered as a good candidate. In the launching of a new institute international recognition may be necessary, assuming that such a person is available for the post and the Government of the day accept the Minister's nomination in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not with to waste the time of the House but it has been said many times that I am trying to undermine vocational education committees.  The Bill provides for a strong continuing role for the vocational education committees in the regional technical college and Dublin Institute of Technology sectors by virtue of their nominations.  They have the single largest representation on the governing body and the continuing power to nominate the organisations they consider require representation on that body. They have the power to approve or modify the programmes and the budgets of the colleges.  There is no real substance to the charge that I am trying to write the vocational education committees out of the script.  I am trying to achieve a balance between local and national representation and to devolve as much power on a phased basis as is practical to the governing body.</P>
    <P>In order to clarify the functions clearly, I have amended the Bill in response to the debate and the IVEA who were invited to meet me this week.  However, they are not available and I hope they will be able to meet me next week.  The vocational education committees can initiate action in relation to the application of the Bills to other educational institutions.  The power of the vocational education committee to recommend the appointment of ordinary members of the governing body is fully maintained.  The Minister's power to direct the governing bodies to cease providing courses and services has been deleted.  The role of the president has been amplified to clarify his or her role <Col N="1008" /> as chief executive.  In relation to the format of programmes and budgets the Minister's role has been changed from determining to approving, in direct response to a request from the IVEA.  In relation to seeking information from a college the requirement that the vocational education committee can only do so with the agreement of the Minister has been removed.  We are not writing out the vocational education committees. We are trying to strike a balance between their role, the national role and the legitimate necessarily increasing power of the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is vitally important.  I was not aware of the Minister's letter but there is a meeting of the City of Dublin vocational education committee tomorrow at which it will probably be discussed.  I am assuming the Minister is referring to the language used by the IVEA which I would not stand over.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to a great extent written off the vocational education committees. He has expressed his great admiration for the chief executive officers and managers and I endorse that fully. Those whom I know are excellent in their jobs.  The Minister has not ever expressed any particular admiration, affection or anything in relation to the vocational education committee system, the 1930 Act and the democratisation and secularisation of education.</P>
      <P>With regard to the appointments by Ministers, the Minister may think that the appointment of a monetarist Thatcherite to be in charge of a third-level education body, a person who would say that education is a commodity like anything else, available to those who wish to purchase it, as the Minister's great man in Limerick said, is appropriate.  That is not the type of person I would like to see appointed to any institute of education. However, that is the type of person one is likely to get through a political appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very worried about the amendments we are discussing.  The denigration <Col N="1009" /> of the vocational education committees in this Bill is deplorable.  Everything the Minister has done has removed the element of democracy that was there originally.  While the first Minister wanted to alter the vocational education committee system, there would nevertheless have been much more democracy in the local education authorities.  There has been no mention of any democratic element from this Minister and that worries me.  I do not know whether the Green Paper will tell as much in relation to the future of education but the democratic element seems to have been swept aside. This section highlights my worries more than any other section.  I am, therefore, opposing these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The episode over the distribution of the commentary by the Minister to the Fianna Fáil members of vocational education committees clearly shows what is wrong with this section, as amended.  It has been well known that the Fianna Fáil members of vocational education committees, and the IVEA, have been greatly agitated by the Minister's amendments in relation to the vocational education committees with regard to this Bill and the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  It is understandable that the Minister as a member of that party would respond to that pressure. <Col N="1010" /> There is nothing necessarily wrong with that but it shows that the Minister behaves in a political way.  It is natural for a Minister to behave in that way.</P>
      <P>If the appointment of the chairperson of the governing body is in the gift of the Minister for Education, it will be a political appointment.  One only has to look at the appointments made by any Government, whether chairpersons or members of various boards, and even members of the Judiciary, to see that the appointments are political, and that the political affiliation of the appointees clearly ranks higher than their international reputation.  If the chairperson of the governing body is appointed by the Minister, it will be a political appointment. That is why I object to this.  It may well be argued that if the appointment is made by the vocational education committee it will also be a political appointment. I am not for a moment defending political appointments by the vocational education committee but at least if an appointment is made by the vocational education committee, there is a local input and a degree of debate in a public forum where a wide range of political and educational interests are represented, and the appointment is open to a certain degree of public scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House, the statement of the four party leaders referred to by the Deputy stated the following in relation to the issues raised by his question:</P>
      <P>All the Leaders who have signed this statement agree that the right to information, appropriately regulated by law, and to travel will be copperfastened in a further Referendum in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Legislative and/or Constitutional changes arising from the Supreme Court decision on Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution will be placed before the Dáil by the Government as soon as is practicable and, in any case, by the autumn.</P>
      <P>This extract from the leaders' statement already sets down the timescale for action in regard to the copperfastening of rights to travel and information for Irish women and in relation to the substantive issue of abortion.  I am happy to assure the Deputy that it is the Government's intention to meet this timescale and that the Cabinet sub-committee established to consider these issues will complete their deliberations with this timescale fully in mind.</P>

      <P>Can we take it that the work of the sub-committee is still being informed and influenced by the statements made by the Taoiseach in this house to the effect that he has no wish to preside over a society where the rights of women are inferior in any way and no wish to preside over a police state or an intolerant state?  In particular, can the Taoiseach confirm that it is his view that there should be no change in the law or Consitution that diminishes the rights of women in Irish society?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>May I make some inquiries as to the timescale involved here?  The Taoiseach said it is proposed to take this in November.  In view of that, the relevant legislation must have passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas before, at the very latest, the end of October and probably mid-October.  May I ask the Taoiseach what are the arrangements for the early resumption of the proceedings of this House with a view to ensuring that we have adequate time in this House to take the relevant legislation? For example, will the House resume in September particularly to deal with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision has yet been taken as to when the House will resume.  The Deputy can be assured we are all well aware of the timetable required under the Consitution for the passing of legislation to prepare for a referendum.</P>

      <P>The statement makes two references to the autumn.  The statement states specifically that the right to information and travel will be dealt with in the autumn.  In relation to the question of abortion and the matters arising from the Supreme Court decision, the statement refers to it being taken by the autumn.  One presumes that means before the end of summer.  May I ask the Taoiseach specifically what he intends to do in relation to the question of abortion, whether he will be complying with the solemn commitment made by the four party leaders that this matter will be dealt with by a referendum and/or legislation by the autumn?  How soon, therefore, does he expect the Cabinet sub-committee to report in order for that to be done and how soon will the Dáil reassemble for that to be done?</P>

      <P>The need for a referendum will have to be considered in the light of proposals that may be made by the intergovernmental conference in 1996.  It is only in the event of a change in direction that a referendum would be required.  The setting up of the committee has been under discussion by the party whips for some considerable time.  The sooner they are set up the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all agreed in this House that great care must be taken in the drafting of this legislation and for that reason it must not be rushed. In the meantime, we have a problem in that pregnant women who are travelling, or are about to travel, to England do not know what the situation is.  Could the Taoiseach give instructions to the Attorney General that pending the introduction of the legislation, that is, between now and the end of the autumn, there should be no further injunctions issued against pregnant women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should recall that I made that position abundantly clear long before the referendum was held.  The Deputy and the House can be assured that there will be no injunction sought by the State in relation to the right <Col N="1020" /> to travel of anyone in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is in the public interest that the sensitive and complex matter of abortion be approached in so far as is possible on an all-party basis?  To facilitate that, would the Taoiseach now consider taking steps to supply the leaders of the other parties in this House with the broad range of legal advice available to him or the position papers now available in the sub-committee? Alternatively, would he consider having meetings with the other party leaders to discuss the complexities of the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I shall certainly consult the party leaders as soon as the position begins to crystalise and we have various options clarified and the implications of all options available to us.  I should be glad to proceed on the basis of consultation with the leaders of the other parties and I hope that we can continue the consensus that proved so fruitful in the recent referendum.  I personally believe that this should not be a matter on which parties divide; it is a question of trying to do the right thing for all of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to a Question here yesterday, I pointed to the results of the referendum as bearing out my total rejection of criticism of the Government's campaign and of suggestions <Col N="1021" /> that we did not provide adequate information.</P>
      <P>We went to considerable lengths to provide information to the electorate in usable form.  The Treaty was made available for consultation in public libraries and main post offices and was on sale at the Government Publications Office.  It would have cost over £6 million to circulate the Treaty to all households. Having regard to its complexity, its use of cross-references to the other Community Treaties and its availability in public libraries and main post offices, such an expensive distribution could not be justified.</P>
      <P>Instead, we published a very comprehensive and clear White Paper and a Short Guide to the Treaty.  A total of 1.2 million copies of the short guide was distributed to every household in the State.  It was described in &ldquo;<i>The Economist</i>&rdquo; as being &ldquo;one of the clearest produced&rdquo;. A series of other information leaflets were produced.  These included the following four leaflets: &ldquo;Questions and Answers about Ireland and the Treaty on European Union&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Benefits of Our Place in Europe&rdquo;; &ldquo;Ireland and Agriculture in Europe&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Europe and the World&rdquo;.  One hundred and fifty thousand of each of these were made available.</P>
      <P>A total of 15,000 of another leaflet, &ldquo;Some Basic Questions Answered on European Union and Abortion&rdquo;, were made available, as were 75,000 copies of the joint statement made on 9 June by the leaders of the four main political parties. The party leaders' statement was also included in supplements circulated with 320,000 copies of the <i>Sunday World</i> on 14 June and 78,000 copies of the <i>Star</i> on 17 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also mounted a substantial advertising campaign to give the necessary information on the reasons for and benefits of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and on the adverse consequences of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  The advertising campaign included: 48 sheet billboard posters in six designs on 153 sites nationwide; press advertising in all the national daily, evening and Sunday newspapers; advertising in a number of selected <Col N="1022" /> periodicals; advertising in every provincial newspaper; 24, 10-second adds on RTE 1 and Network 2 TV; and 441 radio spots on all national and local radio stations.  The advertising on television and on radio was confined to reminding voters of the referendum and urging them to vote.</P>
    <P>A freephone telephone information service operated over six days from 11-13 and 15-17 June from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. daily.  About 4,000 calls were dealt with.  The centre was staffed by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Finance and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>On 16 June, in response to widespread demand, I made a special broadcast to the nation on television and radio to explain the issues simply and clearly to the people.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said sufficiently illustrates the comprehensive nature of the Government campaign.  It was, of course, in addition to the campaign mounted by the parties favouring a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, particularly the Government parties. Other organisations also made a lot of positive and helpful information available, including the orgaisations representing the social partners and, in particular, the Irish Council of European Movement, which produced their own lucid guide to the Treaty and an excellent booklet &ldquo;Maastrict Explained&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The print and broadcasting media also deserve great credit for the amount of information and discussion they carried. All in all, an immense amount of information was conveyed to the people and the result was seen in the fact that the turnout was up 13 percentage points on that in the 1987 referendum on the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I accept that there is a deficit of information among the general public, in Ireland and in other member states, about European developments and that this will have to be rectified if the Community, in its desire to make further progress, is to carry the people with it.  The Dáil and Seanad have, of course, the opportunity, if they wish to use it, to debate the comprehensive <Col N="1023" /> reports on developments in the European Community which was published regularly by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I also said yesterday that the proposed Oireachtas Joint Committee on European and Foreign Affairs will no doubt play a useful role in spreading information and knowledge on Community affairs.</P>
    <P>I would not favour making public funds available to registered political parties in future such campaigns.  It would be by no means helpful that taxpayers' money should be used for purposes which the Government of the day, as the constitutional Executive authority, would regard as being detrimental to the public interest.</P>
    <P>As I indicated yesterday, it may be that the proposed Oireachtas Committee could develop a role in regard to information that would be complementary to that of the Government.  This would represent a development of the role that has been played, not perhaps as fully as it could have been, by the existing Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which has been in existence for the past 20 years.</P>

      <P>I listened to the first 99 percent of the reply with interest.  I regret that in the ultimate paragraph and perhaps the penultimate paragraph the Taoiseach gave a view in response to the question.  I do not wish to be argumentative, a Cheann Comhairle, but I can say to the Taoiseach that if the same enthusiasm and conviction is displayed during a general election campaign you will be here on your own, Sir, because TDs will not be returned having regard to the campaign conducted all around the country.</P>

      <P>Deputies are in no position <Col N="1024" /> to throw stones.  Everybody knows that, so perhaps we should just leave it. Could I put it to the Taoiseach that it would be in the interest of the body politic and the people of this country if the political parties were in a position to carry out the debate and were funded? Granted, the Taoiseach said that the Government provided a certain amount of resources and money, but the political parties were not funded.  The debate was inadequate and there was a lack of information. Certainly the view was conveyed to me by many people going to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty were voting without full information and knowledge.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the question for the future.  There will be another major debate leading up to 1996.  I ask that a campaign of information be conducted on time, because most of the informative material read out by the Taoiseach to the House was issued in the final two or three weeks before the referendum, which was completely inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Maastricht Treaty started a long time before the final few weeks.  The debate went on for a considerable time.  The Deputy and the House should be aware that a survey carried out by a European newspaper on the best informed members of the public in any Community country showed the Irish as rating second.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the position which the Taoiseach has adopted with regard to funding on the basis of not using taxpayers' money for purposes which they consider are not in the national interest.  Will he, therefore, end the subvention to parties in this House who obviously oppose the Government on a whole range of issues apart from Maastricht?  There is obviously a difference of opinion between the parties here regarding the national interest and we have debates on these issues every day of the week.  Does it also mean that the current discussions behind closed doors &mdash; I only hear rumours of these things &mdash; with regard to possibly providing further funding for political parties are just a charade?  How will we decide what the national interest is?  Will it be only in relation to referenda that this principle applies?  Will he accept that the question of the information to the public should start now, not in 1996?  We need a system in the Houses of the Oireachtas whereby Deputies and Senators can contribute to and, indeed, monitor the activities <Col N="1026" /> of the Government at EC level.

      <P>I have no plans to publish a White Paper on the lines suggested by the Deputy.  The Government's priorities in relation to the development of the arts were outlined by the Taoiseach on 18 February last in reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Spring.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions I have met representatives of the Arts Council, the State agency who have a statutory role to advise the Government regarding artistic and cultural matters.  A number of meetings have also been held over the past four months between representatives of the main national cultural institutions and myself or the Taoiseach.  I am satisfied from those meetings that I am fully aware of the needs and aspirations of the various cultural agencies who function under the aegis of my Department.</P>

      <P>No, I do not agree.  As Deputy Spring is aware, the publication of a White Paper was announced in 1984 by his Government but it was not published until 1987.  Its title was <i>Access and</i><Col N="1029" /><i>Opportunity.</i> I appreciate the sentiments of the White Paper but they are mainly aspirational and there is no reference to cost.  My ambitions and hopes in the Department &mdash; I have already outlined my task in this regard &mdash; are to facilitate progress and to work closely with, in particular, the Arts Council who had a sizeable budget of £10 million last year. I also want to work closely with the national cultural institutions.  While I appreciate the aspirations contained in the White Paper I would be duplicating the roles of the Arts Council and the national cultural institutions who are performing the duties more than satisfactorily by doing any more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, thankfully, funding is satisfactory although I always endeavour to try to improve it.  However, my main aims in the Department are those outlined by the Taoiseach in February, to aid development of the arts, to improve access and participation by the public and to advance the status of artists. There are also other areas, to which I referred in previous replies, to involve more local authorities, to regionalise our national museums and their materials, to co-operate more closely with the Northern Ireland Arts Council and to ensure that we are totally involved in the EC dimension when the Maastricht Treaty is finalised.  There are many elements involved and the Taoiseach and I outlined them clearly over the last few months.  I am always willing to listen to views expressed by any Member of this House but a White Paper would simply be a duplication of the wonderful efforts made by the Arts Council and other organisations involved in national culture. Since my appointment, I have met all the parties concerned; since I was last questioned on this matter I met members <Col N="1030" /> of the boards of the galleries and the National Library and museum.  I am very happy that progress is being made and that the investments are being used wisely.  If there are any points which Deputy Spring &mdash; or any other Deputy &mdash; wishes to raise at any time I will be happy to examine their proposals.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the secretariat to the commission that it is intended to submit the commission's report to Government in October.</P>
      <P>Given the broad terms of reference and the independence which have been assigned to the commission it is, of course, open to them to offer an opinion on issues which involve legal or constitutional change.  I do not, therefore, propose to ask the commission specifically for an opinion on matters relating to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I look forward to the launching of the report and I commend the chairperson, Miss Justice Mella Carroll, and the members of the commission for the great work they did.  However, I wish to stress to the Minister of State and the Taoiseach that many women in the recent referendum by voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; showed faith in the Government.  They voted against their better judgement for the greater good of the country but they are unsure and cannot really trust the Government to deliver on the important measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to consult with the chairperson of the commission because I believe women would have greater confidence if they felt that the chairperson and the commission, given <Col N="1031" /> their expertise and considerable skills, would have an input into the decision in relation to the next referendum.  I ask the Minister of State to bear this suggestion in mind given that their report will not now be presented until October.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware, I have consulted widely with women's organisations during the past few months, including the Council for the Status of Women who have made a positive contribution and recommended that women should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  It is clear, given the high &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum, that the women of Ireland supported the strategy pursued by the Government.  I agree with Deputy Fennell when she says that the work of the commission is most important and that we are eagerly awaiting the outcome of their deliberations. They have received 600 submissions and that is the reason their report will not now be made available until October.  We were expecting the report to be presented around this time.</P>

I hope the Deputy will agree that, having given the commission this task, it would be prudent to await the outcome of its deliberations.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but there is considerable concern about his role as Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs?  It appears that he does not have a budget or any legislative plan despite the fact that it is essential to introduce Bills such as the Equal Status Bill if we are to meet our UN commitments. May I ask the Minister of State if he would consider the possibility of having an interdepartmental report which would indicate the action that is being taken or is proposed to be taken?  I ask him not to suggest that we await the report of the commission &mdash; I am sure legislation is a long way down the road &mdash; but rather to indicate what his role is.  I think that after six months many women see the Minister as merely playing a ceremonial role.  We know that his heart is in the right place but can he give us any indication of what action is being taken at Government level?</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to take the Deputy's question seriously having regard to the fact that when she held this portfolio for four years she failed to bring a single legislative measure before the Dáil.  I would like to ask her what is the reason she failed to promote an equal status Bill while in office if she thinks it is so important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject totally her comment that I am only playing a ceremonial role.  Yesterday the high powered inter-departmental committee, who comprises high ranking civil servants from all Government Departments, held their second meeting.  Indeed, since my appointment I have been trying to get the best service from all Government Departments.  In addition, the support of the Taoiseach and of Ministers has been <Col N="1033" /> forthcoming.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs has a co-ordinating and monitoring role.  As I said, I am very pleased with the support I have received since my appointment from all Government Departments.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, with regard to legislation, the Minister for Justice has a number of Bills in the pipeline, including the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992.  The debate on the Report and Final Stages of that Bill is due to be concluded today.  In addition, work has reached an advanced stage and the legislation which deals with the question of equal rights of ownership of the family home.  That Bill will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to marital breakdown, the outcome of the comprehensive inter-departmental review in this area will be reflected in a White Paper which is due to be published shortly.  With regard to equal opportunities in employment, the Minister for Labour is about to approach the Government to secure approval to draft a comprehensive Bill in this area.</P>
    <P>Forgive me, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving a lengthy reply but I resent the tone of the Deputy's remarks.  Since my appointment I have played a pro-active role and I am delighted with the response I have received at Government and Civil Service level.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a broad issue, Deputy.  With regard to an equal status Bill, I have considered Deputy Fennell's ideas.  Indeed I have in the past paid tribute to her for the contribution she has made.  With regard to the question of taking measures to tackle the problem of discrimination in the remaining areas, I have considered the question of membership of golf clubs but that is only one element.  It comes down to a question of whether we should attempt to resolve this matter by way of legislation but I am not convinced that legislation is warranted. It is very difficult to legislate for the attitude of a small minority of our citizens who would condemn women to second class citizenship.  I am in favour of a sustained initiative because I believe that over time such an approach is bound to lead to a change in attitudes.  I repeat that if the Commission on the Status of Women recommend that an equal status Bill, for example, is necessary, the Government will give this and the Commission's other recommendations serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment I have not made any announcements with regard to a blueprint for legislative action.  My main role is to consult with all organisations, including the Commission on the Status of Women.  I am awaiting the outcome of their deliberations.  While I have many <Col N="1035" /> ideas of my own, particularly in the area that Deputy Fennell dealt with for some time, I repeat that the Deputy did not introduce an equal status Bill.

Furthermore, would he agree that the Taoiseach's statement some months ago that the unemployment figures would stabilise was simply a preview of the fact that the figures themselves would be doctored?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy's first statement.  I do not agree that the figures are being doctored. As the Deputy has just proved, by asking the question, the figures can be obtained every month simply by adding (a), (b) and (c) together.  I might point out, as was indicated in the reply to which the Deputy referred on 3 June &mdash; I think it was Deputy De Rossa who asked that question also in relation to a report of the task force on employment &mdash; that the statistical review was carried out by an expert group established under the aegis of the central review committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The group is representative of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Social Welfare, Industry and Commerce and Labour, the Central Statistics Office, the Federation of Irish Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The group recommended that the statistical treatment of persons on week-on/week-off working arrangements and self-employed persons formerly on the register should be regularised.  In reaching their recommendations the expert group had regard to the internationally accepted principles of the measurement of unemployment.  I might add that the group's recommendations were endorsed by the task force.</P>

      <P>The fact that other countries engage in doctoring unemployment <Col N="1037" /> figures should not lead us down the same road.  The fact that people now being removed from being classified as officially unemployed, as defined, who are still in receipt of unemployment benefit, should continue to be included in the statistics.  Would the Minister not agree that it is a gross distortion of our unemployment position to have circumstances prevail in which something like 18,000 &mdash; or closer to 19,000 &mdash; people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance are not now being counted as unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I reject the use of the word &ldquo;doctoring&rdquo;.  As the Deputy has just proved, those figures are there, can be obtained and are a matter of public record.  Of the 18,000 people to whom he refers, 5,200 were removed because they were working on a week-on/week-off basis and comprised part of the numbers involved in the statistical review.  The other 13,000 odd are on pre-retirement allowance and credit schemes.  It is a condition of participation in both schemes that people declare they are no longer available for work, that they are retiring and are removed from the live register on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Commission on Health Funding was a very comprehensive examination of a wide range of aspects of health policy including funding issues, eligibility for services, organisational structures and accountability.  The report, and the consultation process <Col N="1038" /> which followed its publication, provided a most important input to the Government's decisions in these areas and to the preparation of legislation on foot of these.</P>
      <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, is already in place and has restructured eligibility for health services in line with the recommendations of the commission.</P>
      <P>As announced in September last, legislation is now being prepared to implement the Government's decisions on the reorganisation of health services in the Eastern Health Board area and the improvement of accountability in the health services in general.  It will also address the need for greater clarity in relation to the respective roles, relationships and accountability of the other health board memberships and their chief executive officers.  I intend to bring the legislation before the House in the course of this year.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Hospital Advisory Group who were established in September 1991 have been actively pursuing the implementation of the good practice recommendations contained in the Kennedy reports.  The group are at present focusing on the recommendations in relation to out-patients services.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Hospital Efficiency Review Group &mdash; Fox report &mdash; a hospital value for money steering group &mdash; who include two assistant secretaries from my Department &mdash; have been established to progress those recommendations which are amenable to immediate intervention. Appropriate action is ongoing with the full support of the relevant hospital chief executive officers, secretaries and managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  A hallmark of his immediate predecessor was the establishment of committees to report.  At one time there were 21 separate committees investigating various aspects of the health services. Surely it is now time to take direct action rather than cosmetic action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept the kernel of the report of the Commission on Health Funding &mdash; which has been on the Minister's <Col N="1039" /> desk since September 1989 &mdash; that the problems we face with the health services are matters to be dealt with in the manner in which those services are planned, organised and delivered? Would the Minister say what fundamental change he intends to bring about in the way our health services are planned, organised and delivered?  What is the Minister's attitude to the specific recommendation of the commission for the establishment of a health services executive?  Surely he has had adequate time to formulate an opinion?</P>
    <P>My third question relates to the Minister's own proposal, one of very great importance in relation to patient's rights, that is the patient's charter.  Would the Minister confirm that the patient's charter, as announced by him, will make no impact on waiting lists or the quality of care patients receive unless it is underpinned by legislation?  Is it his intention to legislate for a patient's charter so that people will know where they stand and have a legal framework within which they can vindicate their rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which the health services are planned, organised or delivered is a question to which we are addressing ourselves with particular regard to the new structural arrangements for the Eastern Health Board area, which, in turn, will impact on the other health boards nationwide.  Second, under this new proposal, the Department will shift their focus of attention from managing and involving themselves in the everyday affairs or running of the health services, to policy decisions.  I and my predecessor found that the Department were overly involved in certain aspects of the health services in which they should not have been involved, resulting in policy being overlooked.  As the Deputy rightly said, there is need for planning, organisation and delivery of the health services, which can be done only within the structures we propose and which was one of the recommendations of the Commission on Health Funding.  I am not too sure yet about a health services executive. <Col N="1040" /> I wish I had an answer as to whether this constitutes the best resolution of the problem.  I will be studying the matter throughout the summer months.</P>
      <P>There has been a consultation process engaged in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the patient's charter which is almost completed.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions made a very important contribution when I met them a few weeks ago.  The patient's charter is almost finalised and will be published very shortly.  I am not too sure whether such a patient's charter should have legislative weight.  Its main purpose will be to educate patients about their rights.  I think there will be public pressure to ensure that that patient's charter is respected and obeyed by hospitals.  I do not think it will need legislation.  I did bear in mind what the Deputy said about a health ombudsman.  If we observe that the patient's charter is being ignored by hospitals then we will certainly give active and serious consideration to the establishment of a health ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for reflecting on the suggestion I made when we dealt with health questions on a previous occasion in relation to the establishment of a health ombudsman, which would constitute a solution.  I am disappointed at the Minister's present fundamental attitude to the re-organisation of the health services.  The commission report reveals a confused, disorganised, inadequate accountability and inadequate integration of the services.  The Minister suggested today that now he is going to look at the Eastern Health Board and see how that impacts on them. Will he accept that we need a comprehensive change and overview in relation to the planning, organisation and delivery of health services?  That is what the commission were set up to do and what they recommended.  Now, several years on, no significant changes have occurred.  Is the Minister happy to tinker around with the system or is he going to take major initiatives that will change the 1970 Health Act fundamentally?</P>

      <P>I would like to answer Deputy Howlin.  He will understand that the decision was made last September, that new structures would be put in place in the EHB.  I have been looking at this and I have seen the results of consultations and submissions from various bodies interested in the health services. This is no mean task.  I agree with what has been said and I went into the Department with that kind of thinking but now I must face up to what is happening.  That is why I said I would apply myself to this throughout the summer to see what is the best course to take.  I am conscious that the restructuring of the EHB is at an advanced stage, but I must look at it very closely over the summer.  I hope to come back with a positive answer in the interests of the health services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total allocation made available to health boards this year is £1,018.7 million. This represents an increase of 13.5 per cent over the original allocation for 1991.  The financial provision for the health services represents a significant proportion of overall Government expenditure.  Consequently the health service has a vital role to play in ensuring <Col N="1042" /> the success of the Government's medium term fiscal targets as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The maintenance of strict control of expenditure must, therefore, be considered a vital element in the effective management of services by all health boards.  The allocation of resources between the various service programmes is, of course, a matter for each individual health board.</P>
    <P>As the information requested by the Deputies in relation to summer bed closures is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the organisation of hospital services is, of course, a matter for the voluntary hospitals and health boards concerned, having regard to their competing service priorities and the resources at their disposal. Some agencies have made provision for seasonal closures in their service plans for 1992.  I should point out that seasonal closures are not unusual and, indeed, are part and parcel of the provision and organisation of hospital services throughout the country.  This has been the case over many years.  Seasonal closures are often planned to coincide when staff are on annual leave and when the level of activity at the hospital has traditionally decreased.  All emergency and urgent services will, of course, continue to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has expressed concern that seasonal closures will have an adverse effect on waiting lists for patients.  With regard to waiting lists generally, it must be acknowledged by the Deputy, and by every Member, that waiting lists are a feature of all modern health systems.  This is due to many factors, not least of which are the requirements of an ageing population and the development of new procedures and treatments.  In other words, there are unlimited demands being placed on finite resources.  That said, while there are problems in some areas, waiting lists in Ireland for most specialties are not excessive.  The admission of a patient to hospital is, of course, a decision for the <Col N="1043" /> consultant in charge of the case.  Priority is given to urgent cases and it is open to a patient's general practitioner to contact the consultant with a view to expediting matters if that is appropriate.  I would, however, like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that my Department are closely monitoring the situation regarding seasonal closures and are keeping in constant touch with health agencies about this matter.  Should it emerge that undue hardship arises, I have no doubt that the health authority concerned would take appropriate action with a view to alleviating the situation.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister continues to use longwinded replies.  Is he aware that health boards in the first quarter of this year reported substantial overruns running to millions of pounds on their allocation?  Is he also aware that they are blaming his Department in part for failing to deliver the demand-led schemes and the money associated with them?  What instruction did he make to the health boards as to how they would deal with the 1991 overruns which are really at the heart of the difficulties many of the health boards are now facing?</P>

We have tried to <Col N="1044" /> compel them to live within their budgets. The demand-led schemes are something over which there is no control.  We cannot say how many people are going to become ill or will require drugs.  We are tackling the matter and trying to bring some kind of order into it.  The health boards are conscious of the need to bring order and economy into this and I feel sure we can depend on their co-operation.</P>

Dr. Walsh was the medical officer charged with highlighting the problem.  It does not mean it will not receive the same attention and priority. It has no bearing on the person.  There is another new medical officer in the Department who is as enthusiastic as Dr. Walsh.  When Dr. Walsh was appointed there was no AIDS strategy committee in operation.  Since then enormous work has been done in highlighting the problem and that will continue.

A report is prepared following each inspection which is transmitted to health board management, or in the case of the private hospitals, to the appropriate manager.  The report measures the service against the indicators used and makes recommendations for improvements where necessary.  The inspector's recommendations are transmitted to the appropriate health board in whose functional area the psychiatric hospital is <Col N="1047" /> located shortly after inspection.  The health boards must then report to me on action which they plan to take to implement the recommendations made by the inspector.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Green Paper on Mental Health which I launched earlier this month proposes a continuation of this system of inspection of mental hospitals.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this report has taken the lid off the very disturbing situation in some of our psychiatric hospitals where patients were left without occupation, some patients were needlessly locked up &mdash; in one case people were restrained for a period of nine years &mdash; and there was mice infestation in some wards?  Would he agree that the 20 per cent cut in the real allocation of funds to psychiatric services by his Government during the period 1986-92 was in large part responsible for such conditions?  Would he also agree that the closure of long-stay beds which were not replaced with alternative accommodation in the community has been a worrying trend and has under-pinned the deterioration in psychiatric services?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would all agree that mental health services have not been given the priority they deserve. The publication of this report has highlighted the problems experienced by mental patients.  Some of these patients who have been treated very poorly and shabbily were litterly banished from society.  Successive Governments share the blame for this.  I very much agree with what the Deputy has said.  It was very important to highlight these problems.  If the report does nothing else it shames us as individuals into ensuring that these patients get the care and attention they deserve.  Significant improvements have been made in the service since the 1988-89 report was published.  In addition, enormous changes have taken place in the community services.  I believe we should continue along that line, as proposed <Col N="1048" /> in the document Planning for the Future.  If we can do this many patients will be rehabilitated.  It is my great desire to see these old Victorian mental hospitals closed down.  This can and will be done once proper facilities have been installed in the community for these patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 22, 56, 116 to 123, inclusive, and 126 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by Deputy Byrne and the public concern regarding the disposal of clinical waste arising in hospitals.  Officials of my Department and the health boards are currently re-examining the options for disposing of hospital waste in the light of proposed new stricter EC environmental emission standards.  I accept that there are problems associated with present incineration arrangements and the study will assess possible locations for central incinerators and alternative processes to incineration.  The needs of all areas, including of course Dublin, Cork and Galway, will be taken into account in this study and the results will form the basis for a national clinical waste management plan.  I cannot anticipate the recommended method of clinical waste disposal which will emerge from the study but cost considerations would tend to suggest a solution based on a small number of centralised facilities around the country.</P>
      <P>Detailed data on the current costs and methods of disposal of medical waste and on the number of hospital incinerators currently being operated are not readily available.  My Department have requested the health agencies to supply up-to-date information under these headings. It is safe to assume, however, that none of the incinerators in use would comply with the very low emission level standards specified in the current EC draft proposals for hazardous waste incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current recommended practice is that hospital waste be segregated into clinical and non-clinical components, the clinical waste being sent to landfill sites. The operation of hospital incinerators is <Col N="1051" /> subject to the regulatory provisions of the Air Pollution Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that every effort is being made by my Department to implement as quickly as possible a hospital waste disposal policy that will overcome the difficulties associated with current disposal practices and comply fully with the demanding requirements of modern environmental standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the time frame within which he envisages we can comply with standards in this area?  Would he agree it is very worrying that we have incinerators which are producing acids, toxic metals and other compounds which, according to international standards, are hazardous? Will he indicate to the House the degree of urgency he is giving to this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made it clear to my Department that there is a degree of urgency about this matter and that many of the incinerators attached to hospitals fall below standards and are causing a serious problem.  Once we know the scale of the problems and the options in regard to disposal we will decide on the time frame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the incinerator at the Cork Regional Hospital which is antiquated, overloaded and inefficient is a health hazard to the surrounding area?  In view of his previous statement that he will carry out a study, may I ask the Minister if that study will be undertaken in the context of an overall national waste disposal plan or if it will be carried out by his Department?  Would he agree it is about time money was spent to replace many of the unsafe incinerators throughout the country?  What we want is action, not a study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot approach this issue in a haphazard way.  We have to examine the issue properly so that we will know in what direction to go.  We cannot deal with individual incinerators separately.  We must look at the overall problem, the costs involved and how the problem can be dealt with effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that regardless of what study is carried out an incinerator will be located in the Cork area and that the incinerator at the Cork Regional Hospital is antiquated and is causing grave concern to many people in Cork city?  This incinerator needs to be replaced.  When it is obvious that the study will show that an incinerator should be located in Cork the Minister should install the incinerator there now instead of waiting for the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out to Deputy Barry that the incinerators being offered now would not comply with the stricter EC environmental emission standards. Therefore, we could find ourselves in further trouble.  Tenders were invited for some incinerators but they did not comply with the EC environmental standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to know exactly where we are going.  This will be done with great haste.  I accept that the position in Cork is serious and the same applies to St. James's in Dublin.  To put an incinerator in place now that would not meet the requirements could result in further problems arising.  I will consider the matter seriously and urgently.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, considering that at present she is drafting a waste management Bill which hopefully will be law this year?  Is the Minister aware of any hospital or health board who are currently exporting toxic waste from this jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions are taking place with the Department of the Environment. I am not aware of any toxic or clinical waste being exported.  However, I will ask my Department again about that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his decision to site a central clinical waste incinerator in St. James's Hospital is an absolute disgrace because this is an inappropriate site for what is essentially an industrial process?  Would the Minister agree that the staff and patients of St. James's Hospital, as well as the residents in the area, should not be obliged to accept the clinical waste from every home, hospital and private hospital in the city, such as the Blackrock Clinic, the Mater Private Hospital and the private hospital at St. Vincent's? Why would the Minister impose such a penalty on the people of the inner city when this process is more akin to an industrial waste disposal project?

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne is well aware of statements I made and that I met the residents' associations to whom <Col N="1054" /> I gave assurances that nothing would take place without full consultation with them. Despite that fact he tried to create problems in the area in a destructive and negative fashion.  I gave assurances in writing and publicly and I fail to see why the Deputy is taking such a negative attitude. He would be much better employed by adopting a positive approach and showing genuine concern for the needs and concerns of the people rather than stirring up unnecessary trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the tenders were invited before I came to office.  As the Deputy is fully aware, I gave specific assurances that no decision would be made in respect of any tender for an incinerator without full consultation with the public.  I have arranged for liaison between the resident's association and an engineer in my Department.  I said that a study would be carried out of a city of comparable size in Britain to see the measures employed there.  The results of such a study will be shown to the residents concerned and nothing will take place behind their backs.  I will be making a statement on this matter shortly.  I would ask the Deputy to be much more constructive in his approach to this problem and to <Col N="1055" /> please cease being negative and destructive.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent comments made by the Master of the Coombe Hospital in relation to the level of funding allocated to women's health in this country.  Substantial funds have been allocated to the major maternity hospitals in recent years.  Last year a budget of £1.2 million was approved for the development of a new three storey block, including operating theatres and a delivery suite at the Rotunda Hospital.  This year I have approved the provision of a capital grant for the upgrading of the out-patients' department of the Coombe Hospital.  The hospital is currently seeking new tenders for this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these substantial capital investments, additional funds were made available last year for the opening of a new mammography facility at Castlebar General Hospital.  This year additional funds have also been made available for the purchase of replacement mammography equipment in University College Hospital, Galway, and for the running of a new mammography unit in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. A capital <Col N="1057" /> grant of £60,000 was also made available to Holles Street Hospital towards the purchase of ultrasound equipment in respect of a cordocentesis service this year.</P>
    <P>A pilot programme of breast cancer screening is at present underway.  This programme is part of a network of pilot schemes on breast cancer screening currently underway within the European Community, and is partly funded by my Department.  The outcome of this study will obviously play a major role in relation to any decision to establish a national programme.</P>
    <P>In recent times, my Department have also made grants available to the following voluntary organisations concerned with the advancement of women's health: the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their children for an information booklet; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for the development of a leaflet on women and smoking; national association for the Ovulation Method in Ireland (NAOMI) for the development of a leaflet on family planning; Tipperary Childbirth Research Trust for the production and development of a booklet on miscarriage; the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association for the production of a very informative booklet; the Mater breast cancer screening pilot project for publicity materials; Council for the Status of Women for the production of a report of a seminar on women's health and a seminar on women and smoking; the Miscarriage Association and the Endometriosis Society for production of leaflets; the Rotunda Hospital for the production of audiotapes for menopausal women; La Leche League, to cover the cost of attendance of delegates at the INO conference on breast-feeding and Association for Improvements in Maternity Services (AIMS) to assist with compilation and production of a Guide to Maternity Services in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Also, the following publications relating to women's health are available on request from the health promotion unit of my Department: Book of the Child; Menopause; Gynae Book; Hysterectomy; <Col N="1058" /> Cystitis; Women and Alcohol; Diethylstilboestrol &mdash; Ask your Mother and Smoking and Pregnancy.</P>
    <P>In the present AIDS awareness convenience advertising campaign specific messages are targeted at women through women's clinics by the placement of AIDS awareness messages in these venues.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the services already provided by his Department and the funding provided by his Department.  The Master of the Coombe Hospital should be listened to when he says he believes that women's health needs are under-funded. No doubt he made that statement in the full knowledge of the kind of services and funding already available.  Is it intended to increase the funding available for women's health and for research?  Given that the Master of the Coombe, supported by the Council for the Status of Women, has indicated his concern at the virtual non-existence of research into areas relating to women's health, such as cancer, smoking particularly among younger women, the menopause and other areas, the question raised by the Master of the Coombe cannot be adequately responded to by simply listing what is already provided.  We need an indication as to what will be done in the future.</P>

      <P>I opened up a research unit at the Coombe Hospital recently.  I spoke to the Master of the Coombe about what he had said.  He was not aware of the number of information leaflets and booklets and of the work we have done. I hope that what I have read out today will come to his notice.  The Master of the Coombe was concerned about issues affecting women.  In my Department there is a committee concerned with women's health issues.  I came in prepared to set one up and found that there was one already there.  It is a good committee which has done an enormous amount of work of which I was not aware. I agree that a lot more has to be done.  I hope to have further discussions with the <Col N="1059" /> Master of the Coombe and other people interested in women's health issues and that we can highlight and fund measures to improve the health of women.</P>
      <P>There is also a question with regard to privacy in hospitals.  In an obstetrical unit in the out-patients department women are examined with merely a cover thrown across them and there is no privacy at all. I thought it was essential to improve the grant for a new OPD in the Coombe.  In areas like that women are denied privacy and dignity.  We want to see that situation change rapidly.</P>

      <P>Before commencing the Report Stage of the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992, the Minister of State must move a motion which refers to a situation where there is for Report Stage an amendment in the Minister's name which is identical to an amendment which was put and was lost on Committee Stage.  In these circumstances it is necessary for the Minister of State to move that Standing Order No. 104 shall not apply to the amendment which now appears in the Minister's name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet.  The Minister is now moving an amendment which is identical to one the Government voted against on Committee Stage.  As the Minister is a new Minister I would point out to him the folly of not taking on board constructive amendments with no political hidden agenda which are brought forward by Opposition Deputies on Committee Stage of a technical Bill.  It was open to the Minister to accept this amendment on Committee Stage.  It seems that the only reason it was not accepted was because it came from this side of the House.  If that is the approach to be adopted on future legislation from the Department of Justice, we on this side of the House might as well just take <Col N="1139" /> our leave of the House, go out and enjoy the summer sunshine and leave the Minister to his folly of producing defective legislation.  We did a service in proposing an amendment which could have been taken on board on Committee Stage.  The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Parties who are portraying themselves as having an interest in Dáil reform voted against it just because it came from this side of the House.  Now we have to have a motion such as the one before the House to allow the Minister to table the same amendment for whatever ministerial ego trip one goes on in moving an amendment in one's own name instead of accepting an amendment in someone else's name.  I hope that if ever I find myself on the opposite side of the House I will adopt a more constructive approach to amendments tabled by Deputies, so that I will not have to look foolish coming in on Report Stage and having to do what the Minister has to do today.  I agree with the motion.  I just regret that we have to engage in this sort of political play acting in this Chamber.  We seemed, some time ago, to have risen about it.  However, in the context of what happened with this very minor amendment, although its workings are important, we descended again to the sort of approach that appeared to have been brushed aside.  I hope the Minister has learned his lesson from this.  I do not say that in a schoolmasterish way or in any way to try to score a point.  I am simply saying that if the Opposition side table constructive amendments that bear no political malice, have no hidden agenda and are not designed to embarrass anybody the Minister should give them more reasonable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has now recognised the need for this amendment and is inserting it in the Bill.  As we go through the afternoon I will be saying nice things about him as he has taken on board quite a number of the proposals we sought to tease out on Committee Stage.  I welcome the fact that this is happening.  It shows that this particular <Col N="1140" /> item should not have been necessarily dealt with in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment very briefly on Deputy Shatter's remarks as I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House.  The Deputy adverted to the fact that I am new to this portfolio, which is indeed true.  However, as he has not yet occupied ministerial office, I prefer to seek advice elsewhere.  The fact is that I accepted the substance and logic of his argument when he proposed his amendment. I did not refuse to accept it on the basis of political points scoring or because it was an Opposition amendment.  I refused to accept it because I believed the matter would have to be re-examined by the parliamentary draftsman.  The parliamentary draftsman is entitled to consider any legislation we are going to pass into law before it becomes part of the law.  In so far as Opposition amendments are concerned, Deputy Shatter will recognise &mdash; as he acknowledged &mdash; that many Opposition suggestions have been taken on board.  Some amendments could not be accepted as proposed and had to be redrafted.  However, many of the constructive suggestions made by both Deputies Shatter and McCartan, and Members of the Labour Party, have been taken on board.  The input of the Opposition is reflected in the Government amendments and will be reflected in the Bill when it is passed by both Houses.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has tabled this amendment which reflects the amendment put forward by the Opposition on Committee Stage on what is, as Deputy Shatter said, a relatively minor matter which nevertheless affects the operation of the Bill. The Minister has been prepared to adopt proposals and suggestions from the Opposition benches in this legislation which is regarded as a milestone in the development of our criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I advise the House that unlike a Report Stage debate, there is not the same limitation on contributions in the case of recommittal.</P>
      <P>Let me advise the House also that amendments Nos. 24, 40, and 43 are related, amendment No. 25 is an alternative to 24, and it is proposed, therefore, for discussion purposes to take amendments Nos. 1, 24, 25, 40 and 43 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 17, after &ldquo;in particular,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;any of the provisions of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 24.  The substantive amendment is amendment No. 24. Amendment No. 25 is an alternative to amendment No. 24 and amendments Nos. 1, 40 and 43 are consequential. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to discuss the substance of amendment No. 24 when we reach it.  As it is necessary to amend section 1 as a consequence of amendment No. 24 to section 12 we can discuss it in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 proposed to extend the category of witnesses who may give evidence through a live television link.  As section 12 (1) stands, the category is limited to witnesses under 17 years of age and other witnesses who are mentally handicapped.  Obviously, the trauma of having to give evidence in open court in the presence of a person <Col N="1142" /> who is accused of psychical or sexual abuse would be considerable for such people and the section makes it the norm that they should give evidence by television link.  It does this by allowing the evidence to be given in this way unless the court sees good reason to the contrary, an example of this would be where a 16 year old is accused of assaulting another 16 year old in a brawl, but, in certain cases, I can see that the evidence might be given through a television link.  The could be other cases when witnesses over 17 who are not mentally handicapped could be equally traumatised by a court appearance involving a confrontation with the accused.  I am thinking particularly of the victims of rape and other serious assaults whether of a sexual nature or otherwise. In my view it would be wrong not to provide for extending the facility to such vulnerable witnesses.  Indeed, there was support for doing so on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the giving of evidence by such witnesses through a TV link should be the norm as it is provided to be for those under 17 or mentally handicapped witnesses.  This should be left to the court to determine in each case.  The amendment provides that the leave of the court should be necessary before evidence through a television link is authorised.  In the normal situation, as provided for in the Bill, as initiated, the facility of a television link would be the norm for witnesses under 17 years of age and it would operate unless the court saw good reason to act to the contrary.</P>
    <P>When witnesses over the age of 17 are properly allowed to give evidence through the mechanism of a television link, the court must direct its mind to whether it would be appropriate to allow such witnesses to give evidence in this way; in other words it will not be automatic as the court will decide in each case.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 25, I made it clear when this amendment was being discussed on Committee Stage that the intention of the section was that in these cases of physical or sexual abuse it would be the norm to use a live television link when witnesses were under 17 <Col N="1143" /> years of age or mentally handicapped. That was also the view of the Law Reform Commission when it said that: &ldquo;The use of close circuit television should be the rule, unless the court for a special reason decides otherwise&rdquo;.  To give effect to this intention, the section speaks of evidence being given by television link in those cases unless the court sees good reason to the contrary.  That is a very clear indication to the courts of what we want them to do as a result of this legislation.  In my view it is much clearer than the interests of justice formula suggested by Deputy Shatter, although we cannot predict how these things would be interpreted.  At the end of the day the two of them may amount to the same thing.  We are following closely the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to witnesses under the age of 17 and we are trying to bring about a situation where it would be the norm that they be allowed the facility of giving evidence through a television link in these type of cases unless there is some very good reason that the court should order otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister is saying it is presumed that evidence will be given through a television link when persons are under 17 years of age but that when they are over 17 years of age the assumption is that evidence will be given in open court, unless the court gives leave for matters to be dealt with otherwise. Could the Minister explain how this procedure will actually work?  If somebody over the age of 17 is to give evidence in a case involving violence it is assumed that the evidence will be given in open court?  At what stage might an application be made that the witness should give evidence by way of television link?  Will the witness have to come into court?  Will the application be made by counsel for the State or by an independent legal representative of the witness who will have to make the case as to why the witness should not come into court or, if already in court, should not have to give evidence there?  I have no major disagreement with <Col N="1144" /> the principle but I am anxious to get it right.  It is a substantial change to make on Report Stage and we have not had a great deal of time to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually the prosecution will make application for the provision of this facility in respect of people over the age of 17 years.  That is the procedure envisaged.  There may be unusual cases in which a witness for the defence may wish to avail of this facility and the defence counsel can make application. Advance notice is required to be given to the court staff so that the equipment will be available.  The witness will have to come to court initially while the application is being made.</P>

      <P>The witness may be a person who has relevant evidence to offer on a particular incident.  There is an assumption that a person under the age of 17 may give evidence through television link.  The reason is the age of the person, who should not be distressed by the panoply of the justice system, with people wearing wigs and gowns and behaving in rather odd ways which we still seem to tolerate.</P>
      <P>This morning a group of children were touring the House with me and I was looking at the picture of Parliament in College Green in the years 1782 to 1800. I noticed that all the gentlemen there were bewigged.  I suspect that if that Parliament had continued without the interruption of the 19th century we would still be wearing wigs here as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us might rebel against it.  I can understand that a person over the age of 17 who has witnessed a sexual offence and been horrified at what has taken place may not want to be confronted by the accused in court.  The State <Col N="1145" /> is not always sensitive to the feelings of witnesses called to give evidence.  I am not a barrister and I do not practise in the area of criminal law, but I understand that State counsel often do not engage in direct discussions with the witnesses they intend to call for fear that there might be some suggestion that they could influence or coach them.  Instructions come in written form.  How will counsel acting for the State know whether it is desirable or not that a person over the age of 17 should be in court to give evidence?  Must we wait until the witness breaks down while giving evidence?  I am raising some practical questions.  The intent of the section is good but I want to tease out how it will work in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter has raised a number of very interesting practical considerations.  Rules of court can be made to cover these situations and the rules committee will be consulted.  I would assume that the prosecuting counsel would have to examine his list of witnesses and perhaps talk to various people to see whether it would be appropriate to make an application in respect of one or more of them to give evidence through television link.  The witness might feel that the trauma of appearing in open court would have a detrimental effect.  The matter might be discussed with a local general practitioner and come to light in that way.  The local Garda investigating the case would have a knowledge of the principal characters involved and they might be conscious of the fact that one of the witnesses would be vulnerable in this way.  If the Garda are convinced they have a case they will be concerned to see that it is prosecuted successfully.  They may bring the matter to the attention of State counsel.  It is a matter that requires some thought.  These are my preliminary thoughts.  Rules of court can be made to cover the workings of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be a well meaning provision that will not affect anything in practice.  We are talking about the rights of the witness.  If this possibility is <Col N="1146" /> to be open to somebody who is a witness as opposed to somebody who is the accused person, or the victim, the Minister might consider whether there should be some specific provision in the statute or by way of regulation made under it which would provide for an information leaflet to be given to witnesses in cases where the seeking of such manner of giving evidence would arise.  This would make a witness aware of the possibility of giving evidence in this way and would give some indication as to how to make such a request.  If it is to happen with the leave of the court, it would seem that the application would have to be made on the day of the court hearing unless some preliminary court application is envisaged prior to that date.  A detailed opening of the nature of the case to the judge may be required to decide whether it is appropriate or not.  The judge is the only appropriate person before whom that should happen.  This is a procedure that can only function if application is made to the trial judge.  Certainly the rules of court would have to require that if that application is made on behalf of the prosecution the defence would have to be warned in advance; and if it is being made on behalf of the defence in respect of any witness they are calling, the prosecution should be warned in advance.  I am merely raising these issues, some of which cannot be solved directly in the Bill, because they relate to rules of court. This is the first time we have had an opportunity to address this issue.  We would not do our job properly if we did not tease out some of the difficulties that could arise so that the Minister, through his Department, may consider them in advance of the Seanad debate in the context of any further new amendments that may be tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there is not a huge difference between the phraseology in amendment No. 25, which I seek to delete, &ldquo;unless the court sees good reason to the contrary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;unless the interests of justice otherwise require.&rdquo;  The rationale behind tabling that amendment and seeking to substitute the words &ldquo;unless the interests <Col N="1147" /> of justice otherwise require&rdquo; was that the interests of justice may be a somewhat broader concept, because you have to do justice not just to the person who is giving evidence but to ensure that the position of the defendant, who is innocent until proven guilty, is actually protected.  It may be purely a matter of semantics and I will not press it.  The words &ldquo;unless the court sees good reason to the contrary&rdquo; is not the type of wording which is normally put into a statute.  Very often the Law Reform Commission arrive at a proposal which we dress up into normal legislative statutory language.  In this case we seem to simply transcribe it into the Bill.  I have no major issue to raise about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's notion about an information leaflet is an extremely good one.  As he rightly said, prosecution witnesses are ignored by the State.  I will pass on that suggestion and we will do our best to implement it.  It is also envisaged that the Director of Public Prosecutions will issue guidelines to prosecuting counsel for this type of case.  In relation to the Deputy's specific query about when the application is made, I am advised that it is envisaged that the application will be made on the morning of the trial before the trial proper starts. Again, I thank the Deputy for his suggestion about the information leaflet; it is an eminently sensible one.</P>

      <P>I simply wish to signal my apologies for not being here at the outset.  The principles contained in the Bill are welcome.  I would ask the Chair to bear with me and allow me to say that the Minister of State indicated on Committee Stage that he would take on board many of the points made by both Deputy Shatter and myself.  Indeed, the Minister's response, by means of the amendments he has circulated, is very substantial and shows a recognition of the work which we as Deputies have done in the House on Committee Stage and I am very pleased with it.  The extension of the principle of a live television link for evidence by people other than those originally <Col N="1148" /> envisaged in the Bill, as contained in the Minister's amendment, is welcome and one which I support in principle and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 19, after &ldquo;districts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save no such day or days as fixed shall be later than 12 months after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill suffers the frailty that a number of Bills which we put through the House in recent years suffered.  I am repeating to some extent what I said on Committee Stage, which is that we pass legislation and people assume it is operational; but then nothing happens because either the totality of legislation or large chunks of it are said not to come into operation until appropriate ministerial orders have been made.  Hence, in the criminal law area, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, passed in December 1990 to extend the facility of genetic fingerprinting to the Garda in circumstances where someone who is a suspect in a crime is unwilling to co-operate voluntarily in genetic fingerprinting &mdash; certain provisions in that legislation can facilitate the Garda in using that technique &mdash; cannot come into force without ministerial order.  We are now approaching the end of June 1992 and the Bill is not in force because the ministerial order has not been made and we do not know when it will be made.  We were told there is an urgency about the passage of this Bill.  It is accepted on all sides of the House that worthwhile reforms are contained in this Bill in a number of important areas of our criminal law which we would all like to see brought into force fairly rapidly.  The Bill has been improved as we have gone through the legislative <Col N="1149" /> stages and will be further improved today by virtue of amendments tabled by both the Minister and by the Opposition parties, in particular by the Fine Gael Party and the Democratic Left.  Many of the Minister's amendments reflect proposals that came from those two parties on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>There was a great rush to complete Report Stage tonight and the Government wanted to guillotine it at 10.30 p.m. We on the Fine Gael side made the point that it may be possible to complete Report Stage by 10.30 p.m.  But if it had not been fully completed we did not wish the Bill to be guillotined, so we are now sitting until midnight because presumably the Government have an urgent intent to implement the legislation.  The first section of the legislation provides that Part III and section 28 will not come into operation until the necessary ministerial orders are made, but there is no &ldquo;sell-by&rdquo; date.</P>
    <P>I take the view that it is reasonable that the Minister has some time in which to make the various regulations which the legislation will require prior to it becoming operational.  I have no argument with the Minister about that.  Previously, we discussed the fact that time was required to install the video camera equipment which is necessary to implement aspects of the legislation.  I have no quibble about that.  The Minister indicated that much of this will be operational by the beginning of the new law term next October. What I do not like is a Bill that is so open-ended, where there is no guarantee that parts of it will come into force by any particular date.  From my recollection the Mental Health Act, which was passed in 1980 to reform the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 was to come into force by ministerial order, but no part or section of that Act has been brought into operation. In effect, it is now a defunct Act passed through this House 12 years ago, during which time Governments of various political shades have come in and out of office.  It has been abandoned on a lone, desolate island on which Bills that are never brought into operation are forever abandoned without sustenance or care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> I want this Bill to come into force and I want a &ldquo;sell-by&rdquo; date.  I propose that the Bill be amended to provide in page 3, line 19 after &ldquo;districts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save no such day or days as fixed shall be later than 12 months after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.  That would require that the legislation and the relevant ministerial orders become operational in full no later than 12 months from the passing of the Act.  I presume that will take us to the end of July.  On the assumption that it is the Government's intention to pass it through the Seanad in July, 12 months hence would be July 1993.  I do not think it is unreasonable to have a &ldquo;sell-by&rdquo; date of July 1993.  I would hope the Minister would make all his orders and brings into force all the relevant sections well before that date.  I want an assurance that by that date at the very least, this legislation will be in force.  I am formally proposing that amendment and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about the way in which the Bill is drafted in this regard.  It is provided that the Act shall come into effect on such day or dates as the Minister shall order.  Unfortunately, that formula is being used more and more by the Government as a device to introduce legislation by degrees or decree as economic or other exigencies permit.  In practice, that device is denying, or subventing to some degree, the democratic process of this House passing legislation.  Deputy Shatter spoke of the forensic evidence legislation.  I do not intend to give a litany of other legislation in the justice and law reform area and in other areas which include the same formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most startling of such pieces of legislation to come to mind immediately is the Child Care Act.  That legislation is a very important development in the whole area of child care.  It is an area of law within the ambit of the Minister for Health that relates closely to some of the more important provisions in this legislation that deal with the care of young children.  This Bill deals with the prosecution of those who are brought to task <Col N="1151" /> in relation to sexual offences against young people.  There is a very close relationship between the legislation.</P>
    <P>To date, one section out of the more than 100 sections that make up the Child Care Act has been brought into effect, after a period of about 18 months.  That provision is one of a very wide ranging nature that deals with the abuse of solvents. Because of the close relationship between the legislation and because of the indication I have been given in this House that the Government are not inclined to give priority to this area of law in practice, I am extremely reluctant to agree to the inclusion in this Bill of a wide-ranging power providing that the law shall come into effect as and when the Minister for Justice shall deem it appropriate or convenient.  A provision still extant in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, that deals with the tape recording of interviews of suspects in police stations is only now being examined in a very cursory way, some eight years after being passed into law.  That legislation is again closely related in that we are now dealing with the idea of introducing recording technology into the criminal justice and police investigate areas of work.  Eight years have elapsed yet the Department of Justice cannot come to terms with the provision of tape recording in Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about whether those involved in the administration of justice generally will be able to come to terms with the very innovative ideas contained in the Bill in relation to the transmission by video into the courtroom of important testimony in certain circumstances for very important trials.  One of the interesting aspects of the Bill is that it was introduced, as has been mentioned, as legislation requiring urgent attention. There is a very strict guillotine on the proceedings at midnight tonight &mdash; a guillotine that I believe may not ultimately be adequate for our purposes and I do not intend to delay unnecessarily. However, the phenomenon that has emerged in the way in which the House has dealt with the legislation so <Col N="1152" /> expeditiously is that there has not been a widespread reaction within the community at large or, more particularly, within the courts and the justice community, to its provisions.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána in one of their journals quite rightly signalled the legislation as being probably one of the most important developments in criminal evidence law.  I agree that the Bill is remarkably good legislation by and large. However, I have not yet learnt how the courts are reacting to the Bill and, more particularly, how the more conservative elements within the legal professions intend to operate, and work with, the legislation.  I know as a matter of fact that other important, innovative provisions proposed and introduced into law by the Department of Justice, or recommended by several commissions by way of report, are meeting very stout opposition from senior members of the Judiciary and the legal profession, with the result that there has been little or no progress.  One example of that would be the operation of the recommendations of the Martin Committee.</P>
    <P>Before I am able to agree to the way in which this section of the Bill is drafted I would need very clear assurances that all the trade union and professional reservations about the workability of the legislation have been dealt with by the Department.  I would like to know that the decks are entirely clear and that it is only a matter of turning on the technical switch for the legislation to become operational. If that is not the case then it may be that in a year or even later the Minister will say &mdash; as has happened with other legislation &mdash; that all practical problems have not been ironed out and that there are ongoing negotiations with trade union and labour interests, with members of the Judiciary, with personnel operating the courts and with the legal profession in relation to the way in which the legislation can be brought into play, particularly as regards the technical transmission of testimony.</P>
    <P>Although there is other legislation that could be referred to I do not consider that necessary.  I recall one Deputy this <Col N="1153" /> morning complaining that a provision in the intoxicating liquor legislation concerning the display of liquor in supermarkets has not yet been implemented, after more than four years.  The Minister of State should recognise the very real concerns that exist on this side of the House.  Our concerns are not simply fanciful or hypothetical, they are based on real experience gained in dealing with other important legislation that is closely related or parallel to this Bill.</P>
    <P>My amendment, which is being taken in conjunction with that of Deputy Shatter, specifically names a date, the first day of the Michaelmas law term of this year &mdash; in other words, the first day on which the courts resume for ordinary business after the &ldquo;long vacation&rdquo;, as they know it.  We in this House know about long vacations but often the long vacation of the legal professions is even longer than that of the House.  By and large, after the summer vacation the courts reassemble in or about the second week of October.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, said on Committee Stage that in his view the technical arrangements were well advanced, would be in place and should be tried and tested during the summer period.  I have no doubt that he will take an opportunity to update the House on those developments.  My amendment is not unreasonable in demanding that the Minister pursue the legislation in the Seanad with the same vigour as has been evident here; that the legislation be on the stocks by the end of the Seanad session, at the end of July &mdash; and there should be no difficulty there &mdash; and that the Bill be a working piece of legislation in time for the courts recess period of August, September and whatever time in October is necessary to allow for the conclusion of the technical arrangements.  My amendment seeks to provide a date.  I could live with Deputy Shatter's amendment if need be &mdash; I do not wish to take away from his views or efforts in this matter.  Deputy Shatter and I are <i>ad unum</i> in that we are simply trying to achieve a date that is fixed and to make sure that the legislation is not allowed to <Col N="1154" /> slip.  As I said, the Minister of State gave an assurance on Committee Stage that the technical arrangements were well in hand and could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>My amendment &mdash; and that of Deputy Shatter &mdash; is designed to address two other considerations.  We are trying to deal with the possibility of financial reservations rearing their head within the Department and the decision that the legislation cannot be afforded for the time being.  We are also trying to deal with the problem of people in the profession or in the administrative division of the courts deciding that there are parallel or additional issues to be examined and that such issues should be resolved in advance of the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>New technology will be brought in but suddenly people will add bargaining counters and issues with regard to work, pay and conditions as a device to push their case.  I want to strengthen the hand of the Minister of State on this debate so that when he goes back to the conservative or other agencies in this field he can say that his hands are tied because Dáil Éireann has laid down a time-scale within which this legislation must come into operation and that it will be working when the House has ordered that it should.  I do not want a repeat in this legislation of the &mdash; regrettably &mdash; often narrow repeated phenomenon of legislation being passed in the House and not being implemented by reason of this device.  Therefore, I hope that the Minister of State will accept one or other of the amendments because they are essential to the legislation working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, before another Member contributes, as I have done in the past I again want to draw your attention to the appalling conditions in this House today.  I understand that the last day when I took my jacket off, someone in the office of Public Works discovered the following day that five fans could be situated in this Chamber; since then three of them have apparently grown legs and walked out of the Chamber and we are left with two today. <Col N="1155" /> As I said previously, we are doing serious work which will keep us here until midnight. Deputy McCartan suggested that we might not finish at midnight but we are working constructively in the hope that we will finish before midnight.  Either way, I am not prepared to sit in the Chamber from now until midnight in these conditions.  Nothing will be done about conditions in this House until Deputies constantly raise them.  Through your good offices I am raising this matter and if somebody can find the other three fans I would welcome them back to the House.  I do not know whether that requires calling a division which will result in fans running in to vote.  Perhaps, in so far as you can communicate the concerns of Deputies, you might do so.  I do not have any wish to engage in further rows with you, Sir, or anyone else in regard to taking off jackets but if the heat continues in this Chamber, I will certainly be doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not augur well if legislators cannot see that the very modest electrical equipment required to give us minimum comfort is provided. What hope has the Minister of getting the various electrical appliances which will be required when this Bill is enacted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to address myself briefly to the amendments before the House because points have been made about the urgency of this legislation and the fact that it is long overdue.  People before the courts have been acquitted of serious charges &mdash; in some cases perhaps they should not have been acquitted &mdash; because of the lack of necessary evidence.  The provisions of this Bill, which are very urgently required, would ensure that people who should not be acquitted will not be acquitted in future.  I am not a legal person but I was thrown into this debate at the latter end of Committee Stage.  I do not claim to have any great <Col N="1156" /> insight to the problem, unlike my two colleagues, the spopkespersons for Fine Gael and the Democratic Left, who practise the profession.  However, I have listened very carefully to most of what was said since I came into the House and I am impressed with their arguments about the urgency and necessity of having the Bill enacted.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I should like the Minister of State to comment on whether the authorities are ready to meet the requirements of the Bill.  It is one thing for people who should have been found guilty to be acquitted but, if extreme care is not taken in relation to these provisions, something equally bad could happen, an innocent person might be found guilty.  An accused person will be at a disadvantage in trying to cross-examine their accuser and in that context the various provisions of the Bill should be implemented with the utmost care and attention.  It is important that the first cases taken under the Bill are clearly successful and that there should not be any lingering doubts about the acquittal of a person because the equipment was not tested properly and that inexperienced people were using it.  That could result in dubious verdicts being handed down.</P>
    <P>I will support the amendment provided the Minister gives an assurance that everything will be in place.  Deputy McCartan mentioned the financial implications of the Bill and I should like the Minister to comment on them.  The Department have received estimates for the cost of implementing the Bill.  Have they tendered for the equipment required?  Have training courses been provided for the staff?  If the Minister would enlighten us in regard to these matters it would help us in relation to our stand on these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made by Deputies McCartan and Shatter. However, we must compare like with like.  Deputy McCartan referred to the Child Care Bill on Committee Stage and said that only one section has been brought into operation.  Under the <Col N="1157" /> explicit terms of this legislation all the provisions of the Bill &mdash; except Part III and section 28 &mdash; will be brought into operation within three months.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Child Care Bill, in this case money has been allocated in the Estimates. Deputy McCartan mentioned the financial considerations and I take his point.  It would be most unusual, to say the least, if a Government Department failed to spend the money allocated.  The point should also be made that those parts of the Bill which will not come into effect automatically within three months are contingent on the operation of certain equipment which will have to be put in place.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that it would be undesirable if the Minister for Justice was compelled to bring into operation before a certain date legislation, parts of which were contingent on the operation of certain equipment, because through unforseen circumstances the equipment might not be in operation.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I have some good news for both Deputy McCartan and Deputy Shatter.  Their concerns about the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, can be laid to rest.  That Act was brought into operation by order as and from 5 June 1992.  I am aware that Deputy McCartan always expects to hear good news in the House from me and I fulfil his expectations again today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  While I will talk to the PR people, that is not my function.  When Deputy Shatter's amendment was discussed on Committee Stage <Col N="1158" /> I explained that I have every reason to expect that the provisions of Part III of the Bill, which deals with the giving of evidence by television link in child abuse cases, would be brought into operation by next October.  Nothing has happened in the meantime to suggest that that target will not be met and that the necessary facilities will not be installed in the Four Courts before then.  In fact, all the indications are, assuming that the Bill is enacted in the middle of July &mdash; and that is our intention &mdash; these particular provisions will be in operation so far as the Dublin areas are concerned before the other provisions of the Bill.  As I said, these do not come into force until three months after the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>However, I remain of the opinion that it would be imprudent to fax a definite limit for this part to come into operation in case some unforeseen event would delay the installation of the video equipment. If that should happen the Minister for Justice would be placed in the invidious position of having to bring these provisions into operation without the necessary facilities being available. Regrettably, for these reasons I must again decline to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Since Committee Stage debate tenders have been received, demonstrations have been arranged to which representatives of the legal profession have been invited and the systems in operation in the United Kingdom have been inspected.  A decision on the tender to be accepted &mdash; I understand that the number of applicants has been reduced to three or four &mdash; may be made within the next week to ten days.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that on Committee Stage Deputy McCartan was satisfied to propose a limit of six months.  According to the record, he would be willing to concede to Deputy Shatter's proposition of 12 months and &ldquo;would even agree to a longer period provided an emphatic and clear date is laid down for implementation of the legislation&rdquo;.  The date which Deputy McCartan now proposes for implementation is the first day of the next term, which will probably be less than three months after the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>He has also proposed that sections 12 to 15, which deal with the giving of evidence by television link, must be brought into operation in every Circuit and District Court circuit, but this will not be possible.  On Committee Stage I dealt with the position in the Dublin area; but, as the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Bill, proceedings may, on application, be transferred.  As I have explained, I fully expect that the necessary equipment will be installed in the Four Courts by 1 October next, but I have to be honest and say that it will take some time before the facilities can be made generally available.  That is the reason provision is being made for the transfer of proceedings.  Nevertheless, my remarks on Committee Stage about the installation of equipment in courts in other parts of the country still stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The last sentence uttered by the Minister of State is the source of major concern.  He stated that it will take some time to install equipment in other parts of the country.  The difficulty is that the Department of Justice is situated in Dublin and we are Dublin orientated. Having regard to the fact that the proceedings we are talking about are sensitive and difficult, victims and witnesses should not be required to travel from one end of Ireland to the other, from Kerry and Donegal to Dublin, for a court hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see why we cannot address these problems in other parts of the country also.  Deputy McCartan's intentions and my own are no different and it comes down to a question of ensuring that the matter will be dealt with by a reasonable date.  However, I accept what the Minister has to say: that it may not be possible to have this equipment in place by the Michaelmas term and that one may want two or three months after <Col N="1160" /> it has been installed in Dublin to make sure that there are no snags in the system if we are to install it elsewhere.  It would seem that a 12 month period is more than adequate and would be of assistance to the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I see, Sir, that I am going to get my own fan.  I hope the other Deputies in the House will be able to avail of the same facility.  No doubt our own public relations people would warn us about what it would do to our hairstyles for the television cameras, but I am sanguine enough to know that it is probable that no one will watch this.  Indeed, RTE may not relay any of it.</P>
      <P>However, the point I was going to make was that if we insert this figure of 12 months in the Bill the Minister of State will be able to insist when the Estimates meetings take place in the autumn that funding be made available to ensure that these facilities are provided nationally in each of the Circuit Court districts.  To be fair to the people we have in mind in the context of Part III of the legislation &mdash; I am sorry, Sir.  I cannot help but smile because it seems the protest worked.</P>

I was going to say that it would be of help to the Minister of State if this provision were included in the Bill because he would then have a statutory duty to provide these facilities within 12 months and to ensure that the money is made available.  Like the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which Deputy McCartan mentioned, we will install facilities in Killarney and in Dublin and then sit back and look at them and cases will be transferred <Col N="1161" /> for years willy nilly without facilities being installed elsewhere.  To ensure that the Bill functions properly and that unnecessary distress is not caused to people as a result of cases being transferred from one part of the country to Dublin, it is my intention to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 23, after &ldquo;concerned.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The institution of proceedings shall be deemed to have occurred when a charge is laid or a summons is returned to court duly served in accordance with the law.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am happy to withdraw my amendment No. 4 in favour of what the Minister proposes and to repeat in the same spirit what I said earlier, that it is one of the amendments on which the Minister undertook on Committee Stage to have regard to the points made.  He has come back with a much better drafted and better reasoned amendment in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one point I would like to make at this stage is to ask again through the Minister of State or through our deliberations here that a clear signal go out to all parties who would be concerned.  I am <Col N="1165" /> not suggesting there is a great number of cases but I am particularly aware of one on which the Minister and his Department have received representations and submissions on the legislation.  With the lifting of this anachronistic legal requirement of corroboration there is a possibility that a number of investigations that have already been made by An Garda Síochána into allegations of sexual abuse of women or of child sexual abuse may now be reviewed or re-examined.  Some people out there in the community whose children or who themselves have been injured or insulted in the grossest possible way by sexual attack or abuse have made complaint and that complaint could not have been processed or developed because of the absence of this phenomenon known as corroboration, some tangible independent evidence in support of their complaint.  For them this is a very progressive element of the legislation.  It was desirable that the Bill defined the commencement of proceedings for the purposes of ensuring that matters that had simply been investigated by An Garda Síochána and did not lead to the institution of proceedings could be reopened and reviewed in the light of the very innovative and important development in this legislation of the removal of the need for corroboration.</P>
    <P>It is a welcome development.  The Minister's amendment is more effective than my amendment No. 4.  I thank the Minister for that.  I withdraw No. 4 and I will be happy to accept amendment No. 5.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) criminal proceedings are instituted&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  when a summons or warrant of arrest is issued in respect of an offence,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  when a person is arrested without a warrant, or <Col N="1166" /> (iii)  when a person is remanded for trial pursuant to section 177 or 178 (as amended by section 3 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1987) of the Defence Act, 1954.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan is quite right in saying that in certain cases where a prosecution could not have taken place because of the lack of corroboration, a prosecution could not be taken.  I do not know whom precisely Deputy McCartan wants us to communicate with in this regard but I have just been reminded that, while this Bill is extremely important &mdash; as somebody said, a landmark &mdash; in the law of criminal evidence, the newspaper reports of these debates have tended to be very scanty indeed.  Perhaps the press should take note that this section as amended opens up this very important and interesting possibility.</P>
    <P>I am moving amendment No. 5 as a result of an amendment put down by Deputy McCartan on Committee Stage, which he has now retabled but has just withdrawn.</P>
    <P>He was anxious that it be made clear that the institution of proceedings for the purposes of section 1 (4) of the Bill did not include the preliminary investigation carried out by the Garda Síochána.  He was supported in this by Deputy Taylor. Section 1 (4) provides that, apart from certain provisions, the Bill will not apply to criminal proceedings instituted before it comes into operation.</P>
    <P>The effect of my amendment is that for this purpose criminal proceedings will only be regarded as instituted when a summons or warrant of arrest is issued or a person is arrested without a warrant.  It also applies to a person subject to military law when he is remanded for trial by court martial.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment adequately meets the case made by Deputy McCartan and Deputy Taylor.  It provides the necessary degree of certainty as to precisely when proceedings are instituted in the context of this subsection, which is of course a transitional provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. <Col N="1167" /> I hope that serious cases of sexual abuse which took place some time ago and which were not pursued by the commencement of criminal proceedings due to the difficulties which have been described already, and where there is now a possibility of a prosecution proceeding, will be looked at.  Of course, this will require the Director of Public Prosecutions to examine old files sitting on his desk or in filing cabinets.  For each old file not pursued in that way there is someone who has been very seriously wronged and there is a perpetrator of that wrong.  This is an important provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there are great difficulties in the way this Parliament is functioning and the way the proceedings are reported.  All politicians think that every word they utter is a sort of pearl of wisdom which deserves huge headlines.  However, when we all stand back from it we realise we said an awful lot we did not need to say or which did not merit reportage.  This Bill is very important in the area of criminal law, in addressing cases of sexual offences, in dealing with child sexual abuse and the prosecution of those who are responsible for it and in a number of other areas also. I must say I am utterly astonished that much of the proceedings on this Bill have received little or no reportage.  It seems that the national papers have virtually given up on giving decent coverage to anything this House does beyond the Second Stage debate on Bills.  This is unfortunate in a democracy because if the main national newspapers decide <i>en bloc</i> that when Committee and Report Stages of most Bills are being dealt with there is no need to either put in reporters or cover the very important matters which are being discussed, it means the general public do not know about the changes which are taking place.  This is wrong.  I would exclude one newspaper from that criticism, <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, a paper which has a very individual approach to Dáil reports and which is far more comprehensive in its coverage than all the other papers, some of which purport <Col N="1168" /> to keep a daily record of events in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not expect much of what we say here today to get much reportage.  I am not worried about reportage for the sake of what politicians are doing for self-serving reasons.  We need reportage so that the general public, and professionals who work in the relevant areas, are aware of the changes that Parliament is making to the laws of the land in areas of substantial importance.  I do not know how we can deal with this problem.  The appallingly poor coverage given by RTE to the proceedings of this House does not address the problem.  The lunacy of a Dáil Report which usually takes place at 12 midnight or which is given two minutes on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; is not the way to cover the proceedings of Parliament.  We should also bear in mind that for years RTE banged on the door of this Parliament seeking permission to cover the proceedings.  They are not using this footage in a way which I believe would be beneficial to the general public in understanding the workings of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he did not know with whom his Department should communicate.  I believe people who have been aggrieved in the past by the rule of corroboration and who did not successfully convince the Garda Síochána or the Director of Public Prosecutions that prosecutions should be initiated, are keeping a reasonably close eye on the debate on this legislation.  This issue could be addressed if the Minister's Department wrote to the Garda superintendent in each district asking him to advise his members to look at their more recent files to see whether they should get in contact with complainants because of the change in the evidential rules obtaining in this whole area.  Sexual abuse and, in particular, child sexual abuse, are such heinous crimes that they merit this kind of review.  If there are files in Garda stations which could not be processed because of the anachronistic requirement for corroboration then the Garda Síochána should be requested to go back to the complainants and their <Col N="1169" /> families, interview and advise them and let them decide whether the case should be reopened.  This is one way of dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>I put forward this suggestion because recently I read in a Garda Síochána journal a request that a provision in the malicious damage code passed by this House would impact on the workings of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  They complained that no one had told them what had gone on in the House in regard to this Act.  The Garda Síochána did not monitor the deliberations of this House and the Seanad in regard to the fundamental changes introduced in our criminal law in this area.  As Deputy Shatter and the Minister said, perhaps some of the fault for this lies with the rather inadequate reporting of these matters in our national newspapers.  It would seem desirable as a matter of course for a memorandum to be sent by the Department to the Garda Commissioner or the Garda Superintendent in each district advising them about the passing of the legislation and its impact. In the case of this narrow issue, I ask the Minister to ask the Garda Superintendent in each district to re-examine their files to see if any cases could not be prosecuted because of the requirement for corroboration. These files should be re-examined to see whether in the interests of justice and the interests of all concerned the cases can be re-opened.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their support for this amendment.  I stand over what I said about the inadequate reporting of the proceedings of this House.  I appreciate the points made by Deputy Shatter in support of what I said.  Deputy McCartan suggested that we should write to Garda Superintendents asking them to look at their files.  I should point out that I have no power to order Gardaí to do this, that or the other in that respect; it is a matter for them.  He also suggested that the changes could be brought to the attention of the Gardaí possibly through the Garda Commissioner's office.  I will bring that suggestion to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <Col N="1170" /> Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>I page 4, line 29, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any other Act involved in a criminal prosecution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue on Committee Stage.  I re-entered this amendment in order to get the views of the Minister of State on it.  As I said on Committee Stage, in criminal proceedings, particularly under the 1908 Children Act, problems can arise in relation to a person's age.  On many occasions courts have great difficulty in trying to establish the age of people who appear before them, particularly young people.  A person's age can have a fundamental impact on the way a court deals with an offender.  For that reason I had suggested that this subsection, which allows the court to make certain inferences with regard to the age of a person appearing before it, and more particularly, which casts the burden onto the shoulders of the person against whom the finding of age is made to prove it otherwise, should be extended to apply generally, to any other Act involved in a criminal prosecution.  The Minister agreed to consider the matter for Report Stage.  I am simply re-entering the amendment to hear the Minister's reason why it is unnecessary at this stage, which I infer from the fact that he has not tabled an amendment in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is repetition of an amendment tabled by Deputy McCartan on Committee Stage.  On reading my own response on Committee Stage I think I was mistaken.  Deputy Taylor, from the Labour Party, made the point that the section dealing with documentary evidence relates to every type of criminal offence and not just sexual offences or offences involving violence.  I was seduced by the attractiveness of Deputy Taylor's argument.  On reflection it seems that the provision in subsection (3), which provides a presumption that a person's age is to be the age which he or she appears to the court to be, relates only <Col N="1171" /> to the giving of evidence by young witnesses. That is because the question of age does not relate to the Part concerning documentary evidence.  The provision will operate only in relation to the giving of evidence by under 17 years olds by live TV link, the admissibility of out-of-court video recorded interviews with under 14 year old victims and the giving of unsworn evidence by under 14 year olds pursuant to section 26.  If we were to accept Deputy McCartan's amendment we would be extending the presumption generally and that would include young persons who are accused of offences.</P>
      <P>At present under section 123 (1) of the Children Act, 1908, the court must make due inquiry as to the age of the child or young person coming before it.  It has been held that evidence of age given during the inquiry must be given on oath. This is because the object of the Act was to protect children and young persons from the full rigour of the criminal law in so far as punishments are concerned.  It would be therefore undesirable to extend this provision in the way proposed and for those reasons I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is a little disappointing.  I advanced this amendment as a result of my experience of the way in which the interests of justice have been set at nought or played games with by people who refuse to admit to their age either to the investigating officer or to the court under examination when due inquiry was being made.  This provision is a very useful one which puts the onus on a person to disprove a presumption made by a court with regard to age.  It is particularly relevant where a person has been convicted by the court and is to stand for sentence.  In the balance of fairness between one interest and another, where a person is convicted different considerations would apply. This presumption would not be called in aid by the court in order to secure the conviction but would flow after the conviction had been recorded.  The person <Col N="1172" /> therefore would no longer stand as an innocent person in the dock.</P>
      <P>This amendment would have been a very useful and sensible one to have included in the Bill.  I have no doubt that the courts and the Garda Síochána would have found it of great assistance in operating the provisions of section 123 of the 1908 Act which is used most often in this area.  I have made my case and the Minister has not accepted it.  Therefore, I ask that the question be put.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 8, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall include any records of the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages as established&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important matter.  The Miniser of State has kept his word that he would consider this matter carefully and come back to the House with an amendment. I am happy he has addressed the concerns I expressed on Committee Stage, which arose directly from the unbelievable circumstances surrounding the celebrated Waterford case in which the court was unable to establish the parentage of the defendant to the victim despite all other elements of the case having been established in evidence.  The case was withdrawn because this fact could not be established other than by calling the mother of the victim who was not available as a witness at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The glaring injustice that arose from that case was advanced by the Minister for Justice in introducing this legislation on Second Stage.  It concerned me that there was nothing in the Bill as drafted to deal with that situation.  For that reason I <Col N="1173" /> proposed an amendment on Committee Stage, which I have put down again here, that the proof by documentation under Part II of the Bill would include any records of the Registry of Birth, Deaths and Marriages as established.  In other words, the provisions of Part II of the Bill which allow for proof of fact by production of documentary evidence would include evidence of statements contained in the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages as maintained by the various health boards under the Department of Health.  If that was provided for in the legislation it would address the situation the Minister for Justice had ingeniously suggested was already covered in the legislation.  I do not believe it was.  I made that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, and the Department, have responded very reasonably to the issues raised on Committee Stage. Deputy Shatter brought the argument a step further.  He was concerned as to what inferences the court would be allowed to draw from the written record and suggested that it was important that a court be entitled to presume the correctness of the record produced from the register of births, marriages and deaths.  I accept that the simple production of a register of births which carried references to parentage would in itself not be sufficient. My amendment does not go far enough in that respect.  I accept that one would have to allow the court to presume that what was recorded at birth in the register would raise questions of presumption in the minds of the court and the jury and it would be a matter again for the defendant to deny what presumably was a matter of record.  For that reason, I accept in principle the concerns raised by Deputy Shatter in his amendment. Subject to hearing finer arguments on the matter I will be happy to withdraw my amendment at the conclusion of this debate in favour of amendment No. 10 advanced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to listen carefully to the arguments advanced and consider Deputy Shatter's amendment.  On the conclusion of this debate I would like to see agreement that the amendments <Col N="1174" /> reflect the concern of all in the House that the type of situation that emerged in the Waterford incest case, which was an extremely ridiculous injustice, will never recur.  I am not concerned about whose amendment is accepted to achieve that. When we move on from this area of the Bill I want to know that we have copperfastened the law so that this preposterous scenario will never re-emerge in any court proceedings here.  The result of those proceedings was a very black day for criminal justice generally and the capacity of this State to deal with a very heinous sad state of affairs.  I await the contributions of the Minister, Deputy Shatter and others before we make the final decision on what combination of proposals should be adopted by the House.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister in tabling his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 is being taken in conjunction with amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 16 to 22 inclusive.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall the long discussion we had on Committee Stage arising from the disquiet felt on all sides of the House at the outcome of the proceedings in the Waterford incest case.</P>
      <P>Deputies McCartan and Shatter each tabled amendments on that Stage aimed at simplifying the proof of paternity in such cases.  I undertook to bring forward an amendment on this Stage to give effect to the general wish of the House in this respect, though in my view, the situation is already provided for in section 5 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment I am now moving will be acceptable generally.  First, it specifically makes a birth certificate evidence of parentage.  So it avoids the necessity for proving that the conditions of admissibility specified in section 5 (1) have been complied with.  Second, it does not contain any presumption that the certificate is evidence of parentage until the contrary is proved.  I am reluctant to impose on an accused person a burden of proving the contrary, especially in this context. Deputy Shatter has proposed an amendment to my amendment providing specifically for a presumption, though not a presumption until the contrary is proved, <Col N="1175" /> but I am not clear that it is necessary to do so seeing that the birth certificate is being made evidence of the relationship in question.</P>
    <P>My amendment makes a birth certificate evidence that the person named in the certificate as father or mother is the father or the mother of the person to whom the certificate relates.  It is necessary to include a reference to the mother as this would be relevant in establishing the relationship between a maternal grandfather and his grandchild in a case of alleged incest involving a grandfather.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendments Nos. 16 to 22, inclusive, which are related, the new sections proposed to be inserted by Deputy Shatter deal with the taking of blood tests to assist a criminal court in determining paternity.  Since this proposal was discussed on Committee Stage the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990 has been brought into operiation. That Act enables a blood sample to be taken from persons in custody under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939 or section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  The consent, in writing, of the person concerned is necessary, but if it is refused without good cause an inference from such refusal may be drawn in any subsequent proceedings.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the situation which the Deputy was providing for on Committee Stage has now been adequately dealt with by the bringing into operation of the 1990 Act in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably one of the more important, if not the most important, provision with which we are dealing on Report Stage.  As Deputy McCartan, and the Minister, stated there was substantial concern about the Waterford incest case in which charges were dismissed because a birth certificate was not regarded as sufficient to establish even a <i>prima facie</i> case for paternity.  It was a matter of some seriousness because the charges laid were given a great deal of public prominence and there was serious <Col N="1176" /> concern that such charges would not be brought in the future if the law was not adequately changed.</P>
      <P>In relation to this matter, substantial amendments were tabled on Committee Stage and on Second Stage I raised the difficulty with the Minister's approach, when the Minister seemed to suggest that the Bill already adequately addressed the issue.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has now brought forward an amendment which will ensure that a birth certificate can be produced and that the document will be evidence of the relationship admissible in criminal procedings.  I am concerned that this does not go far enough.  We have to recall that this arose from a case of incest, where someone who was alleged to be the father of the child was living with the mother of the child.  They were a married couple and the name of the alleged father appeared on the birth certificate.  The parties had apparently lived for many years as husband and wife, mother, father and child. It seemed incomprehensible to the general public that the father simply denied that he was the father, or his lawyers simply denied that he was the father and he never had to give evidence and that difficulties would arise in establishing the patnerity of the child.</P>

    <P>The Minister's amendment will allow for the production of the certificate as evidence and it stops there.  If a person who was the alleged victim of incest describes to the court the nature of the behaviour that took place, the evidence of the birth certificate will at least mean that the person who was alleged to be the father has a case to answer.  My concern is for the case where he simply says, &ldquo;yes, my name is on the certificate, but I do not know how it got there&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not accept that I am the father&rdquo;.  A criminal case has to establish the position beyond a reasonable doubt.  I am concerned that this Bill should be consistent with the legislation that is already enacted.  In the context that amendment No. 10 should be accepted &mdash; let me way that I will now be discussing or pursuing amendment No. 12 in my name because it will now be irrelevant &mdash; I suggest that this amendment <Col N="1177" /> should itself be amended.  The amendment as presented by the Minister reads:</P>
    <P>In page 6, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  Without a prejudice to subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where a document purports to be a birth certificate issued in pursuance of the Birth and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a person is named therein as father or mother of the person to whose birth the certificate relates,</P>
    <P>the document shall be admissible in many criminal proceedings as evidence of the relationship indicated therein.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I suggest that after subsection (b) we insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such persons shall be presumed to be the father or the mother of the person to whose birth the certificate relates unless the contrary is satisfactorily proved and the document shall be admissible in any criminal proceedings as evidence of such relationship.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The difference between what the Minister and I are proposing is that once the certificate is produced it will be presumed that the person named therein is the father.  Let us assume we are talking about a case of incest and an onus would now rest on the father or the person alleged to be the father to disprove that. It would not be mere evidence.  To suggest it is mere evidence would mean that there is a further onus on the prosecution to bring forward further or additional evidence.  I do not believe that mere evidence is sufficient.  I believe that this presumption should arise.  It would seem to me that there are mechanisms available by which someone can rebut the presumption, and I will come back to the role of genetic fingerprinting in this context in a moment.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is not particularly exceptional and, indeed, it is part of current law anyway.  I wonder whether this provision in the legislation was brought <Col N="1178" /> to the notice of the court in the criminal prosecution case in Waterford?  To illustrate my point I suggest that the Minister looks at Part VIII of the Status of Children Act, 1987.  Section 46 contains various new legal presumptions of paternity and non-paternity in a variety of different circumstances as they arise. I do not wish to detain the House by reading the section in full but subsection (3) is particularly relevant:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, where&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I can assure the Minister that subsection (1) is not of immediate relevance to the overall meaning of what is stated here&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The birth of a child is registered in a register maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1863 to 1987, and</P>
    <P>(b)  The name of a person is entered as the father of the child on the register so maintained,</P>
    <P>then the person whose name is so entered shall be presumed to be the father of the child unless the contrary is proved on the balance of probabilities.</P>
    <P>That presumption in relation to paternity is part of our law and is contained in Part VIII which concerns Presumptions and Evidential Provisions of the Status of Children Act, 1987.  My point is that that provision is not de-limited by the Act as applying only to civil proceedings.  It seems to me that this Part is a general provision in relation to presumptions concerning parenthood.  Once we establish that the birth certificate is admissible as evidence it seems that under the provisions of section 46 if someone is alleged to be the father of a child there is a presumption that will become part of the criminal law in this context.</P>
    <P>I am trying to ensure that the legal provisions that should apply in a criminal evidence Bill are all contained in the one statute, as that is desirable.  It is undesirable that there be a doubt about the presumption existing.  If the presumption which appears to become part of the law <Col N="1179" /> automatically by virtue of the provision in the Status of Children Act, 1987, I fail to see why the Minister should object to my substitute amendment to amendment No. 10.  I can see some lawyer or barrister arguing the point that the 1987 Act had to do with the status of children and has nothing to do with criminal law or criminal evidence, but I do not believe that that is the case.  The fact that this provision is contained in this legislation &mdash; with all due respect to the Minister &mdash; undermines any objection that he could have to my amendment.  Let me emphasise that I am not saying this to score points.  I think this amendment is desirable, as it is desirable to establish a presumption.</P>
    <P>People do not find their names appearing on a birth certificate by accident, they appear for good reason.  Because a birth certificate is a document of record, it is quite reasonable that the record give rise to the presumption that whoever is named as the father or mother is in fact the father or mother and there is an onus on them to rebut that.  I think, in fact, this arises under section 46.  It may be the case that criminal lawyers who are prosecuting such cases are not familiar with the provisions of section 46 of the Status of Children Act, and if the Minister's amendment which does not contain this presumption is accepted, this may give rise to a great deal of debate and confusion.  We should try to rid the Bill of this confusion.  In view of the fact that there are reliable scientific methods to prove or disprove paternity, it does not put a huge burden on a person charged with the offence of incest to prove or disprove paternity when the court assumes he is the father of the child with whom this offence has been committed when his name appears on the birth certificate.</P>
    <P>In the context of another provision in this Bill I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the unexceptional wording of this amendment.  A few moments ago we were debating section 2 (3) &mdash; where there is a provision about the age of the person &mdash; and it states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Where in any criminal proceedings the age of a person at any time is material for the purposes of any provision of this Act, his age at that time shall for the purposes of that provision be deemed, unless the contrary is proved, to be or to have been that which appears to the court to be or to have been his age at that time</P>
    <P>The words used here are &ldquo;unless the contrary is proved&rdquo; while I use the words &ldquo;unless the contrary is satisfactorily proved&rdquo; and I am not sure if there is any functional difference between the two and this establishes that we are creating presumptions in the Act, because this is a presumption about age, whereas I am making a presumption about paternity which might in fact be a bit more reliable. If we judge someone from their stature and their size, what they look like, surely that is far more dangerous than simply looking at a birth certificate and judging whether the person is a parent because they are named as the parent of the child.</P>
    <P>I welcome the constructive attitude the Minister has taken in this amendment to the concerns we have expressed on this Bill and I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to address that.  However, I am anxious that we address it correctly. My point is that if the Minister's amendment is accepted, section 46 of the Status of Children Act will have this application in any case but I think it is as well that we insert my substitute amendment to amendment No. 10 in the Criminal Evidence Bill so that the law is clear and that we do not confuse the issue by giving rise to opportunities for legal debate on what is a hugely important issue.</P>
    <P>I never want to see again a case of incest coming before our courts in which someone escapes from having to give evidence in the witness box by a technicality similar to that which arose in the Waterford case.  I am concerned that simply saying that producing a birth certificate will provide evidence is not sufficient to put an onus on the defendant to, in fact, give evidence.  It may simply be evidence and any counsel could make the submission, without the defendant or the <Col N="1181" /> accused going into the witness box, that this is evidence but there is no other evidence of paternity and this does not mean there is a case to answer.  If we make this a presumption it ensures there is a case to answer and it appears that the presumption may arise anyway because of the Status of Children Act.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with the new Part III which I propose should be inserted in the Bill.  I do not intend to delay the House by reading into the record the lengthy amendment relating to blood tests in determining parentage in criminal proceedings as it was read into the record on Committee Stage on my behalf by Deputy Cotter and is contained in the Official Report of Tuesday, 26 May 1992, commencing at column 439.</P>
    <P>There were two reasons for proposing that amendment.  One reason was to draw attention to the fact that the forensic evidence legislation was not operational. I am pleased to hear that it has now been brought into operation, but that does not obviate the necessity for this provision. This is a different provision from that in the Forensic Evidence Act.  That Act allows the Garda where they have reasonable cause to suspect that somebody has committed a particular type of offence, to request that person to co-operate in genetic fingerprinting.  If the person, without reasonable cause, fails to comply with that request, certain conclusions may be drawn.  The Garda may have a birth certificate and they may bring a charge of incest against the person named on that birth certificate for having relations with his daughter.  The person charged may say nothing or may simply say he is not guilty.  The Garda bring the case to court.</P>
    <P>The Forensic Evidence Act operates as a pre-trial Act, used when there is reasonable cause to suspect.  It may be used even before a decision is made to commence proceedings.  There may be a belief that there is not sufficient evidence to commence proceedings without invoking that legislation.  The case goes to court and the birth certificate is produced.  The person alleged on the birth certificate to <Col N="1182" /> be the father of the child claims that he is not the father.  Under the Minister's provision, a presumption does not even arise.  The court has two contrary pieces of evidence.  Let us say that in this case the mother is dead and cannot be called to give evidence either as a competent or as a compellable witness.  In the absence of a presumption, the court would have difficulty in securing a conviction because it might prove impossible to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the man is the father.  The Garda cannot call the man out of the witness box and ask him to give a blood sample or a tissue sample.</P>
    <P>Where parentage is an issue that comes before the court the man may say he wants an opportunity to prove he is not the father.  This may be relevant in the context of offences other than incest. Provision should be made to allow the judge to make a judicial order for the carrying out of tests.  That is different from co-operating with the Garda.  The trial judge hears conflicting evidence and decides that the only way to resolve the issue is by the use of the scientific technique of genetic fingerprinting.  The relevant court order can be made for samples to be taken.  The trial can be adjourned and continued after the results have been obtained.  If the person does not co-operate in the taking of blood tests, such failure may be treated as corroboration of the presumption of parentage. This brings into the criminal area provisions identical to those in the civil area where an issue of parentage arises. These provisions are taken directly from Part VII of the Status of Children Act and adapted to criminal proceedings.  They have worked extremely well.  Those sections have been tested as far as the Supreme Court in a case in which I was involved.  The Supreme Court confirmed a High Court direction for the taking of samples.</P>
    <P>Circumstances can arise within a trial which can merit the court having powers in a criminal trial to ask that blood samples be taken when before the trial there may not have appeared to be a need for the Garda to invoke the provisions of the Forensic Evidence Act.  That is why this <Col N="1183" /> provision may be useful.  It may not be used frequently, but it is important that it be there.  It would interact in an important way with the other amendments we wish to bring in.  If we give the courts power to make such orders in civil proceedings, I see no difficulty in allowing them to make such orders in criminal proceedings.  The order does not put undue pressure on the accused; it is designed to help the court to get at the truth in cases which may be extremely sensitive and difficult.</P>
    <P>The intent of this proposal has been somewhat misunderstood.  My reading is that there is not a total overlap between it and the forensic evidence legislation. Use of the Forensic Evidence Act pre-trial could in a number of instances make this provision redundant, but in other circumstances it could be a vital statutory power given to a judge to help ensure that truth is ascertained.  It could ensure that those people who have committed offences and should be convicted are properly convicted.  On the other hand, it would provide a mechanism which would ensure that where somebody has not committed an offence but allegations have been made which present a substantial body of plausible evidence, there is a means of establishing the truth with regard to the parentage of a child.  I appreciate that this part of the Bill is complicated but it is no more complicated than what was done in the civil area in legislation on the status of children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister has put down his own amendment in response to concern expressed in the context of the Waterford case, which was widely discussed in the House.  The Minister said at the time that hard cases make bad law.  He would do well to take account of the well-argued case put forward by Deputy Shatter, which is wholly consistent with making sure that this Bill will perform in the court as intended. The amendment to amendment No. 10 is logical.  It provides an additional definition which tidies up that part of the Bill <Col N="1184" /> and removes any doubts as to how that section might be interpreted.</P>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Shatter's reasoning on amendments Nos. 16 to 22, inclusive, how the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act is intended to be applied and the fact that in the course of a trial an individual could make a simple statement which could throw the whole trial into chaos and could mean that the court would not have the power at that stage to get conclusive proof of a particular fact and would have to leave it to a jury to assess from flimsy evidence who may be telling the truth or otherwise, it seems to me to be extremely compelling that the Deputy's Part III, amendments Nos. 16 to 22 inclusive, should also be included.  I would ask the Minister to take plenty of time to consider these amendments. The expertise we have in this Chamber is laudable and the manner in which this Bill has been handled to date is laudable.  Most of the time the Minister of State has been reasonable.  Occasionally he loses his cool a little when somebody like myself persisted in trying to understand the full implications of a particular section, but that is understandable. He has decided to come a certain distance by means of this amendment. I request that he examine very carefully the compelling arguments put forward by Deputy Shatter in regard to incest cases.  I assume from all the evidence we are gathering that these cases will become more numerous.  Some interesting evidence was given last week by the ISPCC to the effect that the number of calls being received on Childline are double the number of calls received last year.  I do not suggest the incidence is increasing, but rather that the reporting of these cases has increased dramatically since 1984 and will continue to do so.  Therefore, the courts will be dealing with more and more very difficult and awkward cases in this area.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that this Bill is watertight and that the courts have the ability to deal with the eventualities that may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it was a good idea to extend the time required for the debate.  If the <Col N="1185" /> Minister is not satisfied that we can deal with this matter this evening &mdash; and, as a layman, I find it very complex legislation; even the experts differ &mdash; further time might be necessary on another day to come to grips with these matters and in order to reach agreement.  The Minister has been willing, throughout the debate, to take into account all the arguments made.  I hope that by the time we are finished the Act will have the hallmark of the expertise that has gone into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments advanced by the Minister of State in support of his amendment do not deal adequately with the matter.  I have indicated that I have no hesitation in withdrawing amendment No. 7 in favour of amendment No. 10 in the name of the Minister.  He has dealt fairly with the general concerns that birth certificates should be given a particular status, but I presume marriage certificates are covered by the legislation.  Only births and deaths registration Acts are referred to, but on occasion issues of marriage can also arise.  I want to be assured that they are included in that legislation.</P>
      <P>I realise we are on the final Stages of the legislation and that under Standing Orders the Minister does not have a right to reply.  Nonetheless, I would urge, if he is not in a position to accept Deputy Shatter's amendment to amendment No. 10, to review the matter again so that when this legislation is considered in the Seanad some progress could be made on it there.  The view advanced by Deputy Shatter must be given serious consideration. The first real consideration is that of consistency.  It is important that the legislative provision in the Status of Children Act, referred to by Deputy Shatter, should be consistent with what we provide in this legislation.  It will give rise to very substantial confusion and debate if there is one provision in that Act and a separate provision in this legislation. The provision should be consistent with that already provided for in an earlier section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (3) is part of the Bill because we recognise that documents of public <Col N="1186" /> record as maintained by State agencies under the provisions of the births and deaths registration Acts and otherwise have a certain status.  They are compiled by the keepers of those records under very strict conditions and they carry authority. For that reason when one comes to deal with the issue of age under this legislation the Minister should have no hesitation in recognising that fact and allow a certain presumption to arise from the face of the document, as provided for under section 2 (3).</P>
    <P>There should be a certain degree of consistency in dealing with these issues. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he use the precise language he used in section 2 (3) &ldquo;unless the contrary is proved&rdquo;.  The issue is important from the point of view of consistency with what is provided earlier in the Bill and also in other legislation in the area.  It is also important from the point of view of ultimate proof and the successful prosecution of matters before the courts.  It is important that the status of these documents be recognised for what they are; they have authority and can be produced as proper proof.  The proposal here is that that authority and proof stand until someone says otherwise.</P>
    <P>We must be sensible about this.  It is inconceivable that a record of birth could be made without the knowledge of any party named on the document.  There is no way that a record of birth, or, indeed, a record of marriage or of death, could be produced or maintained without the people concerned knowing about it.  As a matter of commonsense, we have to recognise the prospect as the law stands. It may well emerge, even with the Minister's amendment, that a person who has allowed his name as the father to remain on a register of birth for a number of years could in effect deny the content of that record should it be produced by remaining mute in a criminal trial when it becomes a matter of convenience.  In these circumstances it is not unreasonable and does not throw an unbearable onus onto the defendant's shoulders if he or she wishes to deny what is a matter of public record, and one that has stood for <Col N="1187" /> a considerable time with the full knowledge of the parties concerned.  He or she should be obliged to bring to the satisfaction of the court some reason that the court might reject the public record. That is all the amendment suggests.  I support Deputy Shatter's view.  I do not believe the amendment would cast the unbearable onus referred to by the Minister in all circumstances.  As a matter of consistency the House is almost compelled, if not obliged, to accept the amendment.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;or examination&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, examination or analysis&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment, suggested as a result of the discussions on Committee Stage, on the meaning of the term &ldquo;examination&rdquo; in the context of section 5 (4) (b) (iv).  In the particular context to which this amendment is confined, that is, the handling of articles constituting evidence, it might be argued that forensic analysis, say of a substance suspected of being a drug, would not be covered by the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; used in the present text of section 5 (4) (b) (iii).  The amendment makes it clear that documents relating to the analysis of exhibits will be admissible as evidence in criminal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment No. 9 is a related amendment.  I undertook to examine a point made by Deputy McCartan when he moved this amendment on Committee Stage.  The Deputy questioned whether the taking of a blood or urine sample by a doctor from a driver under the Road Traffic Acts would be an examination in the sense in which it <Col N="1188" /> occurs in section 5 (4) (b) (iv), which is, &ldquo;a record by a registered medical practitioner of an examination of a living or dead person&rdquo;.  On reflection, I think it is doubtful if it is.  As a result of the Deputy raising this matter we have looked again at section 5 (4) (b) (iii), which deals with the admissibility of a record of &ldquo;the receipt, handling, transmission or examination&rdquo; of any evidence.  A doubt must exist as to whether &ldquo;examination&rdquo; would be an adequate term to describe the analysis to which those samples are subjected. In amendment No. 8, I propose that the subparagraph be extended to include analysis of exhibits.</P>
    <P>As regards the second leg of the Deputy's amendment, section 5 will make it possible for documentary evidence that a doctor is registered to be provided by the Medical Council.  I consider that the House can be satisfied on that aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has responded reasonably to concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  I welcome the introduction of the different term and the extension of the working of the section to include not only an examination but also an analysis.  The Minister is well advised in the area of drug analysis and I am sure he will agree it would be necessary to include the concept of analysis in that not all examinations include an analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern I had arose out of a prosecution of some notoriety, because of the defendant, in this city.  The prosecution ultimately failed because the established &ldquo;police doctor&rdquo; was unavailable.  In fact, at the time he was in hospital seriously ill.  That person has given evidence in court as a registered medical practitioner for as long as I care to remember.  Even though the Registrar of the Medical Council attended to produce the record showing that the doctor who conducted the examination was duly entered and recorded that was not accepted as sufficient evidence of registration because under the law as it stood the doctor had to be in court to say that he was the doctor in question and was a registered medical practitioner.  As I understand the <Col N="1189" /> position, all other elements of the prosecution had been reasonably established to the satisfaction of the court but it failed on that technical point.  I tabled a question to the Minister on this matter and I wanted to ensure that the issue would be addressed in this legislation, that in such circumstances the prosecution evidence would be fully covered.  I am happy with what the Minister of State said, that in conjunction with the addition of the word &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; and the provisions of section 5, the matter is reasonably covered.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is another matter that deserves a memorandum from the Minister to An Garda Síochána explaining that these provisions would now assist the Garda greatly.  It is something that the medico-legal society might also be advised of so that they might make an appropriate response.  A huge amount of professional time is consumed by doctors having to attend at courts in circumstances in which they are simply giving evidence as a matter of course. The sooner we arrive at the day when such testimony can be avoided and accommodated by the provisions of the legislation the better it will be.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the lack of Government support for the Irish Olympic team and urges the Government to grant additional funds to assist the athletes in their final preparations for Barcelona and to commit themselves to providing moneys for the 1992-1996 Olympic cycle of the order <Col N="1197" /> requested in the submission made to the Government by the Irish Olympic Council in 1989.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister last night and read his statement, I must say there is not much joy in this for the Olympic Council of Ireland and affiliated organisations and particularly the young people involved in sport.  I hope the Minister will look more favourably on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a wider sense, I am gravely concerned that the original philosophy and spirit of the Olympic movement, going back to its establishment in 1894, are changing.  It would appear that we are now being directed by the International Olympic Council that only potential finalists should be selected by participating countries.  This is not good.  It would put additional pressure on our athletes. In this context is it any wonder that question marks hang over a number of Olympic champions in recent years because of allegations of drug taking? <Col N="1198" /> Until random drug testing is mandatory all year round throughout the world we will never remove this blemish from the Olympic Games.  I compliment the Olympic Council of Ireland on their actions and attitude in this matter and I urge them to use whatever power they have, and their votes with the International Olympic Council, to further this end. This country and everyone involved in sport should intensify the drive to clear all sports throughout the world of the drug menace.  It is unacceptable to sportsmen and sportswomen throughout the world that athletes convicted of drug taking should be readmitted to their sports within, in many cases, two years. The Olympic council should give a positive lead with the major countries of the world in tackling this menace of drug taking and should row in behind the International Olympic Committee to ensure that drug taking is eliminated from the Olympic Games.  Our competitors face a grave disadvantage in many ways at the moment.  It is totally unacceptable that in addition they could be competing against people who are using drugs.</P>
    <P>There is a great demand throughout this country and an increasing realisation of the need for and the potential of, sport. While I acknowledge that the Minister present has not got his hands on the purse strings, I hope he will use his influence with the Minister for Finance to ensure there is a much greater financial commitment to sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my Labour colleague, Deputy Ryan, for giving me some of his time to say a few words about the Olympic Council of Ireland on the motion moved by Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Olympic Games is a showpiece for world sport, a place where the cream of sportsmen and sportswomen show their paces.  The title &ldquo;world champion&rdquo; though much sought after still has not the same aura as the title of Olympic champion.  In the past Ireland has a very noble and good record of producing Olympic champions ever since the Olympic <Col N="1199" /> Games began in the eighteen nineties. We had many Olympic champions in those early days.  Unfortuately, in latter years they are not quite as many.  We had the raw material then; we still have the raw material, but it takes a little more now to become an Olympic champion.  It takes extra special skills which are developed by training and coaching. Unfortunately, at that level quite an amount of money is required and here we are slipping up slightly, but maybe many other countries slip up to a far greater degree.</P>
    <P>Our first Olympic champion in modern history came from Deputy Deenihan's county of Kerry in tennis, a sport rather unusual for Irishmen in those years.  In the early years of this century at almost every Olympic Games we took two or maybe three gold medals, especially in long jump, hammer throwing and discus throwing.  Since the foundation of our State we took home 13 Olympic medals. Somebody said here last night we brought home 14.  Perhaps we did.  Of those 13 or 14 medals seven have been won by boxers.  That speaks well for our boxers and our boxing fraternity, and this year we have a team of six going to the Olympic Games.  At the moment they are in Germany training with other nations and with the six is one other boxer who was most unfortunate in not being chosen. He may yet be chosen &mdash; that is Mark Winters of Belfast who is Irish light-weight senior champion at 60 kilos.  In the past, different countries picked their boxers.  This year it is not the country that picks its team but the Continent, and we see a European team, an American team, an African team, an Oceana team and so on.  On the European team there are 12 boxers in each weight and there are 12 weights in amateur boxing, and we have six of those.</P>
    <P>As flyweight we have a Corkman, Paul Buttimer, who was trained by a former Olympian, Kieran Joyce, who boxed for Ireland in 1984 and 1988.</P>
    <P>As bantamweight we have Wayne McCullagh, a British Commonwealth gold medallist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> As featherweight we have Dublin man Paul Griffin, current European gold medallist.</P>
    <P>As welterweight we have Michael Carruth, again of Dublin, who was world junior silver medallist.  Both he and Paul Griffin are trained by Mr. Carruth's father, Austin Carruth who also will be one of the coaches in the Olympics.  As heavyweight we have Paul Douglas of Belfast trained by Gerry Storey, a famous international boxing trainer.  Incidentally, when Barry McGuigan turned professional he spent the first six months with Storey learning how to throw a left hook properly, and we all remember how effectively he got the message.  At superheavyweight &mdash; the first time we ever had a superheavyweight &mdash; we have Kevin McBride from the home county of the Minister for Defence Deputy Wilson. From those six boxers I expect we will bring home at least three medals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect all those medals will be bronze.</P>
      <P>Reference was made last night to various Ministers with special responsibility for Sport.  I do not think I can let this occasion pass without referring to the Minister who gave rise to the new word Cospóir.  In the past we took that word to be a verb but it has come to have a different meaning over the past ten or 12 years.  Cospóir, the National Sports Council, were set up by the then Minister with special responsibility for Sport, Deputy Tunney.</P>
      <P>It was stated by a member of the Olympic Council of Ireland that he would not like to see a Government representative among the people who welcome home our athletes.  That was a scandalous comment. This attitude is not shared by all members of the Olympic Council of Ireland.  I know some of those people personally and they have completely disassociated themselves from that remark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to let the House know that I have had a love relationship with the Olympic games for a long time.  I visited Olympia in the Peloponnese in Greece, the beautiful fertile valley where it all began, where the records go back to 776 BC where in the 200×90 feet Temple of Zeus &mdash; the feet were Hercules feet, so that they were bigger than normal &mdash; the gold and ivory statue of the God Zeus by Phidias stood and where the statue of Hermes by Praxiteles, also from the 4th century, with the child Dionysos was found as late as 1877. That is the model for all Christian statues where there is a bambino on the arm of an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Olympia there ware statues of athletes, horse breeders &mdash; chariot racing was very important at that time &mdash; philosophers, statesmen and kings.  Like Deputy Foxe, I too would resent the exclusion of Members of this House from any celebration of a victory at the Olympic Games.  What Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great were entitled to, Members of this House are also entitled to.  It is interesting that Caligua, the Roman Emperor, wanted to steal the gold and ivory chryselepantine statue of the god, take it to Rome and replace its head with a sculpture of his own head. He was frustrated.  This shows the danger of making a god out of oneself in matters Olympic.  I had the pleasure of visiting and talking with President Karamanlis when I was Minister for Education many <Col N="1202" /> years ago.  He is President of Greece again and he told me he hoped that Greece would again become the permanent home of the Olympic Games.  I do not know whether the climate would suit us all that well, but that is his ambition and he has a good basis for it.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out to the House that a sacred truce was proclaimed for the duration of the ancient games. This shows how sophisticated they were. The games stopped wars in ancient Greece; but during the 20th century wars stopped the games, both the 1914-18 and the 1939-45 world wars.  As we know, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Turkey were banned from the 1920 games immediately after the First World War.  This happened after the Baron De Coubertin had revived the games during the last decade of the last century.  It is interesting to note that Germany and Japan were banned from the 1948 London Olympic Games and that the USSR, as it was then known, did not come into the Olympics until the 1952 games in Helsinki.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific reason I am here, I want to put on the record why I made a certain phone call.  I did not make this phone call to bully or force the Olympic Council of Ireland to do any particular thing.  I made the phone call as a result of representations made to me. The following facts will give substance to the steps I took.  Gina Galligan attained a time of one minute, 11.8 seconds in the 100 metres breast stroke, a third of a second outside the time.  The House should know that this time would have won her the gold medal in the Olympic Games in Mexico City &mdash; it was easier to make records there because of the altitude &mdash; the gold medal in the ill-fated Munich games in 1972 and the silver medal in Montreal in 1976.  Her time would have placed her 17th in the Seoul games.  The House should take careful note that Mr. Noel Carroll an Olympic athlete, has given a wise warning about the Seoul Olympics.  He called it the last of the drugs Olympics and noted that since then, because of the tests, times are <Col N="1203" /> slower.  This is highly relevant to the time registered by Gina Galligan.</P>

      <P>Marion Madine from Belfast attained a time of two minutes 15.9 seconds in the 200 metres butterfly race.  This time would have won her the gold medal in Mexico City and the silver medal in Munich.  She would have been in the first eight in Los Angeles in 1984. No Irish swimmer has got into the last eight in a swimming competition in the Olympic Games.  It is time to let these young girls kill forever the old joke &ldquo;The Irish swimming team's success in the Olympics is that nobody drowned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to an article by Tom O'Riordan in, I think, today's <i>Irish Independent,</i> in which he states:</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Olympic Council again discussed swimmer, Marion Madine, for the 200m butterfly after they had received a fax from FINA, the International Swimming Association.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ross E. Wales, Fina Secretary, informed the Council that Madine's time of 2.15.95 in a race after the European Community Club Championships in Touloise last April would satisfy all criteria, barring only those required for a world record.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of league we are talking about.  The article goes on to say:</P>
      <P>He claimed he was satisfied, on the information supplied to him by the IASA, that Madine's time could be recognised for Olympic qualification. It is important to note that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House &mdash; this is well known to the Ceann Comhairle and Members of the Oireachtas generally &mdash; is very careful when legislating to incorporate an appeals procedure into its laws.  The Deputies opposite will know and realise the truth of that.  This is fundamental to our democratic process.  The final word is not left with an oligarchy of any kind. If we come up against the attitude &ldquo;I am Sir Oracle, and when I open my lips let <Col N="1204" /> no dog bark&rdquo; it repels us as legislators. When we hear that Ronnie Delaney was chosen for the Melbourne Olympic Games on a seven votes to six decision, that Gina Galligan had the rules changed and was ruled out on the basis of a third of a second time disqualification, that Marion Madine made the time for the 200 metres butterfly, but, God save the mark, the race was not recognised by the OCI &mdash; both these swimmers were nominated by the Irish Amateur Swimming Association &mdash; and that, as a former Olympic Games competitor stated on the Bibi Baskin programme, a man was picked by the OCI who was not nominated by anybody, then it is time to call strongly for an appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>That is what I am doing before the House this evening.  I suggest that the President of the Gaelic Athletic Association, the President of the Irish Rugby Football Union &mdash; two magnificient sporting bodies not in the Olympic Games and consequently without prejudice and without bias &mdash; and two knowledgeable foreign experts should act as an appeal board in these contentious matters.  I and others who contacted me during the last couple of weeks would be anxious to support the work of the OCI in putting the best possible teams into competition. In the present circumstances I consider I am performing a public duty in following the line I followed and I shall continue to do so if the occasion demands it.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of talk about funding of the Olympic Council of Ireland.  It is as well to remember that in the early history of the Olympic Games no State funding was allowed and there was very heavy dependence on sponsors. The first of the revived Olympics, revived by the Baron De Coubertin, were subsidised very heavily by one individual.  It became a matter of political pride to win at the Olympic Games and consequently the command economies, notably East Germany and the USSR &mdash; from where some magnificent athletes came &mdash; almost abolished the status of amateurism and the word &ldquo;shamateurism&rdquo; was coined.  The whole Olympic movement will have to carefully <Col N="1205" /> consider where we are going in that regard in the future.  It is very difficult now to know who is a real amateur.  In a sense this is a social question, because only the well to do in the 19th century could afford to take part in sports of various kinds and consequently the amateur status was exalted.  Anybody who made a living from the sport, such as professional cricketers on our neighbouring island, professional boxers and professional footballers, were excluded from the amateur ranks.  Things are in such a state at the moment that it is difficult to identify the true amateur.</P>
    <P>I listened with care to the Minister of State last night and I compliment him on his speech.  In particular, I compliment him on his outlining of the expenditure of his Department on sports.  <i>Ex parte</i> pleading had minimised the amounts.  He came out openly and indicated in relation to a wide range of sports what his Department are doing.  His statement on the 50 metre pool must give hope to all of us who aim at excellence.  I give him total support in this regard.  Gura fada buan é san oifig.  Táim cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé beart de réir a bhriathair.</P>
    <P>When thinking about this motion put down by a defender of yore on the Kerry team I thought of the history of the Olympic Games since they were revived by the Baron de Coubertin.  I found some very interesting facts in the record books, many of them a disaster.  One of the funniest was when Chicago was picked to hold the Olympics in 1904 and Teddy Roosevelt of the United States had them transferred to St. Louis, Missouri, but St. Louis was not able to organise the event properly.</P>

      <P>We will allow the Deputy to talk about the Tailteann Games which take place in his county.  In 1908 there was a big row between the Russians and the Finns because the Finns wanted to put up their flag, and between the English and the Irish because the Irish wanted to put up their flag; but they were constrained <Col N="1206" /> from doing so.  As I have mentioned already, in 1920 the Olympic Games excluded the defeated of World War I, not in the spirit of the Olympics. In 1928 in Amsterdam the strong man of Munster, Dr. Pat O'Callaghan, won a gold medal for Ireland, as he did in 1932 in Los Angeles.  He was joined there by the brilliant Tipperary athlete, Bob Tisdall, who won a gold medal in the 400 metres hurdles.</P>
      <P>All this came to mind, particularly the political aspect.  Two men in Mexico City were expelled from the Olympic village for raising their hands in black power salute.  However, the Nazi salute was freely attended to in 1936 in Berlin. Therefore there is a certain lack of logic in some of the activities of the IOC.  South Africa was expelled from the Olympic Games but is now allowed to take part again.  There were the brilliant games in Tokyo and the altitude games in Mexico City, where the black power salute was given.  There was the tragedy of Munich, which was heavily politicised when the athletes from Israel were slaughtered at the Olympic Games there.  There was the financial disaster of Montreal; the Moscow games were boycotted because of Afghanistan and in 1984 Los Angeles was boycotted by the Russians because the USA had boycotted Moscow.  There was a variety of political aspects involved.</P>

I am glad that he, a doughty hurler in his time, is in charge of this section of the Department.  I am quite sure that the funding of the Olympics and the broader spectrum of sport in this country, which is also important, are in safe hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I read through the records various thoughts entered my mind.  I thought of <Col N="1207" /> John McGough, down as GBR-IRL, who won a silver medal in the intercalated games of 1906.  He was masseur for the Cavan team in the late forties.  That team was equally successful in that we took the gold medals from various counties at that time.</P>

      <P>I will come to Deputy Farrelly in a moment, if he will just be patient.  I am sure that the founders or anybody who has any genuine interest in sport, leisure or recreation would not associate the razzamatazz, the vulgar exploitation of sport, the politics and the economic considerations which surround the Olympic Games at the moment, with what is presumed to be their <i>raison d'etre.</i> For me, the real Olympians are in my constituency and they are in Navan, in Claremont Stadium, the people who, day <Col N="1208" /> in and day out, devote their time and their own resources to young boys and girls in their areas so that they can attain to the real purpose of the whole exercise, the healthy mind and body and attain standards by correct methods.  For one reason or another, however, the Olympics are taken as the summit of excellence and all nations aspire to winning a gold medal.  We recall with great satisfaction the names of O'Callaghan and Tisdall and more recently, from 1956, Ronnie Delaney.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Foxe for putting on the record that I gave to the new Sports Council the title &ldquo;Cuspóir&rdquo; a very appropriate word.  I was happy to invite Ronnie Delaney to act as chairman of that body. If I had my way that body would have supplanted the Olympic Council.  I picked that team and the only politician I put on it was Councillor Joe Connolly, a member of the Labour Party, who happened to be secretary of a great organisation, the Community Games.  The only other members of that board were appointed on the basis that they had something to offer to the sports council.</P>
      <P>The Olympic Council of my time, which included Lord Killanin and Des Sullivan were anxious to pursue by legitimate means the genuineness of their case but they did not indulge in this lobbying, in this going public and using the press in order to embarrass a Government or politicians into doing something incorrect.</P>
      <P>I will respond now to the invitation from Deputy Farrelly to comment on the phone call.  Has Deputy Farrelly, in his capacity as a TD for his constituency, made representations to hospitals on behalf of constituents?  Has he ever made representations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to universities where it was represented to him that the authorities had not operated in accordance with the norm?  I understand that the great sportsman sitting beside Deputy Farrelly, Deputy Deenihan, correctly <Col N="1209" /> expressed his disappointment in the House that a constituent of his had not been awarded a sports scholarship.  I commend the Deputy for that.  The Deputy argued his case and that is what we should be doing.  If the Olympic Council are not prepared to listen to submissions made by anybody, not excluding politicians who represent thousands of people, they must feel that they are in a rather insecure position.  The Olympic Council are working under the fallacy that having been established they are entitled to operate to their own satisfaction. That often is the mistake made by members of institutions who appoint themselves and who reject any comment or criticism from anybody outside.  This organisation is not entitled to such protective cover.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan, in his motion, asks this House to give £7 million to a group of people.  That amount of money would do a lot for Claremont Stadium and for genuine sport in my constituency or in Deputy Foxe's constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in his heart realises that the case he is trying to make is without justification.  Is the Deputy seriously suggesting that we should make £7 million available to an organisation the manager of which says that neither of us, in the exercise of our duties, responsibilities or rights is entitled to attend at any sports?  I attend sports at which nobody <Col N="1211" /> was present except the people who were taking part and I enjoyed them and I will continue to do so.  I was motivated by the true Olympian spirit.  The real thrill is to participate.  Naurally we would all like to win but participation is important.  Bearing in mind the lack of performance of the Olympic Council who at the moment are getting £700,000 out of our resources in respect of this Olympics, I am amazed at this motion.  They indicated somewhere that £900,000 would be adequate but I know they can obtain money from other sources, such as sponsorship and people who are ready to support them. Nevertheless, Deputy Deenihan is asking us in this House to guarantee £7 million of the taxpayers' money to that organisation. If we were to judge them by the one person we know, we would give them very little.  They are an unknown group and they do not submit details of how they spend their money.  If Deputy Deenihan regards that as being in the best interest of sport and in the best interests of the people we serve at all levels, I invite him to have second thoughts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion, if passed, will serve as a generous measure of goodwill towards the Olympic movement in Ireland and, more importantly, in practical terms it should serve as a stimulus <Col N="1212" /> to the Government to react in a positive manner by providing badly needed funds for our sports representatives in Spain this summer.</P>
      <P>It is an unfortunate fact that in a country where practically every facet of life evolves around sport, the Government philosophy places sport very far down the list of priorities.  In terms of achievements on the national and international scenes, it is doubtful if there is any country in the world which could match Ireland for sporting prowess, particularly in the context of our isolation as an island country with a small population.  There is rarely a year or an era when there is not some Irish person to the forefront of world sports, many of them have gone on to become household names all over the globe.  Individual competitors have reached the summit of their chosen disciplines in spite of the many obstacles which confront such athletes in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Team sports are reasonably well served as regards public support and the consequent financial boost which such sport engenders.  One need look no further than at the GAA or the Irish Rugby Football Union to see what can be achieved by good organisation and presentation of particular team sports in terms of attracting spectators and providing facilities for the playing and development of our games.  These organisations can, in different ways, serve as role models as to how particular sports can become an integral part of the social and recreational fabric of the community. They have demonstrated that sport can and should be something more than a mere pastime, that it as a part to play in the evolution and development of character in its participants and that it can enhance their quality of life.  The essential point I would like to make about these organisations and others like them is that their progress has been achieved, not at the expense of the community in general through the payment of grants and subsidies, but through the activities of the organisations themselves.  The success in recent years of the Irish international soccer team has generated <Col N="1213" /> enormous public interest and with it the resultant financial benefits which have given the Football Association of Ireland the means by which they can safeguard the future welfare of the game at all levels around the country.  These are obvious examples to quote when talking about sports which are self-supporting.  They have a long standing place in Irish public life, they generate widespread spectator interest and as a consequence they also benefit from the communications media.</P>
    <P>The crux of the matter, unfortunately, is that these are not Olympic sports and the widespread public support enjoyed by our major team sports is of little consequence to those individual disciplines which enjoy Olympic status but which all too often have to pay a massive price when it comes to competing at the highest level of all.  The Government need to take a hard look at their priorities and make some long overdue adjustments to their agenda in this area.  There are far too many sports in this country which do not enjoy a wide degree of spectator appeal and thus lack the resultant financial support which is necessary for survival and development.  The generation of finance through the staging of the sport itself should not be a criterion by which sport is to be judged worthy of Government backing.  For example, amateur boxing is probably Ireland's most successful Olympic sport next to athletics and yet that does not command wide spectator appeal.  If boxing is to continue to thrive in Ireland, it can only do so through regular competition with other countries and the authorities in this sport must have the necessary financial backing to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>Ireland has conquered the world in professional cycling through the marvellous achievements of Seán Kelly, Stephen Roche, Martin Early and others, yet their amateur counterparts at home have to depend almost entirely on their own resources and on the assistance of commercial sponsorship to survive and remain in competition with other countries. Surely this is not right.</P>
    <P>Swimming is another sport which urgently needs Government support.  In <Col N="1214" /> this sport we have come knocking on the door of international success principally through the magnificent and untiring efforts of a few dedicated individuals and a committed governing body which is striving against the odds to promote the sport at national and international level. That we have come so far in this particular sport is a credit to the personnel involved.  That we have done so considering the appalling lack of facilities and without the use of an Olympic standard 50 metre pool is a matter of international incredulity.  Given the talent that is available and waiting to be exploited to the full, Ireland must stand indicted on this issue.</P>
    <P>To compound the problem we heard recent allegations of ministerial interference in the question of personnel selection for the Olympics in this sport. I respectfully suggest that the Cabinet member involved should instead concern himself with the difficulties facing the sports administrators through the lack of funding.  In our climate swimming must be an indoor sport and this entails all the consequent expense.  Yet, because of its very nature, it cannot become a spectator sport to the extent that it could become self-financing.  It must be clearly evident, therefore, that the excellent work being done by swimming associations all over the country in the municipal facilities available to them must be supplemented by a Government approach at national level.  The sport demands an Olympic size pool and our swimmers deserve that.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question which must be a cause of concern and this impinges on the question of Government commitment to sport and its place on the national agenda.  There can be no doubt that significant changes have taken place in our educational system in recent years. For generations we have been very lucky because of the profound influence which the religious teaching orders have had in our primary and secondary schools.  The influence of the religious extended beyond the academic and embraced also the sporting and cultural life of their students.  Second level boarding schools contributed enormously to the welfare of <Col N="1215" /> a number of different sporting disciplines, particularly team sports. However, over the past decade, with the diminution of the numbers in the religious orders, there has been a parallel decrease in the numbers going to boarding school.  This laicisation of the educational system will inevitably bring further change in the future.  The dedication of the lay teaching staff will ensure the maintenance of academic and vocational standards, of that I am confident, but lay staff have a life outside the classroom which is totally different from their religious counterparts and which demands that much of their social and recreational energies are directed towards areas away from the school.  This will inevitably place a greater onus on the individual to pursue his or her own sporting destiny and on local sports clubs and organisations to seek out and nurture talent in their own area.  This is a question that should engage the Minister's attention as it will undoubtedly have a major bearing on the direction in which many sports will go in the future.  Our educational system must continue to foster the idea and the philosophy that sport and recreation form an integral part of the development of the whole student.</P>
    <P>The high level of unemployment in Ireland may not seem to have much relevance in the context of our submission for funding of our Olympic athletes, but it has, and may have a profound influence in the future.  There is a strong and credible body of opinion which says that it will be many years before there is a significant decrease in the number of people out of work.  In other words, we must be realistic about it and realise that we have to face up to the fact that large numbers of people in all our communities will spend long periods out of work.  The manner in which they spend their time must be of concern to the Government. Even a cursory walk around any town or city will show that the video rental business has mushroomed in recent years.  The obvious inference to be drawn from this is that we are becoming a nation of movie watchers, not just during the <Col N="1216" /> traditional hours of late evening and night time but in the mornings and afternoons. This pastime can very quickly become endemic and rooted in the second generation, namely the children of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>We have huge numbers of long term unemployed.  We can and we must direct some of our attention towards offering creative outlets for the energies and the talents of people who have no other way of passing the time.  Paying them to sit around the house may ease our social conscience but it does nothing for our moral failure and certainly it does nothing for the character of the generations who will come after us.</P>
    <P>There are a great many committed and dedicated people running voluntary sporting organisations who have a vast body of firsthand knowledge and a great deal of experience in the fostering and administration of sporting values among their members and supporters.  We have people who have proven their ability to be the best and to take on the best, not just here at home but across the sporting world.  There are people out there whose vision is unclouded by petty boundaries or by parochial snipings and who can see the broad picture of the place and the part that sport can play in regenerating national morale.</P>
    <P>We should leave the athletics to the athletes, the sports to the sportsmen, and get together with the administrators to see how best we can serve the needs of the people.  It is time for us as a collective body to stop sidestepping the issue, to take off our political caps and recognise the implications of this whole area for the future wellbeing of our country.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the real questions involved here.  I am not talking about the simple expedient of a one-off payment to a sporting organisation in this Olympic year.  There will be other years and other Olympics; and if kneejerk reaction is the best we can come up with, then we need to examine our conscience.  We must look at sport in the context of a country with a massive and abiding long term unemployment problem.  We must cater for the second generation longterm unemployed <Col N="1217" /> who will soon form a significant segment of our dole queues.  We must, above all, be supportive of the people who have the expertise in their chosen fields.  We must radically alter the direction which the disbursement of national lottery funds has taken and get back to the basics for which it was set up in the first place.</P>

Anybody who has seen the film <i>Chariots of Fire</i> and who has any interest in sport could not but be moved by the extent of passion and principle which was exemplified in that film, with its story of Olympic competition.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Tánaiste has replied to allegations made in this House and outside regarding contacts relating to a potential participant in the forthcoming Olympic Games.  The Tánaiste achieved the highest accolade in his particular sport and exemplified on the field all that was and should be best in that sport. When I read the report in the newspapers I was absolutely astounded that a sportsman of yesteryear, who reached the highest level in Gaelic sport, should do such a thing.  I did not believe it.  I will have to read the Official Report to see exactly what the Tánaiste said.  He went on to refer to Baron De Coubertin and many other matters.</P>
      <P>The Olympic Games, with the motto <i>In Citius, Altius, Fortius,</i> encompass the greatest emotional moments in the lives of young athletes and of generations of their followers.  Who can forget the great Ron Clarke from Austriala, holder of almost 20 world records, who failed in his attempt in Mexico; or the lean figure of Bikila, the first double marathon winner in 1960 and 1964; or the black-clad Peter Snell from New Zealand, who achieved a unique double in the 800 metres and the 1500 metres?  As a young child I remember passing through Bohola and hearing stories of the great Martin Sheridan.</P>

      <P>The vaulting pole he used in the Olympic Games is in the local public house and is a source of immense attraction to young people.</P>
      <P>Politics have always been intimately intertwined with sport since the first runner arrived into Athens.  The death recently of Arthur Ashe epitomised that. Having reached the highest level at Wimbledon, he had to fight the apartheid system in South Africa.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan is not calling for a grant that cannot be supervised and overseen. In calling for the establishment of a National Sports Council, he is seeking to monitor the expenditure of money. when one looks at the face of somebody like Rosaleen Gallagher from Bangor Erris, who won several gold medals at the paraplegic Olympics, and sees the exultation and sincerity of such people, there is no question but that this country should do more for people like this.</P>
      <P>Obviously 50-metre swimming pools are a necessity for specialists.  I remember competing a number of years ago in the Superstars competition.  Another great athlete, a Member of this House for 24 years, John Donnellan from Galway, attempted to swim a 30-metre pool without being able to swim at all, such was his integrity and diligence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lowry has referred to the movie-watching society which is springing up.  It is very obvious that the decrease in the number of male teachers in primary schools is leading to a sort of matriarchal society at primary school level.  Time will tell whether this will have an effect in terms of the competitiveness or ability of young people to involve themselves in sports which would lead to Olympic competition in later years.  I say that without any reference to the ability of teachers to teach.  There is a vast number of female teachers in primary schools and it may affect the numbers moving into sport at second level.  I mean no offence to anybody. It is just an observation and only time will tell whether it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity to sit for 12 <Col N="1219" /> months in the seat occupied by the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, and I wish him well.  One of the real problems faced by politicians is the growth of cynicism among the public.  I am sure that the then Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, felt like a proper fool when he had to speak to Gary O'Toole, who had just won a gold medal, and tell him that we would have a 50-metre pool before the Barcelona Olympics.</P>
    <P>If the Government of the day make a decision, it should be adhered to.  There is every justification for further expenditure in this field.  One could cite the increase in leisure time and Government directives to double tourist numbers as just two reasons.  I agree that a National Sports Council should be established which would work with or supersede the Olympic Council of Ireland.  The money required would be well spent.  Over £10 million has been spent to date on the beef tribunal in Dublin Castle and no allegation has yet been proven.  We understand the sum of money required could rise to £40 million, a sum which would train all the athletes of the next generation to the level at which they would wish to compete.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy Lowry and Deputy Kenny for sharing their time with me.  In the course of the discussion so far we have had a good deal of long distance talking, from the Tánaiste's references to Greece to your own references, Sir, to the real Olympians somewhere in your own constituency. We have a few of those real Olympians in my own constituency.  It is inevitable that in the course of a debate such as this the issue would be widened from the question of funding for the Olympics to the wider issue of funding for sport.  There is a very serious problem that will have to be addressed very soon by the Government and, in particular, by the Minister with responsibility for Sport. It has to do with the effect the national lottery is having on the administration <Col N="1220" /> and the running of sport at community and at club level in this country.</P>
      <P>We all know that people who run sports clubs, who give of their time voluntarily in order to organise sport at a local level, spend a great deal of their time trying to raise funds to keep their clubs going.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for clubs to do that because the disposable income which was once available and which enabled clubs to function in local communities is no longer there, largely because people have already spent it on lottery tickets and so on.  The problem, as pointed out here last night, is that the funds from the national lottery are not going back into sport at that level. I attended one meeting it my own constituency last week of a very respected football club &mdash; Ballybrack Boys Football Club &mdash; who have told me as well as other Members of this House that come next September they will have to reduce the number of teams they field from 17 to five, which will cut out virtually the entire underage complement, because they have reached the end of their tether with regard to fundraising.  I believe they are not alone in that problem.</P>
      <P>The time has come for the Government to consider some kind of grant scheme of financial assistance to be funded from the national lottery to help clubs meet their current expenditure and their ongoing costs.  The assistance given by the national lottery to sports at present is largely for capital projects; but some assistance, which could be channelled through the local authorities or the vocational education committees, would enable clubs to remain in existence.  Certainly, they have been starved of resources and find it extremely difficult to meet their ongoing costs.  People are spending on the national lottery and they do not have the £1 or £2 or whatever they would normally contribute to a draw or whatever fund raising event a sports club may engage in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House deals specifically with the question of the Olympics.  I should say that my party, Democratic Left, supports that motion, although it does not specify the amount <Col N="1221" /> of money being talked about.  We support it for a number of reasons: first, because sport plays such a major part in our society.  Virtually everybody, whether as participant, as a spectator or as a television viewer, is involved in sport and takes an interest in it.  The degree of success or otherwise at major international events such as the Olympics affects the degree to which people participate in sport.  We saw, for example, the degree to which there was an upsurge in interest in cycling after the victories of Stephen Roche and Seán Kelly.  We saw the increase in participation in football after the victories of the Irish football team.  Here in Dublin we saw an increased interest in Gaelic games, and particularly in Gaelic football, as a result of the achievements of the Dublin football team in the seventies.</P>
    <P>It is not merely a question of spending money on the cream of our athletes and that they are the sole beneficiaries.  If our athletes do well in the Olympics that in turn stimulates and motivates people, and particularly young people, throughout society to engage in sporting activities. The problem is that success at international sporting level does not come cheap.  As standards have been raised the demands on athletes have increased proportionately.  The Olympic Games are in theory still an amateur event, but the standards achieved and the commitments demanded are of a professional level.  Our successes in recent Olympic Games have not been too frequent. The last time we won a gold medal was in 1956.  It is not that the standards or the level of commitment among Irish participants has decreased; the problem is that the level of resources allocated by other countries, including small countries, has increased and we have been left behind.  If we want to repeat the successes of earlier decades and if we want to see more Ronnie Delaneys then we will simply have to allocate more resources. Additional finance on its own will not guarantee more success, but without it our athletes operate at a severe disadvantage. What success there has been in recent years has been achieved despite <Col N="1222" /> the resources we allocate rather than because of them.  While the genuine Olympic spirit may be about participation rather than winning, what athletes and the general public want are successes and medals.</P>
    <P>Participating, never mind success, at Olympic level demands a phenomenal level of sacrifice and commitment by those involved.  It is wrong that those who give that degree of commitment to their particular sport should be put at a disadvantage with regard to their career or their earning potential or whatever.  That has to be supported.  It is not possible for our athletes to compete on a part-time basis.  The atletes of other countries operate effectively on a fulltime professional basis.  Our men and women are entitled to a level of support which will enable them to compete on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>It is not only a question of direct financial support but also a question of facilities.  How can we expect our swimmers to compete abroad when we do not even have a 50 metre swimming pool in this country.  We are the only country in Europe without such a pool.  It is simply ludicrous that our swimmers should have to practice in 25 metre pools or to go abroad to get access to proper facilities. We have been promised &mdash; and again last night &mdash; a 50 metre pool time and again by successive Governments, but our swimmers are still waiting.</P>
    <P>The real scandal &mdash; if one can use that term in this case &mdash; rests not so much with the controversy surrounding the Tánaiste's telephone call or with the Olympic Council's response to it as with the fact that the young swimmers concerned do not have access in this State to a 50 metre pool.  That is the real issue. There are two versions of the story about the telephone call.  I certainly would not subscribe to any Government Minister telephoning any organisation and leaning on them, if that is what has happened.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the view that Members of this House should have an input, if they feel that is <Col N="1223" /> warranted, in a case such as this.  I do not care whether the Minister is right or whether the Olympic Council is right. What I care about is that there is a young swimmer who did not meet what seems to be a fairly arbitrary time limit and who does not have within her country adequate facilities in which to practice in order to meet the times laid down.  Most members of the public are much more concerned about the injustice involved.  I do not think the public are concerned as to whether Gina Galligan is being prevented from going to the Olympics because of an arbitrary time limit or because of lack of resources.  What the public are concerned about is that she is being prevented from participating in the Olympics.  If participation was the principal question then in this particular case the young swimmer concerned should be allowed to participate at the Barcelona Olympics.  That is the bottom line of what has turned out to be an unfortunate instance of the case of a young swimmer being turned into a &ldquo;political football&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this, my first opportunity to do so, to congratulate my successor, Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, on his appointment and to wish him well in his post.  To date he has been doing very well in a difficult time.</P>
      <P>All of us would wish to have much more money allocated to sport, no one more so than the present Minister.  It is clear that there is a great need to develop sport in this country.  One must consider the reality of the position, however, in the context of our overall finances.  Sport has not done badly, really, when one notes that there has been a 40 per cent increase in funding to the Olympic Council since 1988 and there has been a 23 per cent increase in their funding since last year.  The amount of increased funding to the Olympic Council has been significant and the Department and the Minister must be congratulated for that.  It would be unreasonable for one to be critical when one takes into account the increases that have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> For a few moments I should like to deal with the wider issue of funding for sport.  The attitude of politicians in general and that of the general public towards sports funding must be examined. Such examination could only bring about a solution to the problem in the longer term.  It is clear that the general public do not want politicians to spend money on sport.  Fine Gael Deputies, on the opportunities they have been given, have shown that increased expenditure on sport is not a priority for them.  Before giving an example, I wish to say that I fully recognise that the four young Fine Gael Deputies sitting opposite me &mdash; like Deputies on this side of the House &mdash; are themselves fully committed to increased expenditure on sport.  I must point out that at the time of the 1987 general election the Fine Gael Leader, Deputy John Bruton, made a proposal to take £60 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was a proposal to completely strip the small amount of money that was going into sport.  What concerns me is that during that election campaign nobody cried &ldquo;Halt&rdquo; to that proposal.  On the only occasion that the general public were asked about their priority for sports funding in a <i>Sunday Press</i> poll, 70 per cent answered that hospital beds, school buildings and anything else that might be mentioned should have a higher priority for expenditure than sport.  During the 1987 election campaign &mdash; as with Deputy Kenny in the west &mdash; I was playing cornerback in west Galway and trying to keep my own little game on the go.</P>

      <P>I decided that it was not worth my while criticising the Fine Gael Party for what I, as Minister with responsibility for sport at the time, considered <Col N="1226" /> to be a ludicrous proposal.  In Ireland we have never looked on sport as a priority for expenditure.  We are not looking on sport as a priority for expenditure now because all of us &mdash; and we should be honest about this &mdash; do not rate sport as high as we rate the other important areas of expediture that the man-in-the-street considers need assistance. In this specific area the Minister and the Government have done well and should be commended on the increase given.  Perhaps in the global context all of us as politicians have to examine the truth that sport must take a much higher priority.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not give me a chance to share his time, so I had to ask someone else.  The last occasion on which the House had a discussion about the allocation of lottery funds was on 8 and 9 November 1988.  I am sorry that Deputy Fahey is leaving the Chamber because I should like to refer to a few comments made on that occasion.  Then a present Minister of State, in conjunction with a member of the Progressive Democrats who was in Government at the time, said that Fianna Fáil had engaged in the most despicable exercise in gombeen politics ever witnessed in this country in the way in which they handled the allocation from the national lottery.  He said that the behaviour of the Government at the time was seriously jeopardising the future of the lottery itself and was leading many people to the view that Fianna Fáil thought of the lottery as merely a re-election slush fund.  Today, in 1992, four years later, I would say that <Col N="1227" /> Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats view the lottery in the same light. Nothing has changed in the way in which funds are allocated.</P>
      <P>I ask the Progressive Democrats whether they will support the Government tonight on the basis of the amendment standing in the name of the junior Minister of State at the Department of Education.  The Official Report of 8 November 1988 shows Deputy Michael Noonan saying that we needed a Madison Square Garden in this city of which all the people of the country could be proud; we needed it bigger if that were possible. Deputy Fahey replied that we were going to have one.  He went on to say that Deputy Noonan's comments demonstrated his ignorance about what was going on in Ireland, that we would have a £35 million national centre within two years.  Four years later, we have no centre.  A sum of £3.5 million has been spent but we have no centre for dealing with the proposals that were then put before the House.</P>
      <P>This motion concerns the allocation of funds for the Olympic Council of Ireland. Last night the Minister said that the Seoul Olympics were funded by the Government of the time to the tune of £1.39 million.  At that time there was no national lottery.  The national lottery was set up with the intention that 65 per cent of the proceeds would go towards sport and the arts.  It was not envisaged that the lottery would be the success that it is today.  Lo and behold, we are now told that in the four years leading up to the Barcelona Olympics a sum of £2.22 million has been given to the council. That total is made up of allocations of £450,000; £505,000; £567,000 and £700,000 respectively.  The total allocation is only £832,000 more than was given in the previous four years in the lead up to the Seoul Olympics.  The Government have given exactly one week's income presently raised from the lottery, over and above that given in the previous period.  In real terms the contribution by the Minister is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence made a telephone <Col N="1228" /> call about an athlete who had not been selected.  Rules had been made and everybody knew about them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Four members of our Olympic team are at present in England receiving unemployment benefit and training to enable them to compete with the best athletes in the world.  The Minister is trying to justify the fact that he has given one week's extra national lottery funds over a four-year period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We should, as Members of this House, in conjunction with the Olympic Council of Ireland and in accordance with Deputy Deenihan's proposal, be organised properly to ensure that adequate funds are provided &mdash; an annual sum of £1.75 million &mdash; so that athletes will not have to train in other countries.

We hear too little about sport in the House and when we get a chance to debate it we should make the most of it. Unfortunately, because of time constraints, I cannot refer to all the contributions. However, I will refer to the reply of the Minister of State last night. The core of Deputy Aylward's reply was the defence of the Tánaiste; the most charitable thing to say is that the Minister of State did this from a sense of loyalty. It is impossible for anyone to believe that he could be sincere in suggesting that it was a legitimate practice for the second most important member of the Government to telephone the Olympic selectors to tell them to put Gina Galligan &mdash; regardless of whether she deserved it &mdash; on the Olympic squad, accompanied by a veiled threat in regard to funding and taking the matter further.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Gina Galligan did not make the qualifying time.  In his contribution Deputy Aylward accused me of trying to make political capital from the decision of the Government not to proceed with the proposed national sports centre at the Custom House Docks site.  Deputy Aylward should aim his accusations in another direction.  If he looks at the records of his colleagues he will see that, not only were they trying to make political capital out of it, but they were also trying to make compound interest out of it.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the former Taoiseach's press conference in Kilmainham in 1987.  He was surrounded by many people, including the Tánaiste and the former Minister for Sport, Deputy Frank Fahey, when he announced a £40 million new indoor centre on the dock site.  When he was asked by a leading sports journalist whether we would see this in our lifetime the former Taoiseach retorted, in his usual curt fashion, that he would treat that question with the contempt it deserved.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, made a further announcement in 1988 and we had the famous commitment from the former Minister for Sport, Deputy Frank Fahey, in November 1989 that work would commence in two to three weeks.  Am I supposed to praise the Government when they do well and not to make any reference when they have blundered, as they have done so many times in the past, in relation to sport?  How can one realistically raise standards without the necessary additional funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government funding &mdash; now further reduced &mdash; will not change the present position.  As in the case of countries like Italy, standards improve only after sustained <Col N="1231" /> increased funding.  The Minister referred to the House of Sport which, I understand, was donated free by Paul O'Neill subject to the Department paying for overheads such as telephones and lighting.  Paul O'Neill should get the credit for the House of Sport, not the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the 1992 grant of £700,000.  However, this is misleading as the grant from his Department this year was £450,000, representing a decrease of £75,000 from 1991.  The special £250,000 budget allocation from the Minister for Finance should have been given last year, which was the case in 1987, the pre-Olympic year.  It is obvious that sport is a minor affair in the Department of Education with the various senior Ministers for Education ignoring the junior Minister for Sport.</P>
    <P>When cuts are made in the Estimates sport generally suffers, as in 1992 when the sports grant was cut by £0.5 million. The Minister referred to the sponsorship received by the Olympic Council of Ireland and to the fact that they will not reveal the source of their sponsorship. However, I understand that the sponsorship is very small, most of it involves benefit in kind in the sense that various companies sponsor clothing, equipment and travel.  Very little money is provided. Because of the limited success of our athletes in the Olympics it is difficult to attract major sponsors; if we do not provide the funding we will not get the results and then we will not have sponsors.</P>
    <P>The Olympic Council of Ireland are a voluntary body who, in effect, do the State's work very cheaply and they are more than justified in seeking increased Government funding.  Most countries have well staffed, State paid, officials on their Olympic councils.  The OCI have one paid executive.  The Minister also referred to the £300,000 grant made to our élite athletes.  This figure covers all sports, not just Olympic sports.  The grants, which range from £1,000 to £5,000, are just peanuts and do not adequately cover the full-time training of an Olympic athlete.  To do this a sum of <Col N="1232" /> at least £30,000 would be required each year.  The Minister was neither objective nor fair in implying that there was controversy in some of the affiliated sporting organisations within the Olympic Council of Ireland.  As far as I know, there is total harmony within that organisation.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in complying with the dictates of the International Olympic Committee in maintaining proper entry standards, the Olympic Council of Ireland, have applied fair criteria for selection across the board, including in the case of Gina Galligan.  It is most unhelpful for the Minister to imply within the sanctuary of Dáil Éireann where the Olympic Council of Ireland have no remit that they are damaging the individual sports person.  It is only fair that he should withdraw that remark.</P>
    <P>In general, rather than entering into dialogue to clarify a coherent sports policy and to make reasonable commitments to provide increased funding across the sporting spectrum the Minister has deliberately chosen to attack within the confines of this House a voluntary organisation, the Olympic Council of Ireland, whose members give up their time freely for the cause of Olympic sport.  He had ample opportunities outside the House to criticise them.  Indeed he could have done so on the occasions he has met with them.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Government have been stung by the public reaction to the Tánaiste's recent attempt to pull a stroke which was publicly and rightly repudiated by the Olympic Council of Ireland in the interest of protecting their autonomy and freedom.</P>

    <P>I appeal to the Government and the <Col N="1233" /> Minister with responsibility for Sport to work in partnership with the Olympic Council of Ireland on a friendly co-operative basis.  I urge the Minister to pursue that line of argument.  I call on the Government to establish a national sports council to oversee and spearhead the future development of sports policy and to ensure that money is spent properly. In conclusion I urge them to accept this motion which has been proposed by Fine Gael as this would be in the best interests of sport and of young athletes both now and in the future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 5, to delete &ldquo;on indictment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The need for this amendment was brought to notice by the Incorporated Law Society.  As section 7 (1) stands, any party to criminal proceedings &mdash; the prosecution or the accused &mdash; must serve at least 21 days notice on the other side if it proposes to tender any documentary evidence which is made admissible by this part of the Bill.  It must serve also a copy of the documents in question and a copy of any certificate of compliance with the conditions of admissibility set out in section 5.  If the documents are being served by the prosecution they may be included in the book of evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that these requirements of section 7 (1) apply only in the case of proceedings on indictment, because it was assumed that in the case of offences being tried summarily any possible prejudice to an accused by the production of documentary evidence at <Col N="1237" /> the trial could be met by adjourning the proceedings.  Adjournment is not normally feasible at a jury trial.  However, this assumption has been found not to be valid.  For one thing the prosecution is now supplying documentary evidence in advance to the defence in certain summary cases.</P>
    <P>More importantly, however, the absence of prior notice under section 7 (1) in summary proceedings could place the defence at a disadvantage, even with an adjournment to consider the documents. That is because the defence would not automatically be entitled to insist on the prosecution adducing oral evidence in support of any of the matters specified in a certificate of compliance.  At present, as section 6 (3) stands, this entitlement applies only in indictable cases where the defence has been served in advance with the documentation and has signalled an objection to its admissibility.</P>
    <P>For these reasons we are extending to summary proceedings the requirement of giving advance notice of documentary evidence.  This will allow either party to the proceedings to object to the admissibility of the documents and thereby to insist on having oral evidence adduced by the person who certified that the conditions of admissibility in section 5 were complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is very succinct on the face of it, but it raises some very important aspects of the whole process of criminal prosecution and particularly the method of prosecution at summary level in the District Court. Later on I have an amendment dealing with the whole question of evidence to be adduced and an amendment on adducing evidence in the District Court to obviate the farcical situation that exists at the moment where large numbers of Garda Síochána members are obliged to come from overnight duties, having arrested someone, and to sit in the court the next day to give evidence <i>viva voce</i> of arrest, charge and caution.  The whole notion of reducing that type of evidence to written form and allowing it to be presented to the court by an officer holding custody of <Col N="1238" /> all the prisoners coming from one police station seems to be a sensible development that would save huge costs in time and effort.  We did not get a chance to debate this idea on Committee Stage and I hope that tonight we will get that opportunity. It is raised in an important way by the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>For too long our District Courts as courts of summary justice have really been run on the basis that documentary notice or evidence has never been relied upon or supplied to the defence, either as an effort at fairness of procedure on the one hand, or at being efficient on the other.  I welcome this amendment because it takes on board a view raised by the Law Society, which I think will add substantially to the workings of the District Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have to have regard to one other point in giving effect to it. That is to ensure that members of An Garda Síochána have adequate secretarial back-up when they come to the District Court.  It is a phenomenon in the Dublin metropolitian police courts that the prosecution of most of the police cases in summary hearing is done by the Garda officers themselves, unlike in the provincial District Court, where the prosecution is done by an officer of the rank of inspector or occasionally superintendent and the inspector or superintendent is serviced by a secretarial staff and office located in his &mdash; rarely her unfortunately &mdash; police station.  It means that they come prepared with their brief so to speak.  The file is done out with all the statements typed up and witnesses assembled and there is good backup services to the prosecution there.  That does not happen in Dublin.  My understanding is that it is also a phenomenon in some of the busier larger urban provincial courts, where the Garda officers themselves do all the preparatory work.  From experience in Dublin I say it would be a very difficult task for members of An Garda Síochána, working in a busy Dublin police station, to type up and prepare written notices and have them available for service on the defence.  The Minister will have to act on this issue, either by enhancing the <Col N="1239" /> services in the State Solicitor's Office at Ship Street by expanding the secretarial services, if not the professional staff, there, or by ensuring that in the police stations from which the officers come there is adequate secretarial service available. Otherwise they will be very much burdened and unable to give full service. Ultimately many cases may have to be adjourned simply to provide adequate opportunity for the Garda to serve and make available the documentation.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development.  I hope it signals a new era to some degree in introducing common sense order into prosecutions in the District Court which in Dublin city are chaotic at the best of times, as anyone can see who cares to visit them.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) evidence may be admissible under this section by means of the rules set out in this Part, subject to the conditions herein as shall be applicable.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a straightforwad proposition that speaks for itself.  It deals with the admissibility of evidence.  I made this proposition on Committee Stage and the Minister of State undertook to look at the matter. He has not taken it up by way of his own amendments and I would like to hear the reasons that he believes it is unnecessary. If he has anything further to say on it I will listen to him and consider my position.  I <Col N="1240" /> repeated it simply to pursue the matter and make sure it would be aired at some stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan is quite right in saying I undertook on Committee Stage to look at it.  I have had it examined in the meantime in the light of the comments he made then.  The amendment is to section 9, which allows evidence to be given attacking the credibility of the person who has supplied the information contained in documents being made admissible under this part of the Bill. Deputy McCartan wishes to ensure that any such evidence of credibility can also be given by way of documentary evidence, provided the other conditions stipulated in this part of the Bill are complied with.  I am advised that there is nothing in the section to prevent this being done.  Indeed, paragraph (c) specifically provides for documentary evidence being admissible to prove that the supplier of information made a statement on another occasion which is inconsistent with the information supplied. The paragraph says that the inconsistent statement, which can be oral or in writing, shall, &ldquo;if not already admissible by virtue of section 5&rdquo;, be admissible for the purpose of showing that he has contradicted himself.  So it appears that no special provision is needed to make documentary evidence admissible for this purpose and I hope Deputy McCartan will be reassured on this point.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 44, to delete &ldquo;that Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This again is simply a repeat.  It struck me that the drafting of the section needed <Col N="1241" /> some attention.  The marginal heading of section 10 refers to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  Then the first paragraph of the section lists the paragraphs of the subsection it purports to amend. When it gets to paragraph (f), having referred in the previous paragraph to the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, it simply refers to &ldquo;that Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That could be construed as referring to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  I felt we should clarify that the term &ldquo;that Act&rdquo; referred to the 1992 Act as opposed to the 1967 Act.  The Minister has not taken on board my amendment.  If he can assure me that he is 100 per cent satisfied with the paragraph as it stands I will not press it.  I think it is somewhat ambiguous and unclear.  My amendment was designed to clarify the position beyond doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give Deputy McCartan that assurance.  As I said on Committee Stage, I have no objection in principle to his amendment but I do not think it is necessary because, as I understand it, it is clear that the expression &ldquo;that Act&rdquo; refers to the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  I have been advised by the parliamentary draftsman that paragraph (f), where the expression occurs, will now be part of section 10 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and that if reference were to be made to the 1967 Act in that section the expression used would have to be &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;.</P>

However, I am not going to ask the House to divide on this amendment.</P>

    <P>This amendment was discussed earlier so I presume we cannot discuss it further. Having made the case for this amendment, unfortunately I did not get a response from the Minister.  I do not know whether the Minister wants to respond to the points I made on this amendment.  I would have liked him to outline to the House his views on this amendment.  I explained in some detail the reasoning behind this amendment and dealt with an objection raised by the Minister on Committee Stage.  I do not know if the Minister can properly respond within the rules of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;(1) In any criminal proceedings before a court in which the parentage of any person is in question, the court may, either of its own motion or upon application being made to it, give a direction for the use of blood tests for the purpose of assisting the court to determine whether a person is or is not a parent of the person whose parentage is in question, and for the taking, within a period to be specified in the direction, of blood samples from the person whose parentage is so questioned, from any person alleged to be a parent of that person and from any <Col N="1244" /> other person or from any of those persons.</P>
    <P>(2) The court may at any time revoke or vary a direction previously given by it under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 16 to 22, inclusive, deal with the same matter.  They seek to insert a new Part in the Act to extend to the courts the power to provide for genetic finger-printing and to allow judges to order genetic finger-printing where disputes arise in criminal cases as to the parentage of a child.  All these amendments stand or fall together and, in the light of amendment No. 16 not succeeding, I do not see any reason to press the remaining amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) such other further offences as the Minister may prescribe by regulations agreed on motion by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to have particular regard to this amendment as I believe it deserves support.  It proposes to give the Minister the power at such future date as he or she considers appropriate to extend the operation of this Part of the Bill by an order of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill is restricted to dealing with certain types of offences.  Under section 11 it is specifically restricted to dealing with sexual offences, offences involving violence or the threat of violence to a person or attempts or conspiracy to commit such offences.  I accept that there has to be a start in some area and, because of the very difficult problems being encountered in cases involving sexual or marital violence or aggression towards women generally, I am happy that the Government and the Minister have elected to <Col N="1245" /> make a start in this area.  However, I earnestly hope this is only a beginning.</P>
    <P>This Part of the Bill deals with the entitlement of the court to hear evidence through a television link and the giving of testimony in reasonable surroundings, having regard to the traumatic nature of the charges, the age of the witness and their mental condition.  The Bill recognises as a matter of fact, if not principle, that the giving of evidence in the court in certain circumstances can be a very traumatic experience and that the production and presentation of that evidence can, by reason of those circumstances, be severely hindered.  We are trying to create a reasonable environment, using technology, multiple locations and intermediaries, which will assist people in giving their testimony.  It is accepted that the interests of justice have been frustrated in many cases for no other reason than the inability, reluctance or sheer terror of people in attempting to give their version of the facts as sought by the prosecution or, on occasion, the defence.</P>
    <P>I welcome this development in the area of criminal evidence generally and I hope it is only a beginning and that the considerations which apply in this area of the law can be applied to all our criminal law. The Minister should have no difficulty in accepting that an elderly victim of a serious robbery or burglary who has to identify in court the person whom he or she believes committed the crime will suffer as much trauma as a person who has to give evidence in a case involving sexual abuse or violence.</P>
    <P>The measures we are proposing in those cases should be extended to witnesses in all other appropriate cases.  My amendment proposes that rather than confining the provision to the offences as set out in section 11 we provide in the legislation for the extension of the provision to other offences as the Minister deems appropriate.  I also propose in the amendment that the Minister must seek the approval of the House by way of positive motion.</P>
    <P>It would be a pity if, having introduced this innovative idea into legislation, we simply leave it at that.  Any Minister and <Col N="1246" /> anyone with experience in this House will recognise that there is a long list of legislation to be dealt with in the House. It is not a simple or straightforward matter for Ministers to steer through legislation, be it of an innovative or amending nature.  Rather than a Minister at a future date realising that this is a sensible way to approach difficult cases generally and having to come back with amending legislation to change this section we should include in this Bill that general power so that at some stage in the future it would be simply a matter of seeking approval of the House by way of order or motion to extend the operation of the provision to other areas.</P>
    <P>This is an important proposition based upon the good principles and ideas in the Bill.  We should be working to extend the provision to all areas of criminal law as appropriate.  I agree with Deputy Taylor that the principles of this Part of the legislation should not be confined to criminal law but should be extended to cover many traumatic cases on the civil side also, cases in which people might be required to give evidence.  I recognise that we are dealing with criminal legislation but I am merely saying that we should at least give enabling powers so that as the process develops and we become more accustomed to it the Minister can come back to the House to extend its ambit to cover other areas.</P>

      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy McCartan proposes to allow the categories of offence to which this Part applies to be extended by ministerial regulation approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As things stand at the moment I am not sure that this is necessary.  As section 11 stands, Part III of the Bill applies to all sexual offences and any offences involving violence or the threat of violence.  These are offences which are recognised as causing severe trauma for young victims if they have to give evidence in court in the presence of the accused.  Sexual offence has been defined very comprehensively in section 2 and the reference to offences involving violence or the threat of violence <Col N="1247" /> is also extremely wide.  I am not aware of any other offences that need to be added to the list in section 11, but if there are any it would be better to add them now.  If on the other hand new offences are created in the future which are of a similar nature to those already listed in the section, or offences for which we want to extend the provisions of this Part of the Bill, the legislation creating the offences can provide for the application of this Part to them.  That would be a better way to give effect to what Deputy McCartan wishes to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in the amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan.  In one of his examples he painted the picture of an elderly person whose home is burglarised and who may not be subjected to physical violence. There may be no suggestion of an assault or a threat of violence but, nevertheless, that person may feel threatened in the context of what happened and may feel personally intimidated about giving evidence in a courtroom.  In those circumstances there would be a criminal charge based on burglary rather than on an attempt at assault or any other offence that comes within the ambit of section 11 as it is currently drafted and that, of course, would not be a new offence but one that has existed for some time.  I do not wish to delay the House but I could conjure up a number of other offences which do not fall within the area of sexual assault, physical assault or a threat of physical assault which could give rise to criminal proceedings and in respect of which a primary witness might be intimidated by court proceedings &mdash; they may be of an age at which they have difficulty coping with court processes.  That is just one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be merit in taking on board Deputy McCartan's suggestion.  I do not know whether the Minister has received advice as to the validity of additional offences being included by way of ministerial order as opposed to by the enactment of legislation, but it seems in the light of ministerial orders made under <Col N="1248" /> other legislation that that is possible.  This seems to be a sensible and constructive amendment.  We should not take the view that in the event of this approach working if a new offence is created we may wish, in legislation, to extend its ambit to this approach.  However there are a number of very old offences on our Statute Book for which it may be a good idea to give the courts discretion to allow evidence to be dealt with in the manner provided for in this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to take on board Deputy McCartan's suggestion.  It cannot do any ill to the Bill but can only assist it.  If it is not taken on board tonight perhaps the Minister would consider the suggestion in the context of the Seanad debate on this matter.  It is inevitable that some amendments will be made to the Bill in the Seanad.  If this type of approach was included in the Seanad and the Bill had to come back to this House it would be disposed of in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Minister's extraordinary silence on the whole series of amendments that I did not press this evening, I hope that between now and the Seanad debate the Minister will consider them.  There is no explanation on the record of the House on Report Stage to indicate why the Government were apparently opposed to those amendments. The Seanad will afford a further opportunity to improve the Bill in a constructive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many possible offences that could be covered by this provision &mdash; I have referred to one &mdash; and many circumstances in which the use of technological relay of evidence would be of great assistance.  If we accept the view that it is proper in some circumstances, I see no reason why it cannot be proper in all circumstances where it is considered an advantage.  As someone who has given testimony in criminal courts during my years of practice, I know that it can be a very daunting experience.  People of a very frail or nervous disposition may feel more at ease and have a better capacity to give testimony before the court, irrespective of <Col N="1249" /> the nature of the crime, if assisted in the way proposed.</P>
      <P>If it is right in some circumstances to aid people because of age or mental incapacity it is right to be disposed to extend that facility to all circumstances where in the interests of justice the person should be aided and assisted to feel more composed and at ease.  That is the basic idea behind this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is a remarkable twist of events when a Minister does not want further power and an opportunity to extend his own legislation.  Opposition spokespersons expect to be fighting against the Minister taking to himself various different powers and controls over legislation.  Here we are offering an opportunity to the Minister to take up an idea and build it into the legislation, which would enable the Minister to act by way of motion before the House at some future date, and it is being refused.  That is a pity.  This amendment would certainly not do any harm and it would be there for reference.  It should be there for reference and in order to expand on the good ideas here.</P>

      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 41 to 44.</P>
      <P>This proposition animated most of the discussion on Committee Stage.  The proposal was that in all proceedings under Part III of this Act and any preliminary proceedings relating to it, wigs and gowns should not be worn either by judge, barrister or solicitor acting in the proceedings. I was heartened to receive correspondence from a member of the Bar who outlined the history upon which wigs and gowns were first worn by members of the legal profession.  It apparently related to the reign of one of the Jameses and it was an element of fashion.  The fashion became the norm, but it appears that lawyers were not able to divest themselves of this fashion over the centuries and they still persist in wearing these odd garments.  We do not need to go into it at great length here.  The point was made that the requirement to wear the peculiar attire relates to some statutory provision and that the Bar have now come up with this ingenious proposition that they need legislation or some form of ministerial action to be taken before they can divest themselves of their attire.  Perhaps the Minister who was a member of the Bar may be able to advise us on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very long and somewhat animated discussion on this on Committee Stage.  The House should within reason legislate for this proposition.  As I understand now, from the deliberations of Committee Stage, there is all-party opinion in the House that the wearing of wigs and gowns is an anachronism and we should provide for abolition in our legislation where it is being suggested that in certain circumstances they should not be worn, namely when the television link system is being applied.  This should <Col N="1251" /> apply throughout the system regardless of the television link.  I hope the Minister will agree to the spirit if not the wording of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 27 implies that the provision in the section relating to the removal of wigs and gowns while evidence is being given through television link, will not apply where an intermediary is used, for the very good reason that where an intermediary is being used, the child witness will not be able to see the questioner.  There is, therefore, no need to bring in a legislative requirement to ask the barristers and the judge to divest themselves of their wigs and gowns.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 26, I undertook on Committee Stage to make inquiries and to consult the Bar Council about this.  Court dress is not merely a matter of convention.  Order 119 of the Rules of the Superior Courts states:</P>
      <P>3.  Senior and Junior Counsel shall appear, when in court, habited in a dark colour, and in such robes and bands and with such wigs as have heretofore been worn by Senior and Junior Counsel respectively, and no Counsel shall be heard in any case during the sittings unless so habited.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission which was asked to report on restrictive practices in the legal profession in 1990 said that lawyers should wear sober dress in court, but recommended the disappearance of wigs.</P>

      <P>That would be very difficult to enforce.  The report described wigs as being anachronistic and intimidatory. In an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> dated 3 May 1992, by Kevin Dawson, there are a number of comments by fairly senior members of the Bar on this topic. For example, Mr. Séamus McKenna, S.C., and former chairman of the Bar Council is quoted as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> Whatever about abolishing wigs, I would not be in favour of doing away with gowns.  At the end of the day you have to preserve some kind of dignity about court proceedings.  But I see no reason in the world to be against abolishing wigs.  They are terribly unhygienic and uncomfortable.</P>

      <P>Mr. Michael McDowell, S.C., and sometime politician, is quoted as saying:</P>
      <P>I wouldn't be particularly sorry to see wigs go.  I'm fond of it and I have a very nice one but I think there's a feeling in terms of public perception that it must not be a modern, up-to-date profession.</P>

      <P>It goes on:</P>
      <P>I don't see why gowns should be dropped and I think it would be wrong if people were to wear any old thing in court.</P>
      <P>A senior counsel in a letter to me recently said that citizens of this country often express amazement that barristers are forced by Order 119, Rule 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts to wear wigs in court and that many would choose not to do so if the choice was theirs.  He said also that many women consider it inappropriate to be required to wear an item of male apparel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I undertook to contact the Bar Council about this matter because I had been advised when replying on Committee Stage that the Bar Council had set up a small committee to consider court dress and that this committee <Col N="1253" /> were working most diligently and were shortly due to make a recommendation. Deputy McCartan, who is of a more suspicious nature than I, assured me there was a possibility that the council might be dragging things out, that the principle <i>nolumus mutari</i> might apply and that this was simply a stalling device. I spoke to the director of the Bar Council, Mr. John Dowling, who told me what was going on, but I requested something in writing which I could read into the record of the House.  Before I read the following letter, I enter a caveat that it may have been a mistake on Mr. Dowling's part or on my part, but Deputy McCartan was the only person who tabled an amendment on this matter on Committee Stage.  However, he was supported by Deputy Shatter and a number of other Deputies.  I may have wrongly given the impression that both Deputies had tabled amendments but since then I have corrected this point and I have made it clear that the amendment was tabled by Deputy McCartan but was supported by Deputy Shatter, among others.  I received the following reply, dated 29 May 1992, from the chairman of the Bar Council, Mr. Peter Shanley, Senior Counsel:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>As you requested in the course of a telephone conversation with our Director, John Dowling, on Thursday 28 May, I have set out below the current position of the Bar Council and the Bar as a body, on the questions of court dress and the Criminal Evidence Bill 1992.</P>
    <P>It is the strongly held view of the Bar generally that the proper administration of justice, the efficient conduct of court business, and the appropriate degree of respect for the rule of law is assisted by a number of very different factors.  When cases come to court, most especially the criminal courts where the reputation and liberty of the accused and others may be at stake, it is most important that all the participants in the court process are conscious of the fact that <Col N="1254" /> what is taking place is serious, that there are rules to be followed, most importantly the giving of truthful witness, and that wilful misleading of the court is not readily countenanced.  It is the very formality of the court, its procedures, including the attire and demeanour of legal representatives which together lead to an atmosphere where accused and witnesses cannot but be aware of the importance of the occasion.</P>
    <P>Any move which detracted from this degree of formality, which might be perceived as lessening the importance of the occasion, most particularly, but not exclusively in criminal cases, would be seen by practicing members of the Bar as a retrograde step.  Especially so in a process which is already under considerable strain and in which those seeking to maintain respect for the institutions of the administration of justice must seek to do so in surroundings which are often far from ideal.</P>
    <P>The Bar cannot see why advocates, who have a particular role to play in the court process, should not be entitled to retain distinguishing characteristics by way of attire in the conduct of court business.  Apart from the general points made above, from a straight-forward practical point of view, any person in frequent contact with the courts will readily comprehend the advantage to all concerned in court officials, gardai, counsel, prison officers and indeed the presiding judge, all having distinctive attire or uniform.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the question of court dress should be examined.  It is the view of the Bar that both the bench and the advocates before the court should, in the normal course, wear appropriate court attire. Irish barristers, traditionally, have worn wig and gown and the rules of the court lay down the requirements. The Bar itself has not got the authority to alter these rules which are made by the Superior Courts Committee.  It would be true to say that there is a <Col N="1255" /> divergence of opinion within the Bar only on the question of the continued use of the wig.  But even those who favour the abandoning of the wig are overwhelmingly of the view that an appropriate form of court dress should be retained.  In an effort to reach the broadest consensus on the matter the Bar at general meeting decided to have the position of court dress in Ireland examined in the light of the court dress used by advocates in the courts of the European Community.  A special committee was appointed by the Bar Council and has been considering the matter and collecting information from Bars of other EC jurisdictions.  We are aware that advocates and judges in all EC jurisdictions wear distinctive court dress, as do advocates and judges in the European Court and the Court of Human Rights.  We have also asked the Bars of the three neighbouring jurisdictions for indications of their views on revision of their current dress codes.  We have also written to other common law jurisdictions which have modified their dress code for advocates in recent times for information and views.  Although the general meeting last year gave no fixed date for the special committee to report, the committee itself expects to be able to report to the next annual general meeting which is due to be held in the term commencing 5 October 1992.</P>
    <P>On the question of taking evidence from children on two way video links, as proposed by the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992, the Bar Council accepts that children giving evidence, especially those who may have been abused by an authority figure, may need to be dealt with differently.  It is not proven that the form of dress of those in court who may be questioning the child has any bearing on the way in which the child may give its evidence, but the Bar Council is prepared to accept that it is not a matter on which it should take issue in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bar Council is aware that two Members of the Dáil&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" />&mdash;that is probably my mistake as I already mentioned&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;have tabled amendments to the Bill to extend the Bill's provisions with a view to prohibiting the wearing of court attire in all aspects of sexual abuse cases.  The Council is not aware on what basis this amendment is being proposed.  One cannot readily see, apart from the position of children, why one type of criminal case should be so singled out.  The Council has not been consulted by either of the Deputies concerned.  We believe that the abolition of court attire in the Family Law Courts has been, to say the least, a mixed blessing but we are not aware that the Deputies concerned have contacted the Family Laywers Association for views as to the impact of the changes made in this sector.  The Council is also concerned that these moves have been made without the kind of consultation and discussion which would be taken for granted in every other walk of life.  We believe that the approach taken by the Bar itself, in examining the appropriateness of its attire is the correct one, it is being done voluntarily in a methodical and sensible fashion.  It is proposed that the Bar will consider the report of the Committee on Court Dress in an equally sensible way.  The Council would hope that those concerned will take note that the profession last year undertook a major review of its practices and made far reaching changes in the way in which members of the Bar offer their services. We hope that members of the Government and the Oireachtas will accept that with respect to the matter of court dress the profession which has had a particular form of dress for more than 200 years, should be allowed to get on with its own review, which is now in progress, and that everybody, members of the Bar and others will then be in a more informed position to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>If there is any further information on this matter in which I may be of <Col N="1257" /> assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Peter Shanley SC,</P>
    <P>Chairman.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined my position on this matter.  In view of the fact that some distinguishing form of dress &mdash; a simple black gown, for example &mdash; is used in other EC jurisdictions, in the European Court and in the European Court of Human Rights, I can see the argument in favour of court dress; but personally I am totally opposed to a continuation of the practice of wearing wigs in court.  I have taken advice on the matter and I have been advised that if the Bar Council do not change their attire, which I think they should do voluntarily, we will be in a position to do so for them by way of legislation in this House.  I am loath to accept the amendment in the name of Deputy McCartan because it gives rise to the undesirable situation that in one category of criminal case, counsel would not wear wigs and gowns but that in cases outside the family law area they would wear wigs and gowns.  Let us suppose that the Bar Council in their wisdom decide to at least get rid of wigs while retaining some form of simple gown in court, they would not be able to wear this simple gown in such cases because of the effect of this legislation.  I do not wish to create that anomaly.  If we so desire we could include a provision in every piece of related legislation that wigs and gowns should not be worn, but that would represent something akin to the Chinese method of death by a thousand cuts.  I would prefer to see it done at one fell swoop.</P>
    <P>I am giving the Bar the opportunity to change their mode of attire, particularly in relation to the removal of wigs.  They have told me they expect the committee to report before the end of the year, within the term commencing on 5 October. I hope to meet them between now and then and I will make it clear that if they do not agree to abandon the <i>nolumus mutari</i> attitude they will be changed.  I do not want to be responsible for legislation <Col N="1258" /> which could create an anomalous position within a short time.  I am using this opportunity to express the wish, desire and hope that the Bar Council are serious when they say they will make changes in this regard in the very near future.  I will use the opportunity when I meet them to tell them that if they do not change they will be changed.</P>

      <P>I listened with some interest to the Minister's response and with some incredulity to the contents of the letter which he read.  I have achieved one or two things in politics.  One of my achievements was getting the Judicial Separation Bill through this House. While there was controversy about all sorts of provisions in the Bill, there was very little controversy about the provision which requires members of the Bar and the Judiciary to get rid of wigs and gowns in family law cases.  That applies in the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and equally to the Supreme Court hearing appeals.</P>
      <P>I am one of very few solicitors who appear relatively regularly in both the High Court and Supreme Court in cases, all of which are of importance to the people involved and some of which are of considerable importance in the general area of family and constitutional law. Prior to 1989 I very often found myself standing naked in the High Court and Supreme Court, left with nothing but my suit, tie and shirt, while members of the Bar, often two senior and junior counsel, all bewigged and begowned, would be on the opposing side.  I never felt that the job I was doing was any less serious than the job they were doing just because I did not have a slightly moth-eaten investment sitting on my head and a large gown trailing behind me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come to abolish wigs and gowns.  We did it in family law cases in the 1989 Act.  I listened with astonishment to the statement by the current leader of the Bar that this was a mixed blessing in family law cases.  I have not seen any problems arising from it.  It has reduced some of the intimidatory formality which used to be part of family law cases, when <Col N="1259" /> unfortunate couples whose marriages were at an end went to war with each other in the court system rather than resolving their difficulties by agreement in a more civilised way.  It has taken a little bit of the heat out of it.  I am happy to report that justice is still being properly administered in the courts three years after the passage of that Act, despite the fact that the judges and the barristers have lost their wigs and gowns.  There is no real lack of formality.  The importance of the occasion is not lost on the unfortunate people who find themselves in court.  To suggest the solemnity of the occasion is in some way lost because the wigs and gowns have been taken away is bordering on the ridiculous.  For the Bar or any member of the Bar to say that to abolish wigs and gowns would pose a threat to the proper administration of justice and the importance of formality of the occasion is idicative of how out of touch with reality the Bar is.  I welcome the Minister's comments.  If the Bar will not voluntarily dip into the 20th century they should be dragged screaming into it.</P>
    <P>Have members of the Bar ever considered how ludicrous they look in their manner and mode of dress, which is some 200 years old and certainly 100 years out of date.  If you or I wandered down Grafton Street wearing a barrister's wig we would be given very odd looks by the passers-by.  If one stands back and observes members of the Bar in their mode of dress it adds a degree of ludicrousness to the situation.  This was highlighted some years ago in an excellent piece written by Nell McCafferty in <i>The Irish Times.</i> She reported a case at District Court level.  Not all District Court judges wear wigs nowadays, but in those days they all did.  A district justice was sitting in court No. 6 in Morgan Place in Dublin wearing his wig and gown when there came before him a member of the Hare Krishna movement who had been arrested in Grafton Street while walking along the street chanting and jingling their bells.  The judge apparently ticked off the accused people in the dock and suggested that their mode of dress indicated <Col N="1260" /> their lack of respect for the court and also clearly indicated that they were people of some obvious criminal intent and that it was as well that the guards had lifted them in Grafton Street.  Nell McCafferty, in a realistic remark, observed that the Hare Krishna people perhaps looked more like many other people in the mid-20th century, particularly young people, than the judge sitting in court wearing the garb of his forefathers that no one would be seen dead wearing in the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that in other jurisdictions on occasion lawyers have distinguishing characteristics such as wearing a form of robe.  In the European Court members of the Irish Bar manage to appear with great solemnity and a great deal of distinction and present their cases without wearing wigs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>My recollection is that they do not wear gowns.  The English, who tend to be rather quaint in these things, take their wigs and gowns to the European Court.  The Irish Bar have achieved a degree of distinction at the European Court by moving away from the colonial times, which, it appears, they still have a great deal of affection for when they sit in this island.  In the area of legal expertise their cerebral regions have functioned admirably well in the European Court without their having to wear wigs and gowns.  Deputy McCartan's amendments have again given us the opportunity to discuss this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that if we abolish wigs and gowns for some criminal cases we should abolish them for all criminal cases, indeed we should abolish them completely.  They add nothing to the administration of justice or to the solemnity of matters.  Is it not extraordinary that lawyers in the United States Supreme Court and lower courts all manage to function with great distinction without wearing this rather quaint, outdated garb which has been handed down through our colonial past?  The time has <Col N="1261" /> long since come when we should get rid of it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if for no reason other than to satisfy a personal curiosity, to send a reply to that particular letter and to ask Mr. Shanley to expand on the mixed blessing, to which he referred, in the context of the removal of wigs and gowns in the area of family law for barristers.  The only mixed blessing that I can recall which helped to highlight the idiosyncratic nature of the garb of the Bar Library was a case in which I was not invoved but which took place some weeks after the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, became operative.  I am informed there was a very substantial family law case involving a dispute between a husband and wife which took place in or about December 1989 in which there was a great deal of money and property at stake.  In effect the husband and wife were doing battle with each other in the courts as to how the family assets should be dealt with on their separation.  I understand there was also a family company in which each of them had shares.  The entire proceedings derived from a marital breakdown problem but the case had, in legal terms not only a judicial separation element in the context of the 1989 Act but also a company law element.</P>
    <P>Apparently this caused a great deal of distress to members of the Bar.  Barristers on each legal team had a meeting on the morning before the case to decide how they should dress.  The Judicial Separation Act said they should not wear their wigs and gowns but they were concerned that the company law element in the case might require that they should. As I understand it, they decided that the nature of the case had derived from a marital problem and one team did not want to appear with wigs if the other team was not wearing them and <i>vice versa.</i> There was agreement on both sides that no wigs and gowns would be worn for the hearing of the case.  They all went into the High Court suitably bereft of wigs and gowns.  They sat in court and waited for the judge to come out.  When the judge came out they all bowed to each other as is their tradition.  The judge <Col N="1262" /> and the legal team sat down and much to the horror of the legal team the judge appeared in wig and gown.  The judge obviously concluded that the company element of the case dictated that rule 119, which the Minister has read out, required the wearing of wigs and gowns.</P>
    <P>Nothing was said by judge or counsel during the course of that morning.  The counsel got together at lunchtime and decided this was mortally embarrassing and that they had better put their wigs and grows back on.  They put their wigs and gowns back on and walked into court at 2 o'clock.  The judge came in and they all bowed to each other and the counsel sat down dressed in their wigs and gowns, Whey they looked up at the judge they discovered that he had got rid of his wig and gown because he had reached the conclusion that under the 1989 Act he should not have been wearing it.  Needless to say neither judge nor counsel said anything to each other about their attire during the course of the afternoon.  Harmony was restored on the following day when the case proceeded to the second day of hearing and everyone agreed that the wigs and the gowns could be abandoned. I think they should be abandoned. It is ludicrous that the rules of the superior court contain the provision which the Minister read out and with which I am familiar.</P>
    <P>To highlight the idiosyncratic nature of it, I recall another High Court case in which I was personally involved some years ago and in which a very learned and respected junior counsel was appearing opposite me.  We were at the end of day two of the case, and as a solicitor I was no more properly dressed than I am here and the barrister was wearing his wig and gown.  The judge indicated that he wished to call us both into his room because he had a serious message which he wished to communicate.  I did not know whether I had offended the judge in some way that might be to the detriment of the people I was representing or why we were being called in like naughty school children. The barrister who was on the other side did not appear to know either why we were being called in.  The reason we <Col N="1263" /> were called in was that the judge had reached the conclusion that the barrister under the code of dress of the Bar Library was not properly dressed; that is, he had not worn a waistcoat.  It was a hot day, he had been in court all day and was wearing his suit and his wig and gown but no waistcoat.  The barrister got a very serious ticking off by the judge for not wearing his waistcoat.  Of course I had no waistcoat either but he did not have to tick me off because I was, happily, a solicitor and solicitors are not required, under rule 119, to do anything in particular.</P>
    <P>The reason I was called in to witness the embarrassment of the barrister was that the judge was concerned to ensure that I did not feel he was having a private chat with the barrister which was in any way prejudicial to the case.  If any of that can be regarded as adding to the solemnity of the administration of justice or the credibility of it I have serious and grave doubts.  We should get rid of wigs and gowns, and waistcoats could be worn voluntarily, and I ask the Minister in the context of what he is doing to look to the Bar to keep to the time scale they are talking about.  If by 31 December 1992 he has not received a letter from the Bar informing him of radical changes in the mode of dress and if there is not a sitting of the superior court rules committee to amend rule 119, the Minister should early in the New Year, introduce the legislation required to kick the cobwebs out of the Bar Library and to bring them fully and properly into this century and lead them by the hand into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unbelievable that we have spent the last 42 minutes discussing this amendment and this antiquated procedure. For obvious reasons it is being discussed with greater gusto than any other element of his Bill.  As one who has spent very little time in court at any stage during my life and having listened to the latter, I think it is unbelievable in the modern world that people would insist on maintaining this antiquated approach to their business.  I get the suspicion that <Col N="1264" /> they are hopeful that when the report comes in it will come down firmly on the side of the wigs and gowns.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are not familiar with court proceedings could well imagine that people appearing in court for the first time could be upset when they see these people dressed in such an unnatural fashion.  That would be the most ludicrous part of it for the ordinary lay person.  If we were to come to the conclusion that this interferred with the normal course of justice, then we should immediately take appropriate steps.  Not alone is it antiquated and a relic of previous centuries but many people who attend court for the first time would be knocked sideways by the visual impact they would have to suffer, something they would never have seen before except perhaps in comic books.  It puts an additional stress on people who are already in stressful situations.  If the House were to judge that that was a regular occurrence, then we would have a valid case for removing rule 119, with which I am not very familiar, or at least what they wear make voluntary.  Once you say people cannot wear this and that you must specify what they may wear.  If it was voluntary I wonder whether people would wear elegant wellingtons into court and upset people's sensitivities.  It would be rather a surprise if someone were to go into court wearing short trousers but it would not be imtimidating. My feeling is that the rule should be done away with immediately and we should do so if we have to power.  We should leave it to the opinions of people outside to do the decent thing at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the opportunity to make a brief comment in reply as the mover of the amendment.  If the House would bear with me for a moment, I have an anecdote to add to those related by Deputy Shatter.  There <Col N="1265" /> is a story told of a man, now a judge who in his early days as a barrister appearing before the late Mr. Justice Murnaghan in the High Court duly togged out in the attire that barristers wore then and still do.  After he addressed the court, the judge looked at him and said, &ldquo;I am sorry, I cannot hear you.&rdquo;.  The young barrister raised his voice a little so that the judge might well hear him.  The judge in a stern voice, as he was wont to do, remarked again, &ldquo;I am sorry, I cannot hear you&rdquo;.  The young barrister, who was getting a little uneasy, turned up the decibel level just a little further and no one could be in any doubt that everyone in the court, including the judge, could hear him.  Mr. Justice Murnaghan again said, &ldquo;I am sorry, I cannot hear you&rdquo;. At that stage a senior member of the Bar told the barrister that he was wearing the wrong coloured shirt that was not in keeping within the orders or the tone of what was expected &mdash; apparently it was a little too bright or gaudy. The barrister had to withdraw and change his attire.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must be thanked for corresponding, and I also appreciate Mr. Shanley's efforts in making a lengthy and detailed reply.  This is not an issue that should delay the House but it is of some significance.  The amendment recognises that those people we are going to hear and see by way of a television link and who have difficulties because of age and so on relating to the nature of a charge should be accommodated by being addressed by people who are attired normally.  That is a reasonable proposition with which the Bar says it does not intend to take issue.  It would add to the comfort of the person being exmained in that he or she would not be addressed by someone attired in a wig and gown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for introducing this proposition are the same as those forwarded for the introduction of the proposition in family law courts.  I would have to take issue with Mr. Shanley and the Bar Council if they hold to the position that it has not been a good and progressive phenomenon in the family law courts.  Any report <Col N="1266" /> I have had is that the concept works well and is well appreciated.  No one has ever suggested that the dignity of those courts has been interfered with or eroded in any way due to the absence of wigs and gowns.</P>
    <P>An interesting feature of Order 119 is its reference to the need for attire to be worn in courts during the sittings.  If one goes to any vacation sitting of the High Court held throughout August and September one will find crowded courts occupied by judges and barristers who are wearing not wigs and gowns but ordinary, decent, sober dress.  It would be ludicrous for anyone to suggest that the dignity of those courts and assemblies is missing.  In relation to the issues that are tried at length in those sittings, issues and cases that would be dealt with in a normal High Court sitting, such as a bail application or a point that would arise by way of injunction, no one would suggest that the truth is not arrived at or that witnesses all of a sudden become giddy and throw scorn at the courts.  The dignity of the court is maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we were adopting a piecemeal approach.  On Committee Stage I had something to say about that. The first thing I must say about a piecemeal approach is that the Minister's amendment, and the order in which the legislation is being brought in, will require, during an actual case, lawyers and the judge to go to the court dressed in one garb; when a certain stage is reached in the proceedings they will have to take that garb off and throw it underneath their seat, bench or table and, when that portion of the evidence is concluded, the lawyers and judge will put that garb back on.  That is a ridiculous, piecemeal approach to the issue.  The carnival for which the Minister is legislating, and the way he is going about it, is preposterous. With all due respect, it is a ridiculous proposition.</P>
    <P>I am proposing an amendment within the confines of the legislation we are debating.  The Minister is proposing a regime of television link in certain cases. He has rejected my idea that he should hold the power to extend that concept <Col N="1267" /> as circumstances arise but criticised me when I suggested introducing some order to the way proceedings may be conducted because that order is being confined to a certain range of offences.  The Minister has borrowed a rather disingenuous argument from Mr. Shanley.  Mr. Shanley asks why, if it is to be introduced in one instance, it is not being introduced in all cases.  I am using the legislation as drafted and working within the parameters as presented to me.  I am merely saying that, rather than have the preposterous practice that half-way through a case when there is a move to the television screen all of the gear comes off, at the outset lawyers and the judge simply should not wear the garb.  If that proposal was taken on board it would act as an incentive to help those concerned with the voluntary process we hear talk about.  As other Deputies said, eventually those concerned would come to their senses.</P>
    <P>I also wish to take issue with Mr. Shanley on his complaint that I did not consult the Bar Council.  I do not believe it is my duty to go about seeking consultation with and taking advice from various agencies.  I consider the Legislature to be the primary arena in this context. It is a matter for the Bar Council to be appraised of and addressed on the deliberations and considerations of what goes on in this House.  If they see fit they should convey to me their views on whatever matter is current and relevant within the context of legislation.  I do not have any regard to Mr. Shanley's remarks with respect to the Family Lawyers Association because I am well advised as to the experiences in that regard and I have to disagree with his views on that.</P>
    <P>I felt it appropriate to make those points in response to the debate.  I am happy the Minister of State has put on record a very firm view.  I am equally thankful to other Members who contributed to the debate and made their views known, on Committee Stage and Report Stage.  Although this discussion has taken some time, it has nonetheless been very useful and fruitful.</P>

Having spent the last hour criticising the Bar for wearing wigs and gowns it is ironic to be in this position.  I do not know what the temperature is in this part of the Chamber.  I went outside for a few moments and found that it is considerably cooler.  I reckon that the temperature here is probably in the region of 70º or 75º.  I do not wish to be disorderly and perhaps the Members present &mdash; there are not too many of us &mdash; would agree to suspend the rules of the House to get the Bill through this evening.  Conditions are intolerable and I do not think we should have to put up with them.  I said this a number of weeks ago.  I do not know what is happening in the Committee on Procedure and Priv- <Col N="1269" /> ileges.  We have been discussing this Bill since 3.45 p.m. and there is no reason for sitting, sweltering, in this Chamber at 10.15 p.m.  It is thoroughly unpleasant.</P>

I ask you, Sir, to take the same commonsense and pragmatic approach which you did on the last occasion so that we will not delay the proceedings of the House.  I am as anxious as any other Member to complete this Bill but we have at least another hour to go and conditions are appalling.</P>

However, it is my duty to uphold the rules of the House and instead of taking issue any further with Deputy Shatter, we will adjourn for ten minutes during which time the Chamber could be cleared of some of the uncomfortable air.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I be of help to you, Sir?  I regret the fact that we adjourned for ten minutes, having regard to the serious business before the House, as I am anxious to get on with the debate on this Bill which is a very important one.  I do not want to delay the House any further or, because of my personal regard for you and my friendship with you, to put you in any more difficulty or cause you any embarrassment.  I certainly do <Col N="1272" /> not want to be put out of the House.  That is the last thing I want to see happen.</P>
      <P>I and the other Members of the House who have been engaged in the debate on this Bill have used the time that you extended to us to consider the position. It is my understanding that there is nothing in the Standing Orders of this House with regard to modes of dress.  I gather that the view that is being taken is that it is traditional to wear jackets.  I should point out again, as I did four weeks ago, that it is also traditional to wear ties but it seems that Deputy Gregory does not have to wear one. Indeed, it also appears that women Members of this House are not required to wear jackets.  It seems, therefore, that we have rather odd and inconsistent traditions.</P>
      <P>Having looked into the position, I understand also that it is both your wish, as you have stated, and that of the Ceann Comhairle that an air conditioning system should be provided in the Chamber. The problems in this Chamber are not due to weather conditions only &mdash; they are partly to blame &mdash; as you have correctly stated, they are also due to the heat caused by the special lighting for the television cameras.  It is my understanding that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which includes the Ceann Comhairle, held a meeting and that they were of the view that we should have an air conditioning system in the Chamber.  I also understand that a request was made to the Department of Finance for funds to provide such a system but this request has been turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much value your support and that of the Ceann Comhairle in seeking to have proper working facilities provided in this House.  In deference to you and out of respect for you and the workings of this House I have no desire to delay matters further as I am very conscious that Members on all sides of the House are discommoded by the fact that we are sitting late and that this is adding to the difficulty.  However, I hope that I have highlighted again this evening the problem facing us.  I appreciate the support <Col N="1273" /> of my colleague, Deputy Cotter, who has been sitting with me, but I do not think my hay fever has caused this problem.  The problem has been caused by the heat in the Chamber which from time to time affects every Deputy.</P>
    <P>In deference to you, Sir, it is my intention to put my jacket back on but I should say that unless the Department of Finance provide the necessary funding for an air conditioning system in this House I will not on a future occasion, if I have to spend five or six hours in the House to carry out serious legislative work and I find the conditions totally unacceptable, sit here wearing more clothes than are necessary for the purposes of a tradition which has no relevance having regard to the fact that we now have special lighting for the television cameras.  I have been reliably told that the temperature at this time of night in this Chamber is 75 degrees.  It is unacceptable that we have to work in this heat and that we should preserve a tradition whereby we are expected to wear jackets in view of the fact that the Department of Finance will not provide funds for an air conditioning system in the Chamber.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am going to put my jacket back on in the hope that we can get on with the business of the House. I hope also that if other Members feel uncomfortable between now and midnight when we conclude the debate on this Bill they will be allowed some leeway with regard to the need to wear jackets. I am very tempted to put my jacket back on and to take my tie off but I am concerned that this would lead to the time we have left being reduced.  Given that Deputy Gregory can go around without a tie I do not know the reason the Gregory alternative cannot be offered to other Members.</P>

      <P>The Chair appreciates that Deputy Shatter, like the Chair, is enduring mental and physical discomfort.  As I said in regard to the protestations made some time ago I assumed the Committee on Procedure and Privileges had dealt with this matter. I wish to indicate that it should be dealt <Col N="1274" /> with at the next meeting.  Irrespective of the cost, this House requires the best available and it is no excuse to say that the money is not available to create an environment here which is amenable to the pursuit of the obligations and responsibilities that are upon us.  On the other hand, Deputy Shatter will appreciate that as I sit here I have to carry the rules as they are before me.  These are stated and traditional.  I should say to Deputy Shatter that he can from now on allow me to reverse positions and I will act as his advocate in the hope that we can get a satisfactory result both for him and the rest of the House.</P>

In the light of the difficulties we have experienced in the House today, perhaps you would ask the Ceann Comhairle to convene a special meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this week to convey our concerns again to the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to say that nothing I am saying should be taken in any way as criticism of the staff of this House, who some hours ago very kindly supplied me with my own personal fan during the course of our deliberations and which resulted in some colleagues complaining that their papers were being blown round the Chamber.  However, we must solve the problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 5 to 8, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;the&rdquo; in line 5, down to and including &ldquo;conducted.&rdquo; in line 8 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the interests of justice require that any questions to be put to the witness <Col N="1275" /> be put through an intermediary, direct that any such questions be so put.</P>
    <P>(2) Questions put to a witness through an intermediary under this section shall be either in the words used by the questioner or so as to convey to the witness in a way which is appropriate to his age and mental condition the meaning of the questions being asked.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to the experience we have just had and since Deputy Shatter is a sometime novelist himself, he may be familiar with one of George Orwell's less well known but, in my opinion, better novels entitled <i>Coming Up for Air</i>, which adequately describes the process we have just gone through.  Lest my silence be misconstrued, I want to add my voice to that of the other Members who have spoken about these difficulties.  The conditions in this Chamber, particularly when one has been here for quite some time, are quite unbearable.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the efforts and representations he has made in this regard which I hope will bear fruit.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to clarify the role of an intermediary in response to several amendments tabled on this point on Committee Stage.  I have taken particularly on board Deputy McCartan's comments on Committee Stage that the wording of the explanatory memorandum was clearer than that of the actual text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>First of all, this amendment makes it clear that it is only the questions being put in the course of the examination of the witness that will be put through the intermediary.  The replies of the witness, as well as the questions put by the intermediary, of course, will be heard in the courtroom.  The amendment also makes it clear that the intermediary can either repeat the actual words of the question or can use words which convey to the witness the meaning of the questions being asked in a way that is appropriate to his or her age and mental condition. If it happens that the intermediary does not convey the meaning of a question <Col N="1276" /> properly, the questioner can ask her &mdash; it will normally be a female &mdash; to rephrase it.  The questioner's dialogue with the intermediary will be on audio link so that a young witness will not be aware of it. Indeed, in cases where an intermediary is used, the witness will not see or hear anything of what is going on in the courtroom.</P>
    <P>There was some concern expressed on Committee Stage about the possibility that an intermediary might prompt a witness, say, by gesturing, or might otherwise influence the answer to be given.  Of course, such conduct would be highly improper.  But the possibility of its happening, and of its happening not being detected, is remote.  The intermediary is appointed by the trial judge.  She &mdash; as I have said, in most cases, it will be a female &mdash; must be a responsible person who in the opinion of the judge is competent to perform that function.  Before she brings the child to the witness room it is to be assumed that she will be properly instructed by the judge as to what is her function, what she should or should not do.  No doubt as time progresses intermediaries gain more and more experience, the need for such detailed instruction may diminish.  In addition, the judge will have the facility of seeing continuously the whole of the witness room on the separate monitor.</P>
    <P>I believe that this amendment will clarify the role of the intermediary and I hope it will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee Stage concerns I had about the provision I have repeated on Report Stage.  When replying I should be glad if the Minister would deal with one or two worries I have.  I accept that he is making a valid effort to meet some of the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  The question of the definition of the role of the intermediary is clarified in the Minister's amendment; yet the amendment and the section are silent on whether the intermediary has any function in relating back a witness's reply to the court.  It is essential that the testimony of a witness be given by the witness alone &mdash; in other words, at all <Col N="1277" /> stages the replies must be conveyed to the judge or jury by the witness and nobody else.</P>
      <P>I know the section will stipulate that any question be put to the witness through the intermediary and so on.  The section will talk only of the putting of questions through the intermediary.  But the fact that the person is to be described as an intermediary can be a two-way process. I want to ask the Minister of State why he did not see fit to make a specific pronouncement that the function of the intermediary is a one-way process only, namely, to convey in intelligible form to the witness the question being asked, stating specifically that the intermediary's role would be to that extent only &mdash; in other words, that at no stage would the intermediary have any function in relating back, or re-interpreting, what a witness seeks to say.</P>
      <P>I do not support amendment No. 30 in Deputy Shatter's name.  I prefer the sense of what the Minister seeks to do.  His idea is to use professional people, trained to help a witness understand perhaps technical or legalistic questions difficult for the witness to comprehend.  The whole basis of the idea incorporated in this section, which I fully support, involves a translation in many instances, if not all, of the language of the courtroom into the language of the person being asked the question.  The idea is a mechanism to facilitate the delivery of good testimony, to account and relate to the court the experiences of a witness in a particular set of vulnerable circumstances.  On this amendment I am departing from Deputy Shatter's view.  I will be happy to support the Minister's amendment as an advance on mine, although I am concerned about the absence of a specific proposition in the Minister's amendment curtailing and ensuring that the intermediary has no function in relating back the replies of the witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to place on the record, as I have done previously, that I have grave reservations about the use of this so-called intermediary.  I can foresee an intermediary fulfilling a certain function. <Col N="1278" /> Indeed, the Law Reform Commission sought to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>First, one wants to ensure that the victim of a serious assault, physical or sexual, is provided a degree of protection. One wants also to ensure that any other witness, particularly a young witness, is provided a degree of protection in the context of the manner in which courts work, in the context of coming into contact with an alleged perpetrator of a serious offence.  However, the balance has to be maintained.  If we begin with the principle that somebody is innocent until proved guilty, one essential way of determining guilt or innocence, or indeed the truth of an account of an event, is the use of the technique of cross-examination by the lawyers representing an accused person.  The manner in which one cross-examines somebody may vary, depending on the age of the person, their experiences and the nature of the offence.  Indeed, when barristers seek to cross-examine young people at present judges can exercise some degree of restraint on the manner in which an issue is pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise with the Minister how he envisages cross-examination working in circumstances in which there is an intermediary.  Let us assume there has been an allegation of a serious sexual assault, or indeed a rape, of some person. Let us assume a defendant or an accused person is saying there was no rape, that there was consensual sexual intercourse. Let us now assume that the court appoints an intermediary.  It is the function of the court to get at the truth.  It is the function of the lawyer representing an accused person, who is adamant about his innocence, to try to ascertain whether the witness giving evidence, who is the alleged victim of a sexual assault or rape, is actually telling the truth.  Cross-examination has a very important function in that.  The putting of questions, upon getting a response the immediate putting of the next question, the manner in which the questions are phrased, may indeed be crucial in helping to elicit the turth of an incident.  If an intermediary is going to communicate the questions in a more <Col N="1279" /> consumer-friendly language than not simply in that used by the lawyer cross-examining, there is a great danger that the truth may not be reached.  Often a witness in the witness box under pressure tells the truth which, in the absence of pressure, is not up to that moment being told.  The difficulty is to find a balance.  I am seriously concerned that in introducing the intermediary we may certainly be providing a further protection for a victim of a very appalling offence, but we may also be opening the door to convictions being sustained when allegations are falsely made and innocent people go to jail.</P>
    <P>I would raise some reservations about the constitutional validity of the provision relating to the function of the intermediary. The use of the intermediary could at some future date be interpreted as not allowing due process of law in the trial of someone on a criminal charge, on the basis that an accused is presumed innocent and not presumed guilty.  The functioning of the intermediary may block the proper hearing and processing of a criminal trial.  I want to caution the Minister about this.  The Ministers amendment is a well-intended provision to meet some of the problems, objections and difficulties we have discussed, but there is a fundamental problem here that we may be ignoring.  On the basis that I do not have a majority for my views on this &mdash; though I think I have a public duty to put those views on the record of this House &mdash; I tabled an amendment which does not seek to remove the section in relation to the intermediary or get rid of the role of the intermediary but which seeks at least to delimit the manner in which an intermediary can operate.  I am proposing in amendment No. 30 a provision which is certainly at variance with the Minister's approach and that of Deputy McCartan.  The amendment reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) An intermediary shall ask the witness any questions asked by the judge, barrister or solicitor concerned in the examination of the witness and <Col N="1280" /> shall not deviate from the phraseology of the question asked nor interpose any comment on such question nor on the reply given.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The latter part of that provision addresses some of the difficulties Deputy McCartan has regarding the Minister's amendment being silent about the intermediary intervening other than simply to repeat questions. My amendment could at least amend the section to allow it to retain some degree of constitutional propriety and allow for a coherent cross-examination to take place.</P>
    <P>Due process of law requires that the lawyers representing a defendant can in their own manner consider how to establish the defendant's innocence by determining the order of questions to be asked in a cross-examination and the manner in which the questions should be put.  This provision deviates from that in that it certainly interferes with the manner in which questions are put.  There is a problem with this section.  My amendment would at least amend that problem which will remain and, indeed, in a sense be copperfastened by the Minister's provision which allows the words used by the lawyer conducting a cross-examination to be phrased in a different way that the intermediary regards as appropriate to the particular witness.  An intermediary may judge that it is appropriate to a particular witness and he may wrongly make the judgement that a question should be rephrased.  The rephrasing of the question may undermine the cross-examination being conducted by the lawyer for the accused.  If the intermediary judgement is wrong in this, it raises a serious issue.  When is the intermediary to make a judgment that a question should be phrased or rephrased?  I do not know the answer to that, I can see substantial cases of trials within trials developing on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister means well in this provision but I am concerned about some of its implications.  I am sure he is not going to take my amendment on board or accept what I am saying.  I hope I am proved wrong.  I would be happy to be <Col N="1281" /> proved wrong in this instance, but I fear greatly that we may come back to this in amending legislation within a relatively short period after this Bill becomes operative and after a small number of cases have been dealt with in this way with an intermediary.  If a trial at first instance operates this section and if a conviction is obtained that perhaps should be properly obtained because an accused is truly guilty of an offfence.  I am concerned that due to the technical and, possibly, constitutional problems that could arise with this section, a conviction could ultimately be set aside that should be sustained because an accused was involved in the events that were prosecuted.  I will say no more on that, but I have concerns and reservations about the whole role of the intermediary.  I believe those concerns and reservations are exacerbated somewhat by aspects of the Minister's amendment while another aspect he is trying to address refers to some of the problems that were envisaged on both Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Shatter's attempt to take a middle line on the issue of the intermediary, but I have doubts whether that is warranted.  The basis of the role of the intermediary is that the evidence that can be given by this witness is not in the normal way sufficiently clear or coherent.  If the questions are to be simply a repeat by the intermediary of the identical wording posed by the solicitor or barrister in the courtroom, what exactly is the need for the intermediary?  I am concerned about the whole concept.  I sympathise with the Minister's intent to a very large measure and I respect fully his bona fides in the matter, but at the end of the day we are talking about criminal charges, serious offences, not trifling things.  We are talking about a very serious position arising for the accused in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to justify conviction for any offence, particularly a serious offence, two things are required: first, coherent evidence and, second, reliable evidence. In the absence of those two tests there should not be a conviction for a serious <Col N="1282" /> criminal charge.  This begs the question: if a witness in a case is not capable of giving evidence in a sufficiently reliable and coherent manner will he or she be capable of giving that evidence through an intermediary?  It may be regrettable if a person whom the State believes has committed an offence goes free.  That happens from time to time by reason of a witness not being available, there being no witness, or whatever.  One can be drawn too far down the road of trying to set up coherent, acceptable and reliable evidence when the reality is that, regrettably, it may not be there and may not be warranted.</P>
    <P>One can visualise a situation where a relationship or rapport of a type may develop between the intermediary and the witness. Rephrasing of the questioning may take place which would tend by the way it is put &mdash; for example the tone, the intonation, a look, the raising of an eyelid or a suggestion &mdash; to draw an answer which might perhaps not otherwise be obtainable or would not be forthcoming spontaneously from the witness.  This is a real danger.  If this danger exists we ought to exercise very great caution before we go along with that proposition.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of the introduction of the intermediary concept is to some extent debasing and taking away from what is or should be the role of the judge at a trial.  The judge should have a responsibility to look after a witness in this category.  If necessary, he could be given authority by way of legislation to ensure that questions are phrased carefully and simply and are easily understood by the witness both on examination and cross-examination, and to exercise control and constraint on solicitors and counsel involved in the examination and cross-examination of the witness.  I believe judges have that role even now and I am sure they exercise it where young witnesses are concerned and where problems of one kind or another arise in regard to the witness.  To remove that responsibility and control of a trial from a judge raises a question mark as to <Col N="1283" /> whether judges can be relied upon to exercise that degree of supervision in their own court.  I think that is an unfair suggestion.  I believe that by and large judges can be relied upon to exercise that control and to adopt a sympathetic and understanding approach to a witness who may have mental or physical difficulties.</P>
    <P>The nub of the matter is whether evidence can safely and beyond a reasonable doubt be relied on if the only way it is obtainable for the court is through an intermediary.  I must say I have grave doubts as to whether that is the position. This is an issue which requires very considerable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>We kicked this issue around quite a bit on the last occasion we discussed it.  Many of us expressed grave doubts at that stage about the operability of the system and whether it would be sustainable.  Obviously, many questions still remain to be answered about this issue.  The Minister responded to the concerns expressed by us in so far as he amended section 13 to try to improve the application of the system to some degree. Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 30 meets the concerns expressed by Members on the previous occasion and again this evening.  We would do well to give this issue as much consideration as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We dealt with this issue in great detail on the last occasion because of the adversarial nature of our system of justice and the great importance attached to cross-examination and trying to establish the truth.  We also referred to the difficulty an intervention of this kind could create for the defence.  One has to appreciate that the prosecution, defence and judge will have had a lot of practice in phrasing and asking questions of people of varying degrees of intelligence and understanding in all sorts of situations.  Given that they know this type of situation could arise, one would assume that the prosecution, defence and judge would be intelligent and practised enough in the art of questioning to adopt a certain frame of mind and do a satisfactory job.  One could <Col N="1284" /> imagine a situation where they would have to make three or four attempts to get across the intention of their original question.  It would be much more satisfactory if they did this repeatedly rather than give a person the latitude to intervene and use a different form of wording. No matter how practised or great their understanding of children of varying ages is, intermediaries might find it difficult to use wording which gives the meaning of the question put by the questioner.  This is a difficult area with which to deal.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion we discussed the issue the Minister of State became impatient; it was patently obvious that he thought we had discussed the issue <i>ad nauseam.</i> There is grave concern about this provision because of the nature of our justice system.  If necessary, we will have to spend further time considering the possibility of cases not proceeding in certain circumstances where this system is used.  Other questions also arise, for example, how does the judge decide when he will use this procedure?  Would he get reports from outside, from specialists and so on, that in the circumstances, as the person is under 17 years, the television link should be used?  As a lay person, I have not satisfied myself that we have thought the matter through fully, although I know that other people hold a different view.</P>
    <P>I am in complete sympathy with Deputy Shatter and what he is trying to achieve in amendment No. 30.  I have satisfied myself that while in many cases it would be very important that an intermediary accompany a child when this procedure is in place, there are other ways that might be more satisfactory than allowing the intermediary to act as prosecutor, judge or defence.  One would have to say that intermediaries could not act in that way but they would have certain powers to change questions into a format which could lead to grave difficulty in a case.  I have much sympathy with amendment No. 30.  It should be given careful attention before making a decision on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the points <Col N="1285" /> made by Deputy McCartan, I am quite convinced from my reading of the section, as amended, that replies must be conveyed by the witness alone.  The section states that the examination is to be conducted through the intermediary. As I recall, on Committee Stage Deputy McCartan made the point that in the context of a school examination the term, &ldquo;examination&rdquo; implies answers as well as questions.  I have done some research into this matter in the interim and I stick to my original opinion that in the context of courts the term &ldquo;examination&rdquo; implies putting questions only.  As that is the proper interpretation the intermediary would be merely a conduit through which the questions are put.  We are all familiar with the terminology &ldquo;cross-examination was conducted by counsel&rdquo;, &ldquo;counsel examined the witness&rdquo; and &ldquo;the solicitor examined the witness&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;examination&rdquo; when used in that context means that the barrister, counsel or solicitor put questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the examination of the witness will be conducted through an intermediary.  It states: &ldquo;the interests of justice require that his examination-in-chief, cross-examination or re-examination, or any part thereof, be conducted through an intermediary&rdquo;.  We are talking about cases where child witnesses give evidence by television link.  As I have already explained, the system &mdash; Deputies McCartan and Shatter will have had the opportunity of examining the system personally &mdash; the judge will be in control of the case from start to finish and will see and hear everything that is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that questions are asked from time to time about some of our judges but it would be quite ludicrous that a judge would accept a situation where counsel puts questions to a child witness through an intermediary and the intermediary repeats or re-phrases the question and gives the answer himself, or adds or takes from the answer.  If there <Col N="1286" /> was an eccentric judge who accepted that situation it would be grounds for an appeal.  Considering that the judge will be in control of the entire case I cannot see how that could happen in practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter said that he is unhappy about the whole concept of the intermediary. To a certain extent I take the point he makes but we must remember that the use of an intermediary is not automatic.  While Deputy Shatter was speaking I was reading through the section which states that the court may, on the application of the prosecutor or the accused, in the interests of justice, require that the examination be conducted through an intermediary.  In the preceding line there are guidelines as to the circumstances to which the court should have regard in deciding whether the interests of justice require the use of an intermediary, for example, the age or mental condition of the witness.  While the section states that those who may be examined through an intermediary must be under 17 years, I would envisage that in practically all cases, taking into account that the criteria are the age and mental condition, we would be talking about children of the age of five or six years who can give an intelligible account of events, but may be unable to do so if they have to face questioning by strange people on a monitor, even without wigs and gowns.</P>

In relation to the direct <Col N="1287" /> point made by Deputy Shatter about cross-examination, if counsel wishes to put a certain question to a child witness who is being examined through an intermediary and the intermediary re-phrases the question in a way that he or she feels would be more intelligible to the child but counsel is not happy with that, counsel can direct the intermediary &mdash; who will be in audio contact with him &mdash; to re-phrase the question.  He may ask the intermediary to put the question as he asked it.  The judge will be in control of proceedings from start to finish.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor made a point about usurping the judge's role.  As I understand the legislation &mdash; I am open to correction on this&mdash;there will be nothing to stop the judge from putting a question to the child witness through the intermediary. The role of the judge, by and large, is to control proceedings and to ensure that the conduct of the trial is fair to both sides.  The judge will have a special monitor and will see and hear everything that goes on in the witness room.  He will be in control of the case from start to finish.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate Deputy Shatter's point that we must maintain a certain balance.  Young witnesses may be able to give an intelligible account of events, but only through the mechanism we are proposing. If we withdraw the intermediary it is the view of a number of professionals in the area who have advised us and also of the Law Reform Commission, that some child sex abusers will not be prosecuted because the witnesses are too young to take direct cross-examination. In answer to Deputy Taylor's point, they feel that the witness could give an intelligible account of events if put at ease in this way.  We have taken advice on the constitutional aspect of this matter and we have been advised by the Attorney General's office, who are not omnipotent in these matters, that there are constitutional difficulties with the provision. The Law Reform Commission Report on Child Sexual Abuse in paragraph 7.22 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> 7.22 Contrary to what some may have thought, we had not suggested doing away with cross-examination.  We originally contemplated no more than a modification of existing practice: the questions a defending counsel or solicitor would have asked would now be asked in another voice.  As a result, timing and intonation, which is so much part of the skilled cross-examiner's art, would be lost.  This, however, is the price one would have to pay to ensure, in cases where the accused was representing himself, that the child witness was not placed at so serious a disadvantage as to create the possibility of real justice.</P>
    <P>Our final proposal went further than this.  We contemplated the questioning of the child by skilled child examiners, appointed by the court, during the prosecution and, if possible, the investigation of these offences, not merely where the accused was representing himself or herself, but also where he or she was defended by lawyers.  We envisaged that the examiner would act as a conduit for all questions from the lawyers and that his or her role would be to establish and maintain rapport and ease of communication with the child witness while remaining detached from the issues in the case.</P>
    <P>7.23 We were influenced by two factors in making this more radical proposal. First, under our adversarial legal system, it is the duty of a defending lawyer to use every legitimate means to secure the acquittal of his client. While he must not mislead the court of trial in any way, it is not his duty to ensure that the enquiry in which he is participating arrives at the truth. Hence, he is perfectly entitled to conduct a cross-examination which is designed to unsettle a child witness alleged to have been the victim of an offence by his client and reduce his or her credibility as a witness to the lowest possible level.  Secondly, in an imperfect world, there will always be defending advocates who will seek to harass or bully a child witness in a way which <Col N="1289" /> is not only psychologically harmful to the child but may also be damaging to their own client's case.  7.24 This has led us inexorably to the conclusion, not disturbed by our consultations, that too high a price is being paid for the right to conduct a wholly uninhibited and &ldquo;direct&rdquo; cross-examination of a child witness.  While we have naturally had regard to the constitutional dimensions of such a proposal, we are satisfied that the guarantees of a trial &ldquo;in due course of law&rdquo; do not necessarily preclude a restriction of some nature on an accused person's general right to cross-examine his accuser without an intermediary. The right in practice is inevitably restricted: thus, persons who cannot speak English, who are non-speaking or have a speech defect are allowed at present to give evidence through interpreters.  We have also noted that, since we made our provisional recommendations, a majority of those subscribing to the Pigot report recommended that the trial judge should have a discretion at all times to appoint an examiner where a witness was very young or very disturbed.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the Law Reform Commission and it is a pretty radical departure, to some extent moving into the unknown.  I have confidence in the good sense of the courts.  The proposal will work and people will be grateful to us for putting this provision into the legislation because it will result in some child abusers &mdash; the most despicable form of criminal &mdash; who would presently walk free, being prosecuted.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 31, 32 and 33 make specific provision for an edited version of an out-of-court interview with an alleged child victim to be used at the trial, with the consent of the accused.  It is normal for the prosecution when preparing the book for the preliminary examination to edit, when necessary, statements of prosecution witnesses by eliminating irrelevant material.  A video-recording of an interview with a child who is alleged to be the victim of physical or sexual abuse can also contain a lot of irrelevant material, which would not be admissible at the trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 therefore ensures that an edited version of the interview can be used at the preliminary examination, <Col N="1291" /> with the consent of the accused, and also that that version can be used at the trial. Amendments No. 31 and 32 make it clear that the accused will have an opportunity of seeing the whole of the interview before the preliminary examination.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 27 to 29, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;during&rdquo; in line 27, down to and including &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; in line 29, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;during an interview with a member of the Garda Síochána or any other person who is in the opinion of the court competent for the purpose&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment after consideration of the comments made on Committee Stage about these out-of-court interviews with alleged victims of child abuse.  Deputy Shatter suggested that a distinction be drawn between interviews with a woman Garda, say when an offence was being reported, and the interview at an assessment unit when the possibility of abuse was being investigated. The amendment reflects this distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also discussion about the meaning to be given to the expression &ldquo;appropriately qualified&rdquo; used in the present text in relation to those participating in the interview.  That is the expression used by the Law Reform Commission in its recommendation and the commission gave examples of what it understood by it &mdash; a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, woman Garda and so on.  No doubt the intention was <Col N="1293" /> that this matter would be left to the court to determine in any particular case.</P>
    <P>There are objections to this, not least of which is the possibility, perhaps the likelihood, of differing interpretations by different judges.  Another is that &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; suggests that some formal qualification is necessary for anyone participating in the interview and, although normally one or more of the participants would be qualified in this sense, I would not wish that otherwise admissible evidence would be ruled out because of the presence at an interview of a person who had no third level qualifications.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concern of Deputy Shatter, as expressed in the amendment he has retabled, that evidence of an interview should not be admissible unless it is conducted by a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist who has received special training in the techniques required for interviewing alleged victims of physical or sexual assaults.</P>
    <P>I have thought about the matter since and am convinced that it would be undesirable to try to spell out in precise detail in the Bill the qualifications and specialised training that interviewers should have, how an interview should be conducted, what the video-recording should show, what supplementary evidence should be given at the trial about the making of the video-recording and so on. I agree that a code of practice for the guidance of interviewers should be provided on the lines of that recommended by the Pigot Committee and referred to here on Committee Stage.  I shall consult the Minister for Health on this with a view to having such a code made available to the health board personnel concerned and the Garda.</P>
    <P>But, the bottom line is whether the statements of the video-recording are fairly admissible.  At the end of the day it is the court, having seen the video, which must make up its mind on this point and, if necessary, exclude the whole or part of it if it considers that to admit it would not be in the interests of justice. It is important to bear in mind that before a videorecording of this kind can be considered <Col N="1294" /> for admissibility the court must have evidence to satisfy it that the person conducting the interview is competent for that particular purpose.  That involves matters such as formal qualifications, training, experience, familiarity with the code of practice and so on.  It is only when this hurdle has been surmounted that the court proceeds to consider whether the evidence can be admitted, and that will be determined having regard to the need to ensure fairness to the accused.  Admission of these video-recordings is a big step forward so far as the law of evidence is concerned but it is required by the need to protect young victims of abuse and to bring their abusers to justice.  It will call for an extra effort by courts to ensure that no injustice is done, but I have no doubt that they will reject any video-recording of an interview or any part of it that does not comply with accepted standards of fairness.</P>
    <P>To come back to the amendment, what I propose is to drop the expression &ldquo;appropriately qualified&rdquo; altogether and refer instead to an interview with a person &mdash; or persons, for the singular imports the plural &mdash; who is in the opinion of the court competent for that purpose. I think that word conveys better what we want to achieve, that is, that statements made by an alleged victim of child abuse during a video-recorded interview can be used in evidence at the trial of the accused, provided, of course, &mdash; and it is so provided &mdash; that the accused has an opportunity of cross-examining the child on that evidence.</P>
    <P>I will now comment briefly on amendment No. 34 in the name of Deputy Shatter. Having considered his amendment I am prepared to accept it &mdash; I do not know what procedural technicalities have to be followed &mdash; without referring on this occasion to the Parliamentary Draftsman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for meeting some of the objections I raised on this section.  I appreciate that the Minister has taken on board my amendment, which in effect seeks to amend his amendment. I understand why the Minister may <Col N="1295" /> not want to be quite as restrictive in determining who is competent for the purpose as I propose in amendment No. 39.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that we have only 30 minutes and that we want to discuss other amendments.  However, I am very concerned that some people who are not competent to conduct interviews to determine whether an allegation of child sexual abuse can be substantiated and who may use different methods to conduct these type of interviews could be able to conduct video-recording of interviews which may be brought before the court.</P>
      <P>The practice on the ground in the special teams appointed to deal with child sexual abuse is that the person engaging in interviewing young children to determine whether they have been sexually abused is always a qualified child psychologist or child psychiatrist.  Interviewing is not normally left to a social worker.  I have reservations about social workers, especially those without specialised training, conducting interviews.  I am concerned that if it is left to the courts to determine on a case by case basis who is competent to conduct these interviews, some judges may take a different view as to the qualifications and training necessary to determine competence in this area and on their determination may hinge the admissibility of evidence and whether somebody will or will not be convicted. It is preferable that we establish judicial guidelines as to who is competent to conduct such interviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister believes my amendment No. 39, which confines this task to a psychologist or a psychiatrist who specialses in dealing with children and who has received special training in the interview techniques required, is too restrictive; but I believe this is what will probably happen in reality.  Nevertheless, I do not wish to press the matter further as the Minister has come at least 70 per cent of the way in meeting the difficulties I raised.  I welcome the Minister's commitment this evening to provide a code of practice in this area.  To put that in <Col N="1296" /> place will obviously require discussion between the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Health.  I request that the code of practice be made a formal rule of court under this Bill.  I do not know whether this is possible as the Bill is currently framed, but I do not think it would simply be covered by an administrative function.  It should be a rule of practice that the judges will look to, to determine whether competent interviews have been undertaken and the correct techniques applied.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the rules of practice be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that there can be public knowledge, that both Members and the general public have access to them and that they formally be made rules of the court for the purpose of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister has taken on board some of my concerns.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35.</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii) the person who conducted the interview which was video-recorded is available at the trial for cross-examination, or</P>
      <P>(iv) no leading questions were asked by the interviewer during the course of such interview.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various rules laid down in <Col N="1297" /> relation to the video-recording of evidence. Section 15 provides that in the case of a video-recording mentioned in paragraph (b) either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it has been considered in accordance with section 14 (2) by the judge of the District Court conducting the preliminary examination of the offence, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the person whose statement was videorecorded is available at the trial for cross-examination.</P>
    <P>These are preconditions to the video-recording being used as evidence.  I propose two further matters.  One is that not only should the child or young person who features in the video and is the alleged victim of an offence be available to the court for cross-examination, but that the person who conducted the interview should be available to the court. In the context of determining a person's competence to conduct interviews it should not just be a question of the court getting a document detailing their academic qualifications.  Competence to conduct such interviews should not be based simply on academic qualifications, but on practical experience.  It would seem to me therefore that this would require the person to be present in court.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am seeking to ensure that no leading questions should be asked by the interviewer during the course of such interviews.  I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which the Minister was to consider and I did not press it.  I do not wish to detain the House by repeating what I said on Committee Stage, but I wish to draw the attention of the House to the considerable concern I expressed about the use of leading questions in the context of what are known as validation interviews in cases of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that leading questions posed by an adult could result in the child giving a version of events that is untrue because the child is being pressurised by the adult putting the questions or, alternatively, the child might simply agree to the propositions being put by the interviewer in order to please the interviewer, <Col N="1298" /> or may possibly agree to the propositions without fully understanding in adult language what they mean.  Serious reservations have been expressed in the courts, not just in the United Kingdom but elsewhere, on the use of leading questions in the type of interviews envisaged here.  It is most important that leading questions are not put by authority figures when dealing with alleged cases of sexual abuse of children in determining whether allegations of sexual abuse are correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 35 is a very important proposition.  I supported it on Committee Stage and I do so now. Anybody involved in a video recording which may be adduced as evidence and who plays a role in it by way of interview or participation in any way, should be available for cross-examination or questioning at any trial.  That is a basic proposition. Some things might happen which would be apparent on the video recording but which would require testing as to gesture or posture taken.  Debate might hang upon what was meant by a phrase used by a person playing a role in the interview.  It is eminently desirable, if not essential, that anybody involved in the video recording should be available for cross-examination or questioning at a subsequent trial.</P>
      <P>I am not as supportive of amendment No. 38 but I know that Deputy Shatter has well-founded reservations about the use of so called anatomical dolls which are over-suggestive in their shape and form.  People have become more careful about the way they are employed and about the conclusions which might be reached.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the Minister should accept amendment No. 35.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan said it was desirable, if not essential, that the interviewer should be available to the court.  I agree that it is desirable but whether it is essential is the nub of the matter.  Amendments Nos. 35 and 38 were the subject of an extensive discussion on Committee Stage and I have since considered the views expressed by <Col N="1299" /> the Deputies who participated in that debate.</P>
      <P>As regards the additional conditions proposed in the amendments in relation to the admissibility of video recorded interviews, I remain of the view that it should be a matter for the court to determine whether a particular interview, or some portion of it, should be admitted in evidence and to take into account all the circumstances relating to that interview.</P>
      <P>Of course, before the court can proceed to look at a video recording it must satisfy itself that the person who conducted it was competent to do so. Obviously the court will not consider a video recording conducted by the hall porter and it must satisfy itself that the person who conducted the interview was competent to do so.  In many cases the court might not have any personal knowledge of the person conducting the interview and there are obvious things which the court would have to do to satisfy itself that the person was competent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>One obvious way for the court to satisfy itself as regards competence would be to examine the interviewer as to qualifications, training and so on.  If the interviewer is not available because he is absent, or even dead, the court might call people who could testify as to the competence of that person and his qualifications and experience.  That should be sufficient.</P>
      <P>The court will no doubt also require evidence on whether any other person was present at the interview and on any other relevant matters and will seek that evidence either from the interviewer or, where provision is made for the interview to be observed, from the person who observed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the court is satisfied on these points, it will examine the video recording and take account of any submissions that all or some of it should be excluded as being unfair to the accused.  These submissions may well be on the lines of the amendments <Col N="1300" /> we are now considering, that is, that leading questions were asked by the interviewer or that anatomical dolls were improperly used as an aid, but there may be objections on other grounds.</P>
    <P>The court is obliged to examine the video recording carefully and consider any objections because of the specific obligation imposed on it by subsection (2) of section 15, that is, the obligation not to admit in evidence any part of such a video recording if it is of opinion that in the interests of justice it ought not to be admitted.  In amendment No. 37, I am making it clear that in this connection the court must have particular regard to any risk of unfairness to the accused.</P>
    <P>Deputies McCartan and Shatter will know that the court of criminal appeal will consider the transcript of a trial. Video recordings will also be available to the court and they will be able to look at the case afresh to decide whether the judge should have excluded or admitted any part.  That is an extra safeguard.  For these reasons it is not necessary to write in specific conditions governing the admisibility of statements made in video recorded interviews.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is saying that if there are problems in the context of leading statements or in the absence from the court of the person who put the questions on video or if there are problems with anatomical dolls, all that is left to the court to decide in the context of fairness. The Minister's amendment No. 37 is of assistance in this area and I appreciate that it comes some of the way.  Nevertheless, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are entering new territory in the context of ensuring that convictions are not obtained against innocent people.  I do not think the constraints I <Col N="1301" /> am seeking to impose in relation to the production of video recordings are remarkable.

      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 20 to 34 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person is accused of an offence to which this Part applies, and</P>
      <P>(b)  evidence is given by a person (in this section referred to as `the witness') through a live television link pursuant to section 12 (1),</P>
      <P>then&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case evidence is given that the accused was known to the witness before the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, the witness shall not be required to identify the accused at the trial of the offence, unless the court in the interests of justice directs otherwise, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  in any other case, evidence by a person other than the witness that the witness identified the accused at an identification parade as being the offender shall be admissible as evidence that the accused was so indentified.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a revised version of section 17 and endeavours to take into account the comments made on Committee Stage not only on the original text <Col N="1303" /> of the section, but also on the section substituted for it on that Stage.</P>
    <P>The revised section makes provision, as did the earlier versions, for avoiding as far as possible the need for witnesses who have been allowed to give evidence by TV link to appear in court to confront the accused.  The fact that they have been allowed to give evidence in this way suggests that they would be likely to be traumatised by any in-court identification. We are dealing here with sexual offences and offences involving violence.  At the same time it is essential that there should be no bar on an accused insisting on such an identification where identification is an issue.</P>
    <P>To achieve these aims the section first deals with a situation where evidence is given that the accused was known to the witness before the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed. There are two categories of &ldquo;known&rdquo;: there are the people with whom the person is familiar and there are other categories of persons who would be known in a vague sense.  The accused could be the father, uncle, regular baby-sitter, neighbour or family friend.  In that case the witness will not be required to identify the accused in court unless the court in the interests of justice directs otherwise.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to say that I have considered carefully whether, as suggested on Committee Stage, it would be desirable to expand the term &ldquo;known&rdquo; to &ldquo;known by name&rdquo; or &ldquo;known personally&rdquo; and I have had the suggestions considered by the draftsman.  I do not think that such an addition would be useful in the context of what we are trying to achieve.  The examples I have given &mdash; father and so on &mdash; cause no problem and there will be general agreement that a formal in-court identification should not be necessary in such a case.  If, however, it is contended at the trial that the accused was not known to the witness beforehand, or a doubt is raised in the matter, the revised section provides that the court may in the interests of justice direct otherwise, that is, direct that the witness <Col N="1304" /> identify the accused in court.  In view of the importance which courts have attached over the years to the dangers of identification evidence and the constitutional obligation to observe fairness of procedures, it is to be expected that such a direction would be given whenever justified.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the second leg of the revised section.  This deals with cases where the accused was not known to the witness before the date of the alleged offence.  It does not relieve such a witness from having to identify the accused in open court.  However, it does provide that evidence by a person other than the witness that the witness identified the accused at an identification parade as being the offender will be admissible as evidence that the accused was so identified. That evidence would normally be excluded by the rule against hearsay and that is being changed.</P>
    <P>I would expect that the effect of this provision will be that in many, perhaps in most cases, it will not be necessary to require the witness to identify the accused again in court but the provision does not rule out in-court identifications in these cases.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that, unlike earlier versions, the revised section refers only to identifications at an identification parade and not to identifications during some other identification procedure.  I have dropped the reference to the latter procedure in deference to the views expressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;(1)  Evidence where required in any preliminary hearing of <Col N="1307" /> remand or examination (for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967), of arrest, charge, caution, or bail of any accused shall be permissible in court by the production of a certificate of evidence of the Garda or Gardaí responsible or concerned.</P>
    <P>(2)  Such evidence shall be tendered to the court by an officer, not below the rank of Sergeant, attached to the station of the Garda preferring the charge in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>(3)  where any issue is controversial, the court shall require the Garda or Gardaí concerned to attend at a reasonable opportunity to be examined as to their evidence as certified or otherwise.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am glad to move this amendment.  It is one I passively believe in as being of some practical benefit to the manner in which criminal cases are prosecuted, particularly in the district courts.  I referred to this matter earlier.  Garda officers are required when they arrest and take a person to a police station, or release him on bail, to attend at court the next day for the purposes of giving that formal evidence of arrest, charge and caution. The Dublin Metropolitan District Court is packed with Garda officers waiting for hours, many bleary-eyed after being on duty all night for a simple remand to be called and dealt with and to give their evidence of arrest, charge and caution. On occasions this can deny a Garda station of a huge complement of their active working police persons.  That type of evidence can and should be dealt with by way of certificate, completed by the Garda officer, handed to the station sergeant for presentation to the court on the next occasion or by an officer of the station designated to do that.  I hope the Minister takes the point of the amendment. If he cannot act on it today, at least let us move in the direction of doing something useful, using the ideas contained in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Christian Brothers High School in Clonmel was designed to accommodate not more than 350 students.  In September it will have more than 600 students on the roll.  This year the school had 220 applicants for first-year education but could accept only 127, resulting in 93 boys, 12 year olds, being rejected by the school.  That is an appalling situation for the principal of the school, forced to make such a choice; for young boys who experience rejection at so early an age; and for parents who have to cope with a despondent child trying to come to terms with failure caused entirely by the lack of accommodation in the school.</P>
      <P>Added to the alarming accommodation problem are the appalling conditions of the present school.  The Christian Brothers have a very proud record in Clonmel and began education there in 1847.  When the need arose in 1899, they built a new school.  That building, now almost 100 years old, has to accommodate 200 students.  It has been deemed structurally dangerous and is a continuous worry to management, who are interested in securing the safety of teachers and students.  The newer part of the school was built in 1970 but an inspection by architects in 1985 revealed major defects.  The Department of Education were notified but it took no less than five long years for an official to visit the school.  Minor repairs to the roof were carried out.  The school consists of one part listed as a dangerous building and the other part in need of major repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is shameful, but the story gets even worse.  The school has no mechanical or technical drawing room; no crafts or metalwork room; no building <Col N="1311" /> construction room; no music room; no commerce room; no language laboratory; no demonstration room; no special tutor room; no social studies room; no library.  The real mystery are the excellent standards that can be achieved in such appalling accommodation and with such poor facilities. There is no doubt that the honour lies with the entire staff, who, in spite of such obstacles, give their entire energies to making the best of the situation.</P>
    <P>The school are not seeking luxury items.  Rather, they seek the basics to provide the educational needs of their students.  The problem is twofold: the standard of the present accommodation, which, I believe, should be an embarrassment to any Minister for Education; and the lack of space, resulting in students experiencing rejection at a very young age.  At present students are crammed into buildings that are not able to accommodate them.  We must ask, what of those who are refused entry?  Have they a right to be educated in the school of their choice?  Is it acceptable to tell 12 year olds that they are equal while in practice some are more equal than others?  Should any principal be forced to classify a young boy as having failed to reach the standard in the entry test?</P>
    <P>The neglect of the conditions in the high school in Clonmel extends even further. There were no PE or sports facilities in the school.  As early as 1975 an official application was lodged with the Department of Education for a PE hall.  The application met with no luck.  Despite repeated requests there has been no response.  As a last resort and in the interests of the school, the board of managment built a PE hall, at a cost of £324,000, without as much as one penny coming from the Department of Education. To date, a debt of £50,000 remains.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of the appalling situation at the Christian Brothers High School in Clonmel.  The Minister must accept that the problems have reached a critical stage.  His intervention is needed urgently and unless steps are taken <Col N="1312" /> immediately to provide adequate accommodation along with sufficient space I believe that the situation there will be uncontrollable.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for raising this matter and I will outline for the benefit of the Deputy and the House the up-to-date position in this case.</P>
      <P>In the late 1991 the high school authorities approached the Department to restate their case for additional accommodation at the school.  Arising from the application the Department's planning section have undertaken a detailed review of the pupil enrolment position at the high school and also in the other schools in the town.  They also examined carefully enrolment projections for the school and centre.  Examination of the enrolment position is an important exercise to ensure that any additional accommodation that may be indicated by current increased enrolments is justified in terms of the longer term position and that the increased enrolment at one particular school is not simply a matter of pupil and parental choice which would result in vacant accommodation at the other schools in a particular centre.  This is particularly important in current financial circumstances, when funds for school buildings are very limited.  Care must be taken to ensure that any spending is fully justified by the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Department's planning section has now completed this review of the position and this assessment of the short and long term enrolment position is being examined from the educational point of view in the context of the school's actual accommodation and also, of course, in the light of the funds available for building. My Department's examination of the matter will be completed shortly and I can assure the Deputy that a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities without undue delay.</P>

      <P>In 1980 the present Tánaiste, Minister for Education at the time, pointed out in the White Paper then brought before the House that education must try to meet the needs of the individual and the needs of society.  It is clear that at present our educational system does not meet the needs of all of our children.  Certainly it does not fully meet the needs of society when it fails those children.  It has to be stressed that the failure is not that of the children themselves but of the system.  At the moment an estimated 70 children in the Ballymun area are at risk, having already dropped out of school or it being thought that they might drop out of school before finishing.</P>
      <P>An investment in a proper rescue system, whereby these children who do not fit into the standard educational system, would provide them with a more flexible way of learning and socialising. In the vast majority of cases these children will end up before our courts and in health or corrective institutions.  The cost of establishing a project, such as the youth encounter project to which I referred, would be more than repaid over the years in savings which could be made by not having these children in our institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot approach this purely from the point of view of cost, there is also a human dimension.  These children face a life of misery, not just for themselves but also for those people whose lives they touched &mdash; their immediate family or others.  It is, therefore, essential that the Departments of Education, Health and Justice should address this problem as a matter of urgency.  It is estimated that it costs something like £60,000 to keep a <Col N="1314" /> child in Trinity House for one year.  That kind of investment in the early, formative stages of a child's life would save vast sums of money for the State.</P>
    <P>These problems are not confined to the Ballymun area.  I am sure Deputies could nominate other areas around the country which would also benefit from these projects. I am talking about a situation where there would be a fairly flexible approach to the children concerned, bearing in mind that they probably come from homes which are &mdash; to put it at its mildest &mdash; disadvantaged.  There is a necessity for a project which would have a very low pupil-teacher ratio, in the region of eight to one, where there would not only be teachers but welfare and health workers and other people available to maintain and develop liaison with the families.  We are talking about innocent victims, they are not bad people, and we should not simply ignore them until they come to the attention of the courts and then put them into institutions.  We should invest now in providing them with the potential for a decent living.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, for sharing his time with me and you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving us the opportunity to raise this matter.  There is a very serious drop-out problem in the Ballymun schooling system which I am sure is reflected throughout the country.  It has also emerged in other areas in our constituency. The consequences are obviously an enormous cost to the individuals and to the State in the long &mdash; and indeed the short &mdash; term.  At present when those children drop out, the existing school attendance services do their best but the system is so hostile to the young people concerned that they &mdash; and indeed their families &mdash; do everything they can to avoid getting back into it.  We have had experience in the Finglas area of a very successful youth encounter project.  It has worked by identifying and targeting young people and has kept them in a very flexible school environment, otherwise some of them might have been engaged in crime and <Col N="1315" /> would have had an early brush with the law.</P>
      <P>A project or proposal for the Ballymun area was put to a former Minister in 1988-89 but it seems to have been allowed to lie in the Department as there has not been an active response.  I urge the Minister to reactivate its proposals, to support it and to make sure that this great need in the community is met in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to clarify the position.  The youth encounter projects were first established in 1977, initially on a pilot basis, to provide education facilities for children who had become alienated from the conventional school system, are persistent truants and have become involved in, or are at risk of becoming involved in minor crime and delinquency.</P>
      <P>There are four recognised projects operating at present, each of which cater for about 25 pupils aged between ten to 15 years located at Rutland Street and Finglas in Dublin, and one each in Cork and Limerick.  An additional youth encounter project type facility was established on a temporary basis at Seville Place, Dublin 1, in 1982 to cater for a particular group of youths at risk in that area.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the youth encounter projects is to rehabilitate the pupils and to return them to the conventional school system in the shortest possible time.  It is not the intention that the projects develop into an alternative system of education.  Therefore, the projects are required to liaise closely with specified schools in their catchment areas, involving schools at both first and second levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to having &ldquo;above quota&rdquo; teachers, the projects also have the benefit of additional resources such as a community worker and a &ldquo;bean a tí&rdquo;; as well as clerical, maintenance, cleaning and security staff.  This enables the projects <Col N="1316" /> to provide a comprehensive life-skills programme in addition to the normal curriculum.</P>
    <P>A major review and evaluation of the existing youth encounter projects is currently underway and will be concluded later this year.  The purpose of this review is to evaluate the performance of the youth encounter projects in terms of their success as vehicles for enhancing the learning and living experiences of youths at risk, and generally to establish if the youth encounter projects are adequately meeting the need for which they were established.</P>
    <P>Until the evaluation and review has been completed and the findings considered by my Department, no firm decision can be made as to the future direction of these projects or the question of an expansion of the current scheme. Furthermore, in considering the request to establish a new youth encounter project for any area, a thorough examination would have to take place in order to determine the actual needs and extent of disadvantage of the children in the area and decide an appropriate response to those needs.  It may well be the case that the problems manifested could be best addressed by measures targeted through the existing schools in the area.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the House will be aware of the programme of assistance to direct additional resources to areas of particular socio-economic need.  As part of this programme additional funding and ex-quota teachers are provided to schools in areas designated as disadvantaged.  In the particular case of Ballymun, I would point out that ten primary schools in the area are already included in the disadvantaged area scheme and, as such, are granted extra funding to go towards the running costs of the schools as well as for books and equipment and home school, community liaison initiatives. Under this scheme, the ten schools have been given 11 ex-quota concessionary posts.  In addition to the special measures already mentioned, five of these schools also enjoy the services of local home, school, community liaison co-ordinators.</P>
    <P>The home, school, community liaison <Col N="1317" /> co-ordinators act in support of local schools in establishing contact with parents, encouraging parents to become involved in their children's education, organising locally based activities which contribute to closer contact between parents and teachers and establishing links with pre-school and other voluntary and statutory groups in the area.  This scheme, which was originally introduced on a pilot basis in 1990, is having a very positive impact to date and has been extended to the other post-primary sector.  I understand that one of the Ballymun post-primary schools will be included in the schemes for the next school year.</P>
    <P>Apart from the initiatives targeted specifically at schools, my Department also provide considerable funding for projects under a grants scheme to disadvantaged youth.  Among the projects that benefit substantially from this scheme are &mdash; Ballymun youth action project; Ballymun youth service project and Ballymun foróige project.</P>
    <P>In effect, therefore, it can be seen that a significant level of additional resources in both funding and extra staffing are already targeted on the Ballymun area. The question of the need for further such resources addressing the needs of this area will be kept under review in the context of the evaluation of the youth encounter project approach to which I have already referred.  Deputies will be kept informed of progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The regrettable incident at Agriculture House on Tuesday should not deflect people's attention from the central issue, that is the imminent loss of £30 million per annum to sheep farmers due to the severe cut in the ewe premium in the order of £6 per head.  I understand a certain reduction was contemplated but the cut is greater than anticipated. Having regard to the fact that the lamb market is severely depressed this will result in a massive income drop for sheep farmers.  Their predicament must be <Col N="1318" /> addressed and rectified at the next meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. We are now witnessing the worst scenario that I predicted after the Common Agricultural Policy reform talks, that is, a drop in prices along with a reduction in the support system.</P>
      <P>The market is depressed for a number of reasons, but I venture to say that the primary reason is that the British have got rid of their variable premium which was payable to their lamb producers and are now flooding the French market with fresh lamb and making up the balance in the home market with frozen lamb from New Zealand.  Unless we can secure a reduction in the amount of New Zealand lamb entering the market in the European Community in the ongoing GATT negotiations, the problems of lamb producers in this country will be exacerbated as time goes on.  We have to see to it that New Zeland lamb is either removed from the marketplace or that the amount is reduced considerably because we are finding it very difficult to sell our lamb given the preponderance of fresh English lamb on the market.</P>
      <P>I would now like to give way to my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, and to Deputy McGinley also, who wish to contribute on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to express my disapproval with regard to the serious announcement that was made in Brussels yesterday.  It clearly reveals that there was a lack of proper dialogue between the Department and the authorities in Brussels on this issue.  The proposed reduction of over 20 per cent in the ewe premium will spell disaster for our sheep farmers whose incomes will be slashed by at least £30 million this year. This is shocking treatment and it has been meted out by Commissioner Ray MacSharry who should well understand the position given that he comes from a good sheep breeding county, County Sligo.  He should know what this premium means to the farmers on the slopes of Benbulben and along the western seaboard from Malin Head to Mizen Head.  It is clearly <Col N="1319" /> evident that the farmers are very frustrated.</P>
      <P>This announcement confirmed the fears I had when I digested the package negotiated by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in Brussels.  It received wide press coverage.  It is diabolical that there is to be a reduction in the ewe premium when one considers that a colossal amount of New Zealand lamb has been allowed into the European market.  What action does the Minister propose to take with regard to this disastrous blow so far as our sheep farmers are concerned?  This will sound the death knell for the sheep farming sector.  Our sheep farmers are in a state of shock and their action yesterday bears out in no uncertain fashion that they are completely frustrated following this disastrous news.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available to me I would like to say that this reduction of £6 per ewe will cost the 5,300 sheep farmers in County Donegal in the region of £4 million per annum.  This amounts to a drastic and almost fatal blow, as my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, said.  When one considers that the price of lamb this year is between £6 and £8 lower than the price that could be obtained this time last year and that the price of wool is less than 20p per pound I cannot see any future for our sheep farmers.</P>
      <P>The final point I want to make is that it is ironic that news of the drastic reduction in the ewe premium was not announced until after farmers had voted in the Maastricht referendum.  If the present trend continues the traditional small to medium-sized sheep farmers will be wiped out not only in County Donegal but throughout the country.</P>

      <P>In thanking the Deputies for raising this matter I would like to give some background information in relation to this development.  The first advance or tranche of 30 per cent of the estimated 1992 ewe premium which forms an important part of sheep farmers' incomes was fixed by the European Community <Col N="1320" /> Sheepmeat Management Committee on Friday, 13 June and it had nothing whatsoever to do&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I want to make the point that it had nothing whatsoever to do with the Maastricht Treaty. The amount of the premium this year is, for the first time, calcuated on the basis of a single region of the entire Community and is in accordance with the agreement reached by the Council of Ministers in the autumn of 1989, during the French Presidency, on the forms of the sheepmeat regime.  Therefore, this decision dates back to 1989 and it was well signalled by the IFA and others to their members.  As a result, the advance for Ireland, in relation to the first tranche, amounts to £4.99, a drop of £1.76 on last year's level of £6.75.  The reduction outside the disadvantaged areas, which Deputies McGinley, Sheehan, and Deasy, I think, and I represent, will be £1.76&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while the reduction within the disadvantaged areas will amount to 45p.  The additional premium will be paid to some 37,500 producers within the disadvantaged areas, out of a total of 52,000 producers who will benefit. <Col N="1321" /> It should be noted that the payment will amount to some £39 million.  It should also be noted that in April this year those sheep farmers were paid £45 million, giving a total of £84 million.</P>
      <P>The Council agreement of 1989 resulted in a change to the market support arrangements for the sheepmeat sector.  As part of the premium arrangements it was agreed that the variable premium system which operated only in the United Kingdom would be abolished and a single premium would apply for all member states.  It was further agreed that these arrangements would be phased in over a three year period or until the UK authorities decided to terminate the variable premium arrangements.  This decision was taken for the 1992 marketing year, that is, one year in advance of the original time schedule but within the Council agreement.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge and understand the feelings of farmers who are experiencing difficulties at present and have reduced prices on account of difficult market conditions.  This means, with the reduction in the premium, that they are in receipt of lower incomes.  I understand that totally and am doing everything possible I can to alleviate their position.  I have been in contact with <Col N="1322" /> CBF, the Irish Meat Export Board, to impress on them the importance of obtaining the best possible return for sheep farmers.  They are decent people trying to eke out a living and are entitled to the best possible return on their endeavours.  However, the fact of the matter is that this loss of income and of premium does not justify some farmers' behaviour, who air their grievances by forcing a number of unfortunate ewes into the foyer of the Department of Agriculture, intimidating junior staff, messengers, receptionists within that area and causing extreme anxiety along with stress to the animals involved.  I want to put on the record of this House that I deplore and will not tolerate that type of behaviour.</P>
      <P>What is most disquieting about it is the fact that the deputy president of the IFA has stated that that was only a tea party compared with what he has in store for the future.  I want to tell the House that I will not be intimidated by that type of language.  I have brought the matter to the attention of the Garda.  I am arranging for additional security.  It is intolerable in a democracy that the deputy leader of the IFA would threaten our democratic institutions in this manner.  It is absolutely outrageous that junior staff members, who had nothing whatsoever to do either with the premium or with depressed prices, should be assaulted within a Government Department.  I want to reiterate that I deplore and will not stand for that type of behaviour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not try to justify that type of behaviour.  I want to place something else on the record of this House.  There was not one single sheep farmer from west Cork up <Col N="1323" /> here yesterday, not one, and I met the people who were there.</P>
      <P>In regard to the unfortunate animals involved, I want to say that Ireland is a signatory to the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes.  One of the recommendations proposed under that convention, which I fully support, is that sheep should not be used to achieve any goal, including public spectacles or demonstrations, if such use is likely to be detrimental to their health and welare. Clearly the actions to which I have referred were in conflict with that goal.</P>
      <P>I also want to place on the record that I am available to meet farmers, their representatives, or anybody from the agricultural community at any time.  The ironic thing about this is that yesterday morning I met Mr. Alan Gillis, the leader of the IFA, Mr. Tom O'Dwyer, leader of the ICMSA and Mr. Benny Nagle, President of ICOS, from 10 a.m. to 10.55 a.m.  At no time in the course of that meeting was the matter of sheep, the income or premium drop, initiated with me.  Yet the leader of the IFA was able to go out into Kildare Street subsequently and force his way into the Department of Agriculture to make a point.  I find that to be extraordinary behaviour.</P>
      <P>I repeat that I am prepared to sit down with any member of the farming community or their representatives to negotiate and discuss in an endeavour to help the farming community in a rational, coherent way.  I will be meeting the farming leaders again on Friday morning.  I have no difficulty with that.  But certainly the bully boy tactics used in this case are totally out of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To revert to the present problem, I want to point out that I raised this matter at recent European Council meetings and pressed for an increase in the rural world premium as a means of compensating farmers in member states where market prices are particularly low.  I want to assure the House that we are talking here about the first <i>tranche</i>; there will be another in November and a further one in March next.  I will seek to have the premium <Col N="1324" /> restored between now and the granting of the next two <i>tranches.</i> I will begin that process at the very first opportunity, which will be the next Council of Ministers meeting which will take place in a week's time.</P>

      <P>I wish to sincerely point out to the Minister the need for a remedial teacher on a shared basis between Ballingarry, Slieveardagh, Lisnamrock and Mohobher National Schools, County Tipperary, the need for which cannot be over-exaggerated.  So acute is the problem at present that teachers, parents, boards of managements and public representatives are adamant in their resolve to have these schools provided with this vital facility. Our concern about such need is justified by the results of a recent ability assessment of pupils in Ballingarry national school, showing that in excess of 40 per cent of them were discovered to have reading problems of various degrees. This calls, not for a review or investigation but for action.  It would amount to serious negligence on the part of the Department were they to ignore such a serious problem being encountered in any rural school.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten years repeated applications were submitted to the Department of Education, supported by public representatives, for a remedial teacher for those schools.  The blind eye of the Department to these requests is now beginning to show its effects.  The entire Slieveardagh area, where those schools are located, has an extreme level of unemployment &mdash; in some parts as high as 62 per cent &mdash; with attendant social consequences.  Those schools deserve not only a remedial teacher but should also have disadvantaged status.  I must point out to the Minister that the future of the pupils attending these schools is dependent on his response to my appeal this evening.</P>

      <P>As I have <Col N="1325" /> indicated to the House on previous occasions remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs therefore would be helped within the scope of the normal service.</P>
      <P>However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under achievement in primary schools.  It was with this in mind that 80 posts were allocated for remedieal purposes out of the quota of posts made available under the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> for the school year 1991-92.</P>
      <P>These appointments were made following the collection of data and information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate.  The posts were then allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.</P>
      <P>The allocation of these 80 posts, which benefited some 242 schools, brings the total number of remedial teachers operating within the primary sector to 945.  By way of comparison, 945 remedial teachers are now in place at a time when the total number of primary pupils is 530,000 approximately.  This compares very favourably with the position in 1988, when 835 remedial teachers were in place at a time when the total number of primary pupils was 554,000.</P>
      <P>Of the 3,235 ordinary national schools in the country, approximately 1,400 have the services of a remedial teacher, on a fulltime or shared basis.</P>
      <P>The appointment of further remedial teachers will be kept under review.  In that connection, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school referred to by her will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>The board of management of St. Augustine's national school, Clontuskert, Ballinasloe, County <Col N="1326" /> Galway, applied for a grant for the provision of oil-fired central heating in their school.</P>
      <P>I might briefly outline for the Minister the history of this problem.  In 1985, when the school was modernised, the heating had to be deferred because it would involve a new transformer which was very costly.  At the time the Office of Public Works engineer recommended the installation of oil fired central heating.  From that year, 1985, the board of management have been trying to raise money to meet the local contribution.  They have been persistently contacting the Department and public representatives like myself.  In 1989, when the heating was to be installed, it was found that sewerage works had to be carried out because of an emergency.  In the following year, 1990, the environmental health officer from the Western Health Board recommended that the heating system be approved also.  In 1991 two storage heaters broke down.  The ESB engineer examined them and said that the two heaters were beyond repair and that the others were not functioning properly. The following year a five year old pupil received a hand burn from a faulty heater which overheated when the thermostat failed.</P>
      <P>I hope now that the design and specifications are prepared and sent to tender the Minister will be able to give us the approval for the grant.  I would like to point out that the present storage heating system is totally inadequate, with four heaters between three classrooms.  It is envisaged that if there is a very cold spell the school will have to close down. Because the present system has to be augmented with convection heaters, it is costing 60 per cent of the total capitation grant every year.  This is clearly intolerable, especially since the heating is still inadequate.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to give me the news that approval will be given by the Department.  The board of management will be meeting with Department officials late today to discuss this matter and try to have it resolved once and for all.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Kitt has given me the opportunity of outlining the position in regard to the heating grant application by St. Augustine's national school, Clontuskert, County Galway.  Let me say I have had several representations in the Department on this matter.  In fact, the Deputy's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, has been in touch with my office as well on several occasions.</P>
      <P>There has, I agree, been a considerable delay in processing this application.  A report has been received in the engineering and heating section of the Department from the local engineer, advising of the difficult heating situation at this school.  Unfortunately, due to a staffing dispute in that section, a number of cases, including that of St. Augustine's NS, have been delayed.  I understand that the dispute is near resolution.  It is my firm intention that the backlog of cases which has built up should be cleared as a matter of urgency.  I fully accept that the situation regarding heating at this school is inadequate in that the present storage heaters are no longer functioning effectively. It is therefore imperative that a new system be installed and the appropriate grant sanctioned at the earliest possible date.  It is my commitment that schools should be provided with the necessary facilities, including suitable heating systems, in order to operate in an efficient manner.  I wish to thank Deputy Kitt once more for raising this deserving case and I will keep him fully informed of developments.</P>

Not only that but there were details of how the money would be paid out &mdash; £300,000 in 1988, £400,000 in 1989 and the final £300,000 in 1990.  It was all very official, in writing, from the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now the end of June 1992 and so far Sligo has not got as much money as would purchase one blue tile for its 25 metre pool.  Instead, Sligo has been concerned <Col N="1328" /> and codded and fooled and frustrated by successive Ministers in the Department of Education.  The Department have been involved in what can only be described as an exercise in &ldquo;dragging out delays&rdquo;.  In this respect it has been a classical exercise &mdash; real honours stuff if ever I saw it.</P>
    <P>However, on the assumption that even this Department must at some time run out of excuses we all thought recently we were finally going to get our pool started. The first sod would be turned in June, we were told, and sure enough, the Department actually let it go to tender.  They sanctioned all the details in the plans, even made adjustments costing more money.  They knew from the professional advice that the cost would be in the area of £1.3 million.  Still they said: &ldquo;Go to tender&rdquo;.  There was never a suggestion that money might be a problem, quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>The accepted tender was by all accounts a good price, around £1.2 million. It was recommended all round.  Then the Department produce their final master stroke &mdash; sorry Sligo, the cost is £1.2 million.  You have only £1 million. You cannot go ahead.</P>
    <P>There was nothing about the interest that should have accrued on the £1 million granted in 1988 &mdash; after all, this was Sligo's money &mdash; nothing about the additional construction costs now by contrast with 1988; nothing about the fact that the Department knew from professional advice before going to tender that the cost would be well over £1 million, and still they raised no warning signs. They actually added on costly adjustments themselves; and, of course, there was the promise from the Minister of State that there would be a June start even if it cost more than £1 million.</P>
    <P>This is the last bitter twist for all those in Sligo who have worked so hard and waited so long for a swimming pool.  One must ask whether the £1 million itself is there and available immediately.  I appeal to the new Minister of State, in view of the awful manner in which Sligo has been treated, to announce here tonight that he is providing the extra money, that he is <Col N="1329" /> sanctioning an immediate start and thus bringing this sad saga to a close with some semblance of honour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Nealon for raising this matter and note the obvious conviction with which he has spoken on it.</P>
      <P>A grant of £1 million has been allocated to Sligo Corporation under my Department's capital programme for the provision of major sports facilities at regional and local level.  The project comprises the provision of a 25 metre swimming pool, gymnasium and other ancillary accommodation to be built as an extension to the existing multi-purpose indoor sports centre in Sligo.</P>
      <P>A report and a recommendatoin on the tenders received for the project was received from Sligo Corporation and their consultants on 12 May 1992.  My Department have also been in consultation with Sligo Corporation in relation to the proposed management arrangements for the extended sports complex and further information on this matter was recently received from Sligo Corporation.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the examination of these issues will be completed in the very near future and I expect to be in a position shortly to notify Sligo Corporation that the project proceed to contract so that construction work on the swimming pool can commence.</P>
      <P>It is expected that completion of the project will take 12 months approximately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>While the new emphasis on the aural aspect of language in State examinations is to be welcomed, the recent introduction of tapes in the Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations leaves much to be desired.  Many of the examinations were held in gymnasia which are completely unsuitable from the acoustics point of view.  Candidates are entitled to be able to hear a non-abberated sound in aural examinations. <Col N="1330" /> In addition, the conditions should be sensibly constant between centres and between individual candidates in the same centre.  Parents have complained to me that pupils taking the Junior Certificate examination were unable to hear the tapes clearly, particularly in French and German.</P>
      <P>It is surprising that the Department were not aware of the acoustical difficulties imposed by gymnasia and large halls.  It is also surprising that no tests were carried out to establish if students were able to hear clearly prior to the examinations.  A bad quality tape in an aural examination can only be compared to a smudged paper in a written examination and it imposes an unfair handicap on students subjected to such conditions.</P>
      <P>There was considerable media comment on the lack of clarity of the Irish language tapes and the finger of suspicion was directed at dialect variations.  Is it not more than likely that tape quality and acoustical conditions were to blame?  For aural tests using amplifying systems the candidates should be broken into smaller groups and ordinary classsrooms used where the acoustics fall within acceptable levels.  In my opinion the fairness of the examinations has been seriously compromised.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have this matter investigated immediately and where conditions have been inadequate repeats should be arranged.  Our pupils deserve nothing less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I want to thank Deputy McGinley for raising this matter. Aural tests in modern European languages were introduced in the Intermediate Certificate in 1985.  The same aurals are now part of the junior certificate. At this stage teachers can be expected to be familiar with them.  The junior certificate has introduced a second level, the ordinary level to cater for pupils who would be overstretched by the full requirements of the Intermediate certificate aurals.  The ordinary level aural test in junior certificate is therefore a less demanding version of the aural test which was carried forward from the <Col N="1331" /> intermediate certificate.  The requirements of the ordinary level were illustrated in the sample tapes that were issued to the schools some time ago. Teachers therefore were able to become <Col N="1332" /> familiar with the differentiation between ordinary and higher levels at the in-service sessions.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.51 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 June 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions 11 and 86 together.  The provision made in the 1992 book of Estimates takes account of the increased cost of the GMS scheme and the financial cost of the recommendations of the GMS Review Group which reported in early 1991.  My Department is closely monitoring the monthly expenditure patterns in the scheme.  While I am concerned about the continuing upward trend in prescribing costs and recognise that a continuation of this trend would lead to an overrun by the end of the year, <Col N="1060" /> I am pleased that constructive discussions are taking place in the GMS Review to reduce this problem.</P>

Also, the use of lead in jointing techniques for pipes is prohibited by the building Regulations 1991 made by the Minister for the Environment and the application of strict quality standards to all water supplies intended for human consumption includes standards applying to lead content.</P>

      <P>11,846 persons with a mental handicap are currently in receipt of day or residential services.  The breakdown of the level of activity is as follows: Residential, 4,548; Hostel, 1,515; Day Service, 5,783. In addition some 7,500 children attend special schools and classes operated under the aegis of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>These figures relate to service levels in 1990 and are currently being updated.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group &mdash; Needs and Abilities, which has been accepted in principle by the Government, sets out the accumulated and emerging needs of people with a mental handicap. In the period between 1990 and 1994 the review group estimated that 600 residential places and 1,000 day places were required to meet accumulated needs with an emerging annual need for 40 residential and 200 day places.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the improvement and expansion of these services under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> envisages a seven year implementation period and in the past three years an extra £9 million has been allocated for the development of these services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 21, 81 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Act 1991 was enacted by the Oireachtas on 10 July last.</P>
      <P>Given the scale and complexity of the new legislative provisions contained in the Act, it has always been recognised by all sides of the House and by the various interests groups that the Act would have to be implemented on a phased basis over a number of years.  This is acknowledged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which contains a specific commitment to implement the legislation over the period of the seven-year programme.</P>
      <P>Certain provisions of the Act were brought into operation on 1 December last.  These include Section 74 which imposes new legal controls on the sale of solvents to children.</P>
      <P>The following provisions of the Act were brought into operation on 1 June of this year:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 which empowers the health boards to arrange for voluntary bodies and other persons to provide child care <Col N="1065" /> and family support services under the legislation on their behalf;</P>
    <P>Section 10 which permits the health boards to assist bodies and persons providing services on their behalf; and</P>
    <P>Section 66 which provides for the extension of the Local Government Superannuation Scheme to the staffs of certain children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>I intend to commence the following preventative and service-delivery provisions of the Act before the end of this year:</P>
    <P>Section 3 which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and empowers them to provide a comprehensive range of child care and family support services;</P>
    <P>Section 5 which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children;</P>
    <P>Section 6 which requires health boards to provide or ensure the provision of an adoption service in their areas; and</P>
    <P>Section 7 which requires each health board to establish a Child Care Advisory Committee to advise and assist it in the performance of its functions under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that it is my intention that the remaining provisions of the legislation will be implemented within the time scale envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 58 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>My policy is to ensure that all persons with HIV/AIDS should receive the care and management appropriate to their needs.  In view of the nature of the HIV infection, care and management of individuals is required:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;at primary care level</P>
      <P>&mdash;at community care level,</P>
      <P>&mdash;at secondary care level, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;through hospice, palliative and respite care.</P>
      <P>In individual cases, this will involve a continuum which will involve the patient moving in and out of care at different levels.  Consequently, it is essential that an integrated framework is available to ensure that each person infected with the virus receives the highest level of care and attention.  The evolving epidemiology of the disease in Ireland shows that an increasing number of persons will now be requiring treatment, and towards ensuring that the appropriate framework of services is available, I have allocated additional moneys to the health agencies within the past two months to implement the recommendations of the AIDS Strategy Committee.  These recommendations, <i>inter alia</i> support the conclusions and recommendations of Comhairle na nOspidéal on the management of AIDS at Consultant level and in particular:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the creation and appointment of an Infectious Diseases Consultant in North Dublin and a similar post in South Dublin and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the appointment of a Consultant in Genito-Urinary Medicine to North Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of appointing an Infectious Diseases Consultant for the North Side <Col N="1067" /> of Dublin has begun and I hope that the service will become fully operational in the short term.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the analysis conducted by Comhairle on the Consultant needs for the country in the light of the AIDS problem and I propose to keep this under review in the context of:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;evolving epidemiology of HIV in Ireland and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the impact of the Primary Care element of the AIDS Strategy.</P>

      <P>Consequent upon the passing of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, which extended eligibility for public hospital services to the entire population, new arrangements for admission to public hospitals are currently being introduced on a phased basis.  These will improve equity of access by ensuring that, except in emergency cases, private patients are accommodated in designated private beds and public patients in designated public beds.  My Department will be involved in the continuous monitoring of the operation of the new system to ensure that the objective of improving equity of access is achieved.</P>
      <P>Equity in access to community-based services is also being improved as a result of the review of medical card eligibility assessment procedures carried out by the Chief Executive Officers of the health boards.  In addition, a Medical Card Appeals System will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation on the reorganisation of the health services will be brought before the House this year.  One of the objectives <Col N="1068" /> of the reorganisation will be to ensure that health services can develop so as to ensure equality of access.</P>

      <P>Following publication of the report, <i>Planning for the Future</i> in 1984 on the development of services for the mentally ill a policy of transferring suitable patients from an institutional to more appropriate community based care facilities has been pursued vigourously in line with a key recommendation of the report.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 27, 29, 87 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>Information on cancer deaths is routinely published in the Annual and Quarterly Reports on Vital Statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>A tabular statement which I will circulate in the official report gives the number of deaths from cancer for each year from 1982 to 1991.</P>
      <P>The tabular statement also breaks down these deaths into those occurring under and over 65 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the general trend in deaths from cancer over the period has been upwards, it is clear from the table that much of the increase in cancer mortality has been in the older age group: to some extent the <Col N="1071" /> rise in cancer incidence is due to the increase in life expectancy.  Very few people now die from infectious diseases &mdash; instead they succumb in later life to the diseases of old age, including cancer.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the World Health Organisation's European Region adopted targets for &ldquo;Health for All&rdquo; by the year 2000: a specific target dealing with cancer sought a reduction in cancer mortality of at least 15 per cent in people under 65 by the year 2000 and as the tabular statement shows there has been a general downward trend in deaths from cancer in the under 65 age group since 1985.</P>
    <P>To give some specific examples, in 1985 there were 2,235 deaths from cancer in people under 65 &mdash; the corresponding figure for 1989 (the most recent year for which final figures are available) is 2,148 (a reduction of 3.9 per cent).  Provisional figures for 1990 show 2,094 deaths from cancer among the under 65's &mdash; this corresponds to a reduction of 6.3 per cent in cancer mortality among under 65's over the period 1985-1990.  The corresponding figures for 1991 show 2,176 deaths from cancer among under 65's (or a reduction of 2.6 per cent over the period 1985-1991).</P>
    <P>The WHO target in question identifies tobacco-related cancer as a particular problem and measures to decrease the consumption of tobacco are of course a priority of my Department's Health Promotion Unit.</P>
    <P>The establishment of screening programmes for cervical cancer is also recommended by the WHO and in this regard Deputies may wish to note that a cervical-screening service is available to all women through their general practitioners, family planning clinics, maternity hospitals and special clinics organised by health boards.  In addition, the Working Group on Cervical Screening has been reconvened in order to consider what further improvements can be made in this area.  The reconvening of this working group is in line with a commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Publicly funded cancer research is primarily <Col N="1072" /> a matter for the Health Research Board and I would refer Deputies to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 155 of 26 November, 1991 which set out the position on the funding of cancer research.  Having regard to the Health Research Board's allocation I consider that the funding made available is adequate.</P>
    <P>The diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of persons suffering from cancer is a routine activity of the health services.</P>

    <P>The increase in the 1990 figure over 1989 is therefore not necessarily indicative of an increasing trend.</P>
    <P>The balance of medical, scientific and other informed opinion at the present time is that properly controlled animal experimentation contributes to advances which lead to the saving of human life and alleviation of human suffering.  I accept that some animal experimentation will, therefore, continue to be necessary in the public interest subject to proper safeguards but I am anxious to keep the level of experimentation to the absolute minimum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 32 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent year for which final figures for deaths from suicide are available is 1989.  In that year there were 278 reported suicides.  The corresponding figure for 1979 was 193 &mdash; this represents an increase of 44 per cent over the period.</P>
      <P>Research into issues such as suicide is primarily a matter for the Health Research Board and that body has carried out a number of studies in this area. This research has tended to concentrate on suicide rates and on the accuracy of reporting systems.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of suicides amongst young men, a tabular statement which I will circulate in the Official Report sets out the position in this matter.</P>
      <P>The response to threatened or attempted suicide is primarily a matter for the health board psychiatric services who provide services to those suffering from psychological distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community based psychiatric service which are now being developed place an emphasis on the treatement of people in local community settings without the disruptive effects of hospital admission. These localised services, which include facilities such as day centres, day hospitals, workshops and community residences, are making the psychiatric services more accessible and these services are ideally positioned to develop links with local organisations.  The provision of community based services also permits the development of close links between mental health professionals and other statutory and voluntary agencies working at local community level.  This contact facilitates the early identification of people at risk so that the necessary intervention and treatment programmes can be introduced at a stage where they <Col N="1075" /> can be much more effective in preventing suicides.</P>
    <P>Deputies may also wish to note that the recently published Green Paper on Mental Health discusses issues relevant to suicide and attempted suicide.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 44, 78 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>Family planning services are available at present in each health board area.  The services are provided by general practitioners, voluntary organisations and in some areas by licensed family planning clinics.  Comprehensive information and advice in relation to family planning is also readily available through other professional personnel in both hospital and community settings.</P>
      <P>The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1991 is awaiting consideration by the Dáil.  The Bill provides for an increase in the range of outlets permitted to sell contraceptives and for a reduction in the age limit at which persons may buy them for 18 years to 17 years.</P>
      <P>I am at present consulting with my colleagues in Government with a view to considering what amendments if any, should be made to the Bill.  I will make a full statement when the Bill is being considered by the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other amending legislation referred to by the Deputy, the position, as I outlined to the House earlier this month, is that I am reviewing the legislative and other priorities of my Department.  When this review is complete I will be announcing a comprehensive programme of action for the health services which will include measures to tackle problem areas, to improve efficiency and accountability, to strengthen the role of health care and to increase the emphasis on health promotion. It is my intention to bring legislation to amend the Health Act, 1970 before the Oireachtas this year.  A Green Paper on Mental Health has recently been published as a first step towards new legislation in that area.</P>

      <P>There is no change in the role of the VHI arising from the enactment of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991.  There has not been any reduction in VHI membership since the enactment of this legislation and the Board does not anticipate any such reduction.</P>
      <P>Following on from the adoption by the Council of Ministers earlier this year of the EC Third Directive on Non Life Insurance it will be necessary to introduce legislation here to liberalise the non-life insurance market including health insurance.  The legislation on health insurance will allow for competition but insurers who wish to enter the market here must do so on the existing community rating basis.  The VHI will, under the new arrangements, continue to be a vital part of the overall structure of the health services particularly in maintaining a balance between public and private care.  The Government in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has recognised the important role of voluntary health insurance and does not wish its contribution to be diminished in any way.</P>

      <P>The Regulations governing the European Social Fund provide financial assistance only to vocational training programmes which are aimed at training persons for employment in the open labour market. People with disabilities can only benefit to the extent that they are capable of being trained for open employment.  The Fund does not aid sheltered work programmes or the training of people with disabilities for sheltered employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ESF funded programmes are now subject to much stricter monitoring by the EC Commission to ensure that they meet <Col N="1081" /> the required standards, i.e. that they are training people for open employment and that the trainees on these programmes are capable of being trained for open employment.  If the overall funding from this source is to be protected, it is vital that all elements of the programme comply fully with ESF Regulations.</P>
    <P>Where people or programmes are not considered eligible for ESF assistance these are funded through the allocations received from my Department.  In this regard additional funding of £6 million is being provided in the current for services for people with a mental handicap which will enable services such as day care, respite care etc. which are not eligible for ESF funding to be developed.</P>
    <P>In addition my Department will be pressing in the context of the post 1993 situation for a broadening of the scope of eligible activities under the ESF to include training for sheltered or supported employment.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a review of ambulance services is currently being undertaken by my Department, together with the Health Boards.  Amongst the areas to be covered by this review will be the provision of an effective response <Col N="1082" /> to cardiac calls and ambulance transport generally.  It would be intended that the recommendations of the Review Group in relation to the provision of these services would be taken into account by the Health Boards when considering any future developments in this area.</P>

      <P>The National Aids Strategy Committee adopted the report of its sub-committee on the Care and Management of persons with HIV/AIDS on 13 April 1992.  One of the recommendations called for the establishment of Satellite Clinics, initially on a pilot basis, in the Dublin area.  These Clinics will provide a range of risk-reduction services aimed at preventing the transmission of the HIV virus, in particular through the use of infected intravenous-injecting equipment.  These recommendations are in the process of being implemented by the Eastern Health Board.  The Board have identified a number of potential locations for the Clinics which are designed to provide services in areas of greatest need.  I understand that the Board will shortly reach a decision on the precise locations for the clinics.  I might add that I recently provided the Eastern Health Board with a special financial allocation to meet the costs of establishing the Clinics, together with a number of Community Drugs Teams who will work in close contact with the clinics.</P>

      <P>One important objective of these reforms is to strengthen my Department's role in policy formulation and evaluation using techniques such as performance audit.

      <P>The distribution of national lottery funds allocated to my Department is made on the basis of continuing commitments to fund particular programmes and services and on the merits of individual applications. From 1990 onwards, a proportion of the lottery money has been made available in block grants to the health boards which they in turn distribute mainly to local voluntary agencies operating in their areas.  In assessing the merit of applications at national level, the particular difficulties of voluntary organisations and the cost-effectiveness of their contribution is given special consideration. While I am sympathetic to the point made by the Deputy, I am not in a position to make a significant change in the distribution of funding other than on a phased basis, having regard to the proportion of the total funding already committed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> It is not clear what reports Deputy D'Arcy is referring to in his question but I presume that what he has in mind are the problems that occasionally arise in finding suitable accommodation for some homeless youngsters.  The case referred to by Deputy McCartan is one such example.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board have kept my Department fully informed of developments relating to that case.  The problems that arose reflect the current shortage of appropriate accommodation for the young homeless in the Dublin area.  The Eastern Health Board, in conjuction with the various voluntary bodies working with the young homeless, have initiated a number of new developments to provide 40 additional places for the young homeless.  Twelve of those are already available and the remainder will come on stream shortly.  Details of the new places are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new emergency hostel providing 10 places for homeless girls is now in place at Sherrard House, Dublin 1;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new residential unit for 10 boys to be operated by the Los Angeles Society is due to open in Dalkey this month;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the hostel for homeless boys run by the Catholic Social Service Conference has been re-located from Percy Place to newly refurbished accommodation at Eccles Street resulting in an increase from 10 to 12 in the number of places;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new after-care service for up to four boys leaving that hostel has been established at Lennox Street;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new therapeutic unit for eight difficult adolescents (boys and girls) operated by the Eastern Health Board near Naas, County Kildare will be open next month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> In addition, the Eastern Health Board are taking a number of other initiatives, including:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a &ldquo;Carers for Young People Scheme&rdquo; to provide family care for adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings;</P>
    <P>&mdash;developing other short term accommodation such as digs, sheltered flats and semi-independent living accommodation.</P>
    <P>These developments are being financed from the special funding for child care set aside in the Budgets of 1991 and 1992 in accordance with the commitment to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> When all of these new developments are fully operational later this year, they will represent a significant addition to the range of facilities and services currently available to assist the young homeless.</P>
    <P>Progress regarding the implementation of these initiatives and the operation of existing services in this area are regularly evaluated at meetings which my colleague, Chris Flood TD, Minister of State, has with representatives of both the Eastern Health Board and the various voluntary bodies dealing with homeless children in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are available to assist Chief Executive Officers in the determination of a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that <Col N="1089" /> the person's medical needs or other circumstances justify this.</P>
    <P>While it would not be justifiable or fair to other groups to extend the scheme to all children with a significant physical or intellectual disability without any regard for their parents means, I am satisfied that Chief Executive Officers take a sympathetic view of applications where the circumstances warrant it.</P>

As an immediate first step towards developing a primary care service to respond to the evolving epidemiology of AIDS/HIV in Ireland, I have asked the Eastern Health Board to establish, as a matter of urgency, two Satellite Clinics for the treatment of persons with HIV/AIDS.  These clinics will be run by General Practitioners and will provide a range of risk reduction services, such as methadone maintenance, condoms and needle exchange, as well as counselling and testing facilities.  The Clinics will work closely with Community Drugs Teams also being established by the Board to implement the recommendations of the National Coordinating Committee on Drug Abuse.  I have made a special financial allocation to the Eastern Health Board for the clinics and the Drugs Teams.</P>
      <P>As part of the development of these services a Protocol is being developed by my Department, in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners on the Care and Management of HIV infected people by General Practitioners based on information being obtained from a project being funded in Mercers Health Centre.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department and the Irish College of General Practitioners liaise on a routine basis to ensure that the primary care system plays an effective role in this area and a nominee of the ICGP has been appointed to the National AIDS Strategy Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to services provided by general practitioners, the Health Research Board is funding a primary Dental Care project aimed at detecting and caring for <Col N="1092" /> the early manifestation of HIV, which can occur in the mouth.</P>

      <P>Under the review of the GMS which is underway at the moment, the question of increasing the level of generic prescribing in General Practice is one of the issues being discussed with the Medical Organisations.</P>
      <P>The matter has also been considered by an Inter-Departmental Drugs Group which was composed of representatives of the Department of Health, Finance and Industry and Commerce.  This Committee examined all aspects of Exchequer expenditure on prescribed drugs and has recently reported to me.  I am currently considering the recommendations of the Group and in particular will be examining closely their recommendations concerning generic prescribing.</P>
      <P>Among the actions taken to date by my Department to promote the use of generics are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the issuing of the National Drugs Formulary to general practitioners and to hospital doctors and to hospital and community pharmacists, which lists drugs by generic name and helps familiarise general practitioners with the use of generic names in place of proprietary names.  Throughout the Formulary, medicines have been recommended on the basis of their general acceptance as being the medicines of first choice.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the setting up of the National Therapeutics Advisory Committee under the chairmanship of Prof. William Shannon which among other matters, will be advising doctors on appropriate, safe, effective and cost-efficient prescribing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the issuing of guidelines for the operation <Col N="1093" /> of hospital therapeutics committees, which <i>inter alia,</i> promote the use of generic drugs.</P>

      <P>The long term illness scheme covers 15 specified illnesses and there are no plans to extend the scheme to include any further conditions.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons with long term chronic conditions who in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses, without undue hardship, may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines without charge.</P>
      <P>Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the Drug Cost Subsidisation Scheme.  This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Review of the General Medical Services is in progress and I am hopeful that it will result in a better organised and cost effective general practitioner service.</P>
      <P>I would point out that under the terms of the GMS contract at least three months notice of withdrawal must be given by participating doctors and no notice has been served to date by any of the general practitioners involved.  In view of the fact that the Review is underway and given the stated commitment of both sides to this process, I am hopeful that the question of withdrawal from the GMS will not arise.  In the event of such a situation arising, however, I am confident that an adequate service can be provided for eligible persons.</P>
      <P>With reference to part (2) of the question regarding the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, discussions between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation have taken place and as a result the impasse has been resolved and the need for contingency plans has been averted.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy in recent years has been to reorientate the health services towards community-based care wherever this is appropriate.  In last year's Review of the Programme for Government, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to the development of comprehensive community-based services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the difficult budgetary environment of the past few years, very significant progress has been made in the development of general practice, the provision of health centres, day hospitals and community-based support services for the elderly and for those with physical or mental disabilities, and the fundamental change in the psychiatric service from an institution-based service to one based in the community.  All of these developments are taking place in a planned progressive manner, based on the recommendations of the various expert groups which reported on each service. Over the last two Budgets, the Government has increased the level of annual expenditure on community-based and associated services by £16 million so that <Col N="1097" /> the pace of development can be accelerated. In the context of the general position of the public finances, this is very significant evidence of the Government's commitment.</P>

      <P>The process of providing a comprehensive community based service in place of the traditional model based on the psychiatric hospital has been ongoing for a number of years now and the Green Paper on Mental Health launched by me earlier this month on the 3rd June, among other things outlines what still needs to be done to complete the transition. I must emphasise that there is no <Col N="1098" /> question of these hospitals being closed down until adequate community based facilities and services in general hospitals are provided to replace them.  This will be done on a phased basis over a number of years but I would hope that it could be achieved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Before any closures can take place great care has to be taken to ensure that existing patients are trained and taught how to adapt to the new services being provided for them.  This can be a traumatic experience for somebody who has been institutionalised for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the years 1988 and 1989 which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a copy forwarded to the President of the High Court on 2 June 1992 indicates that many of these hospitals are no longer suited to provide a standard of care appropriate to the end of the 20th century.  This is a further reason why the closure of these hospitals will need to be considered.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes a commitment to complete the transition to a community based and integrated psychiatric service. These developments should not be seen or thought of in the negative sense of closing psychiatric hospitals but in the positive sense of the provision of a community based comprehensive psychiatric service in line with the best modern day clinical practice.</P>
      <P>My first objective in each case is to put in place alternative facilities so that there will be no further admissions to the psychiatric hospitals and then to begin the slower task of relocating the patients currently resident in the hospitals.</P>

I am satisfied that the overall quality of service to mothers and babies in Irish Maternity Hospitals and Units is of a very high standard.  However, I am asking the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for its views on the reported variations in the practice of caesarean section and inductions of labour among hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The urgency with which I view the AIDS problem is demonstrated by the speed with which I have conducted a review of the AIDS Strategy through the National AIDS Strategy Committee, of which I am Chairman, and its four subcommittees.</P>
      <P>The Strategy Committee adopted a series of recommendations on 13 April 1992 in relation to the following: care and management of persons with HIV/AIDS; education/prevention; anti-discrimination; and surveillance/ epidemiology.</P>
      <P>These recommendations have been circulated for implementation to the health services and relevant Government Departments and on 27 April 1992 I announced that additional funding of £2.5 million would be made available to implement the recommendations, to supplement the amounts already being spent on HIV/AIDS and to enable new programmes and services to be implemented in line with the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These new programmes are being implemented as a matter of urgency and I will be monitoring their implementation very closely through the National AIDS Strategy Committee.  Towards this end I <Col N="1102" /> propose to meet the chairman of the four subcommittees shortly to develop a mechanism for monitoring the implementation of this strategy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the measures or programmes of information on AIDS being undertaken this year to alert the public to the dangers of HIV/AIDS, my Department are already engaged in a number of campaigns to achieve this objective.  The AIDS educational resource materials for second level schools have been disseminated to all second level schools in the country and the accompanying in-service training programme has been completed.  A video for use in educational settings, called &ldquo;Don't Turn Away&rdquo;, has been disseminated and is much in demand by health educators, teachers and youth leaders.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department is also engaged in an ongoing strategy called &ldquo;Convenience Advertising&rdquo;.  This strategy brings messages about HIV/AIDS to the public's attention by placing specific messages in toilet and washroom facilities.  Messages have been placed in all third level colleges and universities, in many leisure and entertainment venues and in women's health centres and also within the Department of Health.  We are currently considering the possibility of extending this campaign.  The third level colleges aspect of this campaign was evaluated and showed very favourable rates of recognition and recall in comparison with other media approaches.  These messages are rotated so that specific messages about HIV and AIDS can be presented to the target audience.  The initial burst of messages focused on giving information about HIV/AIDS and the latest schedule includes more focused messages aimed at preventing the spread of HIV.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit has also given financial assistance to voluntary sector organisations involved in education and prevention initiatives.</P>
    <P>A grant has also been issued to the Irish College of General Practitioners to assist with running costs of a conference on AIDS next September.</P>
    <P>As a build-up to and to coincide with <Col N="1103" /> Irish AIDS Day on May 16th, the Health Promotion Unit of my Department placed a number of radio advertisements which were played on national and local radio stations.  Once again these advertisements served to alert the public to the fact that HIV/AIDS is still with us and that the danger has not gone away.  These advertisements added impetus to the activities that were planned by the voluntary sector to mark this occasion.</P>
    <P>We are also currently considering how to mark World AIDS Day, which is happening on 1 December, and we will have in place a campaign which will once again bring the threat posed by the spread of this virus to the public's attention.</P>
    <P>Approximately 400,000 copies of the booklet &ldquo;AIDS, the Facts&rdquo; have been circulated by the Health Promotion Unit through health boards and pharmacies. This booklet gives clear information about the virus, its transmission and how prevention is possible.  It has been well received as an accessible and readable booklet which gives useful information to its primary target group, the general public.</P>
    <P>Spending in 1992, to date, on education initiatives amounts to almost £140,000.  This does not take any account of the significant funds which will be spent on the media campaign which we propose having in place for World AIDS Day on 1 December.</P>
    <P>All these activities amount to a significant commitment by my Department to help keep the issue of HIV and AIDS in the mind of the general public and to continually alert them by means of exposure to a range of messages in a range of settings to the ever present threat of HIV and AIDS.</P>

      <P>The long term illness scheme covers 15 specified illnesses and there are no plans at present to extend the scheme to include any further conditions.  The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons with conditions such as Lupus who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses without undue hardship may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all prescribed drugs and medicines without charge.</P>
      <P>Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, such as Lupus, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the drug cost subsidisation scheme. This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries on prescribed medicines to £32 per month.  This scheme is being availed of by many Lupus sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> I am satisfied that these schemes, together with the drugs refund scheme, ensure that the treatment of all sectors of the population, and of Lupus sufferers in particular, are being met.</P>

      <P>Specific steps are being taken to implement the commitment given in the Review of the Programme for Government to provide improved day care facilities for the elderly, psychiatric patients and people with mental handicap.</P>
      <P>Day care services for the elderly are developing in line with the recommendations of the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly,</i> which has been adopted in principle by Government. Considerable progress has been made towards implementing its recommendations as a result of the special allocation of £8 million for services for the elderly in the past two years.  I intend to maintain the momentum in developing new and improved day care facilities for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards improved day care facilities for psychiatric patients, I am committed to the aims of the report, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> published in 1984, which recommended a shift from the traditional institutional approach to a community oriented delivery of psychiatric services. Since the publication of this report significant progress has been made in expanding day care facilities, with a corresponding decrease in numbers of persons receiving care in psychiatric hospitals.  For example, the number of day hospitals and day centres increased from 32 in 1984 to 94 at the end of 1990. The number of day places increased from <Col N="1106" /> 800 to 2,424 in the same period.  It is my intention that future allocations of resources in respect of the provision of psychiatric services will be used to maintain and improve the trend in the development of day care facilities.</P>
    <P>As regards mental handicap services, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that with the £6 million provided this year for additional services significant improvements will be put in place.  For example, there are about 5,700 day care places available at present and during the year I will be providing about 300 additional day places, a home support service for up to 1,000 families and additional respite care for 500 persons with a handicap. These are very significant improvements and indicate the Government's resolve to meet the commitments in the Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>The obligations placed on board members in regard to possible conflict of interest vary from board to board, depending on the nature of the board's activities.  The majority of boards have such matters dealt with in standing orders, codes of conduct or other regulations.</P>
      <P>In October of last year the then Minister for Health wrote to the relevant bodies to emphasise the high standard expected of members of State boards with particular reference to confidentiality and conflicts of interest.  I have also issued to all boards for which I have responsibility a copy of the recently adopted Government guidelines for State bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the organisation of services at Tralee General Hospital is essentially a matter for the Southern Health Board.  The board has made provision for some seasonal closures in its service plans for Tralee General Hospital in 1992.  Seasonal closures are a normal occurence for almost all acute hospitals and indeed are part and parcel of the provision and organisation of hospital services throughout the country.  This has been the case over the last number of years and is not a new situation for Tralee General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The seasonal closures are planned to coincide with periods when staff are on annual leave and when the level of activity at the hospital has traditionally decreased.  It is frequently argued that summer bed closures in tourist populations centres such as Tralee cause hardship. However, this has not been the experience in Tralee.  While it is true to say that last year, for example, attendances at the accident and emergency department increased during the summer months, it is equally true to say that in-patient admissions to the hospital through the accident and emergency department were significantly reducing during the same period.  I would stress that the accident and emergency department will not be affected by the seasonal closure of beds at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Seasonal closures are organised in such a way as to have the least possible impact on the services for patients and are carried out in consultation with the medical consultants concerned.  As in the past, all emergency services will continue to be provided during the period of these seasonal closures.  The situation will be constantly monitored by the Southern Health Board and my Department and, should a situation arise which gives rise to hardship for patients, the matter will be dealt with promptly.</P>

      <P>Most health boards have initiated activities and actions in schools in their areas designed to educate young people about the danger of alcohol and drugs, often in the context of a wider health education programme.  It is indeed in the context of this broad health education programme that a topic such as drug and alcohol misuse can be addressed with the greatest possibility of being effective.  A comprehensive programme that ensures that the topic can be revisited during the students school career affords the best possibility of success.  It is acknowledged that outside experts could have a role to play in complementing such a programme, but to use such outside experts as the only solution would represent one-off <i>ad hoc</i> coverage of the topic and thus would not be as effective.</P>
      <P>I am keenly aware of the need to bring home to young people the danger of the abuse of alochol and drugs.  In an effort to combat this problem at national level my Department's Health Promotion Unit, in co-operation with the Department of Education, embarked on a pilot Substance Abuse Prevention Programme in selected second level schools in September 1991.  The programme is conducted with the assistance of Mater Dei Counselling Centre and the European Commission.  Programme elements include Assertiveness, Self Esteem, Influences on Young People, Feelings and Decision Making Skills.  When piloting and evaluation are completed towards the end of next year the programme will be made available nationally if results are satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit has also initiated, in co-operation with the National Youth Council of Ireland, a comprehensive Drink Awareness for Youth Programme.  This programme has <Col N="1113" /> been made available, with training, to Youth Leaders throughout the country. In addition to youth leaders, gardaí, FÁS instructors, teachers and the Irish Countrywomens Association have expressed an interest in this pack and received training in its application.  To date over 1,000 people have been trained to use the Drink Awareness for Youth Pack.</P>
    <P>The unit also launched an alcohol education video entitled &ldquo;Handle with Care&rdquo;, in conjunction with the Catholic Communications Institute and Veritas Video Productions.  The video is aimed at 10-15 year olds and includes a comprehensive teachers' guide for use in schools.  This is a very useful way of getting the message across to young people before they actually drink alcohol.  Both the DAY pack and the video have been made available to all health boards.</P>
    <P>Because of the vital role which parents can play in preventing substance misuse the Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Southern Health Board, initiated a pilot parenting programme, which addresses how parents can assist in drug prevention strategies. Both parents and the wider community have a major role to play in the prevention of substance misuse.  This programme will be made available nationally if results from the pilot programme prove to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The unit has in recent years supported summer schools which have been organised by the Department of Education to give teachers opportunities to take in-service courses in the drugs and alcohol area.  These courses have been highly successful and each year they have been fully subscribed.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department has also made available materials on the subjects of alcohol and drugs for young people, youth leaders and parents to help in efforts to educate respective target groups about problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy will appreciate both the significance and the effectiveness of the substance misuse initiatives in which both the health boards and the Health <Col N="1114" /> Promotion Unit are involved.  The Deputy can rest assured that every effort will be taken to ensure that young people are aware of the dangers of alcohol and drugs misuse and are equipped with the skills to deal with same.</P>

      <P>The State industrial development agencies operating under the aegis of my Department operate a wide range of programmes to support and assist the development of suitable manufacturing and international services projects.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> (PESP), there is a target to create 20,000 jobs each year of the programme in manufacturing and international services sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out in the programme that the achievement of this target would require continuing stability in the economic environment and cost competitiveness throughout the industrial and services sectors, a positive external environment for our exports and a cooperative response from firms, employees and the various State agencies involved in supporting developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of the demanding economic environment, the target in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> of 20,000 jobs each year in manufacturing and international services was substantially met in 1991 with the creation of over 18,500 jobs in projects supported by the industrial development agencies already referred to and by <Col N="1115" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta.

      <P>Married couples have a choice as to how their tax affairs are dealt with.  Under the aggregation system favoured by the majority of married couples, the husband assumes responsibility for the couple's tax liability.  It is under this system that the question of a written request for the transfer of allowance arises.</P>
      <P>A husband and wife who is unhappy with the aggregation system may opt to have the couple's tax affairs dealt with under an alternative system known as separate assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the separate assessment system, each spouse takes responsibility for his or her own tax affairs, and receives separate tax free allowances.  The system is designed to ensure that the tax liability of the couple does not exceed that which would apply under the aggregation system.  A spouse is, therefore, entitled to the benefit of any allowances unused by the other spouse.  Strictly speaking the amount of allowances available for transfer can be determined only at the end of the tax year.  However, I understand that, when it is possible to anticipate the end-of-year position fairly accurately, the Revenue Commissioners will arrange for the transfer of allowances at the start or during the year.  This would apply, for example, where it is clear <Col N="1116" /> before the year begins that one spouse is likely to be unemployed for the full year. In such cases all the allowances can be made available to the working spouse.</P>
    <P>The question of written permission for the transfer of the allowances in this instance does not arise as the spouse concerned has a legal entitlement to the benefit of the unused allowances.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the working of the existing provisions and I have, therefore, asked my Department to examine the issue to see what action, if any, needs to be taken, This review will take account of any views which the Commission on the Status of Women may express on the subject.  It is unlikely that the review will be completed in time for the proposed autumn Bill; in any event, the main function of this Bill is to put in place legislative provisions that are needed by 1 January next.</P>

There are a number of statutory conditions which must be fulfilled before the company would qualify for a certificate of authorisation.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The company in question holds a fish culture licence which authorises the annual production of 1,000 tonnes of salmon in Lough Swilly, and its production in 1992 will be marginally less than the licensed figure.  The company is also the holder of a foreshore licence which authorises the mooring of cages at its fish farm site.  Following structural damage to cages at its site during storm conditions earlier this year, the company has decided to replace a number of its steel cages with circular plastic cages.  At present six such plastic cages are moored on site, and two of these are stocked.  It is intended to phase in the replacement plastic cages, and to remove two blocks of steel cages before the winter.  The mooring of the replacement cages is covered under the existing foreshore licence, and their presence does not indicate any increase in production above authorised levels.</P>
      <P>As regards the mechanism used to license this fish farm, I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to him in response to similar questions on 13, 20 and 27 February 1992.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, at the end of last year, the Irish registered merchant fleet exceeded 200,000 deadweight tons for the first time since 1984.  This increase of 43 per cent reflects, <i>inter alia,</i> the impact of the measures introduced by the Government in 1987 to assist fleet development and ensure certain minimum capacity requirements.</P>
      <P>The compelling need is for shipping services which provide fast and reliable access to the main European markets which currently account for more than 70 per cent of our trade.  The aim of shipping policy is to ensure that, as far as possible, Ireland's trade routes and needs are adequately catered for on an efficient, economic and competitive basis.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of this objective, the Government have proposed, in a detailed submission to the EC Commission, that Community funding be provided to assist investment in unitised capacity in both the Lift On/Lift Off and Roll On/Roll Off modes.  Although the initial Commission response was not positive, discussions with the Commission have resulted in a revised submission which is currently under consideration by Brussels.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, my plans for this year and next are very much bound up with the decisions which are reached in consultation with the Commission. It would therefore be both misleading and premature to go into the details of proposals which are contingent on progress in this regard.

      <P>I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to bring all Garda accommodation up to a proper standard.  When the Garda building programme was launched about seven years ago a serious problem existed.  Many stations were in a very poor condition.  Since then, eight divisional headquarters stations, 13 district headquarters stations, over 30 smaller stations and four major extensions have been provided, at a cost to the Exchequer of over £35 million.  In addition, substantial sums of money have been directed towards the maintenance of Garda stations, for example £2.3 million was spent in this way in 1991 and a further £1.9 million will be spent this year.  All of this expenditure has seen most of the worst black spots dealt with.  There are still areas which require attention and they are being addressed as rapidly as possible, having regard to available resources.</P>
      <P>It would be misleading to list all the stations which are not up to standard, as problems relating to them can vary greatly and can be remedied in many different ways.  Frequently stations which would formerly have been adequate are replaced or extended because of changes in Garda accommodation requirements. Many of the buildings which house Garda Stations are old; some require structural improvement, others new facilities such as central heating, new kitchen facilities, shower facilities, improvements to cells and so on.  Finally, a large amount of the work which takes place is of a minor nature and is part of an ongoing process of maintenance and modernisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> The Deputy will no doubt be pleased to note that I recently announced the setting up of a review of the Garda building programme to assess Garda accommodation needs, having regard to changing Garda requirements and to make recommendations as to how these should be met on the most cost-effective basis.  This review will pinpoint the objectives we must set ourselves in relation to Garda accommodation for the years ahead.</P>

      <P>In October, 1991, my Department issued a document to the authorities of second-level schools on behaviour and discipline and related matters.  It stated that expulsion should be resorted to only in the most extreme cases of indicipline and only after every effort at rehabilitation has failed and every other sanction exhausted.</P>
      <P>In view of the requirement of the School Attendance Act (1926) of attendance at school until the age of fifteen, school authorities were advised to make themselves aware of the legal consequences that might arise if a pupil under that age were expelled and alternative placement in another school secured for that pupil.</P>
      <P>My Department, through its inspectorate has, from time to time, assisted parents in making alternative arrangements for enrolling them in other schools in cases where particular difficulties may have arisen.</P>

      <P>My Department is concerned to promote lifestyles which will lead to good health for all individuals, and the Health Promotion Unit has several educational programmes which encourage healthy lifestyles, covering such aspects as nutrition, the use and misuse of alcohol, tobacco, etc.  These programmes recommend the responsible use of alcohol by all individuals.</P>

These leaflets are available without charge from my Department, Health Board offices and other outlets.

      <P>Any such difficulty would have stemmed <Col N="1127" /> from the temporary disruption resulting from the implementation in Ireland of EC Directive 89/595 on general nurse training.  Compliance with this directive entails the provision of additional theoretical training and the development of a new curriculum and the priority for the nursing schools must, in the short term, be to ensure that students entering pre-registration courses in general nursing are adequately provided for.  We are currently going through a transition period in the implementation of this directive and I would expect that normal access to general training for post-registration students from other disciplines within nursing will be resumed as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981 has not been brought into force because many of its provisions do not reflect the fundamental shift in the delivery of psychiatric services which have rapidly developed since the Act was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 3 June 1992 I published a Green <Col N="1128" /> Paper on Mental Health which includes proposals for new mental health legislation. Before this new legislation is enacted it is hoped to have wide-ranging discussion on the future of the mental health services with interested parties, both statutory and voluntary.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act, 1991 was enacted by the Oireachtas on 10 July 1991. In accordance with the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the legislation is being implemented on a phased basis over the seven-year period of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 creates a new legal framework for nursing home care and the necessary regulations to implement this Act are at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Since 1989 legislation was promised in relation to the following matters:-</P>
    <P>(a)  that health boards would act as &ldquo;fit persons&rdquo; for the purpose of taking children into care</P>
    <P>This was enacted as the Children Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>(b)  the updating of the law in relation to the care and protection of children</P>
    <P>This was enacted as the Child Care Act, 1991 which, as I have already said, is being introduced in accordance with the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>(c)  the recognition of foreign adoptions</P>
    <P>This was enacted as the Adoption Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>(d)  legislation to give effect to new arrangements for eligibility announced in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>This was enacted as the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>(e)  In September 1991 the Government announced its decision to replace the Eastern Health Board with a new</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> authority which will be responsible for all health and personal social services in the existing Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to introduce the appropriate legislation this coming autumn.</P>
    <P>(f) an amendment to the Health (Family Planning) Acts 1979-1985.  The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill was published in July 1991. I am considering possible further amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The necessary preparation and consultation is being carried out in relation to legislation on the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a Pharmacy Bill to introduce registration of community pharmacies and certain other related matters;</P>
    <P>(ii)  legislation to amend the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978;</P>
    <P>(iii)  a review of the Nurses Act, 1985 was announced in the 1992 Estimates speech.  This may lead to an amendment of the legislation;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the years ending 31 December 1988 and 1989 was critical of the condition of some buildings at psychiatric hospitals.  Significant progress has been made by the health boards in <Col N="1130" /> improving standards in the intervening years and the Inspector has expressed his satisfaction at these improvements in subsequent reports.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> outlines a seven year programme to develop a community oriented service providing facilities outside the traditional psychiatric hospital setting. This policy is based on the principles set out in the Study Group Report &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.  In relation to capital developments for the mentally ill, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> states that resources will be made available to provide for:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the continued development of specialist assessment and rehabilitation units associated with the main general hospitals;</P>
    <P>&mdash;additional places in day centres, workshops and supported hostels.</P>
    <P>Health boards have prepared plans to implement these commitments over the lifetime of the programme.  These plans are currently being examined in my Department and will form the basis for the further development of services for the mentally ill with the resources to be made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 143 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>EEC Directive 80/778 as transposed into Irish law by European Communities (Quality of water intended for human consumption) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 81 of 1988) sets down the quality standards which must be met for water intended for human consumption.  This Directive governs the quality standards for, <i>inter alia</i>, spring waters intended for bottling and is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment.  It does not cover natural mineral waters.  These are dealt with separately under EEC Directive 80/777 as transposed by the European Communities (Natural Mineral Waters) Regulations, 1986 (S.I. No. 11 of 1986) which is administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>Bottled spring water which has been carbonated or flavoured is subject to the labelling requirements established by EEC Directive 79/112 and its amendments as transposed by the European Communities (Labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs) Regulations, 1982 to 1991 (S.I. No. 228 of 1991) and to EC Directive 89/396 as transposed by European Communities (Identification of foodstuff lot) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 110 of 1992) which are administered by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>With my consent the Minister for Industry and Commerce will shortly be introducing a voluntary national standard for Irish bottled water which will, <i>inter alia,</i> cover bottled Irish spring water.  In effect the standard will set out the conditions under which Irish bottled water may be exploited at source together with the quality criteria for such bottled water. The standard will also establish a system of regular monitoring and testing to be carried out by producers.</P>
