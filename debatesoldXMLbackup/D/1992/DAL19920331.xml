      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will clarify the statement recently attributed to the Government's communications policy adviser, to the effect that it was his job, inter alia, to brief Ministers about Government policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The post of the special communications adviser recently appointed in my Department is complementary to that of the Government Press Secretary.  His job is to advise Ministers on all communications aspects of Government policy and to improve the communications structures within Government as part of our new open policy on transmission of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that if Mr. Savage's own statement in relation to his role and responsibility was taken literally it would be in contradiction of the constitutional position in relation to collective responsibility. Secondly, would he consider the fact that <Col N="2214" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications made different statements in relation to the Protocol on Sunday and Monday of this week as a failure on the part of Mr. Savage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a fair reading of the article to which the Deputy refers it would be taking it out of context to infer as the Deputy has suggested.  The specification of the job is as I outlined here and I totally reject any question of differences. It depends on what you interpret and the emphasis you put on what various people say.  In general terms it is quite clear from that article that his job is related to the improvement of communications and in no way does he represent anything more than what I have just said.  Anything more would be totally outside the remit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the clarification from the Taoiseach because on my fair reading of that article Mr. Savage said his function was to brief Ministers on Government policy.  Obviously, I have no difficulty with briefing Ministers on the communications aspects of Government policy.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Spring</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if he has met either or both of the Greencore inspectors in their official capacity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a meeting as Taoiseach with one of the Greencore inspectors at his request.  It was a short meeting at which he wanted to emphasise the concern of both his colleague and himself of the distinct possibility as they saw it then of a possible statement in court regarding costs by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which in their <Col N="2215" /> view might impugn their professional integrity.  I took account of what he said and subsequent events showed that no such statement was made in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that he also met at least one of the inspectors when he was Minister for Finance and that the purpose of that meeting was to deal with a complaint by the inspectors about undue harassment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in answering the question but I have a difficulty in relation to the second half of the question which was ruled out of order by the General Office.  In case anybody might misinterpret that I was trying to hide behind that, yes I met one of the inspectors at the end of October when I was Minister for Finance at which time there was considerable controversy as to whether fees, agreed with the Department of Justice, would be paid.  That controversy had gone on for a matter of four or five weeks and consequently the inspectors were on the point of going back to court to see whether they would continue with their job or whether they would have to take an action to have the agreement implemented.  At the time I spoke to the inspector the Government had already accepted the fact that an agreement was in place and that that agreement would be honoured.  I relayed that information to the inspector concerned and they went back to their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Taoiseach has said that he gave assurances to the inspector that they would be allowed time to complete their work?  Is the Taoiseach aware that detailed notes were kept by both inspectors in relation to all aspects of their work and that those notes have been offered to the Attorney General?  Has the Taoiseach discussed this matter with the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No information in relation to notes was conveyed to me at those meetings.  I am not aware of what notes the inspectors took.  They are <Col N="2216" /> officers of the court and it is a matter for themselves as to how they operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if in his discussions with the inspectors, and particularly in relation to the level of fees which he said arose at the discussions, he expressed concern at the level of fees being charged and if he sought an explanation as to how these fees were arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of fees to which the Deputy refers were questioned by the Department of Finance in the first instance.  In fact, the briefing fee was done away with in the early stages. Unfortunately, the Department of Finance found themselves in a position where a prior agreement had been entered into on the rate to be paid.  Certainly, we expressed our views and they were well known at the time but, as an agreement had been entered into, the agreement had to be honoured.  We would not expect the same level of fees to be agreed in the future by anyone in such circumstances.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Taoiseach confirm that the inspector he met was Ciaran Foley?  Second, may I ask him if the inspector indicated that he was being put under undue pressure by either the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any other Minister and if he will state what communication he had with the Minister for Industry and Commerce subsequent to each of those meetings?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a problem with it; it is a question of whether it is proper for me to do so.  The Deputies know as well as I do which inspector I met.  I do not know whether it is proper for me to mention a name in the House and that is all I am saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of whether the inspectors were put under undue pressure or subjected to influence I would refer the Deputy, and the House, to the statement issued by the inspectors in which they stated they had not been subjected to any influence in relation to their final report.  That statement is there for everybody to see and I fully concur with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of clarification, I am sure the Taoiseach was not aware that detailed notes of his meeting when he was Minister for Finance with the inspector were kept but surely he is now aware that detailed notes were kept of all aspects of the inquiries made by the inspectors.  Is he aware of the fact that these have been offered to the Attorney General and will he take steps to ensure that they are kept as a matter of public record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little doubt that any notes or documents relating to any inquiry are kept as a matter of public record but I would remind the Deputy that the inspectors are still officers of the court and will be for another four to five weeks.  Consequently, I am sure all the documentation to which the Deputy referred &mdash; if it is in existence &mdash; will be kept in safe keeping by the inspectors and then by the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government intend to ask our EC partners <Col N="2219" /> to agree to an amendment to the Protocol to the Masstricht Treaty relating to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, arising from the recent Supreme Court case.  The following addendum has been proposed as the basis for a consensus approach in this regard:</P>
    <P>This Protocol shall not limit freedom to travel between Member States or to obtain, in Ireland, information relating to services lawfully available in Member States.</P>
    <P>This wording is the product of the most serious consideration of the complex and sensitive issues involved, taking fully into account the views expressed by interested parties, including the Commmission on the Status of Women.  It has received a wide measure of support domestically.  I would like to welcome in particular its acceptance by some Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, and pending the outcome of efforts to achieve all-party consensus, our permanent representative in Brussels has, on an exploratory basis, presented to his counterparts the proposed addendum &mdash; and no other wording.  As Deputies will be aware, the agreement of the other eleven will be necessary to any change in the Protocol.</P>
    <P>The position taken by the State recently at the European Court of Human Rights related to the specific circumstances of the cases being held there. Pending fuller consideration of issues under public discussion following the recent Supreme Court judgment, counsel for the State simply drew the logical corollary in respect of information, by reference to the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that there is no reason &mdash; and never has been any reason &mdash; to believe that the Community has any wish to take action that would result in the availability of abortion on demand in Ireland.  The purpose of the Protocol as originally drafted was simply to put that question beyond all possible doubt.  The purpose of the proposed addendum is simply to <Col N="2220" /> put beyond doubt, arising from the recent Supreme Court judgment, the right of women to travel and as a necessary consequence to obtain, in Ireland, information relating to services lawfully available in member states.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to affirm in the House the Government's wholehearted support for the concept of the right to life.  Nothing in the Protocol or in the proposed amendment we have suggested would affect the status and protection of the unborn child and its right to life unshrined in Article 40.3.3º which, as Deputies will recall, acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and refers to the need to have due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies have tabled questions on this subject and I will call them in the order in which their questions appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Taoiseach that the situation which is now developing in relation to this matter is both dangerous and divisive and that every effort should be made to resolve it?  May I ask him to consider holding a meeting with the party leaders to discuss the issues involved and making the advice of the Attorney General available either on a confidential or other basis to all the parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy when he said that this could develop into a divisive debate which could only have an adverse effect on the referendum to ratify the Maastricht Treaty which has serious implications for the future of this country in relation to the Structural Funds, the Delors II package and the cohesion package. I will spare no effort, as I have done up to now, to try to find a political consensus.  I will take on board the suggestion made by the Deputy and will have my office, later this evening, contact the party leaders to see if we can, finally, reach a consensus.  This matter is too important for the nation to let any political <Col N="2221" /> nitpicking or anything else get in our way.</P>
      <P>We published our proposed text in all good faith after serious deliberations and having received the best legal advice available to us.  I recognise the right of others to hold different views and put them forward.  I look forward to hearing from Deputy Bruton, at his own convenience, in due course as to when he might be in a position to respond to me. I agree with the Deputy, and I think the House would agree, that this is not a matter on which there should be political point scoring but rather we should get the question right in the interests of the nation to have the referendum passed. We will need all the credits we can muster for ourselves in the tough negotiations that will take place in the coming months in relation to the Delors II package and the Cohesion Fund.  Other pressures are building up in the opposite direction against us and, consequently, I will go whatever distance I can to try to reach a consensus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Spring's request.  May I ask him if he will consider the suggestion I made that we deal with the Protocol by way of a separate question on the ballot paper?  I am not asking him to necessarily agree with it at this point but to at least consider it as a means of disentangling the issue of abortion from the major and significant issues surrounding the Maastricht Treaty.  May I also ask him if he intends to have a discussion in the House at some stage before reaching agreement in relation to the wording?  I am aware that he is in the process of consulting with our partners in the European Community but it is important that the Members of this House should get the opportunity to discuss the issues before we go to Europe with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy, we could usefully discuss at a meeting of the party leaders what might be the best way forward.  Certainly, this House will have an opportunity, at <Col N="2222" /> the appropriate time, to discuss the issue, be it the discussion on the White Paper which is almost completed.  There are some aspects which should be understood. There appears to be a misunderstanding in relation to the Protocol, its existence, its status and what this Parliament and Government can do with it in our own right.</P>
      <P>First, I clearly outlined the purpose of the Protocol and I do not intend to cover that ground again except to say that, when we signed last February, we signed for the position as it then stood.  Any addendum to the Protocol can only be brought about if the other 11 member states agree to it. It is not a question, as has been suggested, of any referendum held in advance of any referendum on the Maastricht Treaty automatically changing the basis for that Protocol.  That is not the position.  The timing of a referendum will not alter the basis on which we signed last February.  What we signed cannot be changed one iota if we do not get the agreement of the other 11 member states. That agreement will not be easy to get whatever the substance of our amendment.</P>
      <P>There are pressures building up in many other member states for changes in the Maastricht Treaty.  Consequently we can expect a reluctance on the part of many member states to open the door even a little, because, by opening the door, there will be pressures to open it wider and we could all be big losers at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>There is the added complication of the British general election.  If the Labour Party were to form the Government, they are committed to renegotiating the treaty and including the Social Charter.  The popular vote in Denmark is running very strongly against the referendum.  There are a lot of changes and we should bear that in mind.  The Protocol does not belong to Ireland.  We are not free agents to change it as we wish either by referendum or otherwise.  That is the position as we approach this important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that <Col N="2223" /> the Taoiseach has confirmed today that the Government are continuing to seek to deal with this matter by means of consensus. I assure him that the Fine Gael Party take their responsibilities very seriously in this matter, but are equally concerned to reach a consensus.  We have given very careful thought to and are working very actively on a considered response to the Taoiseach's letter.  Would the Taoiseach agree that the lessons, particularly in regard to the drafting of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, indicate that we must proceed carefully to ensure that any wording chosen is absolutely clear and is not liable to subsequent misinterpretation or reinterpretation because of the risks that would follow in the referendum which could jeopardise the Maastricht Treaty such as those in the case of the 14 year old child?  Would the Taoiseach agree that it might be useful to publish a legal paper setting out the legal basis for the Government's choice of words or for the choice of words ultimately agreed, if one is agreed between all the parties, so that the public will understand the legal and policy basis for the decision, and that it will not be seen as something coming from a small group in Leinster House, because this matter is of concern to everybody and the people must understand exactly what we are doing on their behalf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Bruton's approach.  The sentiment he has expressed here runs through his letter to me.  My interpretation of his letter is that he agrees in principle with the objectives we are trying to achieve in relation to travel and information and that his is a question as to how one achieves that objective.  The Fine Gael Party will have their own views and I await with interest their response to the position as it is at the moment.  I am open to finding consensus because the future implications of what we do are great.  That is why, from the start, the Government approach to the very detailed consideration we gave this matter has been <Col N="2224" /> very careful, and we have been criticised by some for taking too long.</P>
      <P>In choosing the words we were trying to get the simplest form of words to achieve the objective.  The words are simple and easy to understand and yet fulfil the legal requirements of what we are trying to do.  We are trying to let everybody know what we are about.  If members of the other political parties have any doubts what the words mean, we can deal with that around the table. That is what political consensus is all about.</P>

      <P>Can I take it that the Government will be making it clear to the other EC member states that the Protocol has to be amended, that because of the Supreme Court decision there is no way it can be accepted by the people unless it is amended, and that, therefore, there is no option for this country with regard to this Protocol &mdash; it has to be changed or dropped?  Likewise, is the Taoiseach satisfied that the point made by the Commission on the Status of Women with regard to the need for counselling is also incorporated in this proposed amendmenmt to the Protocol?</P>

      <P>There has been concern that voluntary organisations cannot engage in providing information and advice.  My legal advice is that they can and that is desirable.  With regard to informing the member states of our position, all we have done so far is to produce a proposed text for an addendum to the <Col N="2225" /> Protocol to our ambassador who had informal discussions with his colleagues on last Thursday evening.  He has put his colleagues on notice that this is the basis on which we are trying to build a consensus. We will revert to Europe when we have a definite position and wording worked out.</P>

      <P>To assist the House, will the Taoiseach outline the procedures that must be followed at European level to obtain agreement to an addendum to a Protocol of this kind &mdash; who must be consulted, what legal proceedings must be gone through and so on?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that this matter is not to be dealt with at a meeting of Foreign Ministers to take place this week and that, unless a special meeting is called, it will not be dealt with in the normal course until the May meeting of Foreign Ministers?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that it will not be finalised at a meeting of Foreign Ministers this week, next Monday or whenever the meeting is.  The question as to the final ratification of our proposed addendum to the Protocol has not been definitively decided yet.  I have not had a formal response on whether we can have a reconvened IGC or if this can be done on the basis on which it was signed in February by the EC Ministers for Finance and Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  This is a legal question which has not been finally resolved.  I will keep the Deputy informed as developments take place.</P>

      <P>Regarding the time frame, I have not yet the final details because the question remains.  A meeting could be called very quickly if it were decided that Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs could be the signatories <Col N="2226" /> for a reconvened IGC.  It is a bit premature to speculate.  The debate on the Danish referendum has already started and is expected to be finalised in the Danish Parliament some time in early May.  We have not a definitive date by which the debate will close but our best advice is that it will be in early May. The referendum date is fixed for 2 June.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the very clear account he has given of the difficulties caused by this Protocol, the complexities of the measures needed to deal with it and the consequences it might have for the whole Maastricht Treaty, are a very eloquent indictment of the irresponsibility of his predecessor in inserting it in the first place?  Would he further agree, given the fact that we have had a particular experience with the wording of the Eighth Amendment, that it is not sufficient for us to make a decision on any form of wording on the basis of probabilities or likelihoods but that we need certainty in this matter?  Would the Taoiseach also agree that if we are to seek consensus in this House on this matter, although we were not consulted about the previous Protocol, we should seek consensus not on the basis of what I might term the highest common factor but on a conclusion that puts the matter beyond doubt?</P>

The Deputy talks about absolute certainty, but I am sure he would be the first to agree with me that, in interpretation of either a protocol or a constitutional amendment, there is no such thing as 100 per cent legal certainty. We should aim at getting as close as we can but nobody should hoist a flag on the question of absolute certainty in relation to what may or may not happen.

      <P>For the past few weeks the Government have been engaged in discussions with the other parties, through the Whips, about the Government's proposals for an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment and amendments to those proposals which the other parties wished to have considered.</P>
      <P>The Government's final proposals on the matter were published on 26 March 1992, and I am arranging to have a copy of those proposals circulated in the Official Report.  I hope that these proposals, which have taken account of views put forward by Opposition Parties, would now be accepted by all as practical and constructive proposals which would help increase employment and reduce unemployment.  The unemployment situation is so grave that the House should now unite around these proposals which are commanding considerable support from outside this House and give them a trial for at least 12 months for the sake of the unemployed who are entitled to look to this House for constructive and practical ideas that could increase employment.</P>
      <P>Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment</P>
      <P>1.  A Joint Oireachtas Committee consisting of 19 members.  10 Government nominees.  6 Fine Gael.  2 Labour.  1 Other.</P>
      <P>2.  The Chairman of the Committee will be provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>3.  A permanent Secretariat will be provided by seconding qualified officers from the relevant Government Departments.</P>
      <P>4.  <i>Terms of Reference.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2231" /> In view of the serious unemployment situation, and the gap between employment growth and the net job requirements of Ireland's potential labour force, the Committee should examine and make recommendations on all aspects of economic and social policy that have a bearing on employment creation and can contribute to alleviating unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Committee may consider any other issues or subjects that it deems relevant to its task.</P>
    <P>5.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee should provide regular reports to be debated in the Dáil at least three times a year.  In the course of the debate the Government will provide a response to the report detailing the action to be taken to implement the report recommendations. The Government will be accountable to the Oireachtas for the implementation of the terms of their response.</P>
    <P>6.  The Committee will operate through three Sub-Committees each with a specific task to perform.  (Appendix A refers).</P>
    <P>7.  The Sub-Committees will be made up of 5 Oireachtas members, 2 representatives of the Government and 1 Fine Gael, 1 Labour, 1 Others and one representative each from: ICTU, Farming Organisations, Employer Organisations, the Unemployed and one other.</P>
    <P>8.  The Committee as a whole would meet regularly to review reports and recommendations drawn up by Sub-Committees. Every effort would be made to ensure that consensus was arrived at prior to adoption of Sub-Committee reports and recommendations.  All members of the Sub-Committees would be entitled to attend and speak at full meetings of the Committee when the work of their Sub-Committee is under discussion.</P>
    <P>9.  In order to assist the political parties in preparing documents and undertaking research for the submissions, £10,000 per annum will be made available for this purpose to each Party.</P>
    <P>10.  The National Economic and Social <Col N="2232" /> Council will have an important role as an independent body providing backup, research and advice to the Committee. In addition the Committee would be empowered to commission reports and studies, either from NESC or from the ESRI and would be entitled to up to date information on areas under study.</P>
    <P>11.  The Committee would liaise on a regular basis with members of Government, through the medium of the task force implementing the Culliton report and the Task Force on Employment.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Appendix A</P>
    <P>Sub-Committees</P>
    <P>1.  <i>Job Creation Strategies.</i></P>
    <P>The focus on this Sub-Committee would be to build and maintain a consensus around the various strategies already outlined by Culliton and other relevant reports.</P>
    <P>The Sub-Committee would examine the various recommendations relating to the impact of tax reform on job creation policy; strategies to increase the level of self-sustaining employment to promote the sharing of available employment; the role of the public and private sectors in wealth and job creation, and the need to gear the market economy towards the creation of maximum employment; employment development plans in such areas as value-added, import substitution, linkages, and regional and sectoral structures would be given special attention.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Strategies for the Unemployed.</i></P>
    <P>This Sub-Committee will focus on the unemployed.</P>
    <P>It will make recommendations aimed at gearing the labour force more effectively to benefit from economic growth; identify obstacles to employment, to the take up of employment and recommend strategies to overcome these obstacles; consider the effectiveness of the educational system and of existing training and employment schemes, with particular reference to the needs of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>In addition the Sub-Committee could also address the question of how work <Col N="2233" /> could be more evenly shared across the community.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>The European Issue.</i></P>
    <P>This Sub-Committee would address European aspects of the crisis.  Its purpose would be to build and maintain a consensus around the need to develop a strategy based on an EC response to the issue of unemployment.  Specifically, the Sub-Committee will seek to develop (and propose to the Government and the Oireachtas) the economic and social measures necessary for the development of an EC employment policy which will ensure a fair distribution of investment and employment in the regions of Europe, and will give priority to disadvantaged regions.</P>

Is he aware that Ministers have been full members of committees of this House, for example, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was a full member of the special committee dealing with the Companies Bill?  Therefore, there is no obstacle to members of the Government being full members of this committee or of any other committee. Would the Taoiseach agree that if there is an obstacle under Standing Orders to Ministers being asked to appear before the committees, it is perfectly in order to change Standing Orders to allow for their appearance?

      <P>I, as Taoiseach, am chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee responsible for the implementation of the Culliton report.  Under the CRC there is a task force on employment and a task force on tourism.  Twelve black spots have been picked out for special treatment under the area based projects.  Looking at all the interested groups and different organisations involved, we ask ourselves who are the people who are most often left out?  The answer, of course, is Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I have listened to criticism in this House about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  It has been said that the political system was being by-passed in relation to their views on unemployment, the biggest single challenge facing this country.  The opportunity now given to involve the House and other organisations that are not already involved in making an input through the structure of subcommittees &mdash; an opportunity that will result in the issue of reports to the House at least three times a year and will require a Government response &mdash; is a meaningful way of involving those who are not already involved and not over-involving those who are already involved.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Ard-Fheis speech I stated that &ldquo;the greatest challenge we face in the nineties &mdash; the one that will show if we succeed as a society &mdash; is to create jobs here at home for all our young people who want to work in Ireland&rdquo;.  As the House is aware, the Government are undertaking a number of initiatives to promote job creation in addition to measures already taken such as the Task Force on Employment, which combines the views of the social partners, Government Departments and the commercial State bodies.</P>
      <P>The new initiatives include: the ministerial committee chaired by myself and the complementary task force to implement the Culliton report so that all obstacles to the creation of more jobs in industry and services are removed and all necessary measures to accelerate the provision of such jobs are speedily taken; and the Task Force on Tourism, which is now in operation, with the special remit to increase employment in tourism, which has unique potential for the emloyment of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we have negotiated the <Col N="2243" /> details of the new employment and training schemes with the European Commission, which, over twelve months, will provide employment or training for 25,000 persons who are on the Live Register for at least two months.  Young people, who represent 23 per cent of the Live Register, will greatly benefit from these schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government's most recent initiative has been to propose the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment, which should be seen as a major initiative to harness the ideas of all political parties in providing employment for young people.</P>
    <P>All Government Departments have been asked to bring forward new ideas or proposals for the creation of sustainable jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the biggest obstacle to job creation in this country is the extra cost requirement on employers who want to employ somebody?  Would he not agree that an employer wishing to employ someone has to pay 57p in the pound over and above what is received by the employee simply to employ that person? Would he agree that nothing sold in the shops, apart from cigarettes, is as severely taxed as is the creation of a job? Would he agree that some employers face an additional tax, equivalent to 20p in the pound, to cover the cost of insuring their workers under employers' liability insurance?  Finally, would he agree that the most crucial issue that must be dealt with is finding the means to reduce the cost of creating a job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a contribution towards the problem in all of the areas to which the Deputy has referred.  The cost of employing someone is certainly a factor, but it is not the factor that the Deputy would like us all to believe.  The Government did undertake a 12-month trial in which anyone taking on a new employee did not have to pay PRSI.  The response to that trial was very minimal compared to the result one would expect after continually hearing the argument <Col N="2244" /> that Deputy Bruton is making.  In relation to the question of the social costs on employment, I am sure that when the Deputy studies the issue he will agree that Ireland has one of the lowest overall levels of social cost compared with payroll costs in Europe.  As a consequence we are very competitive with our EC partners.  Certainly in relation to the level of taxation &mdash; an area identified as being in need of reform by the Government as far back as 1989 &mdash; I was the first Minister in 20 years to begin reducing the rates, lowering the standard rate from 35 per cent, which is now down to 28 per cent and the top rate from 58 per cent, which is now down to 48 per cent.  Nonetheless, they need to be lowered even further.</P>
      <P>There are other costs, such as the cost of State services.  One thing that contributed most to rendering our economy more competitive in recent years was the fact that we were able to hold down the cost of electricity for three years, hold down the cost of telecommunications and many other services, because they must be recouped by the private sector in selling their goods abroad.  All those areas are being tackled and will continue to be tackled by this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out first that at the junior certificate examination, to be held for the first time this year, the examination will be set at two levels in all subjects and at three levels in Irish, English and mathematics.  This is a major departure from the intermediate certificate where different levels existed in Irish and English only, where there were two levels, and in mathematics where there were three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard it as educationally undesirable <Col N="2245" /> to have young students remain uncertain up to the time of the examination of the levels appropriate to them.  It is considered that, after three years of study, students should be quite clear, with the advice of their teachers, on what level of examination they should take.  Where students have finally to make up their minds by 1 May the pressure of choice will be removed from their consideration and they will be better able to concentrate on and prepare for their chosen level.</P>
    <P>Experience with mathematics at the intermediate certificate examination has shown that students opted for lower levels in greater numbers than was indicated. This was done against the advice of their teachers beforehand and, in some cases, of the principal on the day of the examination.  Clearly, some candidates made their choice of a less challenging option because it was available to them and, accordingly, did not do themselves justice.</P>
    <P>In the light of this experience and of all the circumstances surrounding the new examination, I have concluded that it is not in the best interests of young students to leave them with the pressure of making up their minds on the day of the examination regarding the level which they intend to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that his announcement has caused pandemonium in the schools, that there is involved here a fundamental, traditional right to opt on the day?  Does he not realise that after 1 May a student could decide that he was not fit for pass or that he would prefer to opt for honours.  I put it to the Minister that, on the day, if a pupil who is entered for a pass paper decides to do an honours paper, the superintendent has no option but to give that pupil his or her honours paper or <i>vice versa.</i>  Furthermore, if a superintendent does not do so, both the superintendent and the Minister will find themselves in deep legal water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Higgins.  I am satisfied that if a <Col N="2246" /> pupil has been studying for an examination over three years, some five weeks before sitting that examination is about the right time at which to make up one's mind whether one is going to take a higher or lower paper.  I have given this a lot of consideration and am happy that to put that pressure on students on the day of the examination is not fair to them. It is better to decide calmly and coolly five weeks before the exam, after two years and eleven months of study, which paper one plans to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that he has taken his decision based not on educational factors &mdash; because, as a former teacher, I can tell him that the reverse of what he says is true &mdash; but on logistical and/or cost factors, on the fact that there will not be sufficient honours or pass papers to fit into the box, which is what the Minister has said?  I put it to him that students' names are entered by the school authorities and if a student says he wants a pass paper then that student has the right to demand and get that paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a difference of philosophy between the Deputy and me.  My main considerations are educational.  I do not believe that, after two years and eleven months of study for an examination, a student should not be in a position in advance to decide at that time.  I think it would be exerting undue pressure to put it up to them on the actual day.  Indeed, experience has shown that, when that has happened, students have changed their minds in large numbers, some of which must be attributed to the panic of the moment.  In my view that is not fair on young students.</P>

      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to the alternative leaving certificate ordinary mathematics course, a course drawn up on the specific instructions of his predecessor, by a mathematics course committee established by his Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, who issued a circular letter to schools advising them that the course would be of a high standard. Yet 2,500 students now discover that 200 of the 217 courses run by the RTC and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges will not be accepted.  Would the Minister not agree that it boils down to a wrangle between people at various mathematical levels with regard to the status to be accorded the course, which matter should be rectified straightaway?</P>

      <P>I understand the difficulty. However, I should say that the alternative mathematics paper is accepted as satisfying the basic entry requirements to third level, but as the Deputy will know, is not accepted for certain courses where strength in mathematics is an important prerequisite. Indeed, perhaps that is how it should be. For example, it is acceptable for entry to certain BA courses but is not acceptable for engineering, science or economics where strong proficiency in mathematics is to be expected.  To do it any other way would mean some students would not be able to keep up.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree it is unfair and inequitable to students &mdash; who enter such courses in a bona fide manner, assurances having been given them &mdash; that effectively 200 courses are now closed off to them for third level entry purposes?  Does the Minister realise that the teachers and the colleges are adamant that the standard is high, that the teachers in schools believe the standard is high?  Would he not agree that it is a highly practical, orientated, well disciplined course?  Yet the colleges are digging in, the students being the victims of nothing more than an elitist argument on the part of a number of people in the colleges who pride themselves on having PhDs in mathematics.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 27 of 19 February last, I am very conscious of the need for career guidance and to ensure that greater numbers of pupils have access to it.</P>
      <P>Significant numbers of our post-primary schools already have an ex-quota guidance provision and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for still more schools to have such a provision over the next three years.</P>
      <P>Guidance is given to students on an on-going basis during the course of their schooling.  Pupils will have been advised of the various options open to them, depending on their performance at the leaving certificate examination, well in advance of the examination itself.</P>
      <P>However, I do appreciate the special need for timely guidance and my Department will review the present arrangement with the teachers organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the two weeks immediately following the issue of the leaving certificate results are two of the most vital weeks in the lifetime of a student, when they make career choices, subject choices and lifelong course choices.  Would he agree it is fundamentally wrong that, in those two weeks, substantial numbers of career guidance teachers should decide to absent themselves from schools, albeit on grounds of taking holidays?  Would he not agree that it would be much more sensible to retain the services of such career guidance teachers for those two weeks &mdash; allowing them to take two weeks leave of absence at some other time of the year &mdash; thereby making their professional services available to the children badly in need of guidance at that stage?</P>

However, I have to say that, at best, that would have to be a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; provision; it could not be the method of guiding pupils which must take place throughout the year on a broader range of issues affecting them.  I will have the Deputy's suggestion, which is worthy of consideration, discussed with the teachers' organisations.</P>

I do not think this difficulty can be solved by way of a two week crash course after the issuing of the leaving certificate results.  I will have discussions with the teachers' organisations about the provision of some type of &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; service at that stage to see if it is practical.  As I said, such a course would not of itself resolve the entire problem.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to develop pre-school services on a nationwide basis along the lines suggested by <Col N="2251" /> the Deputy.  Since children are entitled to enter school from the age of four years, much of what is considered pre-schooling in other countries is already incorporated in the primary school system in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Primary Education Review Body recommended that more pressing areas of concern affecting the quality of education provision from age four to age 12 years plus be given priority over a general system of pre-schooling for children aged four and I am in agreement with that view.</P>
      <P>Further comments on this matter will be contained in the forthcoming Green Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that many children entering the formal education system at present are very deficient in terms of verbal skills, social skills and general preparedness for school and that resources should be provided for proper pre-school facilities? The Minister should bear in mind that in terms of language skills, the ability of a child to learn a language declines from the age of five years onwards.  I believe a large number of children entering the formal educational system are sadly deficient in verbal skills and they will never make up the ground they have lost during their initial years because they come from a socially deprived background. If we do not address this issue it will be to our loss in the future.</P>

      <P>By continental standards we have a pre-school system.  Most continental children do not go to school until they are six years while in Ireland some 65 per cent of four year olds and almost 100 per cent of five year olds attend school.  In effect, this is pre-schooling because the compulsory school age is six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to schooling for younger children, I would be happy to encourage the use of school buildings by local groups or private organisations who want to engage in pre-school activities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that such a provision would merely be an <i>ad hoc</i> response and that what is really needed is a properly structured curriculum with trained teachers in charge?  Otherwise, these facilities would only be provided in certain areas and would not be available for the vast number of children &mdash; unfortunately this number is growing &mdash; who are not being provided for.  I do not agree with the Minister's views as regards the age at which children enter school.  We must provide proper pre-school facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Planning for the national indoor sports centre, including site acquisition, proceeded on the basis of Government decisions that the project would proceed. The scale and nature of the project as proposed necessitated detailed and complex preplanning by the Custom House Docks Development Authority in consultation with my Department and the level of fees paid are considered fair and reasonable and are consistent with the extent of the pre-planning work undertaken.</P>
    <P>Payments in respect of CHDDA fees on site acquisition, site management and site security also reflect the lengthy and complex negotiations involved in the acquisition of title to over 20 individual properties on the 12 acre site.</P>
    <P>The question of proceeding with the centre is still under review.  I am determined to ensure that full value will be obtained by the State for expenditure already incurred in the preparatory stages of planning for the centre.</P>

Surely we should at least have a design for a national indoor stadium for this money.  The Minister said that the idea of a national indoor stadium has not yet been abandoned.  Can he give an indication as to the proposed location for a national indoor stadium, now that the Customs House Docks site has been abandoned?  Will the Minister clarify his recent statement regarding the provision of a 50 metre swimming pool on the Belfield site?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the feasibility study was carried out in 1988.  The plans envisaged at that stage would not be suitable today for a number of reasons.  I should like to say to the Deputy that alternative sites for a stadium are being considered.  The Deputy referred to the building of an Olympic-type swimming pool complex.  I have not identified any specific site for such a complex yet but a number of sites are being investigated.  I hope to make some progress in this regard in the not too distant future.</P>

Is the Minister making another announcement in this regard today?</P>

      <P>A number of alternative proposals are being actively investigated at present.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I have been in office for a short time only and I need a reasonable length of <Col N="2255" /> time to familiarise myself with this matter.  As I said in the media, I regard the provision of a 50 metre swimming pool as a priority.</P>
      <P>With regard to the building of an indoor sports stadium, it is important to remember that circumstances have changed in many respects since the feasibility study was carried out.  I will read these out to the Deputy.  They include the development of conference facilities at a number of locations throughout the city and country; the development of the Point Depot with a seating capacity for 9,000 patrons as a pop concert venue; the separate provision of a new badminton centre at Baldoyle under the regional programme; the refurbishment of the National Boxing Stadium which has seating capacity for 2,000; the inclusion of a national basketball stadium at Tallaght under the regional programme.  This stadium will have seating capacity for 3,500 and will cater for all the major basketball events and provide facilities for other indoor games, for example volleyball, badminton and gymnastics.  Finally, a house of sport facility has been developed in Walkinstown which acts as the headquarters for 13 national sporting organisations. All of these developments have taken place over the past number of years and they have changed the entire picture. Because of these changes, I hope to announce alternative plans in the not too distant future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 73:</P>
      <P>In page 20, lines 38 to 42, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the appointment of directors to the Environmental Protection Agency.  In section 21, which we did not get the opportunity to debate because of the guillotine, there is a procedure laid down in subsection (1) for the appointment of the Director General. Subsection (2) provides that a committee shall be established consisting of (a) the secretary to the Government, (b) the secretary to the Department of the Environment, (c) the chairperson of the Council of An Taisce &mdash; the National Trust for Ireland, (d) the managing director of the Industrial Development Authority, (e) the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and (f) the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women, will recommend three names for appointment to the post of director general.  On the face of it, that is a very fair way of making the appointment. As I understand it, the purpose of this provision is to take the appointment of director general out of the realm of political patronage and to establish some kind of independent basis for it.  My understanding is that the thinking behind the section is to copperfasten the independence of the Environmental Protection Agency.  While Members may wish to amend the manner in which this is done, I think we would all agree with the principle behind it.</P>
      <P>However, a different procedure is being provided in section 24 to deal with the appointment of directors.  The formula retains the idea that the committee will select candidates whose names will be passed to the Minister who will then make the appointment.  However, in section 24 (2) there is the extraordinary provision that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Director General (where a Director General is in office) or the Deputy Director General (where a Deputy Director General is in office) <Col N="2399" /> if there is no Director General in office, by order specify qualifications for all posts, or any particular post, of director.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister should seek to require that power in the first place since the Bill sets out in some considerable detail the way in which the agency is to be structured and its functions. The qualifications of people who will carry out those functions clearly derives from the content of the legislation. It would obviously be a matter for the committee to be established to assess the qualifications of the various directors and make their recommendation to the Minister on that basis.</P>
    <P>In the subsection which my amendment seeks to delete from the Bill, the Minister wants to be able to set down the qualifications for the individual post of director.  This is a very small country and the number of people who would qualify to be appointed as directors to the Environmental Protection Agency would be few.  If we sat down to think about it, most people could probably list, and it would not be very long, the names of the people who would qualify as potential directors of the agency.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can make an order specifying the qualifications of the director general or individual directors, we will be opening the door to undermining the independence of the Environmental Protection Agency and to the kind of political interference in the appointment of directors which section 21 seeks to eliminate.  This means he could be in cahoots with the director general, and effectively could virtually nominate the directors.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely dangerous subsection to have in this Bill.  In my view it has the effect of undermining the independence of the agency, of opening the floodgates for political interference in the appointment of the directors and it virtually gives the Minister power, sometimes in co-operation with the director general, to decide who the individual <Col N="2400" /> directors will be.  I think that provision should be deleted.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a committee which will have the power to nominate certain people for appointment by the Minister, then it should be left to that committee to assess the applications they receive.  If the Minister can say it must be a qualification in chemistry, biochemistry or in one of the marine sciences or whatever, he can identify the person who will be appointed as director.  That seems to defeat the whole purpose of the independence of the agency and the idea of an independent committee which would assess the applications and then make recommendations to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have considerable reservations about the manner in which it is proposed to appoint directors. We already discussed at some length the method by which the director general would be appointed by the Government. While I was not totally happy with the provisions of section 21 we accepted it. The director general has no independent board to be accountable to; there are no outside directors and there are no directors on the board who can feel independent of the Minister.  We have a situation where the director general, the chief executive of the Employment Equality Agency, will have next to no clout in the appointment of directors.  That will greatly undermine the authority and power of the director general in the appointment and of the other senior executives of the agency.  Does the Minister of State know of any other board, company or agency, where the chief executive has virtually no say in the appointment of the other senior executives. It seems to me that the director general will, on the other hand, be beholden to the Minister to whom he will report directly, in the absence of an independent board and, on the other hand, he will be hamstrung because he has no power over the directors.  Not only will he not have the power to appoint or influence the appointments, he will have no power to dismiss, the only power he would seem to have in respect of the <Col N="2401" /> other directors will be assigning duties between them.</P>
      <P>All the sections from section 21 onwards, in this part of the Bill, are making untried provisions which we should have had more times to tease out. We should not be afraid to try novel provisions but we are trying to set up an effective and powerful agency which will be independent of Government and will be firm in the prosecution of its remit to improve and protect our environment.</P>
      <P>Under section 24 we could have directors who happen to find favour with the Minister of the day but who may be totally incompatible with the director general. I know from my experience as a Minister responsible for many State companies, and from my experience in life, that if the chief executive of any company or body does not have effective control over the senior executives, and they are independent of him to a great extent it can be a recipe for disaster.  Not to have a say in the appointment of directors is a great weakening of the powers of the director general.  I would ask the Minister to reflect on these points and perhaps we could have some significant input by the director general by way of an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand the purpose of the amendment which seeks the deletion of subsection (2).  I want to respond, first, to Deputy Mitchell because he seems to be at variance with what is being suggested by Deputy Gilmore.  Deputy Mitchell seems to take the view that the director general &mdash; or the chief executive as he described him &mdash; should almost have full say in who is to be appointed as a director of the agency.  I do not accept that because, to a large extent, all five directors will be equal but, obviously, somebody must have overall responsibility by way of being chief executive or, in this case, director general.  In virtually every other case the directors will be very much on an equal basis, except where a casting vote is required and the director general, being the chairperson of the <Col N="2402" /> board, will have a casting vote.  I assume the directors will meet to make decisions in relation to the operation of the agency.</P>
      <P>I want to refute immediately the suggestion by Deputy Mitchell that this board will not be independent and that the director general will be responsible to the Minister.  This board will operate independent of the Minister, the Department and the Government.  He is right in saying there is no precedent for what we are doing here because no such board exists.  The nearest we could get to the appointment of a board of this kind was An Bord Pleanála and that is appointed on a different basis.  The board members of An Bord Pleanála are appointed following a nomination procedure by various prescribed bodies.</P>
      <P>I felt it was not desirable to follow that procedure in this case for this reason. The board of this agency will not just be any five people; in the main, so far as the directors are concerned, they will be people with professional expert qualifications because they will have to do a very complicated job, particularly in relation to their licensing role, which we will debate in the morning.  They will have to assess and lay down conditions in relation to licence applications for very complicated and technical processes in the pharmaceutical chemical industry and across a whole range of activities in the First Schedule.  That will require that some directors, not necessarily all, will need to have a scientific professional qualification, and Deputy Gilmore is right in saying that.  To assume that, because we wish to prescribe the kind of qualifications that might be required, after consultation with the director general, is in any way seeking to interfere with who might be personnel directors of this agency, is being very dishonest, and the Deputy knows that.  There are several people with qualifications in chemistry, biochemistry and biotechnology, for example, but our hope is that we will be able to get some of them to apply for the position of director general or director of this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power being given is not a mandatory one; the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used as <Col N="2403" /> opposed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;; and it may well be necessary, following discussion with the director general, to specify qualifications. This would help the selection committee and make them aware of what is required by way of professional expertise and it will avoid people applying for positions for which they clearly are not suited because they do not have the expertise required.</P>
    <P>Each director will not need to have scientific expertise nor should each director have the same expertise but, because this will be a full-time executive board who will have to make very difficult decisions on licensing applications, some of them will have to have particular scientific qualifications.  That is the reason this power is being given.  I cannot think of any other way of going about it.</P>
    <P>It is quite common when vacant positions in both the public and private sectors are being advertised to specify what qualifications will be required.  It is understandable that we would specify the kind of people we will be looking for, in terms of their expert qualifications, when we place advertisements for the appointment of director.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell seemed to take issue with the fact that the chief executive of the Employment Equality Agency will not be part of the selection committee.  I think he is being less than honest in seeking to make an issue of it because he knows that, for the first time in legislation, we are making provision for the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women to be part of the selection committee.  The reason for this is that the Government want to ensure that women have a fair chance of being appointed to senior decision-making positions.  The best way of making sure that women will have a fair chance of being appointed is to make sure that they will be represented at the selection procedural stage.  That is why we are making provision, for the first time in legislation, for the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women, whom I believe is the most worthy person to represent women's interests, to be a full member of the selection committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2404" /> Provision is not being made for outside directors to be appointed to the board of the agency, and Deputy Mitchell seems to think that this will jeopardise the independence of the agency but I would dispute this.  At the outset, a firm decision was made &mdash; it received widespead support among environmental organisations and others &mdash; that it would be a full-time executive board and not the more traditional board we often find in many public and State bodies where it is a part-time occupation and, therefore, many board members cannot devote much time to the work of the board and often many of them have a passive interest in the activities of the board given their other commitments.  That will not be sufficient in relation to this agency.  It is important that the agency have a full-time board of directors.</P>
    <P>While I want to ensure that they will be concerned about the environment they need not be members of environmental organisations; the important thing is that they have professional know-how and expertise to be able to assess and make very important decisions.  I assume they will work together and make decisions as a board rather than make decisions on their own as individuals.  There will be a quorum &mdash; we will discuss that matter shortly &mdash; but they will have to come together and make decisions as a board on many of these issues.  It is important that the directors should have different skills, qualifications and expertise and that is why I believe it is necessary to keep subsection (2).  This subsection will be vital if, following discussions with the director general we feel particular skills are required and that the people with those skills might not apply unless they are specified by the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>I also believe that many people, who might otherwise apply will be very pleased to know they may not qualify and will not have to go through the mundane and tiresome process of having to make an application given the expense involved.  Second, the selection committee will know what exactly will be required and will not have to go through the time consuming procedure of having <Col N="2405" /> to interview hundreds of people when what they will be looking for are people with particular skills.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gilmore said, this is a small country but small as it is, it is not unreasonable to specify what qualifications will be required.  I want to ensure the Deputy that in drafting the Bill, it was not my intention, nor have I any intention &mdash; I hope I will be the Minister who will specify what will be required &mdash; to seek to influence the board of directors and the director general.  As far as I am concerned, and I think I speak for the Government as a whole, I want the best people.  It is more important to have the best people than anything else.</P>
    <P>I also want to ensure that we have the best possible selection procedure to make sure the best people are appointed.  I hope at the end of the day when the directors are appointed that they will be seen to be independent minded people with professional qualifications and the necessary expertise to carry out the comprehensive task being assigned to them under this legislation.</P>

I think she would reassure us if she gave us a more specific answer about the qualifications she would consider appropriate.  I had expected her to do this on her reply, but she did not do so.  Does she think that different criteria will be laid down for different directors? As she has obviously given some consideration to this matter, would she be more forthcoming in relation to the qualifications she would consider appropriate? Would she agree to publish the criteria in advance of Report Stage to allay fears that the criteria will be tailor made to suit a particular individual or individuals or to exclude a particular individual or individuals and to ensure that we will have total confidence in the procedures when it comes the appointment of directors?</P>

      <P>A distinction has to be drawn between the posts under discussion <Col N="2406" /> here and the generality of staff positions which will arise in the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Environmental Protection Agency will employ staff with a wide range of skills and disciplines. It will be in order, therefore, for the Environmental Protection Agency when they advertise in the newspapers for a planner or engineer to specify what qualifications will be required, but we are talking here about the four people who will make the decisions.  I do not want to pre-empt the debate, but they will make those decisions in groups of two; two of the directors will make critical decisions about the future of the environment.</P>
      <P>It seems that the principal requirement in respect of any of these posts is judgment rather than expert knowledge in a particular area.  In practical terms, the judgments that will be made by directors will presumably be based on reports they will receive from the staff employed by the agency.  They will obviously have to make an assessment whether a licence should be issued based on the information in front of them.  Therefore, it is wrong of the Minister of State to suggest that it may be necessary for directors to have particular skills.</P>
      <P>The type of people who will apply and who will be appointed as directors of the Environmental Protection Agency are likely to have experience and skills over a range of areas, whether scientific, managerial, relating to environmental protection, local government or whatever. It is acceptable for the Minister to want to achieve a certain balance in people appointed as directors of the agency, but if the Minister has particular qualifications in mind, or if she has in mind that the committee in assessing the applications should have regard to a range of qualifications, she should specify that in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with this subsection is that at any point when a vacancy arises for a director, the Minister of the day may make an order saying that the director now to be appointed shall have experience in academic life, in industrial life, etc.  The Minister may step in and completely change the complexion of the <Col N="2407" /> agency by deciding what qualifications are necessary at a particular point.  The Minister could also effectively influence the choice of director by specifying particular qualifications.  This is a small country and it is often known who are available candidates or the likely candidates for posts of this kind.  I want to ensure that a Minister cannot completely change the nature of the agency.</P>
    <P>As it stands, there is nothing to stop the Minister deciding that he or she wanted four directors with experience in industry, and that would change the complexion of the agency.  If there was pressure from industry to relax environmental conditions or if there was a controversy involving the CII or the IDA, the Minister can ensure that the next four directors will have experience in industry. That power should not be there.  We should provide for a genuinely independent agency.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of merit in having a committee send in a list of names.  We might all have different ideas as to who should comprise the committee, but it should be as independent as we can get. If the Minister wants to set down qualifications criteria this should be done under legislation and not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis when vacancies arise.  This will undermine the independence of the agency.  It makes the agency an arm of the Minister, and that runs counter to what the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to be about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin asked me to specify the kind of qualifications that might be required.  Every director would not necessarily have to possess any of these qualifications, but I want to make sure that we do not have, for instance, four directors with the same experience coming from a similar background.  Aside from this legislation, decisions are always better if some people on the decision-making board have expertise in what they are doing.  We would have to assume that all the directors and the director general would be people of good judgment, and <Col N="2408" /> that is, perhaps, more important than anything else.  I accept what Deputy Gilmore says in that regard but, in addition to good judgment, those making the decisions should be aware of what they are talking about and should be capable of readily assimilating technical and detailed concepts in relation to all kinds of toxic waste matters, chemical processes and so on.  A qualification in chemistry or an honours qualification in biology might be essential.</P>
      <P>If any Minister was to specify that all the representatives must have a background in industry, as suggested by Deputy Gilmore, he would have to answer to the House and to the electorate. Something like that would not happen.  It might be necessary to specify that one of the directors should have an in-depth professional experience in agriculture because, in addition to the food industry and agricultural industries being licensed under the First Schedule, the agency will be involved in drawing up codes of practice.  It may also be important to have somebody with an engineering qualification.  I do not intend that specifications should be necessary for all four posts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's reference to judgment is interesting and nowhere is judgment more important that in relation to members of the judiciary.  To be a judge of the High Court one must have a minimum of ten tears' experience as a practising barrister.  For most significant posts it is reasonable to specify qualifications and it is not desirable to leave that solely to the selection committee.  If it was left solely to the selection committee, they would probably approach the Minister of the day for help in making their decision.  They would want to know what precisely might be required for some of these posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what changes occur in the future, any Minister for the Environment who specified qualifications is answerable to this House and to the elctorate, and I do not anticipate abuse of this practice. It would be extremely difficult for any Minister who wished to have a particular person appointed to specify the qualifications <Col N="2409" /> in such a restrictive way that only one or two people had those qualifications. I accept that in some very rare disciplines we might not have many people with a qualification, but I do not anticipate that the specifications would be so limited as to apply to only one or two individuals.</P>

      <P>It was ingenious of the Minister to import into this a discussion we had on section 21 about the Employment Equality Agency.  That would have been a more appropriate body to have had included in the list than the Council for the Status of Woman, because they are a statutory agency whose job it is to try to ensure equality for women.</P>
      <P>Section 24(1) says that the directors of the agency shall be appointed by the Government.  Section 24 (3) (a) says:</P>
      <P>` &ldquo;The committee provided for in section 21 shall, whenever so requested by the Minister ....&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Taking those two subsections together, could they be construed to mean that the committee would only make recommendations when requested by the Minister? Is it conceivable that the Minister could proceed to make an appointment without making such a request to a committee? Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.</P>

      <P>I have some difficulty with subsection (5).  I understood it was based on the original wording of section 21 (9). We did not have time on the last occasion to discuss section 21 and a number of amendments tabled to it.  I understand that the original section 21 (9) was withdrawn and reworded following complaints in the other House about its obscure wording.  It was made clearer by its division into two new subsections which in the current Bill are section 21 (9) and subsection (10).  Apparently the same logic that prevailed in clarifying section 21 (9) did not apply in respect of subsection (5) of this section, which is extremely obscure.  Anybody trying to understand it would have great difficulty. I wonder why it was not clarified.</P>
      <P>On subsection (8), the selection procedure for the director general is on the basis that the term of office will be seven years, whereas the term of office for a director will be five years.  Is there a reason for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">

      <P>I wish to address the question of qualifications of the directors. It is all very well for the Minister to talk about qualifications, special knowledge and experience.  These are all absolutely vital, but there is something more important, namely, that the directors should have a genuine concern for the state of the environment.  Knowledge is one thing; concern is an entirely separate <Col N="2412" /> matter.  This is something which would have to be teased out in the selection process.  The selection committee would have to give an immense amount of thought to it and it should be written into the Bill.  It would be useless if the director general were fully qualified but lacked the true commitment of achieving a proper ecological balance.  We in the Green Party believe that the role of the director general is more than just a job &mdash; it is a vocation which demands 100 per cent allegiance to the environment.  The Minister might consider including this as an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I wished to be popular I would certainly say I would accept this. In theory it is obviously desirable that every director and staff member of the agency would have deep concern for the environment, but to include that in legislation would be quite meaningless.  I do not think anybody will apply for a post of this kind and say that he or she is not deeply concerned about the environment. It would be legally meaningless. I am not keen to write into legislation something which will have no practical effect.  While I accept Deputy Garland's desire to ensure that the directors and the director general would have a deep concern for the environment, I assume that anybody who would go for a position of this kind would have such a concern. To put a requirement of that kind into legislation would mean nothing.  Presumably the interview board would ask any candidate if he or she had a deep concern for the environment and presumably the answer would be yes and that would be the end of it.  I doubt if anybody applying for a position of this kind would say that they are not greatly concerned about the environment.  Certainly if there was a requirement that these people had to indicate that they had a high concern for the environment, naturally anyone wishing to hold this position would indicate that they had that concern.  While I sympathise with and understand the sentiment behind Deputy Garland's proposal, it would have no practical or legal effect and, therefore, it <Col N="2413" /> would be unnecessary and undesirable to write it into the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the Minister is used in lieu of Government but it is the Government who make the appointments. A person cannot be appointed to the post of director without having gone through the selection committee procedure. Deputy Howlin asked why subsection (5) has not been changed.  The simple and truthful answer is that the desire in the Seanad was that changes should be made in relation to the director general but the matter was not followed up.  I will consider this proposal for Report Stage to see if that can be done. It is always my intention and desire, particularly since I am not a lawyer, to make legislation as easily understood as possible and to set it out in as clear a form as possible.  For many of us, to try to comprehend Acts of this House is a mammoth task, and the clearer the legislation the better.  I will consider this matter before Report Stage with a view to simplifying the provision in relation to the director general.</P>

      <P>In relation to the term of office, the director general will be appointed for seven years and the directors for five years.  The reason two different time periods were chosen was to allow for some degree of continuity.  If the director general and the directors were appointed this year, in five years' time they would all go out of office and a new director general and directors would take over.  In the interests of continuity and to provide for some overlap from one board to another we felt that the director general, as the most appropriate person, should serve for a period of seven years while all other directors would serve for a period of five years, unless they were reappointed.</P>

I would remind Deputies &mdash; this information might not be as popular now as it will be at 6.45 p.m. &mdash; that they have agreed to dispose of sections up to section 79 by 6.45 p.m. and, therefore, an economy of words might be in the best interests of all.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (1), line 4, to delete &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Like yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am usually very economical with words.  This amendment relates to an amendment I put down to section 21, which was not debated, concerning the number of directors to be appointed to the board.  The Bill proposes that four members be appointed, but that seems to be a very low number, given the range of activities the agency will have to engage in.  I had suggested that seven directors be appointed and that there be a quorum of three.  I concede that a quorum of three out of four directors would be a little high whereas a quorum of three out of seven directors might be more acceptable.  Perhaps the Minister would reconsider the number of directors to be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is more concerned about the number of directors than about the quorum. However, I will deal first with the question of the quorum.  When the Bill was being drafted it was intended not to include any reference to a quorum but to leave the decision totally to the agency. Given that we wish this agency to be independent it would be desirable that they set their own quorum and organise their own affairs in so far as possible. <Col N="2415" /> However, it was felt, particularly in the Seanad where this issue was debated quite extensively, that we should provide for a quorum.  Taking into account that the director general would have a casting vote, if the director general and one other director acting alone disagreed it would be unacceptable in those circumstances that the director general would have two votes.  In that instance three out of five people would form a quorum.  If somebody was ill or on holidays it would make the workings of the agency difficult if the quorum was very high.  In any event, in regard to fundamental and important matters the agency would probably decide their own procedures and I doubt if any two directors would make decisions that they knew would be at variance with those of the other three directors.</P>
      <P>In relation to the number of directors, whether it is five, six or seven, there will always be a dispute as to the optimum number.  I am anxious to ensure that this board be a full-time board, a board that would be as manageable, effective and efficient as possible.  In my experience the smaller the board the better.  A large number of people is not needed in order for the board to perform effectively.  For example, the board of An Bord Pleanala which consists of six members deal with about 3,000 planning applications per year.  When the proposed agency are fully operational in relation to their licensing and monitoring role they will have about 1,000 different activities and, in addition, they will have a wide range of other functions. However, much of the day-to-day work of the agency will be done by staff other than the directors.  The directors will make the fundamental decisions in relation to licensing, overall policy and direction matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On balance, I think five is the appropriate number of directors, but of course in cases such as this it is always argued that the number should be more or less. Some people have suggested that five is too many and that as it is to be a full-time executive board we should have provided for the appointment of a fewer number of directors and pay them more. <Col N="2416" /> However, we have got the balance right in providing for five directors.  That would allow for a range of experience and expertise on the board.  Unfortunately, therefore, I cannot concede to Deputy Gilmore's request for seven directors.  I accept that his proposal for a quorum of three was based on the supposition that there would be seven directors.  I assume that he will be quite agreeable to a quorum of two considering that the number of directors will be five.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting that the board will consist of five directors I believe that the quorum should be at least three.  I strongly support Deputy Gilmore's amendment in those circumstances. It is utter folly to have a quorum of two, a minority of the directors, because it could lead to conflict. What would happen in the event of a conflict arising between the two members present?  There is reference to this matter in an earlier section.  What would happen, say, if two people present could not agree on who should chair the meeting? A quorum of three would be much more acceptable.  It is notorious in many companies that it is impossible to resolve difficulties in these circumstance because both people would have equal votes.</P>
      <P>On the last section the Minister spoke about appointing engineers, biologists and so on.  I hope that included among the directors will be a generalist who need not necessarily have experience in any of those areas but who has a flavour for the environment and for the administration of environmental matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay too long on this section.  I understand that the amendment dealing with a quorum was based on the notion that there would be an increase in the number of directors. I support the proposal that the number of directors be greater than five.  Under the Bill the directors will have a great deal of power and responsibility.  When talking about the qualifications required the Minister listed, at my request, the criteria that should be taken into account in appointing directors.  If the board consisted <Col N="2417" /> of a representative of the agricultural sector, the industrial sector, a chemist and an engineer &mdash; to name the areas mentioned by the Minister &mdash; unless there is a multi-talented individual who would meet all the criteria laid down, that would account for the filling of four vacancies.  Five is a small number to do all of the work laid down, particularly in the initial stages.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the number of directors will be five &mdash; the Minister's mind seems to be firmly fixed on that &mdash; I also consider that two is a small number of directors to make an important decision.  As a general rule an even number of contributors to a debate is not as good as an odd number.  An odd number of participants would at least ensure a decision.  The Minister should consider the motion that three would be a better number for a quorum than two. The position is not the same as that for an ordinary meeting in which a small number only is required for a meeting to start.  In the case in question, once the quorum of two is present, important decisions may be made.  I consider that two individuals should not have the authority to make important decisions.  It could happen that directors might be sick, absent or abroad and two directors meeting together could make a decision that would be neither correct nor in line with the majority view of all directors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the debate, and for the reasons stated by the three Deputies who have spoken from this side of the House, I am strongly of the opinion that three is the correct number for a quorum.  I realise that there are advantages either way.  I accept that it is important that the directors of the agency be able to meet but I also consider that two out of five directors is a very small number for a quorum and that that could lead to all kinds of problems.  This is a very minor point.  The arguments have been very well made and it is time the Minister threw us a bone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this issue is a <Col N="2418" /> little like mixing primary colours &mdash; a different secondary colour is made depending on which two primary colours are mixed.  Given that the Minister talked earlier about the directors coming from different backgrounds, and so on, the decision on a critical issue could depend on which two directors happened to meet on the relevant day.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to be set on having the number of five directors.  That provision should be considered again if having five directors means there will be a quorum of two.  To have two directors make a decision would seem a little too cosy.  It would be preferable to have a quorum of at least three.  Therefore, the Minister should give fresh consideration to the issue.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the argument of people being away on holidays or being ill holds.  The directors of the agency will be appointed full time and their job will be to serve on the agency.  What kind of an agency would it be if three of the five directors could be absent at any given time?  Meetings should be arranged early enough to ensure that at least three of the five could be present.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept an increase in the number for the quorum.  In that way, both the agency and the decisions made by the agency would be strengthened. People going to court will know that the outcome of their case depends in some cases on the judge who presides over it.  We do not want people interested in a decision made by the agency to ask themselves which directors met on the day the decision was made or to regret that it was not a different two directors who met to consider that issue.  A quorum of three directors would be preferable in that it would provide for a greater consistency of decision-making.</P>

      <P>In relation to the query raised by Deputy Mitchell, the director general, if present, chairs the meetings. If the director general is not present then the directors present would decide which one of them would chair the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When two directors were present at a meeting and disagreed a third director <Col N="2419" /> would be required before a decision could be made.  An amendment made by the Seanad provided that the director chairing the meeting in that instance would not have a casting vote.</P>
    <P>The agency themselves will have the discretion to set a quorum at a higher number than two.  We are providing in legislation that the quorum be at least two.  Deputies should consider what it is we are doing.  Here we are establishing an agency in which we all want to have faith.

      <P>Deputy Gilmore asked what kind of agency it would be if there could not be more than two directors present at any given time.  The issue is not merely one of a quorum required for the meetings of the agency.  The agency will have specific time limits with which to comply.  In relation to matters such as decisions on licences, the agency will obviously be making daily decisions.  If we want the agency to operate then we will have to be practical when we consider the making of such decisions, otherwise it could well be necessary for the agency to decide that they have to close down for a certain period in the summer and have everyone take their holidays at the same time in order to ensure that at least three directors were always able to meet. It is possible that directors could be away from the agency headquarters on official business.</P>
      <P>I accept that if one wished to limit the scope of the agency and their capacity to make decisions in particular circumstances one would provide for a quorum of three directors but I consider that proposal to be unnecessarily restrictive. It would place difficulty in the way of the day to day management of the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the agency are established and <Col N="2420" /> the directors first meet it may well be that they decide themselves that it is desirable to provide for a quorum of three.  I do not consider that three directors of the agency would be happy to have two other directors decide for them on matters of widespread fundamental importance.  On some occasions it may be that the directors of the agency were equally balanced, two each way, when trying to reach a decision of significant importance to them, with perhaps one director taking a middle stand and waiting to assess his or her decision.  On such occasions the agency themselves would want to decide what to do.  Some of the directors might not wish to have themselves associated with a decision that they could not stand over.  On particular occasions it might well be decided that all five directors should meet in order to make a particular decision.  The agency would certainly be free to do that and I expect that it is very possible that that decision will be made on very special occasions.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to provide for a very restrictive quorum, that quorum would have to be reached every day in relation to every decision taken, even when there might not be a problem.  I consider such a proposal to be unnecessarily restrictive.</P>
    <P>I equally accept that it would be unreasonable to expect a casting vote from the director in the Chair in the case of a quorum of two meeting and not being able to reach agreement.  That would effectively mean that one person was making the decision.  The Government have taken account of such a scenario and are ensuring it cannot happen.  It is desirable to keep the legislation as workable and as practical as possible and I am confident the Government have done that in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This provision obviously is intended, as Deputy Gilmore said and is clear from the Bill, to apply in a period in which a director may be ill.  In the unusual circumstances in which a director's illness was unlikely to continue on a permanent basis it might be desirable &mdash; in order to allow the agency to function &mdash; to reappoint somebody for a further six months rather than have to go through the procedure of dismissing the director concerned or not facilitate his or her return.  While this provision applies also in the case of the legislation in regard to An Bord Pleanála it has never been used for longer than the period specified.  I would not envisage it being resorted to in this case except in the most unusual circumstances.</P>

      <P>We ought to consider a further amendment of this section on Report Stage.  Clearly it is unsatisfctory that the Minister could over-ride the provisions of earlier sections with regard to the appointment of directors by just renominating a civil servant every six months.</P>
      <P>Section 26 (4) (a) states:</P>
      <P>(4) (a) Where, owing to the illness of the Director General or of a director, or for any other reason, a sufficent number of directors of the Agency is not available to enable the Agency effectively to perform its functions, the Minister may, as an interim measure, appoint from among the officers of the Minister who are established civil servants for the purposes of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, one or more persons to be a director and, where necessary, one to be Deputy Director General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if &ldquo;for any other reason&rdquo; a <Col N="2423" /> vacancy arises, the Minister could continue to appoint a substitute.  Obviously, that is a dangerous proposal.  I wish to give notice of my intention to table an amendment to this section on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>While fully accepting the bona fides of the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> the intention of the section is contend it is not good legislation that includes in its remit a mechanism to circumvent the whole intention of the Bill.  Any Minister who might succeed the present one, could simply circumvent the normal appointments procedure by appointing whomsoever he or she chose to be a director, deputy director but, apparently, not Director General <i>ad infinitum.</i>  The Minister said that is possible but will not happen.  She cited the legislation establishing An Bord Pleanála and said a similar provision had been included there and has not been abused.  But, when in preparing legislation, we should strive to have our actual intentions enacted.  Will the Minister consider tabling an amendment on Report Stage to limit a subsequent reappointment to one term only?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make it clear, in relation to the An Bord Pleanála legislation, the relevant provision has never been used, not that it has never been abused.  I hope it will never have to be used in relation to this Bill or agency either. The illness of an officer does not necessarily mean one would have to apppoint a civil servant; it may not be necessary, the agency may be able to continue to operate very effectively.  However, circumstances could arise where due to the illness of an officer the agency would be unable to operate effectively because of the workload or whatever.  In such circumstances it would be desirable that we be able to appoint a public servant, on a temporary basis, to be a director or deputy director general of the agency.</P>
      <P>I want to be reasonable about this.  I do not envisage it being used very often if ever.  If a director is genuinely ill, dare I say, has open heart surgery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or has a major medical problem and after six months, despite that director's best intentions, he or she is unable to return to work but might be able to do so a couple of months later, it would be desirable that, after six months, the appointment would be reviewed and a substitute appointed.  I stress a reappointment would arise only in such circumstances.  If it was a case of an officer resigning, failing to turn up or taking a long holiday, obviously other arrangements would be made to appoint a full-time director and dispense with the services of the former.</P>
      <P>In the case of a person who is genuinely ill I do not want to be unreasonable.  I do not want to have to force a good director of the agency to make up his or her mind within six months, which is rather short. While I may give Deputies a commitment to re-examine the matter before Report Stage, I have to say my thinking is unlikely to change.  That was my view when we discussed this matter in the Seanad.  Indeed I reduced the relevant period from 12 to six months, which does force one to re-think every six months whether a public servant should be reappointed, or whether it might be desirable to ask the relevant director to resign because he or she might be unable to return to work.  Where a person is unable to return to work after six months, but might be able to return after another few months, in the interests of natural justice, if for no other reason, it would not be desirable, caring or humane to have the services of that director dispensed with and not be able to appoint a public servant in the interim to carry out his or her duties.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (2), line 27, to delete &ldquo;not less than five and not more than&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have a number of amendments tabled to this important section which has attracted some comment.  The section provides some mechanism for directors of the agency as an institution, to interface with the environmental organisations, with people working professionally in the environmental area and with those working in the wider social and economic arena.  It is also the section which deals with the question of accountability. There is nothing to indicate &mdash; this is always a difficulty when an independent agency is established &mdash; to whom the agency will be accountable.  The advisory committee will be the only vehicle through which environmental organisations and professionals working in the environmental area, for example, local authorities and so on, can have an input into the work of the agency and have some influence over it.</P>
      <P>My amendment deals with the number of members who will make up the advisory committee.  As it stands, the Bill provides that membership of the advisory committee can range between five and 12.  During the debate in the Seanad I think it was proposed that membership of the advisory committee be increased to 15.  If my memory serves me correctly, the Minister rejected that amendment. An advisory committee of five members would be too small.  I cannot see how one would get a sufficiently representative committee across a whole range of interests by confining it to five members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment proposes that the advisory committee should have 12 <Col N="2426" /> members and that the Minister would not have the discretion, as is the case at present, to appoint an advisory committee of fewer than that number.  What I can see happening is that &mdash; I hope the Minister will not take any personal offence; I am not impugning the intentions of Ministers for the Environment &mdash; a Minister for the Environment might not like the nominees put forward by various bodies or might simply wish to reduce the size of the advisory committee for whatever reason.  I do not think that that discretion should be there.  The advisory committee should have 12 members.  Our objective is to get as representative a body as possible.  Even with 12 members, there is a whole range of organisations whose input would be valuable to the advisory committee but who, because of necessity, would be excluded from it.  If there are fewer than 12 members I do not see how the Minister can get a sufficiently wide range of bodies on the advisory committee in order to give them balance and some degree of representation.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment which proposes that the advisory committee should have 12 members and not to provide that the number be as low as five.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It struck me as odd that there was such a wide possibility of numbers. I imagined the Minister would have thought out the correct number in this case as she did in regard to the number of directors.  I know there was some debate as to what should be the correct number.  I suppose we will never agree on a particular number but I strongly contend that five is too low.  It would be wrong to provide this sort of guideline in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment because excluding the director general, who will be an <i>ex officio</i> member, 11 members will be selected from a range of groups put forward.  I welcome the inclusion of some of these groups and the innovation the Minister of State has brought to the section.  However, as I said a baseline of five is too low.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies are probably aware, when the Bill was being debated in the other House I put forward the figure five because the debate went along the lines that nobody would ever be appointed and this provision would be left there as a noble idea which would never be implemented.  Therefore, I introduced the concept of not fewer than five members.  In politics anyone who changes their mind, even after nine or ten months, are accused of not knowing what they are talking about or perhaps of not knowing what they were about in the first instance.  However, I want the debate to be as meaningful as possible and for Deputies to have an input into the Bill.  Therefore, I am happy to accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment, but with one proviso that I come back to this issue on Report Stage because before I got to my feet I was advised of a particular difficulty which might arise if the nominating bodies did not make any nominations, that in these circumstances the Minister could not appoint the 12 members.  The Minister is restricted to appointing four members; the director general will be an <i>ex officio</i> member, which makes five members, and seven members will be nominated by the nominated bodies.  It is unlikely but if in theory the nominating bodies were to decide &mdash; there are groups of nominating bodies in each category &mdash; not to nominate their four members, then obviously nobody could be selected.  I wanted to clarify that point in order to ensure that the provision has a practical effect and that we do not introduce an amendment which it might not be possible to implement.  Subject to that provision, I accept the substance of Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be my intention to have the fullest possible advisory committee, as they will have a very important role to play.  We decided to have a full-time executive board for the agency and therefore, environmental organisations would <Col N="2428" /> not necessarily be represented on the board of the agency, unless one of their members happened to be appointed on a professional basis, in which case they would be there in their professional capacity rather than as a representative. Although I went that route, unlike the Bord Pleanála route, which involves a nomination process, I was equally keen to provide a facility for environmental and other organisations, a wide list of which is covered under section 27 (5).  It is my intention to exercise fully the powers laid down in the legislation to appoint the maximum number of members to the advisory committee from a comprehensive range of people and organisations in the cultural, social, economic, environmental and academic world.  The descriptions in section 27 (5) are fairly wide.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to ensure that the committee is small enough to be effective and important and to have an input not merely into the operation of the agency in regard to individual licence applications but also into overall policy, the direction of the agency and advising the Minister of the day.  The advisory committee will have a very important and significant role to play in this area and it is my intention to ensure that they can do this.  As I said, I will return on Report Stage with either an amendment similar to the one tabled by Deputy Gilmore or one which will give the best possible effect to the concept he has outlined.</P>

      <P>Even though I may be straying slightly from the amendment, I should like the Minister to clarify a point. With regard to the mechanism for nomination, it appears that under section 27 (7) all of the organisations prescribed under section 27 (5) will act collectively. Yet I get the impression that under section 27 (10) they will be expected to act individually.  How does the Minister envisage the nominations actually being carried out by the groups prescribed under section 27 (5)?</P>

We will be dealing later with amendments in this regard.  It is important not to single out any particular body.  If this were done it would be only fair to name all bodies.  Obviously the mainstream organisations will be prescribed, and I have already given a commitment in the Seanad to prescribe local authority representatives.

Obviously it would be difficult to try to assess the strength of one organisation in relation to another.  However, we can certainly make provision for that.</P>
      <P>I assume that the organisation will send a representative to a meeting where they will vote, disagree or decide to nominate one each for the purpose of the group. There is a minimum of four but they can forward ten or 15 names if they wish.  We did not wish to restrict it to one or two because, with a number of organisations, there would be environmental politics between the different organisations as to whose representative was chosen.  That is why we specified a minimum of four; if there are only four organisations, I assume they would have one each, although that does not necessarily follow. They may decide not to do that; one body could decide not to nominate anybody. If there are five organisations they may decide to forward five names and then it would be a matter for the Minister to decide the person to be appointed, duly advised by a committee from that group.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (3) (a), line 31, to delete &ldquo;and shall chair the meetings&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have just had a discussion on how the advisory committee will be appointed and these amendments relate to how such a committee will work.  I am concerned about the provision in the Bill that the chair of the advisory committee will be the director general or his or her deputy in the absence of the director general.  I propose to change that and to enable the advisory committee to elect their own chairperson.  As you are no doubt aware, a Cheann Comhairle; whoever chairs a meeting can exercise a great deal of influence in the way in which the meeting proceeds.  To all intents and purposes the director general will be the agency and the advisory committee is really the only forum in which there is a degree of accountability in relation to the director general and the other directors.  It would be unusual for the director general to chair the meetings of the advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in later sections in relation to matters of information regarding particular cases which might be before the agency, the kind of information to which the advisory committee are entitled and the kind of matters which would be eligible for the agenda of the advisory commmittee.  The chair of the <Col N="2432" /> committee should be someone selected by the committee; we can try to imagine the situation in which there is a permanent director general and permanent directors of the agency, where the advisory committee meet once a month.  The committee is made up of people representative of environmental organisations, they meet and are supplied with the documentation for the meeting by the director general and by his or her staff.  If the meeting is also chaired by the director general he or she would be running the show and the advisory committee would be a sham.  The director general, as chair of the meeting, could rule things in or out of order, dictate the agenda, the pace of the meeting and supply the information. This would give the director general far too much power in the context of the meeting and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee should elect their own chairperson; the director general will continue to be a member of the advisory committee and will, obviously, supply the committee with whatever information and documentation they require, which would provide for a greater degree of balance than a situation where the director general is running the show.  It would be like the Taoiseach being Ceann Comhairle of this House.  I do not believe that any individual office holder, in addition to being the most powerful executive in the organisation, should also chair the meetings of the advisory body.</P>

      <P>There is great merit in this amendment.  If we are to have an advisory agency it must been seen to operate independently of the permanent executive of the agency.  The permanent executive will carry out the functions but they are to be advised and monitored by the advisory committee.  The detail of the functions of the advisory committee is set out in the next section, with which we will deal shortly.  It is proper for the director general to be a member of the agency and to hear the views and clarify matters, but not to steer discussion.  As we know, a chair can steer discussion and there is great merit in having an independent <Col N="2433" /> agency in every sense.  A good way of achieving that would be to have an independent chairman of the advisory agency.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the amendment as it is a very important issue.  There is a danger that a very strong willed director general &mdash; we are looking for someone who will be strong willed and passionate about his job &mdash; could steer the agency because he will have control of all information and be in a position to organise the agenda.  It would be preferable to have a line of demarcation between the advisory agency and the executive who will be mandated to carry out the specific legislation which we are putting in place.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to strongly support this amendment and I urge the Minister to accept it.  I am concerned about the absence of directors who would take a view different from the hands-on management.  The advisory committee could reduce to some extent my anxiety in that respect by providing a forum for ensuring that outside views are heard.</P>
      <P>We all know that a determined chairman can order the manner in which business is taken, the manner in which questions are put and the order in which speakers are called.  It would be a significant improvement if the Minister agreed to provide that the director general or one of the directors shall not be the chairperson.</P>

      <P>I concur with the previous speakers on this subject.  Section 28 which deals with the functions of the agency provides that the advisory committee will report to the Minister or to the board of the agency.  It is quite clear to me that there must be an independent chairman and, like the other Deputies, I feel very strongly about this.  I look forward with interest to hearing the reasons the Minister might possibly have for establishing the committee on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that I have nothing suspicious in mind. I have considered this issue particularly <Col N="2434" /> since it arose in the Seanad where the matter was discussed and I wondered whether I was doing the right thing.</P>
      <P>Strangely enough I take the opposite view to the rest of the Deputies.  One may ask what objection would I have to anybody being chairperson.  While in theory that is the case, I quite honestly believe that the advisory committee will be far more integrated in the running of the agency and in the formulation of their policy if the director general is the chairperson rather than it being almost a separate body altogether.  If that were the case, I think it may be like many of these advisory committees where they will do a great deal of good work but will not be taken seriously.  If the committee were to make particular recommendations or decisions they would be taken much more seriously if the chairperson of that committee happens to be the director general of the agency.</P>
      <P>There is something strange about the way the Deputies are dealing with this issue, because there is an assumption &mdash; and I listened very carefully to all four Deputies &mdash; that it is better to have somebody who is independent of the director general, as if the director general would be a very authoritarian, difficult person and that the directors would not be independent-minded people.  There is only so far that we can carry the independent process.  I believe it is important that as we have a full-time executive board of directors we would have a facility for bringing in outside people on a voluntary basis to act in an advisory capacity to the agency, which would keep it abreast and informed on matters on the ground.  Outside agencies working in a voluntary capacity often have a different perspective and it is important that their viewpoint is understood and listened to. Equally, the advisory committee have an important role in advising the Minister for the Environment of the day.  I believe the advisory committee would have a lot more clout and would be taken a lot more seriously if the director general is also the chairperson rather than some other person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think the Deputies do not have <Col N="2435" /> much faith in the kinds of people to be appointed to the advisory committee as they are suggesting by inference that unless somebody other than the director general is in the chair, he will be able to ride roughshod over the advisory committee. That is assuming the people on the advisory committee will be weak-minded individuals who will not be able to stand up for themselves.  I do not envisage that such people will be on the advisory committee because, as I have said seven will come from nominating organisations involved in the environment or in industry, such as local authority members and representatives of the County and City Managers Association.  The representatives from these organisations will be more than capable not only of representing their organisations but of being able to fight their corner.  I do not anticipate the director general or any other person in the chair being able to push them around or order business in a way that would not be satisfactory to the advisory committee.  I do not accept that this could arise; I think we would be making false assumptions if we were to assume that that would be the case.</P>
    <P>I believe also that if we leave the post of chairperson of the advisory committee open to everybody there may be political lobbying for it and I am not necessarily sure that is a good thing.  I will probably be accused now of not having faith in the democratic process but the 11 members of the advisory committee may not necessarily know each other.  The director general of the agency working in a full-time capacity is the person best suited in all the circumstances to chair the advisory committee.  If one of the representatives of industry, for example, were to become chairperson of the advisory committee some people might take the view that Irish industry would have clout on the committee; similarly, if a representative of a particular organisation were to become chairperson of the advisory committee, it might be assumed there was something political about his appointment, and the kind of advice and direction he might give the agency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2436" /> It is true a chairperson has a great deal of clout in the way a business is run and you need a strong person to chair meetings particularly of strong-minded independent individuals, as I anticipate the advisory committee will be. However, to assume that the chairperson has the power the Deputies have assumed is a little naive and I do not accept the Deputies are that naive.  I believe a chairperson can do a great deal where he is surrounded by weak-minded individuals or a low level committee but where you have a high-powered advisory committee, as envisaged, the role of the chairperson is not as influential as the Deputies would like to suggest.</P>
    <P>The main reason I wish to retain the director general as chairperson of the advisory committee is that it forces the director general to attend the meetings and be attentive and responsive to the committee of which he is a chairperson. I cannot imagine a chairperson would want his committee to be out of line with him, neither do I anticipate that the members of the committee will be so weak-minded that the director general can lead them down any avenue regardless of how they think.  On balance, in order to have the advisory committee as fully integrated as possible in the operation and direction of the agency &mdash; and since we did not take the route of appointing environmentalists and representatives of the various organisations to the board of the agency &mdash; the next best thing is to have a fully integrated advisory committee where the director general is chairperson of that committee.</P>
    <P>There were some suggestions &mdash; although no amendments to this effect were tabled &mdash; that the board of the agency should comprise of representatives of particular organisations. Since we have made the decision not to go down that road, which I believe is right, because a full-time executive director is required, the next best way of fully incorporating the types of people we would like to see involved, accepting that they cannot be involved on a full-time basis, is to involve them in an advisory committee that is as fully integrated as <Col N="2437" /> possible.  If the director general were not chairperson perhaps he might not attend the meetings of the advisory committee or take their views seriously.  There is no political reason for doing this but I genuinely believe it will be the most effective way of having the advisory committee taken seriously and requiring the director general to be as attentive and responsible as possible to the proceedings of the committee which he or she happens to chair.</P>

      <P>Clearly, the Minister has an extraordinary view.  It is an interesting giveaway by her as to what the powers of this advisory committee will be that the director general is unlikely to take it seriously unless he or she is in the chair controlling meetings.  That says something about the functions which are being given to this committee.  I do not agree with the argument the Minister made that the director general must be in the chair to get over the problem she mentioned, the possibility of politicking between the various organisations and members of the advisory committee.  There is an easy way to get over that problem, the Minister could appoint the chairperson of the advisory committee from one of her nominees, if necessary.  There are many people who would be accepted as being independent in the chair.  It is unwise &mdash; I do not want to labour the point because <Col N="2438" /> of the time factor &mdash; to compound the power the director general has by giving that person the chair of the advisory committee.</P>

      <P>The more the Minister talks about these sections at great length the more I get suspicious.  Her line of logic is curious in this respect, to say the least.  The more she spoke on this amendment the more she discredited her argument.  There are precedents for the Minister's stand.  Caligula, the great Roman emperor, appointed his horse a Consul and what the Minister is trying to do is to appoint the horse the horse's adviser.  It is absurd.</P>

      <P>The last person who should be the chairman of the advisory body to the agency is the director general who is also chairman of that agency.  He will be chairman of the agency and chairman of the advisory committee.  I am amazed at the curious logic which dreamt up this proposal and which, despite the unanimity of argument on this side of the House, the Minister insists on defending. We will be pressing this amendment very strongly.  We want the advisory body to be truly independent of the agency so that they can not only give advice but if they believe their advice is not heard can make that advice public.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (5), between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) organisations which represent the elected members of local authorities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment concerns the kind of bodies entitled to nominate persons for appointment to the advisory committee. The bodies already listed include bodies representing professions which relate to the environment, environmental organisations, social and economic bodies, and so on.  The big omission in that list is the elected members of local authorities. We have had much discussion during the last year about local democracy and the need to strengthen local government. Every political party made it their theme song during the local elections last June that greater powers should be given to elected members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities are at the coal face of environmental protection.  At the very least the elected members of local authorities should be entitled to <Col N="2442" /> representation on this advisory body. The formula I am proposing is for the minimal representation one can get.  A number of organisations represent the elected members of local authorities &mdash; the General Council of County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities and the Local Authority Members Association.  Those bodies should be entitled to nominate persons for selection by the Minister as possible members of the advisory committee.  It would be anomalous if voluntary bodies, commercial bodies, social bodies and professional bodies were entitled to make nominations while directly elected members of local authorities, elected to protect the environment, did not have the same right.  That would be wrong and I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention and I indicated it in the Seanad, to prescribe for the purposes of this section organisations representing elected members of local authorities.  I am not keen to accept an amendment of this kind because it would be wrong to single out some bodies and not others.  Why should I single out organisations representing elected members of local authorities and not An Taisce or an organisation which represents some professional body dealing with environmental protection?  I assure the Deputy that organisations which represent local authority members and which represent county managers are covered under section 27 (5) (b), (c) and (d).  These organisations represent people involved in environmental protection, the promotion of economic and other development and in the promotion of community, and social, economic and general interests.  They may also be organisations which qualify under subsection (5) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am giving a firm commitment to prescribe, for the purposes of nominating persons to the advisory committee, organisations which represent elected members of local authorities.  I also undertake to prescribe for the purposes of this section organisations which <Col N="2443" /> represent city and county managers. There is only one such organisation and I intend to prescribe that organisation.  It would be wrong to specify some organisations and not others in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to accept my assurance that the bodies representing local authorities and city and county managers will be prescribed for the purposes of this section of the Bill and that we should not write this into legislation putting these groups on a different basis to that which applies to other organisations. To treat some organisations on a different basis would be unfair and would be misrepresented by the general public and by members of organisations which were not specified in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am disappointed with the Minister's reply and we will be supporting the amendment tabled by Deputy Gilmore.  I am particularly disappointed that the Minister who was a member of a local authority does not understand the difference between people who offer themselves for election from time to time and members of voluntary bodies like An Taisce.  Elected representatives are accountable to the people but members of voluntary bodies are not accountable in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reason for supporting this amendment as it affects accountable bodies.  The Minister should recall from her days in the local authority all the hassle about proper representation at the highest level.  This is an opportunity to reform some of the attitudes of the Department of the Environment towards local authority members and county managers. I am disappointed the Minister, having regard to her experience in the Department, is relying on her own good will.  Others will follow her who will appoint people to other advisory councils and there will be no guarantee that local authority members or the County Managers <Col N="2444" /> Association will be represented. The Minister is being very trusting of officials and bureaucrats.</P>
    <P>When she was on this side of the House she looked for the highest standards from people in Government and she was always very concerned about appointments. The quality of the appointees is critical.  The people who come from the General Council of County Councils or the County Managers Association would have the national interest at heart.  I appeal to the Minister to review this matter for Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I am not happy that local authorities as a group would be subsumed into another heading, whether it is an organisation which, in the opinion of the Minister, is concerned with environmental protection or with the promotion of economic or other developments.  Obviously local authorities would fit readily into either of those categories.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough that the whole strata of local administration, democratic structures at sub-national level, would be slotted in by regulation under some other heading.  We need make no apology for giving them a category of their own.  They are not analogous to An Taisce or anybody else.  We are talking about the democratic tier of administration below the national level.  There was much talk last year when the local government legislation was going through these Houses about empowering local communities and giving real strength to the local authorities. We are still awaiting a Bill to restructure local authorities at sub-county level.  It is nothing short of farcical that local democracy and local authorities are not seen to be worthy of a category of their own.  I ask the Minister to think again on this.  I have not spoke as trenchantly on any other amendment this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past couple of years no organisation has impacted a greater degree for the betterment of the environment than the local authorities.  I have seen it at county and urban level cross the country. Through urban renewal and beautification <Col N="2445" /> measures local authorities are transforming the whole landscape of Ireland.  That should be recognised.  They are of strategic importance in the battle to improve our environment, a battle in which this Bill is simlpy an instrument.  It is important that local authorities should be afforded a particular slot.  We should not have to be in any way apologetic about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree very strongly with Deputy Howlin.  I would oppose both of these amendments.  There seems to be an effort by the other parties on this side of the House to politicise the committee.  We have enough politicians in positions of power.  We need independent-minded environmental people on this committee, not representatives of local authorities or city or county managers. Whether we like it or not, the local authorities themselves have been very much at fault over the years.  Much of the pollution is caused by local authorities. They may say they lack funds from the Department of the Environment and admittedly this is often the case.  One of the duties of the agency will be to call local authorities to task in the event of pollution arising locally.</P>
      <P>Everyone in this House agrees with the principle of subsidiarity.  Many environmental problems have to be dealt with at national or international level.  It is totally inappropriate for many of these problems to be dealt with at county level.  I am not mollified by the Minister's speech because she is implying that these people will get in by the back door or under some other subsection.  She should state clearly that there will be no specific representatives of the elected local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed to do what the amendment is seeking, which is to prescribe organisations representing the elected members of local authorities.  I cannot see, therefore, why she is not prepared to accept the amendment and to include it in the legislation, thereby ensuring that her successors, should they wish to change the organisations <Col N="2446" /> which are prescribed, do not exclude the elected members of local authorities.  There is a principle involved. The elected members of local authorities cannot be lumped in as bodies which in some circumstances might be concerned with environmental protection and other circumstances might be concerned with economic or social development.  The elected members of local authorities represent the organisations which have primary responsibilty for environmental protection at local level.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Garland has said is claptrap. One cannot on the one hand say one is for subsidiarity and on the other hand rubbish the people elected at local level.  There is an idea &mdash; and it is perhaps useful that it has come up at this stage &mdash; that independent bodies can be appointed.  There is no such thing as absolute independence.  A person appointed to a position in the Environmental Protection Agency will bring with him his own life experience, views, attitudes and so on.  When any independent agency is established a balance must be achieved between, on the one hand, the independence of that agency from vested interests, political interference and so on, and on the other hand a degree of accountability.  Without that there is an élitest structure where people are accountable to nobody.  The principle of accountability is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to be not just a Member of this House but also a member of two local authorities and it is my experience that I am made much more accountable by the people whom I represent as a member of a local authority than I am ever made as a Member of Dáil Éireann.  As a member of a local authority I am asked, week after week, to attend meetings in local communities about matters which affect the immediate environment.  There is a far greater degree of accountability between members of the local authorities and the public who elect them than there is between Members of this House and their electorate.  Perhaps it is because the environmental issues which members of local authorities deal with at local level are much more tangible and closer to the <Col N="2447" /> people.  I may disagree, and regularly do, with other members of the local authorities to which I am a member, but that is part of the normal process.  Why do we have local government if we say that elected members of local authorities are not the kind of people who should be eligible for appointment to this body?  I submit that people elected by the public are every bit as entitled to be appointed to a body like this as people who represent commercial or other interests.</P>
    <P>I agree to some extent with the point that local authorities have contributed to problems of pollution, but local authorities and their staffs must be given some credit for the contribution they make to the environment.  Who collects the rubbish bins, takes away sewage, provides water and roads?  The local authorities and their staff.  It is grossly insulting to local authorities, to the elected members, to the staff who work for them at all levels and to the people who vote in local elections to rubbish local government as Deputy Garland has done.  There is a principle to be taken into account.  The elected members of local authorities should be included in the Bill.  The Minister has accepted this in practice by saying she is prepared to prescribe the elected members of local authorities.  She should give legislative effect to that by including it in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on the outrageous assault on locally elected members by the representative of the Green Party.  It is clear that Deputy Garland has no understanding or knowledge of the workings of local authorities, although I understand he was invited to my local authority area by members of a local authority.  I thought he would have some appreciation of the work carried out by members of local authorities in relation to the environment.  It is scandalous for anybody to suggest that such people should be excluded.  We have already discussed sections which seek to include, as directors of this agency, people from agriculture and industry, people who are hardly noted as always <Col N="2448" /> being perfect in their attitude to the environment, but that was not decried. The only people Deputy Garland wants to specifically exclude, not only from the directorships but from membership of the advisory committee, are local elected members who serve the community so well.  This is an outrageous assault on the thousands of individuals who work so hard, for very little recompense and gratitude, to improve our environment, the fruit of whose efforts is to be seen up and down the country.</P>

      <P>I know Deputies are anxious to move on, and therefore, I will not reply at length to the points made.  I think Deputy Garland's comments have been misunderstood.  I do not think he intended to convey the impression that he totally disregards the role of elected members of local authorities and local authorities generally.  A repesentative of Deputy Garland's party could be a representative of the advisory committee, but that person would not be there in his or her capacity as a party political representative but rather as a representative of local authorities and its elected members.</P>
      <P>The reason I am not keen to accept the amendment is that I do not wish to put local elected representatives on a different basis, even if that affects some members from, for example, farming and environmental organisations and others.  In the process of drafting this Bill a large number of organisations representing environmentalists, farmers, industrial and economic development, workers and so on, lobbied for representation on the advisory committee, but all of them cannot be represented.  It is my intention to nominate and prescribe, for the purposes of this section, organisations that fall into the categories so described.  It would be wrong of me to single out, in relation to local elected members, three organisations, and, in relation to city and county managers, one organisation.  It would be wrong to put some organisations on a different basis than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey chastised me for not <Col N="2449" /> having faith in the democratic process and in the people who are elected.  His party have nominated the city and county managers, who are certainly not elected through a democratic process.  I am not faulting the manner in which they are appointed but there are good organisations that are not necessarily elected by the universal franchise, and we must recognise that.  They do invaluable work in many areas in relation to environmental protection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore said he is more accountable as a local authority representative than he is as a representative of this House.  I share his view that that is the case, but that is regrettable.  Very often constituents have a greater interest in matters that are of immediate concern to their locality than they have in, for example, the education, health or taxation systems, which may have an effect on their lives although the effect is not often realised.  The link between the ordinary life of an individual and the role of this House in legislating is not as easily understood as one would wish.  If the present clientelist system did not exist here this House would be the better for that.  I am not criticising the fact that people are genuinely concerned about their own locality.  Everybody is concerned about the quality of the environment in which they live, but it is not an argument in favour of putting local elected representatives on a different footing, as seems to be suggested, from other organisations that have a very meaningful and effective role to play in relation to environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree to writing into primary legislation that we nominate a representative from local authorities when we are not equally writing into legislation that we nominate, for example, a category that would allow a representative of An Taisce or that we are not precisely specifying the environmental organisations. The Deputy should accept the assurance that, for the purposes of this section, the organisations representing local elected members and the organisation representing city and county managers, will be so prescribed.  It will <Col N="2450" /> be a matter for the Minister of the day, in making the appointment, to decide whether these organisations should be represented on the advisory committee when such a committee is being appointed.  That is a political decision. I am not anxious to put one group of organisations, albeit local elected representatives, on a different footing to organisations that represent environmental concerns in a general sense. Therefore, I ask Deputies to accept my commitment in this regard.  It is my intention to prescribe the organisations about which they are concerned.</P>

      <P>In page 24, subsection (7), line 17, to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (7) of this section provides that the prescribed organisations shall, whenever so requested by the Minister, select such number, not less than four, of candidates as the Minister may specify for appointment.  That gives too much scope to the Minister and takes power from the nominating bodies.  For that reason the word &ldquo;four&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;two&rdquo;, thereby giving more leeway to nominating bodies.  If the Minister intends to appoint two people from a particular panel surely she should accept the two people put forward by the nominating body.  If she insists on the selection of four members she may end up appointing third and fourth choice rather than first and second choice candidates.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy seems to think that, for the purposes of this section, there is only one organisation in each category.  As I said earlier, there may be as many as four organisations involved.  Rather than have environmental politics between the <Col N="2451" /> different organisations, it is appropriate that each organisation be able to make a nomination.  Provision is made for a minimum of four nominations, and more nominations may be made if required.  It is for the Minister for the Environment to decide who to nominate to the advisory committee.  In relation to environmental organisations, for example, in which An Taisce and several other organisations might be prescribed, acceptance of Deputy Garland's amendment would mean that there would have to be some kind of voting procedure between the organisations to decide which organisation would send a nominee.  That would not be desirable.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Garland misunderstood the position and assumed there would be only one organisation and then asked why that organisation should have to send forward four names. Obviously, if there were only one organisation, four names would not be expected.  As more than one organisation is involved, a minimum of four nominations is reasonable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the reappointment of members of the advisory committee. The Bill as it stands provides that members of the advisory committee can be reappointed when their term of office expires.  My amendment makes that reappointment subject to the person <Col N="2452" /> having been reselected by the bodies which nominated him or her in the first place.  The objective of the amendment is to prevent a poacher turned gamekeeper situation.  By the time the term of appointment of someone selected by organisations to represent their interests has expired, the person appointed might no longer represent those interests or might no longer be acceptable to the organisations that nominated him or her. The Minister should not be able to reappoint that person without the approval of the organisations that nominated him or her in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been a misunderstanding here.  I am strongly advised by the parliamentary draftsperson that section 27 (11) is subject to section 27 (8), which requires a person to be renominated by the nominating group.  Of course, the Minister may decide to nominate someone who is not a nominee of an organisation.  I am sure the Deputy does not wish to exclude that possibility.  No one could be reappointed as the representative of an organisation unless reappointed under section 27 (8).</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  The purpose of the provision is to give the Minister the power to prescribe organisations and then, if necessary, to change the body so prescribed.  For example, the body might no longer exist, which is the case in relation to one of the bodies prescribed under the legislation establishing An Bord Pleanála.  I consider that the Minister should, therefore, have the power to change the body so prescribed without the complicated procedure envisaged if Deputy Garland's amendment were accepted.  The section also empowers the Minister to specify the way in which nominations were to be made if there were difficulties.  For example, the organisation or organisations concerned might be required to call a meeting to give a particular notice.  This is a housekeeping provision to deal with matters of that kind and it would be ineffective and impractical if we were to accept Deputy Garland's amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment concerns section 27 (16) (b), which deals with the removal from office of a member of the advisory committee by the Minister.  This provision requires amendment.  After the words &ldquo;The Minister may&rdquo; I want to insert &ldquo;subject to the requirement that he/she give adequate reasons&rdquo;.  Section 27 (16) (b) gives the Minister too much power to remove from office a member <Col N="2454" /> of the advisory committee for unspecified reasons.  The provision could be too easily used to silence a politically embarrassing but otherwise capable member without giving adequate reasons.  The expresion &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; has to be defined.  In exercising the Minister's power to remove from office a member of the advisory committee, he or she should be required to give adequate reasons in the interests of natural justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  It is highly unlikely that anyone would ever be removed as a member of the advisory committee, except in the most extraordinary circumstances.  I do not recall the removal of any individual under provisions of this kind, which are fairly usual in legislation of this type.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had to specify the adequate reasons to which the amendment refers &mdash; and the definition of &ldquo;adequate reasons&rdquo; could be debated forever, because what might be adequate to some might not be adequate to others &mdash; that could prejudice any legal proceedings that might be taken against the individual concerned.  It should be remembered that members of the advisory committee will be serving in a voluntary capacity.  The Minister could become aware of security reasons that necessitated an individual's removal from the committee in the interests of the credibility of the agency.  Would it be desirable for the Minister then to have to state publicly very detailed reasons that could prejudice any legal proceedings that might be taken?  That could run against the course of natural justice and the rights of the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirment in section 27 (16) (b) is precisely the same as that relating to the director general and the directors. The provision gives the Minister power to remove from office a member of the advisory committee if, in the Minister's opinion, that person has become incapable through ill-health of effectively performing his duties or for stated misbehaviour. That provision is considered satisfactory.  As I said, similar provisions <Col N="2455" /> exist in legislation of this kind and I do not recall them ever having to be used.  I do not consider that any Minister would try to remove someone from an advisory committee simply because of a difference in politics.  Very often an individual's politics would not be known or, if they were, they would not necessarily prejudice that person's effectiveness as a member of an advisory committee.  I do not accept that that could be a reason for the dismissal of someone from an advisory committee.  The individual concerned would have recourse to natural justice.  I do not envisage anything of that kind happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the Minister's reply and that there has been no response from other Members on this side of the House.  I consider curt dismissal to be a serious issue.  I am not impressed by the Minister's argument that similar provisions are found in other legislation.  Something that is taken for granted is often the very thing that needs to be examined.  I am also not impressed by the argument that such a provision has never been used before; there is always a first time.  I wonder whether the Minister and I could find middle ground in this regard.  I agree that from time to time people have to be removed from office.</P>
      <P>Would it not be preferable that the advisory committee themselves would recommend to the Minister that a person be removed if there was somebody who was unreasonable, who was not attending meetings or was otherwise undesirable or unsuitable in that the first people on whom this would impinge would be his or her fellow members of the advisory committee?  Perhaps the Minister would re-examine this to ascertain whether an amendment could be tabled on Report Stage to provide that the Minister could remove somebody on a recommendation from the advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the House a commitment to re-examine this.  The amendment the Deputy seeks to insert would weaken the provision of the Bill. <Col N="2456" /> If a Minister, under the provisions of the Bill as drafted, seeks to remove somebody from the advisory committee, it must be for stated misbehaviour whereas under Deputy Garland's proposal a person could be removed simply for &ldquo;adequate reasons&rdquo;.  For example, a Minister of the day could decide it was an &ldquo;adequate reason&rdquo; to remove somebody because he or she did not like something they had said in relation to a particular matter at a meeting which had been brought to the Minister's attention; it could be something as simple as that. &ldquo;Adequate reasons&rdquo; does not say anything; anything could be an &ldquo;adequate reason&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; actually requires a member of the advisory committee to do something wrong.  It is a much more restrictive provision than what Deputy Garland seeks to introduce and prevents anybody from being dismissed willy-nilly from an advisory committee. In fact, what Deputy Garland seeks to introduce would have the opposite effect to what he said or seeks to do.  In theory, under the provisions of Deputy Garland's amendment, somebody could be removed for perhaps being of a different political persuasion than what might be felt to be desirable; that might be considered to be an &ldquo;adequate reason&rdquo;.  I contend the concept is much too wide, loose and liberal and I would prefer the provision of the Bill, as drafted, which are common in legislation of this type.  Those provisions have never been used and I do not envisage their being used except in the most extraordinary circumstance in which somebody may have committed a serious misdemeanour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to persist on this point but clearly the Minister misunderstands my amendment.  If she looks at it again she will see I do not say anything one way or the other about stated misbehaviour.  For example, section 27 (16) (b) says: &ldquo;The Minister may remove from office ...&rdquo;.  I want to insert after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; the words &ldquo;subject to the requirement that he or she give adequate reasons&rdquo;.  That does not in any way <Col N="2457" /> detract from the reasons for removal but rather specifies that the Minister should give the full reasons for his or her decision to seek a removal, which is entirely different from what the Minister was saying.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, these will be people working in a voluntary capacity.  Suppose a member of the advisory committee decides to take a piece of equipment from the agency's headquarters, is involved in a serious act of theft.  Such a person probably will have a family, is serving in a voluntary capacity. Would it be in order that a Minister of the day would have to make a public statement about that matter?  Would it not be proper that the normal law would take its course rather than a Minister having to become involved in making a public statement which could prejudice the outcome of any legal proceedings? Quite honestly, I do not believe the introduction of a provision of that kind is either desirable or necessary.  I think we are wasting time.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  Well, they are people concerned about &ldquo;promotion in relation to the commmunity of social, economic or general interests&rdquo;.  I would envisage representatives of city and county managers, perhaps trade union organisations, representatives of workers.  I am advised it would include representatives of the farming organisations, as people concerned about social, economic or general interests. Perhaps a voluntary body involved in the social area could qualify for the purpose of this provision.  The phrase &ldquo;general interests&rdquo; is a general one to allow us to nominate groups.  As I said earlier, in the process of drafting this legislation, I and my officials had widespread consultations with many organisations who expressed an interest in participating in the advisory committee of the agency.  It is the intention of the Government to appoint as many people as possible, subject to the provision that we do not end up with an advisory committee that is all things to all men, or that we simply appoint people for the sake of so doing.  We want to appoint people with a genuine interest in environmental issues even if they do not work in the environmental area on a day-to-day basis.  For example, it is important, in the context of the environment, that we make environmentalists out of farmers, industrialists, trade union officials and so on.  That is the way to ensure that our environment is protected rather than keeping it strictly within its own area.  Therefore, I was keen to ensure there was a fairly general provision to allow us to nominate bodies with an interest, knowledge and widespread concern, as members of the advisory committee.  I am sure I will be advised later by my officials of further organisations which I will bring to Deputy Howlin's attention.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the substance of his amendment is included in the provisions of the Bill, as drafted.  Obviously, the advisory committee in giving advice either to the agency or the Minister would have to bear in mind the requirements of the agency as a whole.  Under the provisions of section 52 (2) (d) &mdash; which speaks of the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle &mdash; the advisory committee would be required to take that into account in any advice being given the agency or the Minister.  The advisory committee cannot operate outside the law that establishes the agency or outside its functions and the manner in which those functions are assigned to the agency.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the decision to again postpone the commencement of the Tallaght Regional Teaching Hospital; requests that the Kennedy Group complete an Interim Report on Tallaght Hospital at the earliest possible date; and resolves itself to be of the opinion that the necessary capital should be set aside to commence building work in 1992.</P>
      <P>The urgency of this motion arises from the fact that the Minister for Health will shortly finalise plans for the expenditure of over £40 million during 1992 on hospital services, investment in new capital projects for hospitals and health care. It is vital that the Minister includes the £5 million necessary to get Tallaght Hospital under way in this allocation, and I hope the Minister will give an indication of his commitment to do this in the House tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Tallaght are no strangers to official foot dragging.  They have had to wait for third level education facilities <Col N="2462" /> and fight all the way to get them; they have had to wait for shopping facilities and they are still waiting for effective transport services.  It is unacceptable that they should still be waiting, 12 years later, for a basic health service.</P>
    <P>I do not know, a Cheann Comhairle, if you are familiar with the history of this project, which goes back a very long way. The board, who were first appointed in 1980, had a planning brief drawn up which was completed in December 1983 and accepted by the Minister.  They held an architectural competition in March 1984 and the winning design was announced in July 1985.  The Department of Health gave their approval to the commencement of the detailed planning in March 1986 and this was completed in December 1987.  The Department gave their approval to the commencement of the stage 4 planning process, the builders' drawing stage, in June 1988.  In early 1989 the Minister for Health announced that he wanted to see the project accelerated; in an unprecedented move, he wanted to see stage 4 and stage 5 drawn together and completed together.  This was done during the autumn of 1990.  Tenders were then ready to go in November 1990, but sadly, that is where the matter has rested since then.  That state of readiness to go to tender was submitted to the Department of Health in November 1990 but there has been no response to date.</P>
    <P>Tallaght hospital was overlooked in the capital programme for 1991, and there is a very real danger that Tallaght will be overlooked yet again in 1992 and that the £5 million necessary to get the hospital under way will not be made available. This is why Fine Gael believe this motion had to be brought to the floor of the House.  I am very pleased that the Labour Party and the Democratic Left are supporting this motion and I hope that there will be all-party support for it.</P>
    <P>Obviously to the 80,000 people in the Tallaght area this project is crucial.  As we know, this community has suffered unusual economic hardship during the past ten years, having the problems of economic recession piled high on them. The unemployment level in some parts <Col N="2463" /> of the area is extremely high, up to 70 per cent in some cases.  This project is of importance not only to the people of Tallaght but also to a much wider catchment area of some 300,000 people which it will service.</P>
    <P>The project has been referred yet again to the Kennedy group, despite the 12 years of preparation.  The Kennedy group have laid extreme emphasis on the importance of an integrated service which should have at its heart an acute hospital which would provide a comprehensive range of services.  I should like to quote briefly from the earlier work of the Kennedy group which gives a clear illustration of their thinking.  In talking about the problems in our health services, as presently constituted, they say:</P>
    <P>The present structures are notable for the fragmentation of the health service, the confusion as to roles and responsibilities of the various agencies and the lack of an effective overview of the interaction of services at levels of planning or delivery.  The difficulties arise from the scale of the area and population to be served, the operational autonomy of most of the acute general hospitals and many of then non-acute agencies in the city, the fact that the geographical areas which apply in the organisation of community care services do not generally coincide with the configuration of the populations served by acute hospitals, and because of relative isolation of the more than 800 general practitioners in the region from the rest of the health care system, the present structures facilitate a lack of co-ordination and provide no proper basis for resource allocation or for performance review.</P>
    <P>That is a short summary of the deficiencies they identified in our health services.  Nowhere in the city of Dublin are these deficiencies more stark than in the Tallaght region where acute hospital care is entirely divorced from the region. The Meath Hospital, the Adelaide Hospital and the National Children's Hospital and the Naas hospital on the <Col N="2464" /> other side of the region are a long distance from the core populations who have to be served.  We expect some of the most deprived people in Dublin city to attend acute hospital facilities long distances from their homes and to do so without a proper transport service.</P>
    <P>At the core of the Kennedy group's recommendations for restructuring health care in Dublin is the idea that there should be five regions with integrated and comprehensive services which would be capable of being supported by a given population and would be provided locally to that population.  Those are the key elements of the report.  As the Minister knows, they go on to say that one of the key areas was to be the Tallaght region, centred on the Tallaght Hospital.  It was to serve a population of 250,000 people, under the section &ldquo;the south west region&rdquo;.  The Tallaght Hospital and the development of a comprehensive range of services is at the core of the Kennedy group proposals.  It has already been established by that committee what they want to see in the way of development of health services for the population to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Against that background people have been rightly dismayed at the recent suggestion by the Minister for Health that the Adelaide Hospital should be kept open.  That would involve the splitting of specialties and would leave some key specialties not available as part of a comprehensive service to the people of Tallaght and the surrounding region, known as the south west, which takes in part of Wicklow and Kildare as well as the south west regions of Dublin.  It is disturbing to hear the Minister making these announcements.  It is hard to accept he is acting in good faith in commissioning and urging the completion of this report when he makes suggestions like this which are not only ill-thought out but cannot be seen as anything but put together to prejudge a conclusion which is likely to emerge from the Kennedy report based on their existing work, mainly the recommendation, as a matter of urgency, that we go ahead with a comprehensive service in Tallaght, drawing together all the <Col N="2465" /> elements of care now split between the fragmented services of the existing hospitals.</P>
    <P>People in Tallaght and the surrounding regions must rightly feel aggrieved that they are being turned into a political football after the long history, which I described, dating back to 1980 when this project was being brought painstakingly through the different stages of development, that a new committee has been appointed at the last hurdle to investigate afresh the functions, scope and scale of the hospital.</P>
    <P>Despite being concerned as to whether the review is in good faith and not just a stalling tactic, I accept that since 1980 there have been significant changes in the approach to hospital care and in the needs for bed complements relating to different specialities.  I accept &mdash; as do the board of Tallaght Hospital &mdash; that the changes in health care have also changed the balance between in-hospital stay and day care which should be provided for in the Tallaght Hospital project.  However, they have been acutely conscious of that throughout the design stage, they have not been living in an ivory tower divorced from these trends; they have been acutely conscious of those trends and have designed a hospital explicitly to have that flexibility to convert stay care into day care in a way which can respond to the emerging needs and process of effective health care which is developing.</P>
    <P>The continued delay is pushing that future &mdash; where there is flexibility between stay and day care &mdash; further and further from our grasp; that is the reality. The delay means that the old Nightingale wards in the Meath and other hospitals will continue.  It is hard to credit that the Meath Hospital is 270 years old and that the Adelaide Hospital is 150 years old. Conditions in those buildings cannot result in the sort of modern care which I know the Minister wants to see delivered. Tallaght Hospital is there to fill that gap. We all know that it would be a total waste to see money being sunk into an attempt to patch up these hospitals and to keep them going to a date long beyond when they can provide the sort of services that <Col N="2466" /> either the staff working there or the patients have learned to accept.  It is like the old story of the roads network, we have seen to our cost that this patchwork of putting a small amount of money here and there is a total waste of money and leaves a service which is structurally unsound in the long run.  We must arrest that possibility in this instance by not having continued delay in regard to this project.</P>
    <P>People were also dismayed at the Minister's recent suggestion that some sort of municipal loan would be the basis on which this project would stand or fall.  I do not know who the Minister thinks he is fooling by suggesting that a municipal loan is some way of resolving the problem of finance for this project.  We do not have to go to the United States of America to learn how to borrow money, this country is better than any at borrowing money.  We are borrowing money this year to give the Minister £42 million to provide capital for his hospital programmes and his health investment.  To talk of some mysterious US loan as being the answer is just pie in the sky and the Minister must know that.  It cannot deliver an effective solution to this problem because the Minister for Finance, who sits beside the Minister for Health at the Cabinet table day after day, has made it crystal clear that he will not sanction more borrowing for health purposes; he will not go beyond the £42 million which he has made available.  The net issue here is not a new loan to divert attention to a different area of work, the issue is whether the Minister and his colleague will make available from the £42 million the sum of £5 million to build the Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response because people want him to prove he is not engaged in a stalling tactic in the various suggestions he has made and that he is committed to starting work on the project which emerges from the review by the Kennedy group.  As I understand it, the Kennedy group will, very shortly, be in a position to give an answer in regard to the sort of service they envisage as suitable for serving the <Col N="2467" /> people of the south west of Dublin.  The manoeuvring and political brinkmanship in regard to the Tallaght Hospital must come to an end.  It is not as if the money is not there, that is manifestly untrue; not only is there £42 million available this year to be spent, since the sod was first turned on the Tallaght site in 1986, the Government have spent a colossal £350 million on hospitals and yet Tallaght Hospital did not get the go-ahead.  That sum would have built Tallaght Hospital three times over and more no matter what estimates are given of the cost of the project.  If the Government had the will, that project would now be underway. However, it seems that the Government do not have the will.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the issue of costs.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State, time and again repeat the estimate of £118 million as if that was the proposed scale of expenditure planned by the hospital board at present.  That is not the case, the sum of £118 million was based on a 600 bed hospital which the Tallaght board are not pressing at this stage.  That sum involved three phases of their plan and, at the request of the Department of Health, they abandoned those three phases to provide this extra scaled-down service. The real project does not run to £118 million but could be financed for under £100 million.  It is significant that the Government seem to be putting up the figure to make it seem more difficult to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>We would have to draw attention to the fact that a Minister in the present Government voted against his own party in order to secure the survival of Limerick's third hospital, a city with a much smaller population than Tallaght.  The Tallaght-Clondalkin area which as the Kennedy report stated is the second largest region and has two Ministers representing it in the House tonight, is still denied a hospital.</P>
    <P>In this area incomes are low and people do not have the option of paying for care elsewhere.  I am convinced that these people are going without health care and <Col N="2468" /> the disadvantage of low income and unemployment they already suffer is compounded.  I have spoken to many people directly concerned, our party councillor, Councillor Michael Keating and Senator McMahon, and they have testified to the enormous problems these people face.  Picture if you can, a single parent with three or four children trying to cope with the children as well as having to attend an accident and emergency unit, who has to flag down a bus, perhaps in the rain, to make her way into the inner city for hospital care.  It is unthinkable that that is the level of service we are providing in such a large area, and it compounds our scandalous neglect of the area.  It is a shame that we should continue to neglect health care in this area.</P>
    <P>If the Minister goes ahead with his proposal to split the project the Tallaght Hospital project will be seriously damaged. There is not only a clear desire to see the Adelaide approach to care in the Tallaght Hospital and providing the Adelaide with a modern setting, but it is vital that the many excellent consultants in the Adelaide should not be relegated to the second division serving an area which is already adequately served by the existing major hospitals.  It would be sad to see the Adelaide Hospital relegated in that way &mdash; as the Minister suggests &mdash; which is against the tone and approach of the Kennedy report.</P>
    <P>There were other suggestions that gave rise to concern.  When the Minister talks about looking to other sources of funding for this hospital, I fear that this is some sort of code for private funding.  We all know from our experience of privately funded hospitals elsewhere that they are hungry for private patients and their main driving force is to maximise the level of private business in order to generate revenue.  It would be very serious if there was any suggestion that the proposed Tallaght Hospital would not be a public hospital committed to the care of public patients as their primary function who, according to the Minister's statement, make up 85 per cent of the patient throughput.  It must be clear that the Minister is committed to public care from <Col N="2469" /> the outset and any suggestion that we would row back from that commitment and opt for a privately funded hospital that would have different priorities would be damaging.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the types of services to be provided in the proposed Tallaght Hospital.  It is important that the Minister's suggestion of splitting the project and leaving certain elements, such as the Adelaide Hospital and some of the children's hospital, out of the Tallaght project must be addressed in this debate.  I hope the Minister recognises the wisdom of the Kennedy approach where it is clearly proposed that the paediatric speciality would be a core part of the service.  What is really needed in an area where there are a great many children is a strong acute hospital with paediatric services and I hope the Minister will confirm that there will be no attempt on his part to row back from the concept of a comprehensive health service in Tallaght. By splitting the project and taking some of the specialities away from the proposed hospital, the Minister would be undermining the concept at the heart of the proposal to develop an effective care service for the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Tallaght lies within the greater Dublin area and has a population of 250,000 plus. The Kennedy report recommended that an acute hospital be situated in the centre of the area which would build up relationships with the general practitioners and the community care services in the area. That is at the heart of what we want to see developed in the Tallaght area and I hope the Minister will not row back from this.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle I wish to draw my comments to a close so that I can share my time with Deputy Fennell.</P>

      <P>For obvious reasons, it would have been more appropriate if that request had been made at the commencement of the Deputy's speech.  However I am sure this House will agree to the Deputy's request.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious issue.  As I am sure the Minister knows, there are very active committees which are committed to ensuring that this project starts, and they rightly recognise that Tallaght has a history of neglect, but this must not be allowed continue.  Even if the Minister agreed today to start this project, it would be five and a half years before the first patient would be admitted. Therefore, I urge the Minister to support our motion which seeks a commitment to start work this year and I look forward to hearing his response.</P>
      <P>May I commend the Minister on his suggestion to site an outpatient facility in the area as a matter of urgency?  While we would like to see that, we do not want it used as an excuse to put off the commencement of this project which is long overdue.  We hope this is not the thin edge of the wedge to set up a hospital that would be less than the comprehensive service envisaged in the Kennedy report which sould be at the core of an effective treatment centre for the population of 250,000 in Dublin south-west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sense of <i>déja vu</i> about this debate.  It is similar to the Shannon controversy which keeps cropping up; it appears to be solved but nothing happens.</P>
      <P>The proposed Tallaght Hospital was raised in numerous questions, during grievance time and on the Adjournment. This area is close to my own constituency and I am very familiar with it.  Indeed, the proposed hospital would serve part of my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From reading the Official Report of the debates, one would feel sorry for Deputy Flood, who represents this constituency and is Minister of State at the Department of Health.  As a local Deputy, he had to bat for the Minister and repeatedly he has had to read scripts and amended scripts which say the same thing but with the words juggled a little, to soothe the frustrations of Opposition Deputies who run out of patience on this long drawn-out and cynically manipulated measure.  I would feel very sorry for <Col N="2471" /> the Minister were it not for the fact that on this matter my sympathy goes to the people of the area &mdash; the 200,000 citizens who are being left without this very urgent service.  Considering the political representation in the area, there are two Ministers of State serving that area, one is surprised that nothing has happened and that there is such a stalemate.  One is led to believe that hospitals, highway buildings and road building tend to be decided on geographical representation of Ministers.  I am sure the people of Tallaght feel very frustrated in view of the fact that they have such good, strong representation and yet nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a vast area &mdash; Clondalkin, Rathcoole, Firhouse, Brittas to Ballyboden, west Wicklow and south Kildare.  The people out there are being let down and they are the people for whom this motion speaks.  When this hospital was first proposed in 1968 it was for a moderately developed suburb of Dublin which still had features of its rural past.  Maybe there was not the same urgency for a hospital when it was first suggested and certainly not for a hospital of the scale that has laterally been decided upon.</P>
    <P>The need now, as for many years past, is chronic.  No other region in the whole country can be more deserving or more desperate for a hospital complex for the following reasons, there is a grave need for medical care in the central Tallaght area for surgery, treatment, preventive medicine, out-patients.  This is an area which is as large as many of our cities in population.  Second, it would be a source of employment and, therefore, the development of the community.  No area can have a greater need for development. This community has been starved of resources.  Effectively, people were dumped out of the town, put in small boxes away from the city with little or no development.  How can people, who are already disadvantaged both socially and educationally, survive when deprived of basic needs and facilities such as schools, shops, transport and medical facilities?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2472" /> Was it any wonder that over the years we saw such bad newspaper headlines about Tallaght given their geographical isolation, their 50 per cent unemployment rate and the lack of community amenities?  Of course, one cannot expect community development and proper community growth when you feed people on promises with no follow up action. That leads to disillusionment and to disdain for us politicians in Leinster House. We promise to build roads, schools, hospitals and to drain rivers, yet those who make those promises know there is very little hope of fulfilling them.  We saw that kind of cynicism from Fianna Fáil in 1989.  There was a promise in 1989 that the hospital building would be brought forward to 1990.  I quote from an advertisment by Fianna Fáil which was put in the media in 1989:</P>
    <P>Building of the massive new Tallaght Hospital in Dublin which was to have started in 1991 has been brought forward to next year.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Tallaght Hospital Board, Professor R.T.W.L. Conroy said that Health Minister, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon has agreed to accelerate the development programme.  It is now hoped that work would be underway in about 15 months time.</P>
    <P>The advertisement continued as follows:</P>
    <P>By voting Fianna Fáil on 15 June you will ensure that the improvements which are taking place will continue.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of cynicism that makes people lack belief in politicians.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, is trying to grasp all the very difficult problems &mdash; nobody underestimates the job he has to do &mdash; and given his style, energy and approach to the job he will want to leave his mark in all these areas.  I hope he will be honest and set down his aims and objectives for the Tallaght hospital and stick with them. I would ask him not to say something that cannot be delivered on: it would be wrong that that should happen in an area like Tallaght.  The project has been deferred, postponed, and the people <Col N="2473" /> strung along relentlessly.  We have been told there is to be another report and more proposals; I feel these are unnecessary but perhaps they are necessary for administration purposes or for the Department's procedures.  When one goes out and sees the glorious turned sod or monument, one has to feel very sad for the people of Tallaght that they do not have an amenity, which is so necessary for growing families, close to their community.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that a children's hospital should be part of the new hospital.  We have to think of the needs of the children in that huge built-up area where there must be more children per street than in any other area.  Parents have to struggle with a very bad transport system, take their children into the city centre to hospital and depend on an unreliable bus service to visit them.  It is particularly regrettable for parents, who value their children, just as the rest of us do and want to have the best for them, but it is made very difficult for them because of the difficulties of getting into town. Everybody in hospital deserves the best and most up-to-date treatment they can get and they should have it closer to them than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>What can these people do?  They have made their protest, they have made their submissions, they have been polite and have complied with all the necessary requests.  They deserve realistic answers and to have their expectations met. People in this House who do not live near Tallaght and who, perhaps, were never in Tallaght, would sympathise very strongly with this case and would want to urge the Minister to take action and to do something.  I support the proposer of this motion and ask for support from all sides of the House.  I would ask the three Ministers present, but particularly, the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Connell, to give considered commitment to this project and to give a clear message to the people of Tallaght and to stick to it because the people living in Tallaght deserve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  In the meantime I wish to confirm that we have had many meetings and discussions with local community groups, professional groups and interested individuals with a view to progressing matters.  Before I proceed further I wish to respond to a number of specific points raised by Deputy Bruton. I think it is important to briefly outline the major developments that have taken place in the acute hospital scene in recent years.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, we have been engaged in this country over the past 15 years on a major and expensive development programme in our general hospital system.  This has resulted in the upgrading of many hospitals and the development of a number of major new hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back to 1968, the Fitzgerald <Col N="2475" /> report set out how acute hospital services should develop in Dublin.  In designing the future plan for hospital services in Dublin, particular attention was paid to the movement of the population in the urban and suburban areas.  As Deputies will be aware, this has shown a shift towards the suburbs and a marked decline in the inner city areas.  The hospital needs of the new expanding suburbs were the critical consideration in shaping the plan that ultimately emerged.</P>
    <P>That plan provided for six major hospitals for the greater Dublin area &mdash; three on the north side, Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital and Blanchardstown Hospital and three on the south side, St. James's Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and a new hospital at Tallaght.  The plan also provided for the relocation of services of a number of older hospitals to enable the new developments to come on stream.</P>
    <P>We made great progress on the rationalisation of hospital services throughout the eighties.  It was imperative that such progress was made, not only in the interests of eliminating avoidable management and maintenance overheads but also in the interests of improving the quality of patient care.</P>
    <P>In 1984, Mercer's Hospital was the first of the city hospitals to transfer its service to St. James's.  In 1986, Sir Patrick Dun's also transferred to St. James's.  In 1987, the Richmond and St. Laurence's transferred to the new hospital at Beaumont. Also in 1987, the services of Dr. Steeven's Hospital and the acute services of Baggot Street Hospital were relocated in the Meath, the Adelaide and St. James's.</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree, therefore, that we have made progress, very significant progress, in the implementation of the original plan for acute services in Dublin. Indeed, with the recent commissioning of the new block at St. James's, the jigsaw is almost complete.  The only major developments still to be put in place is the Tallaght Hospital which will serve Dublin South-West, south Kildare and west Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght Hospital project, costing <Col N="2476" /> an estimated £118 million, is the largest health capital project ever proposed in this country.  The constuction period involved is about four years, following which a further period of about 18 months would be required for commissioning.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospitals will move from their existing sites in the city centre to Tallaght where they will operate as a single entity under one management.  Already through their coming together in the MANCH hospital group, the unity and cohesion of their services is being forged and this augurs well for the future.  For example, all the consultants' contracts in the three hospitals are held by a single authority &mdash; the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals.  This was done in anticipation of the move to Tallaght so as to ensure that when the hospital was built there would be no delay in having it fully operational.</P>
    <P>The Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals, through their representatives on the Tallaght Hospital board and on its various projects groups, have been fully involved in the planning of the Tallaght Hospital.  At this stage I would like to publicly thank the members of the Tallaght Hospital board for their dedication and commitment over the years and to congratulate them on bringing the project to tender stage without any undue delays.</P>
    <P>In planning and architectural terms, the modular design of the new hospital will, I understand, ensure an efficient working unit, built to high technical standards. Visually, the design and lay-out of the proposed hospital will greatly enhance the Tallaght area.  Most important, however, and foremost in the board's thoughts at all times were the needs of patients and staff, the people who will be actually using the facility. Again, I compliment the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospitals for their contribution to the development to date.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I have been pursuing this matter vigorously since I <Col N="2477" /> became Minister of State.  It is clear to me that in organising the future development of hospital services in the Dublin area particular importance has to be given to the needs of Tallaght which has a core population of about 70,000 people and a wider catchment population of about 260,000 people.</P>
    <P>In comparison with other Irish towns, Tallaght is a very significant urban community and its lack of a vital amenity such as a modern hospital obviously has to be remedied.  I have spoken publicly on the issue many times.  Indeed, both the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, and I have been criticised by some Opposition Deputies for seeking innovative solutions to the problem.  For instance, in relation to the size of the hospital, we have questioned the need for the bed provision originally proposed.  That question has been conveniently misinterpreted and misrepresented as a scaling down of the hospital project.  That is clearly not the case and let me explain why.</P>
    <P>Bed norms for planning purposes were originally produced by the Department in the seventies and there was a revision of the norms in 1981.  These norms were essentially derived from norms in use at that time in other countries, particularly the United Kingdom.  Since then, there has been a considerable international trend towards day surgery and day activity of all types as a substitute for traditional in-patient care.  For example, medical literature now indicates that up to 50 per cent of all surgery can be undertaken on a day basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton made the point that practice has changed and that the original number of beds proposed need not necessarily stand fast and can be re-examined. I welcome that statement by Deputy Bruton tonight.  I should add that others have made similar statements. For example, the general practitioners in Tallaght have said at one public meeting that I have attended in Rathcoole that the number of beds proposed need not stand fast at 600 or 700, that we could start out with 400 to 450, which would be quite acceptable to them. That is the type of contribution that was <Col N="2478" /> made at a public meeting in Rathcoole recently in this matter.</P>
    <P>In addition, the duration of stay in hospital has fallen significantly and may fall still further as a consequence of more intensive utilisation of beds, five-day wards, programmed investigation units, new technology and new drug therapies. All these major changes have taken place since planning for the Tallaght Hospital first commenced and clearly they point towards a reduced need for acute hospital beds in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I have had recent meetings with the Tallaght Hospital Board, the Tallaght Community Council and the Tallaght Regional Hospital Action Group and we have explained the position in some detail.  I think it would be fair to say that there is an acceptance all round that in the light of rapidly changing medical practice it would be possible to provide adequately for the hospital needs of the people in the catchment area with fewer beds than originally envisaged, but precisely how many beds should be provided has yet to be determined.</P>
    <P>I look to the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group for guidance on this point.  The advisory group, as Deputies are aware, was reconvened in December last and was asked by the previous Minister for Health to examine and report on the proposed new hospital at Tallaght in the context of the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>(i)  To review and make recommendations on the functions, scope and scale of the proposed Tallaght Hospital, having regard to the previous reports issued by the group on the organisation and delivery of hospital care, so that the hospital needs of the catchment population can be met in the most appropriate manner;</P>
    <P>(ii)  In the light of (i) to consider and make recommendations on possible methods of funding for the building of the new Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>The group was asked to report before the end of June.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2479" /> The group, which is under the chairmanship of Mr. David Kennedy, is comprised of senior health services medical, nursing and administrative personnel who are experts in their particular fields. The group have proceeded to meet with a broad range of community groups and interests as well as the hospitals mainly concerned.  This consultation process is almost complete.  The group are also currently actively exploring funding options.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, made the point to Professor Kennedy's group, that those in the Tallaght area who wished to put forward their views on the project should be accommodated as early as possible.  As far as I am aware the Kennedy group have met with most of the organisations in Tallght and have heard detailed submissions from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What does &ldquo;funding options&rdquo; mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>That will emerge in time.  I do not wish to pre-empt the work of the Kennedy group at this stage.  I am prepared to wait for a few more weeks to see what the Kennedy group have to say, taking into account the brief given to them and the submissions from the groups I mentioned.</P>
      <P>Indeed when the Minister met the group on 27 February last, he asked that they report back quickly and in advance of the June deadline, if at all possible.  I know that the group have been extremely active in the meantime and I understand they hope to be in a position to submit their report in about six weeks time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On receipt of the group's report, the Minister and I will have the recommendations considered as a matter of urgency in the Department with a view to bringing it before Government at the earliest possible date.  We have already indicated to a number of groups in the Tallaght area that once we receive the report and consider it we will submit it to the Government without delay.  I am talking in terms of days, not weeks or months.  That will be welcomed by those <Col N="2480" /> in this House who have an interest in the Tallaght Hospital project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised that point in the course of his contribution and made a suggestion regarding this year's allocation.  I will return to that later.</P>
      <P>I would now like to refer to the role to be played by the Adelaide in the Tallaght project.  I welcome the firm assurances given by successive Ministers in regard to the preservation and continuation of the Adelaide's distinctive traditions and ethos in the new hospital at Tallaght.  It is right and proper that we should use opportunities such as we have this evening to specifically reaffirm those assurances.  The Adelaide is a hospital with a splendid history and has been responsible for many significant developments in medicine in Ireland.  More than 130 years ago, it introduced the first dermatology clinic.  It was the first to introduce gynaecological clinics, psychiatry clinics and organised social services.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has had an association with the hospital, can testify to its exceptional record in the area of patient care. This is in no small part due to the quality of its nurse training.  In this regard, I am particularly pleased to repeat the categorical assurances given by previous Ministers that this tradition will be maintained in the new hospital at Tallaght and that 40 places in the new nursing school would be reserved for nurses from the &ldquo;Adelaide&rdquo; tradition.  The Government respect and value the tradition of the Adelaide and are committed to ensuring its continuance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health made it clear, in answer to questions in this House last Thursday, that he was not pre-empting the outcome of the Kennedy group report so far as the Adelaide is concerned.  The Minister merely suggested that if the Adelaide wish to stay where they are he will ensure the protection of their interests and ethos.  The Minister made <Col N="2481" /> it abundantly clear also, that should the Adelaide wish to move to Tallaght he would ensure that they would be fully facilitated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The two other hospitals involved in the move to Tallaght &mdash; the Meath and the National Children's &mdash; have also contributed in a significant way to the development of Irish medicine.</P>
      <P>The Meath, which dates back to 1753, is recognised internationally for its contribution through physicians such as Graves and Stokes to the development of medical education.  Whatever else we do, we must ensure that the excellent record of the Meath in relation to education and training, patient services and first class medical and nursing care is continued in the new Tallaght Hospital.</P>
      <P>In a similar manner, the National Children's Hospital, now at Harcourt Street, has an unbroken tradition of providing care for children since 1821.  It is the longest established children's teaching hospital in these islands.  It has, while being small in size, played an important role over the years in a paediatric medical and nursing education and training. Moving to an area with a large child population will provide a new challenge and, as in the past, I am sure this will be met and dealt with in the same caring and professional manner.</P>
      <P>As I said on many occasions, the challenge which faces us in relation to the arrangements for the management of the new Tallaght Hospital is to ensure that all that is valuable in the traditions of the three hospitals is successfully transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy O'Hanlon was Minister for Health he was concerned that arrangements for the management of the new hospital would be agreed in advance of the development of the hospital.  He was anxious to ensure that all possible obstacles to the speedy transfer of staff to the new hospital would be removed. He did not want to see a completed hospital lying idle while management were sorting out staffing arrangements. To this end, with the agreement of the <Col N="2484" /> Meath Hospital, Adelaide Hospital and National Children's Hospital, he established an <i>ad hoc</i> working party under the chairmanship of Mr. T.D. Kingston to consider a management structure which would respect the traditions of the three hospitals.</P>
    <P>The working group were asked to consider possible future management arrangements for the new public voluntary teaching hospital, with nursing school, at Tallaght.  Specifically, they were asked to consider the following management options: a management board established under the Health Corporate Bodies Act, 1961; a management board established under primary legislation providing for the establishment of a new public voluntary hospital; a management board operating under an adapted Adelaide Charter or a management board established under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>The group were asked to base their proposals on the premise that the traditions and emphases of the three hospitals are valuable and must be given expression in the management arrangements for Tallaght as must the existing links with Trinity College and other teaching institutions.  In particular, the position of the Adelaide as a focus for Protestant participation in the health services and its particular denominational ethos was to be provided for in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The report of the working group was submitted to my predecessor.  While it was never the intention to publish the report, I can say that there was a broad measure of agreement on many of the management issues.  There were, however, some matters on which it was not possible for the working group to adopt an agreed position.  We will be asking the parties concerned to address these outstanding issues in the context of the Government's decision on Tallaght subsequent to the submission of the report of the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that the £40 million available to the Department of Health in 1992 for capital works should <Col N="2485" /> be used in part to fund the Tallaght project. He should know that the funds have already been committed to projects which are at various stages of construction. A large proportion, for example, has been spent on the new Ardkeen Regional Hospital in Waterford which will be completed in the next two years.  We do not have the option to cancel any contracts.</P>

I recognise that political points will be made in the heat of debate, but I am satisfied that all of us are very keen to make whatever contribution we can to bring forward the provision of the hospital.  We know the area and its needs, which have been there for a very long time.  The needs are greater than ever because of the growing population.  Our commitment is to try to provide the mechanism whereby funding will be available, not only to start the project but to develop it into a hospital capable of providing all the services required in Tallaght and beyond.  The Kennedy group are possibly the best option because they are looking at the scale of the hospital and the groups are saying quite clearly in various contributions that it is not necessary to have a 750-bed hospital with an impersonal operation.  It is not necessary to start with a 600-bed hospital.  The first phase, which we talked about originally, of 450 or 460 beds is the type of development with which we should commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is seen in the years ahead that a larger hospital is required, the question can be addressed then by those with responsibility.  The people of Tallaght want to see a major hospital of 450 or 460 beds in operation as quickly as possible. The Minister and I are committed to finding a way to ensure that the project can start quickly.  It is complex and costly in these difficult financial times.  We are not saying that the money has to come from the taxpayer or, indeed, come from any particular source.  What we are saying is that it would be a public hospital providing for the needs of Tallaght.  In the <Col N="2489" /> meantime we are saying, as an indication of our goodwill, that we want to provide as soon as possible basic services in the Tallaght area, perhaps even on the site if that is possible.  These services have been called for at public meetings which, as public representatives, we have attended in the past number of months.</P>
    <P>The community is united behind this project.  We are simply saying that the last issue to be resolved, which is perhaps always the most difficult, is the financial one.  I would like to hear from anybody in this House who says that the issue can be easily solved.  We have to be realistic because once the project starts we must be capable of seeing it through for three or four years construction and one to one and a half years commissioning and of providing whatever amount of money is required.  Different figures have been mentioned but at the end of the day the project will require about £100 million or £120 million.  That is the crucial question and that is the question that is being addressed by the Kennedy group.  As the Minister for Health has said, he will have the report in six weeks time and, having considered it, there will be no delay in putting it on the Cabinet table.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party's amendment to the Fine Gael Private Members' motion proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; on the second line and to insert the following: &ldquo;and demands that the necessary capital be made available to allow work on the hospital to commence in 1992&rdquo;.  I am disappointed, as are the people of Tallaght, that the Minister's contribution has brought nothing new to this debate.  I had hoped some specific positive announcement would be forthcoming this evening from the Minister, which would have shown a clear intention to get this project moving at some stage this year, but that was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech is an indictment of the Government's response to the people of Tallaght and Dublin south west.  At the beginning of his speech the Minister talked about the wonderful improvements that have been made in <Col N="2490" /> hospital services in every part of Dublin, in Beaumont Hospital, Blanchardstown Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. James' Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and also in Ardkeen Hospital and others.  The Minister said the jigsaw is almost complete. The piece that is missing is Tallaght Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the piece of the jigsaw that is the concern and the need of the 260,000 people in Dublin south west to whom the Minister referred.  It is no consolation to the people of Tallaght, Clondalkin and the surrounding areas to hear about the wonderful provisions that have been made on the north side of Dublin, in Ardkeen, in Waterford and everywhere else.  It shows the scant regard the Minister and the Government are paying to the people of Tallaght and Clondalkin.</P>

      <P>The people in these areas had hoped that as there are two Ministers in the area, a hospital would be provided. In gamesmanship terms the result could be described thus: Ministers, two; hospitals, nil.  A much better result for the people of Tallaght and Clondalkin would have been: hospitals, one; Ministers, nil.  That would have much better met the needs of the people.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister quoted a statement of Deputy O'Hanlon when he was Minister for Health in which he said he did not want to see a completed hospital lying idle while management were sorting out staffing arrangements.  I wish we had a completed hospital, even lying idle, with only staffing arrangements to be sorted out.  However, we are a very long way down the road from that position.</P>

      <P>It would take at least five and a half years.  I had hoped the Minister would tell the House tonight that this <Col N="2491" /> project would be started considering, as he has said, that £42 million has been already committed to it.  Supplementary budgets are introduced in this House when the occasion demands it.  Would it be the end of the world if a supplementary budget of £5 million was introduced to get this project started? The Minister said that before the project starts one has to be committed to it.  In statements and replies to questions over the past number of years &mdash; and it is years since this Government and their predecessors came to office &mdash; we have been consistently told that the Government are committed to the project.  If they are so committed, why is there a problem in providing the initial start-up sum of £5 million?  That provision would at least give some hope to the people of the area who are so frustrated.  They would see that the commitment meant something and that it was not just talk. However, nothing is being done.  All we are witnessing is shilly-shallying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in the name of the Labour Party is based on the conviction that the last thing Tallaght needs is another report and that the time for action on this project is overdue.  In my view and in the view of many people, the Kennedy report is just an excuse to postpone this project.  There is no reality in it whatsoever. The Minister shifted from one side to another in the course of his speech from the Kennedy report to the number of beds and the financial provision for the project.  If the Minister was honest he would say there will be no financial provision for the Tallaght Hospital now or in the foreseeable future, that it is not the policy of this Government to go ahead at this stage, or ever, with the Tallaght Hospital project and for that reason the matter is at a standstill.  However, the Minister tried to sidetrack that fact.  He referred to it briefly on the one hand while on the other hand he talked about revisions, the needs of the hospital and the number of beds it should have.  I do not accept the point about fewer beds being required as a result of some miraculous, sudden change in technique and <Col N="2492" /> that this whole issue is relatively new on the scene, just as is the red herring of the Adelaide Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght Hospital board were made up of top experts, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, professionals of every description who have been meeting on a regular basis since 1981.  I was a member of that board for some years and I know the number of hours that went into the drawing up and planning of this project.  Every facet of it, every need of the area and of the hospital was discussed at length.  That board considered the number of beds required for geriatrics, surgery, ophthalmology, gynaecology and so on, and they knew what was needed.  To hear the Minister say that the number of beds can be reduced one would imagine that the hospital needs of the greater Dublin area are up to date, that hospitals are waiting to carry out operations in the orthopaedic and other areas and that all of a sudden there is a surplus of beds.</P>
    <P>However, the reality is that the hospital waiting lists for all departments are as long as one's arm and are getting longer, even though the Minister may be revising the lists for his own purposes and might achieve some reductions in that regard.  Every bed provided in accordance with the plan for the Tallaght Hospital would be fully used.  Perhaps some of them could be used to reduce some of those very long waiting lists that are such a penance, which for many people are a question of life and limb, people who have been waiting a very long time, many of them in pain, for very necessary operations.  For those people the suggestion that the hospital would have a surplus of beds will sound very hollow; in fact, they will be very distressed and extremely annoyed.</P>
    <P>The issue of funding has been mentioned. One of the briefs given to the new committee &mdash; yet another committee &mdash; is to advise on the funding for the hospital.  I must confess that, in that regard, I am puzzled in the extreme.  Why is the Minister for Health asking an outside committee, the Kennedy committee, to advise on the way this public general hospital, designed to serve an area bigger <Col N="2493" /> than Limerick, should be funded?  The way to fund a public general hospital is through Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>The Blackrock Clinic and other private clinics may have certain arrangements for funding, different schemes, bonds and so forth &mdash; I do not know what they do &mdash; but a public general hospital is funded from the Exchequer.  This idea is just another ruse, another red herring, another sidetrack.</P>
    <P>For all of the ten years in which the hospital board existed, working hard and with dedication &mdash; including representation from all hospitals, including the Adelaide Hospital &mdash; there was never a suggestion that the Adelaide Hospital would drop out, would not participate or was not willing to be actively involved in the Tallaght Hospital project.  The position of the Adelaide Hospital was the reverse.  The Adelaide Hospital was keen, anxious and eager to be involved. The suggestion that the Adelaide Hospital should drop out and be retained as a smaller hospital was thrown in as a red herring.  None of this has any meaning.</P>
    <P>The planning for the hospital project was done at great length.  I have seen the book of quantities, it is a three inch thick publication and the effort that went into it was enormous.  The book details the smallest of items.  In 1989 or 1990 when the work was done, a competition was held to provide for the hospital.  We saw the magnificent drawings that came in and were developed.  Everything was ready and we were prepared to invite tenders.  To date, £8.7 million has been invested in that work.  The Government then decided to put the project on the backburner, using such provisions for the Tallaght Hospital in the Department of Health budget for other projects.</P>
    <P>It is not that there is not the money to build the Tallaght Hospital; there are substantial funds available to the Department of Health and if the Department, the Minister and the Government &mdash; and it is a Government matter &mdash; are minded to provide the £5 million necessary for start up in 1992, then there is no problem. I am giving a commitment on behalf of <Col N="2494" /> the Labour Party that if a Supplementary estimate for the £5 million were introduced, we would have the greatest pleasure supporting it.  I am sure that Fine Gael and the Democratic Left also would have no problem with that.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of priorities; it is a question of whether the Government regard the building and construction of the Tallaght Hospital as a priority.  If the Government gave the project top priority, then they could and would construct it and at this late stage they would not again be shifting the matter off to the Kennedy committee or any other committee. After all of the work that has been done and all the planning that has been provided, the Government do not need to look for any other studies or reports &mdash; they are unnecessary.  The work has been done, and with tremendous effort.  Many specialists, GPs and hospital and nursing representatives assembled at meetings, month in and month out, and a great deal of material went into providing a very fine hospital plan, which is a very costly thing to produce.  The work has already been done.  It is ready on the table for the Minister if he wants to use it and start construction, which is what I hoped he would do.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Health chose to involve himself in a controversy with his rather simplistic and dangerous approach to the issue of heart by-pass surgery.  That approach is all too familiar to the people of Tallaght who have been by passed for the past decade.  This time no pill, even if it is sugar coated, will address the very considerable and entirely legitimate sense of grievance these people feel.</P>
    <P>Every Minister for Health has accepted the unanswerable case put forward by the people of Tallaght for a major regional hospital.  Only last December the former Minister for Health, Deputy O`Rourke, recognised Tallaght as the biggest hospital priority in her area of responsibility. Despite her recognition of that fact, she decided not to spend one penny extra.  Instead, she offered to undertake two more studies.  The people of Tallaght do not want any more reports or studies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2495" /> Already there are copious reports instigated by various Ministers for Health. The people of Tallaght recognise those reports for what they are &mdash; delaying tactics by a Government that, I am sorry to say, appear to have no intention of building the Tallaght Hospital in the foreseeable future.  That is the nub of the issue.  The Government attempt to pay little more than lip service to the people of Tallaght, on the one hand by acknowledging that there is no area in the country with a greater priority and, on the other, refusing to respond to its legitimate demands.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago there was a proposal to establish an outpatients clinic in Tallaght. That proposal was agreed by the Department of Health in 1982.  The Minister will find all the information in the files if he cares to look.  The hospital was to have been managed jointly by the Meath Hospital, the Adelaide Hospital and the National Children's Hospital and was to have been funded by the Department. Now ten years later, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is still talking about outpatients' departments and service.</P>
    <P>It seems almost as if time has stood still in the Department of Health but time has not stood still in Tallaght.  The population of the area has grown and disadvantage has become a feature of daily life.  This disadvantage has been compounded and exacerbated by the complete absence of Tallaght from the Government's list of priorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about money and providing funds, but in the 1992 budget this Government showed where their true commitment lay.  In that budget the Government saw fit to reduce the top rate of income tax by 4p in the pound. That will cost the Exchequer £60 million in a full year and every year from 1993 on.</P>
    <P>Had the Government decided to make health a priority in their 1992 budget they could have used the £60 million towards developing a full hospital service for the people of Tallaght.  The Tallaght site development was initiated in the early eighties to provide essential hospital services for the 150,000 citizens of Tallaght and surrounding areas.  As we know in <Col N="2496" /> the 1992 Health Capital Programme, there was no provision for the Tallaght Hospital.  However, since 1982 when the project was originally approved, £8.7 million has been spent on the development of Tallaght Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise this matter this evening and the Minister of State for his presence.</P>
      <P>This two-acre site has been vacant for almost 25 years and, because of bureaucratic neglect on the part of the local authority, a Jurys Hotel is being built there without the site having being properly surveyed for its archaeological content. Certainly Dublin Corporation are guilty in that they did not underline the importance of this Viking medieval site. The Office of Public Works who, in the first instance indicated that a maximum archaeological survey would take place there, backed-off and have now intimated that a minimum survey would be sufficient.  As a matter of extreme urgency the Government should take the initiative of introducing legislation to prevent bureaucratic vandalism of this kind being perpetrated in our capital city. The National Monuments Advisory Council should be re-established to act as watchdog against this type of vandalism recurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nothing short of a national disgrace that one of our most important archaeological treasures, on a par with Wood Quay, is about to be built on.  What will future generations think of the scant regard given to preserving our heritage? It must be pointed out that £2.2 million was the price paid for the central core area of this city, an area rich in treasure, in the artefacts under the ground there but also in that it would provide the key to the ethnic origin of Dublin.  It is a disgrace this is being allowed to happen and I call on the Minister to intervene and give the House a guarantee that no <Col N="2497" /> development will take place until this site has been satisfactorily surveyed.</P>
    <P>Only about one-quarter of the site has been surveyed to date.  The present system of piling, of driving stakes into the ground, demonstrates that the site is more important than was first thought.  It is quite ironic that large amounts of EC grants are being provided for questionable interpretative centres in the Burren and Luggala while no money is being provided for archaeological investigation of this kind.</P>
    <P>The city has a city archaeologist, Mr. Andrew Halpin, who should be to the forefront of this sequel; yet we hear nothing from him.  It is a shame on our capital city that the history of this Wood Quay saga that has remained with us over so many years should be repeated. Perhaps there is a misguided belief that people are jaded protesting against this type of unwarranted vandalism; I describe it in the strongest possible terms. I contend it is an uncivilised attitude to take.  Legislation should be enacted to prevent development of this kind.</P>
    <P>It would not be reasonable or satisfactory of the Minister to reply to the effect that the developers are complying with planning regulations when we know all too well that in this case the planning regulations were altered, with the threat of the relevant hotel group withdrawing from the site, exerting pressure of that kind.  I appeal to the Minister to give the House that badly needed guarantee. Indeed his colleague, the Minister himself, is a Dublin man and I know the Minister of State takes an interest in these matters.  I appeal to him to give every consideration to ordering an immediate halt until all archaeological forces are satisfied that the site has been fully surveyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take, and always have taken, a personal interest in matters pertaining to our national heritage, in this case, archaeology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before speaking on the specific site, which is the subject of this debate, I <Col N="2498" /> should like to deal with urban archaeology in general terms.  In 1989 the National Monuments Advisory Council published Urban Archaeology Guidelines, which were very well received.  The purpose of the document was to produce a better understanding of the needs of archaeology in Ireland, to secure the collaboration of archaeologists, town planners and developers in protecting our heritage, and to suggest ways to secure both orderly development and sound conservation.  I commend this document to Members of the Oireachtas, who are interested in archaeology.</P>
    <P>One of the principles propounded in the guidelines is as follows:</P>
    <P>Where neighbouring sites have been excavated and a stage has been reached, at which further digging with present techniques would not add significantly to knowledge, it is prudent to conserve archaeological deposits for further discovery and examination. When resources are scarce there may be no alternative to adopting this course.</P>
    <P>This is being done internationally.  The guidelines went on to say:</P>
    <P>Development may proceed on sites, where it is decided to conserve suspected deposits but only in such a manner as would not damage, or would limit to a negligible degree, any damage to the deposits.</P>
    <P>The document further says:</P>
    <P>Where conventional foundations are not suitable, rafts or piling may be used.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that a sizeable portion of the Christchurch Place site, about one-seventh, was excavated by the National Museum of Ireland in the seventies' I am satisfied that the present development is proceeding in accordance with these principles, that is the building is being built on piled foundations and the archaeological remains are being sealed in for future generations or archaeologists to investigate.  However, in addition, an archaeological excavation is being undertaken <Col N="2499" /> to expose to view a length of the old city wall.  This will add significantly to our knowledge of medieval history as well as providing an interesting feature for the public to enjoy.</P>
    <P>This case is significant too in that it is the first occasion on which An Bord Pleanála imposed fairly stringent conditions in relation to archaeology and where they accepted the principle that the developer must pay.  All the costs of excavation and monitoring by archaeologists of ground disturbance and the cost of post-excavation reports are the responsibility of the developer.  The main conditions are: First, excavation of an area, to expose a portion of the old city wall.  An excavation of an area of 26 metres by 10 metres will be undertaken here; Second, excavation by machine cuttings to establish the full line of the old city wall on the site.  These cuttings have already been done to ensure that piling for the proposed car-park will not damage the wall; and third, monitoring by an archaeologist of all development works, including assessment of all potentially damaging works, such as pile driving, reduction of ground levels, excavation for pile caps and service trenches, etc.  It was in relation to this condition that the archaeologist requested that areas being excavated for pile caps, should be archaeologically excavated.  This work has now been completed.</P>
    <P>I might add that the site was surveyed by archaeologists in 1989 to assess the nature of the archaeological strata.  This survey included for the first time in this country the use of ground radar.  While the results were not altogether convincing, the expense incurred by the developer in undertaking this assessment must be acknowledged.  The Christchurch Place site was assembled by Dublin Corporation and sold to developers.</P>
    <P>The provisions to be made for archaeology were not specified and, consequently, became a subject of contention, leading to an appeal to An Board Pleanála.  Since the appointment last year <Col N="2500" /> by Dublin Corporation, with assistance from the Office of Public Works, of a city archaeologist, a new arrangement has been arrived at whereby in future the archaeological requirements will be settled in such cases, in advance, with the Office of Public Works.  Hopefully this will ensure that there will be no further difficulties of this nature.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, due to the conditions inserted by An Bord Pleanála, the archaeological work being undertaken and the positive attitude being adopted, we can conserve and preserve vital archaeological remains in this, our capital city, for examination by future generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, who is present in the House and who as a member of the Waterford Vocational Education Committee has given me great support on vocational education committee matters particularly.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, Drogheda Vocational Education Committee is the largest vocational education committee in any provincial town.  It has been the most successful and fastest growing college over the past number of years.  As I have said to three of the Minister's predecessors who have dealt with this issue, the vocational education committee, the parents' council and the people of Drogheda have been messed about &mdash; those are the best words I can use &mdash; by the Department of Education. I will explain my reasons for saying this presently.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there is a serious overcrowding problem in the school.  Approval for an extension was granted by the Department of Education on 20 June last and six additional rooms were provided for in that grant, based on a pupil population of 1,100.  At present there are 1,068 pupils in the school which was built to accommodate 800 students. This is causing a serious accommodation crisis with no rooms available for classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2501" /> Some classes are held in offices, storerooms and the library.  This intolerable situation was accepted on the strict understanding that the extension would be built by now.  I should like to quote a letter dated 20 June 1991 from the Minister's Department.  It states:</P>
    <P>A chara,</P>
    <P>I refer to recent meetings and discussions concerning the accommodation situation at St. Laurence's Vocational School, Drogheda.  The matter has been fully considered and the Department is satisfied that additional accommodation is warranted and proposes the following spaces to meet the immediate and long-term commitments of the school: four general classrooms at 190m2; one science laboratory at 91m2; one home economics room at 86m2; and a circulation area of 43m2; giving a total area of 410m2.  It is intended that this accommodation will be provided urgently by way of minimum cost masonry type structure requiring the services of an architect only.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department is approving the furnishing and equipping of the existing language room at St. Oliver's to provide for a language laboratory.</P>
    <P>On receipt of your Committee's acceptance of the foregoing proposals the Department will write to you further regarding the procedures for detailed implementation.</P>
    <P>As I said, that letter was dated 20 June 1991.  I put down a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister for Education on this matter to which I will refer briefly.</P>
    <P>Two hundred and eighty-two students are already enrolled in the school for next September.  However, only 127 students will leave the school after their leaving certificate.  This means that 120-150 students will inevitably have to be turned away unless the extension is built immediately.  All second level schools in the Drogheda area are full to capacity, <Col N="2502" /> including the other vocational education committee school, St. Laurence's.  I should say that promises were made before one general election that permission would be given to purchase a site for a new school.  Of course, that promise was withdrawn fairly quickly after the election.</P>
    <P>The Vocational Education Committee Parents' Council are extremely anxious to give guidance to parents of incoming students about the likely outcome of this serious situation.  However, they cannot give any guarantees about the building of the extension until such time as they get the go ahead from the Department of Education.  Approval to proceed to the next stage of this project is urgently awaited as the matter of accommodation at St. Oliver's College is already critical. Over a period of time the vocational education committee have endeavoured to have a deputation received by the Minister for Education but have failed to do so.  At a special meeting of the committee held on 23 March the principal of St. Oliver's College informed the committee that it would be physically impossible to accommodate the number of students seeking entry to the college in September 1992 unless the approved extension was completed.  The committee also examined the primary school numbers and the number of post-primary places available in Drogheda.  It was noted that in excess of 160 students would be without accommodation in second level schools in September 1992 and that this trend would continue.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that the future of the children of the Drogheda and east Meath areas rests in the hands of the Department of Education.  I ask the Minister to indicate clearly his intention to allow this extension work to proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking that direct funding be provided by the Department of Health for the Sacred Heart Day Unit for Mentally Handicapped Children at Lady Lane, Waterford.  To visit the Sacred Heart Unit is one of the most heart rendering experiences imaginable. The unit is run by a remarkable lady, Sister Imelda, who is assisted by a wonderful staff, 12 of whom are full-time and nine part time.  The nine part-time workers are on a FÁS training course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most apt way of describing Sister Imelda is to say that she compares somewhat with Mother Teresa of Calcutta. She devotes all her time and energies to the care and wellbeing of these young children.  There are 45 children in the unit <Col N="2504" /> and their ages are from 4 to 16.  They attend the day care centre for five days of the week.  These children vary from moderately to severely handicapped.  I think the Minister will appreciate from that the amount of effort and love necessary to cater for their needs.  The children are ferried to and from the unit by a team of volunteer drivers.  Recently the director, Sister Imelda, was told to cut back on numbers by the South Eastern Health Board in an obvious attempt to reduce costs.  This centre has a waiting list of 26 children and is desperately short of cash.  At present there is a bank debt of £30,000 and it would be much higher but for the trojan efforts of the voluntary fund raisers who help the centre.</P>
    <P>Waterford city have a well deserved reputation for being very charitable in needy cases and they have constantly raised money for this unit.  Every day the problems in relation to finance facilities and accommodation become more difficult. Apart from fund raising, the unit is assisted financially by the South Eastern Health Board who have their own financial difficulties.  The board have done their best in very difficult circumstances but their best is not good enough and that is why I am asking the Minister for Health to assist the unit directly.  In one of his initial interviews the Minister made the point that his priority was to assist the mentally handicapped and he could not come across a more deserving case than this one.</P>
    <P>Sister Imelda and her staff should not have the additional worry of insufficient financing.  Their work is extremely demanding and they operate in a building constructed in 1974 which needs to be extended if not totally replaced.  The unit should be financed entirely from central funds.  I understand that the Minister will visit Waterford shortly and I hope he will visit the Sacred Heart unit to see their magnificent work &mdash; and plight &mdash; at first hand.  I hope he will see fit to assist them as they deserve.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Dáil question on the matter last week, the Minister indicated that some extra moneys will be available from the South Eastern Health Board.  I <Col N="2505" /> understand that the sum in respect of 1991 is £6,500.  However, I understand that an extra £850,000 will be available for all mentally handicapped people in the south-west region and I hope that a substantial amount of those moneys will be made available.  However, direct funding is the ultimate solution so that all the children in need of assistance can be catered for in satisfactory surroundings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that Deputy Deasy raised this matter as, the more we discuss it, the more we highlight the problems of the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>The Sacred Heart Unit, which is run by the Irish Sisters of Charity, provides training and education for about 40 children with mental handicap.  The unit is funded by the South Eastern Health Board under section 65 of the 1953 Health Act and, as such, the funding issue is a matter for the health board.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the funding provided by the health board was £110,000, which was an increase of 10 per cent on the 1990 figure. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this figure has been further increased by £6,500 and a payable order for that amount will be issued to the Sacred Heart Unit shortly.</P>
      <P>The 1992 allocation for the unit has not yet been determined by the health board. I understand that it will be increased in line with the funds available to the board for the funding of such agencies.  Sister Imelda recently met the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board about her budgetary situation. The cash flow problems of the unit due to late payments from the health board have since been sorted out.</P>
      <P>As regards waiting lists for services, the position is that this year, apart from the normal increases in allocation totalling some £4 million, an additional £5 million revenue and £1 million capital has been made available to enable significant improvements in mental handicap services to be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These additional funds will enable an extra 80 residential and 300 day places to be provided to those most in need of such <Col N="2506" /> services.  A further 41 respite places will be developed.  This will mean that about 500 additional families will be able to have a respite break of one month in the year.  This is a very significant provision and will provide valuable relief to families and carers.  These additional places will be spread over the entire country in proportion to need.</P>
    <P>A home care or outreach programme will be initiated to meet the needs of families with a mentally handicapped member.  It is my intention that this scheme will work in a flexible way.  The scheme should provide a service for up to 1,000 families and will be targeted specifically at those persons who have no service at present or an inadequate one.</P>
    <P>Crisis intervention and services for disturbed persons will also be developed. There is a particular need to have an effective and immediate response when crises arise.  There is also the need to cater for those persons who are very disturbed. Special measures will be put in place to meet these needs.  Twenty places to deal with emergency needs in the Dublin area will be provided, which should ensure that all emergencies can be responded to as they arise.  The service for people with mental handicap who are also disturbed will be improved and expanded.</P>
    <P>Preventive and early intervention services play a significant role in reducing the level and severity of handicap in our society and will receive particular attention this year.  A specialist genetic counselling service will be initiated in 1992. Services for children will be expanded by the provision of three extra early intervention teams and 55 places in child education and development centres.  The precise operational details of the additional services to be provided, the staffing requirements, and the people to benefit are being considered by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee in each health board area.</P>
    <P>Because of the serious situation which exists in the Dublin area £2.65 million revenue was allocated to the Eastern Health Board.  The next largest amount, that is £850,000, was allocated to the South Eastern Health Board area in <Col N="2507" /> recognition of the scale of unmet need there.  This money will enable ten residential places, five respite places to serve 60 people, 60 day places, a home support service for 90-150 families, two early intervention teams and 15 day places for children to be created in the south-east.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board are in the process of consulting and agreeing with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee the precise operational details of the additional services to be provided and their proposals are awaited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2508" /> These developments are a major step forward and will result in a considerable improvement in service provision.  I accept that more needs to be done but I want to assure the Deputy that these services will be maintained at this higher level and it is my intention that they will be built on and further improved in future years.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Deasy suggested, I will be delighted to visit the Sacred Heart Unit when I am in Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 April 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>Many schools already make their premises available as suggested by the Deputy.  I am very much in favour of the use of school premises for community purposes outside of school hours and I would strongly urge that school buildings provided by way of State aid should be readily available for such use.  I will be addressing this matter further in the forthcoming Green Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>Where groups come together at the invitation of the schools, e.g. for parent association or parent-teacher meetings, the question of separate insurance cover does not arise.  However, in all other circumstances, outside groups given permission to use school premises are obliged to effect comprehensive insurance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 210 together.</P>
      <P>The Stay Safe Programme is being introduced to all teachers in counties Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare, which is the Eastern Health Board area, during this school year.  In order to assist the introduction three teachers were seconded to the health board.  The cost of the teachers and their expenses is provided by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>A circular was issued to school authorities at the beginning of the school year encouraging them to co-operate with the programme teams and indicating the Minister's support for the programme.</P>
      <P>I have not been aware of a reluctance on the part of teachers to use the programme. On the contrary the latest progress report available to the Department indicates that teachers' response has been positive and up to the end of February some 5,835 teachers have participated in the programme's training day.</P>
      <P>The programme is designed as a preventative programme and is not being introduced into individual schools without the consent of management and parents.</P>
      <P>The question of the extension of the programme to other areas is under consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department have for many years operated a scheme of special consideration for handicapped students who wish to take the certificate examinations. Under the terms of the scheme a wide range of special facilities are available to help such candidates at examination time.  With regard to extra time, the position is that extra time has, for many years, been allowed in the case of visually impaired candidates in order to compensate for their need to use Braille and/or low vision aids.  The extra time involved, ten minutes per hour, is related to the scheduled duration of the subject taken.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for special consideration, including the provision of extra time, are currently under review in my Department.  In the meantime, it has been decided that extra time should be allowed to candidates whose writing speed is hampered by a physical disability and who would not be in a position to make adequate use of aids such as typewriters, word processors or tape recorders.  Additional time of ten minutes per hour will be allowed to such candidates, as in the case of the visually impaired.</P>

      <P>The internal telephone service at military barracks in Dublin is currently in the process of being improved and restructured. When completed, all Dublin barracks will be served through a single switchboard located at McKee Barracks rather than by separate switchboards at each barracks.  The level of staffing at the centralised switchboard has been the subject of negotiations with the trade unions representing staff and further consultations will take place before a final decision on the appropriate staffing level is arrived at.</P>
      <P>Telephonists are recruited by competition from candidates sought from and nominated by the National Rehabilitation Board and/or FÁS.</P>
      <P>There was an expenditure of £6,130 on telephonist overtime at McKee Barracks in 1991.  The other information regarding overtime sought in the question is not readily available and a disproportionate amount of time would be required to extract it.</P>

The functions of the IDA and the nature of supports available are set out clearly in the Industrial Development Act, 1986, as amended by the Industrial Development (Amendment) Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>IDA liaise very closely with FÁS in the implementation of all the Authority's training-type supports.  Indeed, section 28 of the Industrial Development Act specifically requires the IDA to consult with FÁS prior to making a grant for the training of persons in the processes of an industrial undertaking.  For the purposes of considering major training grant proposals, there is a special FÁS/IDA Training Grants Committee.  FÁS are also represented on each of the IDA's Regional Small Industry Boards.</P>
      <P>In so far as grants supports in particular sectors are concerned, there are interdepartmental and inter-agency contacts with the intent of ensuring, as far as possible, that the programmes operated by the two agencies do not conflict with each other.  The IDA operate a sensitive sector list agreed with my Department under which IDA grant aid is not given in circumstances where firms would be competing primarily against existing businesses on the home market.

      <P>I have received representations from employers, employees and from various representative bodies about the changes which I announced in the budget in relation to the taxation of the benefit from the availability for private use of company cars.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this aspect of income tax cannot be seen in isolation from the totality of the measures taken in the income tax area in the budget &mdash; both their underlying rationale, and the fact that the budget effected substantial mainstream income tax reliefs &mdash; which will benefit taxpayers to the extent of £168 million this year.</P>
      <P>The current rates of taxable benefit i.e., 20 per cent of original market value where all the costs are met by the employer falling to 12½ per cent where the car only is provided, are very lenient when compared with the costs of private ownership.  When the sliding scale was originally introduced in 1982, it was intended that these rates would double to 40 per cent and 25 per cent for 1983-84 and subsequent years but this change never took place.  There is no doubt that the annual cost to an individual of providing and running a new car is over 40 per cent of the purchase price.  This being the case the increase in the BIK rate to 30 per cent, announced in the budget, is seen as being fair.  Equally the Government consider that the curtailment of tapering relief, so as to impose a charge in all cases where a company car is available for private use, is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2291" /> It should be noted that the benefit-in-kind charge does not apply where an employee arranges with his employer that he will not have the use of the car other than for business purposes; therefore, the provision of cars exclusively for business purposes is not being taxed. Alternatively, no charge will arise where an employee uses his own car for work and, subject to Revenue approval, is recouped the cost involved by his employer.</P>

      <P>All payments in respect of official travelling by Ministers of State are made by the Departments/Offices concerned, and in the time available it is not possible for me to furnish full details of all such payments over the nine-year period since the current arrangements were introduced.</P>
      <P>However from the data that are available the mileage payments, since the current system was introduced, are estimated to be: 1984, £184,000; 1985, £217,000; 1986, £198,000; 1987, £182,000; 1988, £235,000; 1989, £240,000; 1990, £232,000; 1991, £236,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average mileage payment to a Minister of State is now approximately £17,000.  In addition to mileage allowances, payments in respect of salaries and expenses to the civilian drivers assigned to Ministers of State averaged £33,000 a year in each case, entailing total expenditure of £50,000 on average in respect of each officeholder.  These figures represent less than half the costs which the State would have incurred in 1991 under the arrangements that operated prior to <Col N="2292" /> 1983, i.e. the provision of State cars and Garda drivers for Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>I can therefore assure the Deputy that the travel arrangements now applicable to Ministers of State continue to produce very substantial savings in so far as the Exchequer is concerned.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that section 16 of the Finance Act, 1986, provides that individuals who are chargeable to income tax in respect of profits or gains from farming are entitled to be given a credit in respect of farm tax paid by them in the year of assessment against the income tax liability arising from such profits and gains, on the production of proof of farm tax actually paid.</P>
      <P>However, section 3 of the Finance Act, 1987, provides that farm tax for 1986, paid on or before 30 June 1987, may be allowed only as a credit against 1986-87 income tax payable.  Farm tax paid after 30 June is not allowable as a credit in computing profits for tax purposes for any year.</P>
      <P>The inspector of taxes has no record of having received a claim for credit in respect of land tax paid by the taxpayer. In any event, as the tax is stated to have been paid on 5 October 1988, section 3 of the Finance Act, 1987 applies and credit is not available.</P>

This scheme is aimed at small scale recycling projects involved in the segregation, collection and sorting of waste before sending onwards for further processing/recycling.  Since its inception in 1987 a total of 43 separate grants amounting to just over £1.1 million have issued to 32 enterprises.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department of the Environment has commissioned Environmental Resources Limited to carry out a study on recycling potential in Ireland with a view to developing a strategy for its continued financing and development through the nineties.

    <P>The study will look at supports for recycling in Ireland, make recommendations for development of the existing recycling network and advise on the setting of targets for waste recycling in an Irish context.</P>
    <P>The timing of the study is opportune given the new comprehensive national waste legislation which is currently being drafted in the Department.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The completion of the Internal Market in accordance with the provisions of the Single European Act and in particular the abolition of internal frontiers control will mean considerable staffing, operational and other changes for the Customs and Excise service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners produced a report in October 1991 on the staffing implications for the Customs and Excise service of the planned completion of the Single European Market on 1 January <Col N="2296" /> 1993 and, in particular, the elimination of the fiscal frontiers and border controls between member states.  This report, which was presented to staff and the staff unions, showed that a potential surplus of 584 Customs and Excise staff would arise as a consequence of the introduction of the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>A review of the findings in this report has recently been completed.  The result of this review indicates that, based on current decisions and assumptions, the Commissioners now estimate that 604 jobs will be lost in Customs and Excise in the Internal Market context.</P>
    <P>The scale of the surplus staff situation identified obviously has implications for the organisational structure of the Customs and Excise service.  Under the present organisation structure the country is divided, for Customs and Excise purposes, into five administrative areas known as Collections.  It was proposed in the October 1991 report that four Collections should be retained, viz Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Galway and that Limerick should be closed as the seat of Collection.  The work now administered by the Collector, Limerick will be redistributed among Galway, Cork and Waterford Collections and the Collector's Office Limerick (23 staff) will be closed.  The proposal envisages that the 82 staff currently serving in the stations attached to the Limerick Collection area will continue to serve in the same locations but within new administrative structures.</P>
    <P>In making this particular proposal the future volume and concentration of Revenue work in the provincial Collections and the suitable location of administrative centres were taken into account to the greatest extent possible having regard to all the circumstances.  The Commissioners are satisfied that the proposed closure of Limerick as the seat of a Collection will not impact to any significant degree on the service given to traders in the Limerick area.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have made specific proposals for the involvement of Customs and Excise staff in new areas of work which will arise post-1992 and which have <Col N="2297" /> the potential to provide substantial employment opportunities.  While these new areas of work are likely to reduce the staff surplus figures from its current level of 604 it is not envisaged at this time that the retention of the Collector's Office in Limerick as an administrative centre would be warranted.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of the Revenue Commissioners to try to provide a career for all Customs and Excise staff in, or close to, their present locations so as to minimise disruption to staff and their families. It is envisaged that the discussions between the Commissioners and staff interests will be ongoing as the situation develops in order to resolve this issue. Given a reasonable degree of flexibility on the part of Revenue staff interests there is a good possibility that a substantial portion of any staff surplus arising in Limerick can be absorbed within Revenue when the decentralisation of the Collector General's Office to Limerick, involving in excess of 500 staff, commences in the spring of 1993.  I am asking the Revenue Commisioners to meet with the Customs and Excise staff in Limerick to discuss the issues involved.</P>

    <P>Question No. 55.  The floor covering was included in the overall tenders for the project at the initial stages on the basis of a bill of contractual arrangements which included a prime costs sum for this purpose.  The main contractor were McInerney's Ltd.  The carpets were specified in the bill of quantities for the overall project as &ldquo;Munster Glencurl Major with border design&rdquo;.  The carpet laying was carried out as a domestic subcontract by Messrs.  Sé Quirk Ltd. who supplied and fitted carpets as per the specification in the bill of quantities.</P>
    <P>Questions Nos. 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 <Col N="2300" /> and 68.  In accordance with procedures laid down by the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works require that before a contract is awarded a firm must have obtained the necessary tax clearance documentation from the Revenue Commissioners.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 132 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the staffing levels of all the fishery boards have fallen significantly in recent years due to general restrictions on recruitment and to the take-up by board staff of the early retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>In present financial circumstances it would be unrealistic to expect that there would be any general relaxation of these restrictions or any general increase in the staffing of the fishery boards.</P>
      <P>I am nevertheless conscious of the need to maintain a balance in the staffing of the boards and to ensure that a number of priority posts are filled.</P>
      <P>My Department has carried out an assessment of the staffing needs of the fisheries boards and I am endeavouring to secure the filling of priority posts, including posts in the Dundalk District which covers County Louth, and in the Upper Shannon Region at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The organisation and deployment of fisheries boards' staff is a matter for the boards themselves.</P>

Such offences are dealt with in the same manner as other breaches of the parking regulations.</P>
      <P>In recent years, traffic law enforcement has been accorded a very high priority. For instance, in so far as the Dublin Metropolitan Area is concerned, an additional 75 traffic wardens have been recruited since 1990 and there is provision to recruit a further 50 during 1992. In 1991, 353,447 on-the-spot parking fines were issued in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also been increasingly active in towing away illegally parked cars.  In 1991, 7,083 illegally parked cars were towed away by the gardaí in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  This compares with 6,187 in 1990 and 2,507 in 1989.</P>

      <P>The background to the problem with regard to the grant of free legal aid to persons charged before the courts in Cork city was set out in considerable detail in response to Deputy Quill in the Adjournment Debate on 18 February 1992 (Official Report of 18 February 1992, Columns 2305 to 2311).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disruption of the court system in Cork city in criminal cases is a direct consequence of action taken by solicitors in Cork, members of the Southern Law Association, who are refusing to represent persons charged with criminal offences who are entitled to legal aid. Their action was taken after they delivered what was in effect an ultimatum last September that they would withdraw from the operation of the criminal legal aid scheme within three weeks unless a scale of fees for legal aid cases in line <Col N="2310" /> with the fees they charge their private clients was introduced.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Southern Law Association, in delivering their ultimatum and in withdrawing from the operation of the scheme, were taken without any claim for an increase in criminal legal aid fees having been submitted on their behalf by the Incorporated Law Society.  The society is the representative body for all solicitors in the State and is the appropriate body for my Department to negotiate with on matters relating to the operation of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962 and regulations made under that Act in so far as solicitors are concerned.  For obvious reasons it would be out of the question for my Department to negotiate on matters of this kind with a purely local section of the solicitors profession and bypass their national representative body.</P>
    <P>On 18 February last the Law Society submitted a claim to my Department in which they sought a substantial increase in legal aid fees for solicitors in all parts of the State who operate the criminal legal aid scheme.  The Law Society claim is currently being examined in my Department and is being processed with all possible expedition.  Unfortunately the Cork solicitors are still persisting with their action.</P>
    <P>With regard to the effect which the solicitors' action is having on court cases in the Cork area the position is as set out hereunder;</P>
    <P>1.  Cork District Court: Since the dispute commenced up to and including 30 March a total of 257 people charged with criminal offences before Cork District Court have been affected by the solicitors action; 255 of these 257 people have had their cases adjourned by the court for lack of a legal aid solicitor.  With regard to the two people remaining, in the absence of legal aid, orders returning for trial were not made and the charges against them were struck-out.  However, the State may still prosecute them in respect of the charges referred to.</P>
    <P>2.  Cork Circuit Court: A total of 14 people, each with a criminal appeal to the Cork Circuit Court, have been <Col N="2311" /> affected by the solicitors action.  Eleven of these criminal appeals have been adjourned from the Hilary Term to the Easter Term because of the non-availability of a legal aid solicitor.  The three remaining appeals were allowed by the trial judge because of the non-availability of legal aid to which the defendants would have been entitled.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Martin Committee deal with two issues.  The first relates to the desirability of a procedure under which convictions can be reviewed following the exhaustion of the normal appeal procedures where there is an allegation of miscarriage of justice.  The committee recommended the establishment of an independent body with statutory powers of inquiry to examine cases where substantial doubt as to the propriety of a conviction has arisen but where the normal appeal procedures have been exhausted.  This recommendation has important implications for our criminal law system and is under detailed examination. I will bring forward my proposals as soon as possible in line with the commitment in the review of the Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The Martin Committee also recommended the introduction of video recording of questioning of suspects by the Garda Síochána.  I am looking at this recommendation with a view to submitting proposals to the Government as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, for some years past, all trainee gardaí and gardaí on in-service training courses, including community relations, Neighbourhood <Col N="2314" /> Watch and community policing courses, have received training and advice on relations with victims of crime.</P>
      <P>The stress and humiliation caused to women and children who are victims of sexual crime is such that it calls for a particularly sympathetic and sensitive response on the part of the Garda teams assigned to investigate such crime.  It is Garda policy that a woman member of the Force be included in each of these teams and that they be specially trained in relations with victims.  This training consists of special courses at the Garda College, Templemore and Harcourt Square and includes inputs by extern lecturers from child assessment units, clinical psychologists, social workers, forensic and medical personnel and Garda personnel. To date, six women members from the Cork East Division have undergone these courses and two places are reserved on each future course for other women members from that division.</P>
      <P>The Garda in-service training programme at Barrack Street station, Cork, provides more general instruction on family and criminal law and advice on how to deal with victims of crime, violence and rape.  The Garda authorities inform me that 300 gardaí from the Cork East Division have attended this course over the past six months and further training is on-going.</P>

      <P>The current Garda building programme was launched seven years ago to tackle the serious accommodation crisis which existed in many Garda stations.  The programme, which is based on priorities agreed following consultation with the Garda representative associations, has seen the replacement of eight divisional headquarters stations, 13 district headquarters stations, 30 smaller stations and the provision of four major extensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Cork east Garda division is concerned, new station buildings have been provided as follows: Blackrock, Gurranabraher, Watercourse Road, Mayfield and the new divisional headquarters at Anglesea Street.  A major extension to Togher district headquarters, at a total cost of £750,000, is due to be completed this year, as is a new station at Charleville.  I might also mention that renovation works totalling approximately £90,000 were carried out <Col N="2318" /> at 17 stations in the division in 1991 and to date in 1992.</P>
    <P>Other works authorised to date this year are new interview rooms at the Bridewell station, renovation works at Rathcormac, Glantane and Cloyne stations and the installation of storage heating at Ballycotton, Whitegate, Ardmore and Cloyne stations.  Further improvements in the Cork east division will be provided over the coming years in the light of overall priorities and available finance.</P>

I understand that arrests have already been made in both of these cases and the Garda authorities are confident that these arrests will help allay the fears of local residents about crime in their area.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the current Garda strengths at Crumlin and Sundrive Road station are 71 and 47, respectively.  I understand that there are no proposals at present to allocate additional gardaí to Crumlin or Sundrive Road stations.  The situation is, however, being kept under continuing review.</P>

      <P>The programme of support negotiated under the European Community Support Framework provided for an expansion of ESF-aided third level programmes to cater for 19,600 students by 1993.  This threshold was, in fact, reached by 1990.  Since then a further 2,600 have joined the same programmes for whom no ESF support is available. The full costs of these students must be met by the Exchequer at an annual cost of £10 million.</P>
      <P>The question of expanding the scope of the ESF grants scheme does not arise as no additional ESF aid is available under the existing agreement on the use of the Structural Funds which expires on 31 December 1993.</P>

      <P>Regulations made under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960 (No. 46 of 1960) prescribe that the amount of flourine which may be added to a water supply shall be such that the water, after the addition of the fluorine, shall contain not more than one part of fluorine per million parts of water, and not less than eight tenths of a part of fluorine per million parts of water.  These regulations also prescribe that the fluorine <Col N="2335" /> content of fluoridation public water supplies shall be determined daily by a colorimetic method and, in addition, shall be determined by a distillation method at intervals not exceeding four weeks.</P>
      <P>A general report on the fluorine levels for each fluoridated water supply is submitted by health boards to my Department on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>Returns made to my Department by health boards of the results of testing by the distillation method of fluorine levels in water supplies in 1990 (the latest period for which completed returns are available) indicate that a satisfactory level was achieved in 81 per cent of the tests carried out and I expect that a similar satisfactory overall result was achieved in 1991.</P>
      <P>Results for County Louth for 1991 indicate that a satisfactory level was achieved in 71 per cent of the tests carried out.  My Department are in touch with the North Eastern Health Board with a view to bringing the results for County Louth up to the national average.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on a recent study published in the British Medical Journal which was conducted in Finland and which showed that middle-aged men treated by doctors for heart complaints were more likely to die than those who ignored coronary problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the findings of the recent study published in the British Medical Journal on the outcome of intervention with middle-aged Finnish men who had <Col N="2343" /> one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease.</P>
      <P>These men were seen regularly and advised about diet, physical activity and smoking and were treated if hypertension or hyperlipidaemia was present.  Following the intervention the risk factors for coronary heart disease had reduced by almost half in the intervention group. Despite this, more non-fatal and fatal heart attacks occurred in the intervention group compared to the control group.</P>
      <P>The authors of the study could provide no convincing explanation for their findings. The findings need to be put in the context of an extensive range of other studies of interventions worldwide to reduce mortality and morbidity from coronary heart disease, some of which indeed support these findings.</P>
      <P>However, the balance of evidence suggests that significant reductions in mortality and morbidity from coronary heart disease can be achieved in countries where healthier lifestyle practices have been adopted.  Such practices include avoidance of tobacco consumption, balanced nutrition, moderate alcohol consumption, and regular exercise.  These core ingredients in any community based intervention are in line with WHO recommendations and are widely implemented internationally.  Indeed there has been a significant drop in deaths from heart disease in both men and women recorded in this country from 1980 to 1988 &mdash; the latest years for which detailed figures are available.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, more difficult to change one's lifestyle in middle age than to develop healthy lifestyle habits from an early age.  A community based approach provides the strongest and most supportive environment for adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyles.  The approach to healthy lifestyles involving the entire population &mdash; young, middle aged and elderly &mdash; is the best recipe for reducing our relatively high rates of death from coronary heart disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the basis of the establishment of a pilot research and demonstration project initiated in 1985 in Kilkenny.  The <Col N="2344" /> Kilkenny health project is currently being evaluated in terms of its success in reducing the risk of heart disease among the population in Kilkenny.  I expect this report on the evaluation to be submitted to me by the end of this year.  A parallel and linked study is being conducted by the Health Policy Research Centre at the ESRI which is examining the potential of a community-based lifestyle programme such as the Kilkenny health project for positively influencing lifestyles on a national basis and the implications of organising any such programme nationally within the existing care delivery structures.</P>

      <P>A cervical smear testing service is available <Col N="2345" /> to all women through their general practitioners, family planning clinics, maternity hospitals and special clinics organised by health boards.  Smears are analysed in a number of hospital laboratories throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The number of cervical smears tested in public hospital laboratories for diagnostic and screening purposes in 1991 was 122,000 approximately.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a working party was established in 1988 to review the cervical smear testing service. This group produced a very constructive interim report, the main recommendations of which are: the provision of improved training for staff; reporting time to doctors and patients not to exceed one month; abnormal results to be followed up quickly by the referring doctor with laboratory assistance; common classification to be adopted; continued availability of the service through different outlets; and laboratory procedures to be computerised.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of implementation of the report, it was circulated for comment to those organisations most closely involved in cervical smear testing services.  There has been a considerable improvement in the reporting of results of cervical smear tests over the past few years and my Department continue to monitor the reporting of results to ensure that no undue delays occur.</P>
      <P>The comments received and the evaluation of the implementation of the recommendations to date will form the main thrust of the work of the working party, which I am currently reconvening under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  This will also include consideration of the uptake of cervical smear testing by the target group.  One of the major items to be included in the terms of reference of the reconvened committee will be a review of the operational efficiency of the test notification procedures.</P>

    <P>Approximately 40 per cent of the population of the Southern Health Board have medical card eligibility.</P>
    <P>The specialist orthodontic service is at present being provided by a full-time consultant orthodontist and by two private orthodontists on a sessional basis recruited to the board's service.  The Southern Health Board recently reached agreement with University College Cork and Cork Dental Hospital under which an agreed level of orthodontic treatment will be carried out at Cork Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>A primary role of the consultant orthodontist <Col N="2351" /> is to organise and carry out a programme of education and training in orthodontic procedures to specialist and sub-specialist level for health board dental staff.  This will make further improvements in service levels.</P>
    <P>My Department provided extra funds to the Southern Health Board in 1990 and 1991 specifically for specialist orthodontic treatment.  Altogether a total of 1,981 cases received specialist orthodontic treatment in this region in 1991. The Southern Health Board's 1992 allocation includes a repeat of the special provision for the development of orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>My Department are in consultation with the Garda with a view to the development of an appropriate statutory code for cycle priority measures generally. The Roads Bill, 1991, makes provision for the construction of cycle ways for the use of pedal cycles or pedal cyclists and pedestrians.  Local authorities are reminded annually of the need to ensure that the surface of hard shoulders on roads is adequately maintained for the safety and convenience of cyclists.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for waste management and waste planning, including the selection and operation of waste disposal sites, is a matter for the local authority concerned. In this case, Roscommon County Council, in their response to the incident at Ballaghaderreen, decided that the Cregga Hill site and the disposal arrangements proposed there represented the option most likely in the circumstances to minimise danger to human health and the environment.  An inspector from my Department provided advice and assistance to the council on an informal basis in their consideration of the matter.</P>

I am satisfied that the matter can be dealt with under the general requirement to drive with due care and attention contained in section 52 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  An offence under that section carries a maximum fine of £350 or, at the discretion of the court, a prison term of up to three months or both.</P>
      <P>Following a request by my Department, Bord Telecom now includes a prominent message &mdash;&ldquo;Take Care: Don't Dial and Drive&rdquo;&mdash; on each bill for mobile telephones.  The next edition of the <i>Rules of the Road</i> booklet, which will be published in the near future, will advise drivers to stop at a safe location before making or receiving calls on hand-held telephones.</P>

      <P>Taking into account both this result and her failure to attend three previous examination, the deciding officer decided that she was not incapable of work from 30 December 1991.  Accordingly, she is not entitled to disability benefit from that date.  Previous representations from the Deputy, received on 27 February 1992, were accepted as an appeal by her against her disallowance of benefit and a further medical examination by a different medical referee has been arranged for 16 April 1992.</P>
      <P>When the result of this examination is to hand her entitlement to disability benefit, including the period from 30 December 1991, will be reviewed.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the proportion of the cases of payment of deserted wife's payments and supplementary welfare allowances to deserted spouses, where the deserting spouse is making a contribution towards these payments in accordance with the provisions made in the Social Welfare Act, 1989 for such contributions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The liability to maintain <Col N="2383" /> family provisions contained in the Social Welfare Act, 1989 were commenced on 29 November 1990.</P>
      <P>Since then, a total of 952 cases have been assessed or are in the process of being investigated.  The identification of these 952 cases involved a first phase elimination of almost 5,000 other cases, where it is now established that liability does not exist.  Seven liable relatives have started to make a contribution towards their spouses' deserted wife's benefit or allowance or lone parent allowance.  Currently there are 19,051 claimants receiving a deserted wife's payment or lone parent (separated spouses) allowance from my Department.</P>
      <P>Legal proceedings are being considered in a number of cases that have failed to comply.  As data is built up the level of success will rise quickly.  In addition, the move towards the unique RSI number for every adult will make identification of deserting spouses easier and more effective.  The work done so far shows that cases fall into three main categories.  The first two are cases where a liability on the spouse either does not arise or cannot be pursued.  These relate to cases where the spouse is either on social welfare payments or cannot be traced generally because of having gone abroad.  The Department's main ongoing action will, therefore, be limited to the remaining category who have a possible liability which may be capable of being pursued.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not available from either the health boards or my Department of the total number of liable relatives who are making contributions towards payments of supplementary welfare allowance to deserted or separated spouses. Accordingly, it is not possible to say what proportion of supplementary welfare allowance payments to deserted spouses are being offset by contributions to health boards from liable relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1992 Social Welfare Bill widens the scope of the liability to maintain family provisions and strengthens powers of collection and enforcement.  My Department are also applying more stringent <Col N="2384" /> income assessment procedures in determining the ability of liable relatives to pay regular contributions.  I expect that this combination of measures will increase substantially the number of liable relatives making a contribution towards social welfare support of deserted spouses, lone parents and their children.</P>
    <P>The approach to date has involved a considerable amount of groundwork and research to establish the most effective approaches.  This has allowed the issue of spouses' liability to be brought home to those concerned in a selective way.  It allows potential contributors to consider the better alternatives to the enforced system which is now being imposed.  It is felt that this approach will have a positive and ongoing deterrent effect.</P>

      <P>At present, applicants for disability benefit are required to have paid at least 39 PRSI contributions at any time.  There are no proposals to change this condition.</P>
      <P>In addition claimants are required to have a minimum of 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  The Social Welfare Bill provides for the additional condition that, with some exceptions, a minimum of 13 of those contributions will have to have been paid contributions.  This change will bring about a saving in disability benefit expenditure.</P>

      <P>In general it is the practice not to pay rent supplements in respect of accommodation rented from parents.  A supplement is not being paid in this case because the applicant is the daughter of the landlord.</P>
