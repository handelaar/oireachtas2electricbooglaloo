      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 10 and 11.  It is also proposed notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 10, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Education.  It is further proposed, notwithstanding anything in the Order of the Dáil of 4 June, that the two divisions on Votes 42 and 43 and Votes 26, 27, 28 and 29 deferred on Thursday and Friday last shall take place successively at 6.30 this evening.  Private Members' business, which shall be No. <Col N="2" /> 20, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 tonight.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Taoiseach that there are serious difficulties in relation to No. 10.  My understanding is that agreements were reached last week on the basis of certain undertakings in regard to the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  Despite negotiations taking place up to a late hour this morning, agreement has not been reached in relation to the position of the vocational education committees or the role of the IVEA.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that, with 40 amendments before the House in the name of the Minister today, the Bill will be completely different <Col N="3" /> from that before the House previously. I suggest that a committee of this House be set up to deal with these issues because of the fundamental changes to the Bill, of which most Fianna Fáil Deputies will be aware from the lobbying that took place in the last number of days.  I suggest that instead of putting a guillotine on the Bill at 5 p.m. today we should order that a committee of the <Col N="4" /> House be set up to deal appropriately with the serious issues.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Taoiseach.  One is the matter of the Cohesion Fund and the discussions at the Council of Finance Ministers yesterday. The confusion about these funds is not helpful to the campaign being conducted regarding the poll next Thursday. If the Minister for Finance would come into the House today or at some other time before the poll and make an authoritative statement on the precise position, that would be of assistance in the campaign.  The other matter is the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme on BBC on Monday. I have already written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about it.  I understand the Taoiseach will be meeting the British Prime Minister some time in the next week and I hope he will take the opportunity to raise the concerns held by many Members about that programme.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhíomar ag plé anuraidh an Bhille speisialta ar Ollscoil Luimnigh, bhí díospóireacht an-suimiúil againn ar áit na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais: bunscoil, dara leibhéal agus tríú leibhéal, go háirithe an ollscoil nua i Luimneach.  Mhol an Teachta Mac Giolla agus mé féin leasuithe agus ghlac an tAire ag an am sin leo nó ghlac sé le spiorad na leasuithe a leagamar os comhair an Tí. Nuair a scrúdaítear an dá leasú inniu, is é sin, an chuid den Bhille é féin agus an leasú in ainm an Teachta O'Shea agus na dTeachtaí eile, is léir go bhfuil an leasú in ainm na dTeachtaí O'Shea, Mhic Ghiolla agus Garland i bhfad níos láidre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were debating last year the Bill to change the title of the NIHE in Limerick to the University of Limerick and the NIHE in Glasnevin to Dublin <Col N="8" /> City University, there was an omission from the Bill relating to the role of the Irish language.  Deputy Mac Giolla and I tabled an amendment very much in the same vein as the amendment before us. It is very important from the point of view of image, ethos and ambience of a university or any institution that we should stitch in a very clear commitment to the Irish language.  Section 7 (4) is rather bland.  It states:</P>
    <P>(4) In performing its functions, a governing body shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>The amendment is much stronger.  It provides that the governing body shall have due regard to the preservation, promotion and use of the Irish language and to the preservation and development of the national culture.  The commitment to preservation presupposes that the language is an integral part of the college. Promotion implies a pro-active role for the language within the college.  The language should be used as a medium for teaching and a general vehicle of communication within the college.  There should prevail within the college a general atmosphere of things Gaelic, cultural and Irish.</P>
    <P>As we face into the final week of the referendum campaign when people will, I hope, decide substantially in favour of going into a more united Europe, it is important to remember that one of the strengths of the Community will be the diversity of culture within it.  There will be a bringing together of the cultural mosaic of language and tradition.  We should preserve and enshrine in any legislation, but particularly legislation dealing with education, a very clear commitment to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>That is why I support the spirit and thrust of the amendment.  It is stronger, more forceful and more committed than the well-meaning but rather bland aspirations in section 7 (4).</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an leasú atá os ár gcomhair anois agus leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Higgins. Fáiltím freisin roimh an ráiteas a rinne an tAire an lá faoi dheireadh nuair a dúirt sé go raibh sé chun glacadh leis an leasú. Ach ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire, cén bhrí atá leis an alt atá os ár gcomhair, agus go háirithe leis na focail &ldquo;cultúr náisiúnta&rdquo;.  Chuala mé dhá rud ar an raidió ar maidin: rud amháin faoi chóisir atá le bheith ag Prince san RDS roimh i bhfad agus bhí roinnt daoine ag caint faoi na focail a úsáideann an duine sin, go háirithe na focail a bhaineann le gnéas. An dara rud a chuala mé ar an raidió ná úsáid an fhocail &ldquo;maighdean&rdquo; ar thraenacha DART.  Tá sé an-deacair a rá cén tuiscint atá againn faoin chultúr náisiúnta, go háirithe i gcomhthéacs an reifrinn a bheidh ann roimh i bhfad.  Ba mhaith liom, mar sin, go míneodh an tAire an bhrí atá leis an alt sa Bhille seo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment.  It is important that we write into these Bills on education a very clear commitment from this House to the promotion of the Irish language.  It is sad that the Irish language has fallen into neglect in average daily usage and that is to be deeply regretted.  I hope there can be improvements in this area in the future.  Obviously we are dependent on the school system at every level to encourage and promote the use of the Irish language which is an inherent part of our culture.  I note the Maastricht debate comes into everything these days. Deputy Higgins referred to the need for cultural diversity and so on.  I would like to echo those sentiments.  However, I do not share his optimism that national culture in this country or, indeed, in other European countries, can survive the cold <Col N="10" /> winds of Euro-conformism which undoubtedly will be blowing even stronger if, and when, the Maastricht Treaty is approved next Thursday.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have paid lip service to the Irish language.  They had a unique opportunity some years ago to have Irish made an official accredited language of the European Community but they did not avail of that opportunity. That set a marker which, unfortunately, has continued for some time; in other words, successive Governments have demeaned the national language.  Basically, they have said to the EC: &ldquo;Do not bother about the Irish language, it is only spoken by a few cranks, it is not important&rdquo;. That is the message that is getting across and I think it is a very wrong message.  So far as I know, the Maastricht Treaty is not readily available in the Irish language.  This is deplorable.  The information leaflets which we are putting out in connection with the Maastricht Treaty is printed in both languages.  I commend this amendment to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Aontaím freisin leis an leasú seo.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh gach duine dáiríre maidir le cur chun cinn agus labhairt na Gaeilge.  Ní haon mhaith leasú a chur isteach sa Bhile seo mura mbíonn na daoine atá i gceannas ar na coláistí seo dáiríre faoin gceist seo.  Táimid go léir ag labhairt faoin Ghaeilge ach níl go leor daoine ag labhairt Gaeilge &mdash; sin an fhadhb atá ann.  Tá suim ag gach duine sa tír sa Ghaeilge ach ní labhraíonn siad í.  Tá sé fíor-riachtanach, ó thaobh lucht ceannais na gcoláistí de, go mbeadh an dáiríreacht seo faoin Ghaeilge ann mar ní féidir dada a dhéanamh gan sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé soiléir anseo sa Dáil: mura mbeadh Gaeilge ag an Cheann Comhairle bheadh sé an-deacair labhairt as Gaeilge mar ní bheadh a fhios aige cad a bhí ar siúl.  Nuair a fheictear do dhaoine go bhfuil Gaeilge ag lucht ceannais is mór an spreagadh é sin dóibh an teanga a labhairt.  Rinne an Teachta Garland tagairt do Maastricht agus sílim, de bharr an dlúthcheangail leis an Eoraip, gur mó an meas atá againn ar ár gcultúr agus ar <Col N="11" /> ár dteanga.  Nuair a théann Éireannaigh thar lear is mó an fonn a bhíonn orthu Gaeilge a labhairt lena chéile mar cloiseann siad daoine eile ag labhairt a dteangacha féin.  Mar sin, ní aontaím leis an Teachta Garland ar chor ar bith mar creidim go ndéanfadh sé maitheas dúinn bheith páirteach ann.  Tá súil agam go gcothófar labhairt na Gaeilge i ngach col-áiste agus, in ionad óráid bheith á tabhairt as Laidin, mar a tharlaíonn go minic nuair a bhíonn céimeanna á mbronnadh sna hollscoileanna, b'fhéidir go bhféadfadh an chaint tosaigh bheith as Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá áthas orm glacadh leis an leasú seo.  Tacaím go hiomlán le cur chun cinn úsáid na Gaeilge sna coláistí tríú leibhéal agus tríd an chóras oideachais i gcoitinne.  Freisin, ar ndóigh, tá dualgas ar na coláistí ár gcultúr náisiúnta a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt.  Leagann an fhoráil seo sa Bhille an dualgas sin ar na coláistí.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputies' concern that appropriate provision should be made with regard to Irish.  Therefore, as I said the last day I am pleased to accept this amendment.  However, I would not accept that progress towards closer European integration, as has been pointed out by some Deputies, poses any threat to our distinctive national identity.  On the contrary, closer contact with the variety of European languages and cultures should, and I am confident will, reinforce the esteem and respect in which we hold our unique culture.  It is my duty today to deal specifically with the amendment. I would welcome a fuller debate on the use of the Irish language.  I, like many others, could improve my own Irish, which has become rusty over the years.  I support completely the sentiments expressed.  Perhaps when we launch the Green Paper that is a matter that could be addressed at that stage.  However, I am delighted to accept the amendment as put forward by Deputy O'Shea.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) In performing its functions, a governing body shall have due regard to promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in education.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper which will be introduced shortly will stress the need to ensure gender equity and equality of opportunity throughout the education system.  These are matters of the highest priority for me and I am pleased, therefore, to have the opportunity to enshrine this principle in this Bill.  I am also pleased to respond to the view expressed by Deputy MacGiolla on Second Stage that the Bill should have a clause promoting equality of opportunity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment. Nevertheless, I regret that the committment to gender equity and equality of opportunity is not stronger.  I appealed earlier to the Minister to put it in plain writing that there would be equal representation of men and women. However, we have just got a general commitment to encourage gender equity.  We have been getting such promises for a long time and they have not brought the results we would all welcome. That experience should tell the Minister, if he is really serious about gender equity, that it is necessary to take the radical step of providing for equal opportunity in the Bill and not just a provision which states it as a principle.</P>

However it reminds me of the kinds of clauses which were promoted some years ago, particularly by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in relation to employment agreements where employers and trade unions were encouraged to build equality clauses into employment agreements stating an aspiration to gender equity and equality of opportunity.  It is certainly very good that aspirational clauses of that kind are built into legislation and employment agreements. However, experience has shown that it is necessary to do more than simply state an aspiration.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Green Paper is, apparently, to deal with this because nowhere more than in the educational system does the question of gender equity need to be examined.  I do not know offhand the proportion of women teachers but I think that in the primary area it is of the order of about 70 per cent; it is not quite as high as that at second level although it is very high. When one moves outside the ranks of the teaching profession and through to posts of responsibility and the areas of principalships and vice-principalships, and even through the teacher unions to the composition of executives, the administration of the educational system and the Minister's own Department, one finds that the bulk of the people in those areas are men.  The Minister must ask himself why that is the case.  Why is it that although the vast bulk of teachers are women the vast bulk of principals and vice-principals are men.  One cannot say that it is a historical inheritance because for many years women have out-numbered men in the teaching profession and yet have not managed to come through in the areas of promotion.  Let us look, for example, at the generation of teachers now coming to the stage of promotion, teachers in their thirties and forties. Where the overwhelming majority of teachers are women one still finds that it is the man who is promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the teacher unions have done some study of this and have made a number of recommendations in relation <Col N="14" /> to it.  However, it is time that the Minister had a serious look at this to find out why it is that so few women are promoted in a profession in which they are in the majority.  It does not make sense.  In other professions where women are under-represented it is perfectly understandable that women do not hold the majority of managerial positions.  In a profession where women are in the majority and have been so for a very long time, where it is women teachers who are very often running the show &mdash; and I mean no disrespect to principals and vice-principals &mdash; why is it that they are not being promoted?  This is something that must be tackled urgently.  The Minister should be asking his inspectors who are sitting on interview boards why it is that more women are not being promoted to posts of responsibility, to principalships and to managerial positions in a profession where they are clearly in the majority and have been for quite some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this amendment.  However, the whole area of equity needs to be looked at.  Equity has many faces.  Gender equity has been dealt with by a number of speakers and it is something to which I am totally committed as are the Labour Party.  Equality of opportunity in the context of students is another area that needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>There is a certain hypocritical side to this amendment in as much as the Government have already decided that the ESF maintenance grants are now to be means tested along the same lines as the higher education grants.  That will certainly have two effects.  First, it will divert people away from the colleges and towards the universities and, second, it will mean that there will be students who will not get any third level education. One wonders about the sincerity of the Government in introducing this amendment when they are following this road outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent letter from the Department to vocational education committees in relation to the course provision for 1992-93 <Col N="15" /> spells out clearly that the Government wish to pursue a policy of restricting the number of students following degree courses in RTCs to 10 per cent.  Students are disadvantaged in many ways in terms of equality of access.  There are factors that could broadly be called socio-economic factors and there are also geographic factors.  To a very large extent, the area in which one lives determines whether one will be able to avail of third level education, whether at a regional technical college or at a university.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a general comment about the use of the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; throughout the Bill.  If we are serious about gender equity the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; should appear.  I understand that the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; would cover a man as well as a woman in the legal context.  A commitment to gender equity must be demonstrated in every way possible.  I have a subsequent amendment in relation to this matter and I hope the Minister will recognise the sense in using the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; as distinct from that of &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In general terms I support the amendment but it is my view it is aspirational. I ask the Minister to consider making provision for the introduction of regulations on Report Stage to give stronger statutory effect to the aspiration of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I support this amendment.  The Green Party are totally committed to gender balance and, where possible, gender equality.  That has been part of our policy since 1982 and we were the forerunners in ridding our vocabulary of sexist language.  Deputy O'Shea referred to the use of the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, which is very offensive when used in the context of appointing someone to chair a meeting.  The term used should always be &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  I am glad the other parties are coming around to the Green Party point of view.  I assume that this amendment will be adopted with acclaim.</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of the amendment.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore, however, that it is slightly platitudinous. I also agree with my colleague Deputy Ahearn that more forcible wording should be built in to strengthen and copperfasten the role and entitlement of women.</P>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves.  The regional technical colleges in Sligo, Letterkenny, Galway, Cork, Waterford, Carlow and Dundalk all have male principals. All nine regional technical colleges have male principals.  Time and again it has been shown the higher the management grade, the fewer the representation of women.  We have 3,200 primary schools and, as has been said, the preponderance of women in the profession of late is self-evident.  Despite the fact that there is a huge female dominance in the primary teaching profession, of the 3,200 principals only 1,400 are women.  A similar representation is found in the grade of vice-principal, both A and B posts, although the number increases for the B post category.  There is a need for positive discrimination.  Of course, there is the concern that if an inbuilt regulation for one to one is copperfastened doubt could be expressed as to whether merit has prevailed, that the objective of equality is not always achieved.  Nevertheless, in light of the under-representation of women and the clear discrimination against women in the profession, there is a need to enshrine in legislation the one to one provision, &ldquo;at least one of whom shall be a woman&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consideration of the general withdrawal of males from the educational profession, the figures speak for themselves. Of the 100 under-graduates taken into St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra last year there were 90 women and ten men.  I understand that similar figures apply to Mary Immaculate College in Limerick.  Those figures point to a most unhealthy imbalance.  While it is very important that we have a meritorious entry system, boys are making a conscious decision not to participate in education. A specific study should be carried out on the reasons boys are not entering <Col N="17" /> the education profession.  A 9:1 ratio in favour of females would mean that our schools did not have the extension of the home unit that is important in the classroom.  A balanced representation in the classroom is vital from the point of view of role model.  However, that is a separate issue for another day and it is one worthy of special study.</P>
    <P>I support and accept the spirit of the amendment.  It does not go as far as the Fine Gael Party would like but we look with considerable appetite and anticipation for the long-awaited Green Paper on education.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I also should like to support the amendment. To elaborate on the comments made by my colleague, Deputy Higgins, I consider that there is an imbalance in the number of women appointed to the posts of principal and vice-principal, especially at primary school level.  For many years the balance was quite in order.  Many of our older teachers will not be replaced by men teachers.  Primary school male teachers will become the white blackbirds of education &mdash; they just will not exist.  If 90 per cent of the entrants to our teacher training colleges are female it is obvious that women will dominate the education system.  At the moment the figures give a distorted picture in that in recent years women have completely dominated our colleges yet older male teachers are still in positions of power.</P>

      <P>As I said, the Green Paper on education will stress the need to ensure equity and equality of opportunity in the education system.  They are matters of the highest priority for the Minister.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a significant step forward.  It enshrines in legislation the responsibility of the governing body to promote gender equity and equality of opportunity.  The governing bodies will, accordingly, be answerable to the Minister and, through him or her, to the Dáil as to the way they discharge their responsibilities.  The aim will be to attain gender balance on governing bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> Those responsible for nominating persons to the governing bodies must consider the balance between men and women.  That will apply to vocational education committees, students, academic staff and industrial interests. Overall the Green Paper recognises the need to tackle gender equity and sets out specific proposals.  The Government are fully committed to gender equity and equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea suggested the provision of regulations on Report Stage. The Minister when formally appointing governing bodies has power under the Bill to review the gender balance.  If the Minister is unhappy he or she can ask the nominating bodies to review the nominations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned use of the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  The Deputy is correct in what he said in that regard.  The issue is covered under the Interpretation Act. That question was raised at drafting stage but was not acceptable.  Deputy O'Shea's concerns can be dealt with through the Second Schedule, which provides that the chairman may be designated by such title as the governing body may determine. Over a number of years I served on various bodies headed by women and it was my experience that women were often offended at being called &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo;. Some women insisted on being called &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo;.</P>

However, I prefer to look at attitudes which have developed in the younger generation, a man or a woman is a &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; and that is how we should proceed. <Col N="19" /> The Minister's response has given room to cover the problem which I raised and I ask him to do something specific on Report Stage which would insert a recommendation that boards of management should look at the title &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; when this office is being filled.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82a:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 10 to 14, to delete subsection (5).</P>
      <P>During the course of Committee Stage debate on the amendments concern was expressed about the apparent over-centralisation in the Minister of functions in relation to the college.  I have already made it clear to the House that there was no such intention and to emphasise this fact I have already moved a number of amendments, particularly in relation to section 5, to clarify my intent in this regard.  The amendments have been widely welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give colleges autonomy in managing their affairs on a day-to-day basis within the framework of agreed programmes and budgets. These programmes and budgets are provided for in section 13 of this Bill which also provides for the roles of the vocational education committee and the Minister in this matter.  Having further considered subsection (5) and taking into account strong representations received <Col N="20" /> on the matter and the views of Deputies as expressed through amendments to this Bill and to the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, I have concluded that the provision is not consistent with the intention of giving colleges appropriate autonomy. The intent of the subsection can more appropriately be achieved through the provisions of section 13.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the purpose of this Bill is to give colleges appropriate autonomy while defining the respective roles of the vocational education committee and the Minister.  I reiterate that this Bill provides for a strong continuing role for the vocational education committees in the RTC sector: they have the single largest representation on the governing body; they have the continuing power to nominate the organisations they consider require representation on the governing body and they have the power to approve or modify the programmes and budgets of the colleges.  Concern has, nevertheless, been expressed in the House and through representations to me that the role of the vocational education committee has been &ldquo;written out&rdquo; of the Bill or at best that its role has been considerably diminished.  I have demonstrated that this is clearly not the case. However, I am prepared to clarify the position further in the following important respects.</P>
    <P>I have already undertaken to come back on Report Stage regarding the Minister appointing ordinary members on the recommendation of the vocational education committee.  I will be accepting an amendment from Deputies Higgins and Ahearn on section 3 (3) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill to the effect that the vocational education committee may make recommendations with regard to other institutions to be covered by that Bill and I will be introducing a corresponding amendment to the RTC Bill on Report Stage.  I am also proposing to accept amendment 145 from Deputies O'Shea and Garland to substitute &ldquo;approved&rdquo; for &ldquo;determined&rdquo; in relation to the format of the operational programmes in section 13 (1) and amendment 149 from the same Deputies and <Col N="21" /> from Deputy Mac Giolla to delete &ldquo;with the agreement of the Minister&rdquo; from section 14 (2).</P>
    <P>I trust the House will recognise from what I have said that the role of the vocational education committee is appropriately provided for.  The Bill, however, has to strike a balance between this role, the role of the Minister and the objective of establishing these colleges as third level educational institutions with the necessary authority to manage their affairs as intended, in line with all other third level institutions.  It is a balance which, I believe, all sides of the House wish to see succeed.  It is, however, a delicate balance and I believe that the position as I have now outlined it is the best way of achieving it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister is going some way to meet the fears which a number of Members expressed on Second Stage and Committee Stage. However, section 7 relates to the functions of the governing bodies and, whereas section 13 is being put forward as an area where improvements can be made, I submit that the proper amending of subsection (5) to section 7 is a productive road to follow because the role of the vocational education committees &mdash;even with the changes which the Minister is proposing &mdash; has been reduced very dramatically.  Subsection (5), as stated, and which the Minister now proposes to delete gave the Minister far too tight a grip on the colleges.  However, amendments tabled in my name and in those of other Deputies sought to put academic freedom back into the system &mdash; I mean academic freedom in terms of the vocational education committees and parents' bodies who have developed those colleges for over 20 years and who are responsive to local needs.  They are an important part of the local community and instead of subsection (5) stating that a governing body could be directed to cease providing specific courses or services, one of the amendments in my name and in those of Deputies Mac Giolla and Garland, seeks to amend subsection (5) so that the vocational education committee <Col N="22" /> could direct the governing body to provide for specific courses or services.</P>
      <P>The basic flaw in the Bill is that the colleges are looked on as being similar in all circumstances but this is far from being the case.  For instance, colleges in Waterford and Cork have a high incidence of degree provision while others do not confer any degrees.  We are now tightening the system, a letter has already gone to the vocational education committees directing that the degree content in student numbers would relate to 10 per cent of students.  It is important for the local vocational education committees to respond to a need which they identify in their own areas.  I make no apology for referring to Waterford; there is a strong consensus that the college in Waterford should be allowed to develop to a point of providing degrees, not just in the narrow based approach of business technology and so on, but degrees which would take in the liberal agenda.</P>
      <P>In relation to the future of the colleges &mdash; the Bill and the recent letter from the Department to the vocational education committees would seem to support this view &mdash; I fear that the liberal agenda will be sidelined.  If that happens we will lose sight of the essence of education; people should be allowed to develop to their full potential.  While we can train people in the areas of business and technology we should also allow them to develop their faculties so that they will be able to relate to other people and play a much fuller part in the community in general.  If we narrow the basis of the curriculum we may do considerable damage.  As I stated earlier, students have a tendency to remain in the sector from which they graduated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the regional technical colleges are confined to a curriculum and ethos which does not cover in a meaningful way the liberal agenda of education, they will provide a lopsided education service which would be to the detriment of areas outside Dublin and the other university cities.  Therefore, rather than delete the section the Minister should accept the amendments which have been tabled in my name and that of other Deputies in <Col N="23" /> order to meet the need for local democratic control.</P>
    <P>The business studies degree at Waterford Regional Technical College is probably the most popular degree course in the country.  However, in 1985 the Department did not want this course to be provided but the local vocational education committee who were aware that there was a need and a demand locally for this course and aware of the excellence of the staff who would provide the course, went ahead with it.  It is now without doubt the most popular degree course in the country.</P>
    <P>While, on the one hand, the Minister is trying to meet our reservations in relation to centralisation I put it to him strongly that we should refer in this section, which deals with the functions of the colleges, to their ethos given the ability of the vocational education committees to tap into the various sectors of the local economy &mdash; trade unions, employer organisations and so on.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees have been in existence since 1930.  The Minister was very generous in his praise of the committees last week.  At second level they have developed an excellent and comprehensive programme not only for those of schoolgoing age but also for those who wish to avail of second chance education and develop their skills and ability, for example to read and write. Indeed, I am aware that the Minister is grateful to the vocational education committees for providing the literacy service. Therefore I ask him to look again at the amendment which was tabled to the Bill initially in the context of amendments which have been tabled in my name and that of other Deputies.  We contend that the regional technical colleges should have a say in terms of the academic freedom of these institutions. An educational institution which does not have academic freedom does not fit in with any definition of an educational institution that I know of.</P>
    <P>The problem with the Bill is that it relates to unit costs and the need to produce people who can fill slots in the <Col N="24" /> market place only.  While courses must be relevant and improve the chances of graduates of obtaining employment once they qualify there is also the wider agenda in relation to the input and responsibilities of these graduates to their local communities.  Those who have benefited from third level education can make a large contribution to voluntary, community and sporting organisations in their local areas.  However, if they are to make this necessary and desirable contribution they must be allowed to develop their faculties to the full so that they will be able to analyse, criticise, relate to other people, to be compassionate and see the other person's point of view.  If this section is deleted, I am afraid we will lose sight of the need to cover all aspects of education in these colleges.</P>
    <P>The recent letter from the Department to the chief executive officers is quite clear in relation to the role of the universities as distinct from the regional technical colleges.  As a former member of two vocational education committees and as someone who has always been committed to the system, I reacted angrily to that letter.  If the role played by any educational establishment is to be meaningful they must have academic freedom to respond to ever-changing circumstances. The Department, and all the facts seem to support this view, want to remove the vocational education committees from the third level scene immediately, to direct achievers in the direction of universities and to restore the mandate that these colleges had 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the amendment and I will oppose the proposal that this section be deleted.  The Labour Party wish to see this section retained in the Bill and to see the amendments made to the section to ensure that the colleges would retain control and so that we will not lose sight of the liberal agenda of education.  There is a school of thought within the Department, which is reflected in the additional amendments which have been tabled by the Minister for Education, which suggests that while it is the function of these colleges to produce <Col N="25" /> people with qualifications, courses should not cover the liberal agenda; in other words, they should not be in keeping with the comprehensive definition of education.</P>

      <P>I welcome the assurances given by the Minister in relation to the proposal that subsection (5) be deleted and to some extent accept the points made by Deputy O'Shea in relation to amendment No. 83 which proposes an input by the vocational education committees in relation to programmes.  However, section 13 provides for a considerable input by the vocational education committees in relation to (1) the budget and (2) the operational programmes.  It reads:</P>
      <P>The college shall, on or before the 1st day of March in each year, prepare and submit to the vocational education committee in such format...</P>
      <P>It will thus be seen clearly that the operational programme goes to the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>Section 13 (3) says:</P>
      <P>The vocational education committee may, in respect of the programmes and budget submitted to it under this section, either approve of such programmes and budget without modification or following appropriate consultation with the governing body approve of the programmes and budget with such modifications as it thinks fit to make.</P>
      <P>Again the vocational education committee would appear to have a considerable input there.  We have also managed to increase representation of the vocational education committee on the governing bodies.  Therefore, there is an indirect input by members of the vocational education committee in the devising of programmes and so on.</P>
      <P>What I do not like are the provisions of section 13 (9) which appears to introduce the heavy hand of the Minister, in that it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any material departure from the <Col N="26" /> programmes and budget as approved or imposed by the Minister under this section may take place...</P>
    <P>I do not like the phrase &ldquo;imposed by the Minister&rdquo; in this subsection, which continues:</P>
    <P>only with the prior approval of the vocational education committee and the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably happy that the vocational education committee are being given a considerable input in relation to the devising of programmes, both directly by way of programmes being submitted to them, through their right to make suggestions and recommendations, and of course, by virtue of the presence of the vocational education committee members on the governing bodies themselves.</P>

      <P>I have always believed that the essence of and basic principle underlying this Bill should be given greater autonomy to regional technical colleges, allowing them run their day-to-day affairs.  It is my belief that the Minister's proposed deletion of section 13 (5) does afford the governing bodies greater autonomy.  I contend they should have that autonomy, that it was not to their benefit that they did not have sufficient power to take day-to-day decisions themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are to be six members representing the vocational education committee on the governing body who should be able to adequately represent the committees views.  I am satisfied that the vocational education committee are not being totally isolated since they will have their six members serving on the governing body.  It will be up to the Committees themselves to ensure that those six members adequately reflect their views whether about programmes or courses to be provided in the regional technical colleges.  The most important aspect is that the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges do have autonomy to conduct their affairs in the interests of their students and education <Col N="27" /> generally.  It is a step in the right direction to give them power to take such day-to-day decisions themselves.  Like my colleague, I am satisfied that the vocational education committees are not isolated, and that they will have their six representatives who will, hopefully, reflect their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was appalled at the provisions of section 13 (5) when I first read them, that the Minister would have the right to give a direction to a governing body requiring them to refrain from providing or to provide particular courses, with which direction the governing body would have to comply.  I consider that to be gross interference on the part of the Minister for Education in the day-to-day flexibility one would normally wish for the governing body of a regional technical college.  Consequently, I am pleased that it is proposed to delete that subsection.</P>
      <P>In a way Deputy O'Shea's amendments argue for much the same thing although it is to be achieved in a different manner.  As I read them, they argue for the Minister continuing to have a role in directing a regional technical college in the provision of courses where, in the opinion of the Minister, the vocational education committee fails to do so.  I hope I am not misrepresenting Deputy O'Shea but it seems to me he is making a case that the vocational education committee, in some way, should have a role in directing the governing body on the provision of specific courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have argued here very strongly that the role of the vocational education committee must be maintained in the context of the provisions of this Bill.  The role I perceive for the vocational education committee in relation to these two Bills is one which provides for a degree of public, in particular local, accountability on the part of regional technical colleges. I would not agree with the vocational education committees participating in the day-to-day running of the regional technical colleges or in the day-to-day decisions of the governing body with <Col N="28" /> regard to whether given courses should be provided.  Although having the height of respect for vocational education committees &mdash; and I was a member of a vocational education committee up to about a year ago &mdash; I think there is a tendency on the part of some vocational education committees to over-extend themselves into areas of detail within schools and colleges, which is precisely the kind of thing that has created resentment among some principals and staff in the regional technical colleges.  There is a role for the vocational education committees in the areas of accountability, general policy-making and general control. But there is a line to be drawn &mdash; some times it can be difficult to ascertain exactly where that line should be drawn &mdash; beyond which the governing body, the board of management or the principal and staff of the schools or colleges concerned should be allowed to get on with the job.  The decision whether individual courses should be provided is one that should be taken within the colleges themselves. There is a procedure under which programmes and so on are submitted to the vocational education committee for approval, which role should be left to the individual colleges.  I am glad the Minister is proposing the deletion of this subsection.</P>

It was for that reason we endeavoured to facilitate their view-points.</P>

    <P>I might reiterate that the overall aim of the Bill is to give autonomy to the regional technical colleges within an agreed policy framework, on which there <Col N="29" /> is general agreement.  For example, the annual programmes and budget will provide the vocational education committees ample opportunity to make an input into the provision of courses and their direction. Therefore I am not willing to accept the amendments of Deputies O'Shea, Mac Giolla and Garland in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the involvement of my Department in the provision of courses, I should say the aim is to move away from that involvement.  Indeed I am confident that the new governing bodies will be fully receptive to local needs.  Again, Deputy O'Shea suggests that all colleges are being treated similarly without regard to regional variations.  That is not the case, because the vocational education committees, through their direct nominees and their selection of regional, industrial and commercial interests, clearly can reflect local and regional interests and dimensions.  In fairness it can be said that we have moved a considerable distance from the amendments tabled last week. It was because of concern expressed by many interests that my amendment No. 82 (a) was tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with a point raised by Deputy Ahearn in regard to reportage back to the vocational education committees.  As I understand the system, there is provision for reporting back to the parent vocational education committee, but in my experience with vocational education committees who at present have one nominee on the governing body, there is not a set report-back procedure.  The Bill does not provide for a report-back on a monthly basis, for example, to vocational education committee meetings, so the role of the vocational education committees, who will not have information given to them on a regular basis by the colleges, will go into decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Members talked of the autonomy of the colleges in terms of day to day running of their affairs.  The Labour Party have no problem in making them more autonomous, certainly in the day to day running of their affairs, but the difficulty <Col N="30" /> arises at the level of general policy-making. I do not envisage colleges being at odds with their vocational education committees very often, but in terms of general policy making the vocational education committees should have a very definite input in the direction of programmes. That is not adequately covered in the Bill.  The college must submit an annual programme and budget one year in advance to Marlborough Street.  There is some reference procedure in relation to the vocational education committees, but there is no definite or meaningful role in relation to the development of general policy.  The role of vocational education committees as buffers between the Department of Education and the colleges, has been very fruitful in relation to the development of colleges and, in particular, colleges who wanted to move away from the basic mandate to expand the range and number of qualifications they were making available.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to diminish the autonomy of the colleges in the day to day running of their affairs.  That makes good sense. It makes for economy and it eliminates all kinds of duplication.  My problem is about the general policy area, the directions colleges will take, how a college will develop over a period.  In certain instances, it may suit a college to provide certain courses which may attract students from all over the country as distinct from responding to a particular and clearly defined regional need.  The vocational education committee with the closest link with the college, would have sometimes a more objective or possibly subjective view of the local need and requirement, and how educational services should be provided in the area.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister see the colleges as being national institutions?  The CAO-CAS operation seems to indicate that the thinking in the Department is they are national institutions.  Is the mandate of the colleges to provide courses that will attract students from any part of the country or is it to produce a range of courses, be they for certificates, diplomas, degrees or other professional qualifications? Are the colleges to respond <Col N="31" /> to regional needs or are they to respond to the body of students nationally?</P>

      <P>I shall deal with some of the points raised by Deputy O'Shea.  I mentioned a balance earlier and spoke of facilitating the vocational education committees and the Minister to oversee the overall thrust of the college while, within that framework, allowing the colleges to get on with the job, that is to give them the necessary academic freedom to do so, which I presume Deputy O'Shea would fully agree with.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the involvement of the vocational education committees with the colleges.  Amendment No. 82a provides that the vocational education committee can request information directly from the college.  This is an important change.  I emphasise again that the annual plan comes through the vocational education committee who can approve or modify it.  If day to day intervention by the vocational education committee was to become the norm it would totally defeat the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1) (b), line 20, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of the vocational education committee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the dissolution of the governing body, the doomsday situation.  The role of the vocational education committee is the point that gives rise to this amendment.  Subsection 2 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  If&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Minister is satisfied that the functions of the governing body of a college are not being duly and effectively discharged, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a governing body wilfully neglects to comply with any lawful order, direction or regulation of the Minister,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>Here again there is mention of the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;. This is centralisation, and side-lining the role of the vocational education committee.  The amendment which is in my name, and that of Deputy Garland's seeks to amend subsection (1) (b) to read:</P>
      <P>(b)  a governing body wilfully neglects to comply with any lawful order of the vocational education committee, direction or regulation of the Minister</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, if the governing body of a vocational education committee are not performing their functions properly or are defying the Minister or an order of <Col N="33" /> the vocational education committee, they may be dissolved.  I put down this amendment because I believe that vocational education committees, the only locally elected democratic bodies in our education system, should have a role to play if a governing body act in a way which is inimical to education in an area or, more importantly, to the interests of the students attending the college.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 already sets out the functions of the governing body to be carried out subject to such policies as may be determined by the Minister.

      <P>I accept the spirit of what Deputy O'Shea is trying to do, that is, maximise the influence and role of vocational education committees.  I am trying to conceive of a situation in which a governing body would wilfully neglect to comply with the lawful order of a vocational education committee.  There would seem to be a clear conflict of interest here.  In the first instance, six people will be nominated directly onto the governing body by the vocational education committee.  In addition, five persons shall be nominated by such organisations as the vocational education committee consider require representation. Such organisations shall be representative of various sectoral interests, for example, agriculture, industry, etc.  Therefore, the vocational education committees will have an input in regard to direct nominations.  The interests of the vocational education committee will be doubly represented by virtue of the nominees from the other organisations.  Consequently, I find it difficult to conceive of a situation in which a governing body would be in conflict with a substantial body of opinion within itself, the vocational education committee members, and the indirect nominees of the vocational education <Col N="34" /> committee.  In these circumstances I would have difficulty in supporting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the problem here relates to the section as a whole.  I can understand the inclusion in the Bill of a provision which provides that in certain exceptional circumstances there could be a procedure whereby a governing body could be dissolved if an individual member or members became impossible and their continued membership was inappropriate.  I think there are some provisions in the Bill which cover that type of situation.  However, what we are talking about here is a procedure whereby the Minister will only have to consult with the vocational education committee &mdash; it might be no more than a telephone call or a letter giving them a date by which they can state their views &mdash; before he can sack the entire governing body and appoint another governing body in their place who could stay in office for up to two years.  The circumstances in which the Minister can do this are quite extensive.  For example, he can sack the governing body of a college if he is satisfied that their functions are not being duly and effectively discharged. This could mean a number of things; there are a very wide set of possibilities contained within the phrase &ldquo;duly and effectively discharged&rdquo;.  He can also discharge them if they wilfully neglect to comply with any lawful order, direction or regulation of the Minister; in other words, the Minister can sack the governing body if they displease him. Finally, he can sack them if they fail to comply with any judgment or order of any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why this section is included in the Bill.  I should like the Minister to indicate to us the kind of practical situations which he envisages arising which require a provision like this to be included in the Bill.  The governing body will have to be reappointed in any event.  If the governing body are not fulfilling their duties or individual members behave in a way with which the vocational education committee are <Col N="35" /> unhappy, the vocational education committee has a recourse open to them whereby they can replace that person the next time round.  Presumably the various staff representatives, student representatives and the representatives of the various nominated bodies can also be replaced when the time comes round. This section provides for a set of circumstances where the Minister can sack the governing body if he does not like what they are doing and replace them for up to two years with nominees of his own. That is an extraordinary power to give the Minister.  I do not see the necessity for this provision and I should like the Minister to give us a few examples of what he envisages could happen which would require him to behave in this very powerful way in relation to the governing bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not envisage any difficulties arising.  Section 8 is broadly in line with a somewhat similar provision in the 1930 Vocational Education Act, which so many people are anxious to protect at present.  I am not aware that that provision has ever been used. Similarly, I hope that a doomsday scenario will never arise in the colleges.  I do not anticipate that the provisions in section 8 will ever have to be used; they will not be used as an ordinary day to day mechanism.  As I said, I do not envisage any problems arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to recall where such circumstances did arise.  I know that not so very long ago when the board of management of a primary school in County Kildare made a decision which displeased the parish priest, the parish priest petitioned the Minister to disolve the board of management and the then Minister, much to my surprise, complied with his request and dissolved them. Therefore, there is a precedent where a governing body who make a decision which displeases somebody can be dissolved. As far as I can recall, the only other time something like this was done was almost 20 years ago when a Government <Col N="36" /> dissolved the RTE authority.  We are still reeling from that decision 20 years later.  We are still seeing a degree of timidity and deference to Government by RTE, particularly in regard to their news and current affairs programmes.</P>
      <P>If the provision in the 1930 Act has never been used then why is it necessary to repeat a similar provision in this legislation? The Minister has not given any instance of where he expects this provision might be used.  I do not think this section should be included in the Bill at all.  I believe a case can be made for the House opposing this section or for the Minister withdrawing it, unless he has more compelling reasons, for its inclusion than he has expressed so far.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore's comments.  We on this side of the House also question the need for section 8 of the Bill, probably because the Minister has not outlined circumstances that may arise to necessitate the dissolution of a governing body.  For example, it is very clearly spelt out that if a local authority fail to strike a rate the Minister for the Environment can dissolve the local authority.  Under what circumstances could the dissolution of a governing body of a regional college occur?  If the Minister explains the position we might be able to accept the need for the section, but on logical grounds I cannot see the need for it.  As regards failure to comply with any lawful order, I would like clarification on what is a lawful order.  If the Minister clarifies this it might give us reason to believe that there is need for section 8 but as it stands, I find it difficult to comprehend the position.</P>

      <P>Deputy Glmore made the point that rarely has a provision such as this been used.  There have been only two examples over a long number of years.  The reason this section is in the Bill is that the Minister would have power in the event of this extreme situation arising.  As I have said, it is highly unlikely and I would not envisage any such development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like clarification from the Minister on this section. Is a lawful order as presented in the Bill an order of the Houses of the Oirechtas? Are regulations of the Minister regulations that would arise following the enactment of this Bill?  When talking about a direction are we talking about, for example, a letter or a phone communication from the Department?  I can see conflict arising in this area.  I asked the Minister about this matter during the debate on the amendments to section 5. Do the Department see the colleges as being national or regional institutions. For instance, if a governing body wish to pursue a certain line of action in line with regional need but the Minister takes the view that the college should respond to a national agenda, a conflict could arise. There is need for clarifying this section.</P>
      <P>Obviously if a body are to be dissolved provisions must be made for that.  I asked the question last week &mdash; to which I did not receive an answer &mdash; whether in the event of a governing body being dissolved and a college ceasing to function, the lands and buildings vested in the governing body would revert back to the Department, or what would happen them.  We need clarification as to what an order constitutes and whether it is an order of the Houses of the Oireachtas, whether a direction would need to be written or whether a telephone communication would suffice and whether regulations as laid down in the Bill would have to be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>My initial comments were addressed solely to the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Shea, which relates to a governing body who wilfully neglect to comply with any lawful order of the vocational education committee or regulation of the Minister.  The reasons I am not inclined to agree to this amendment are twofold.  I am unsure as to whether or not a vocational education committee should have the right to order a governing body.  In view of the fact that they are represented on the governing body, there is dual representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> We are trying to envisage circumstances in which the Minister would invoke this section to dissolve a governing body and set up a governing body nominated by him.</P>
    <P>The more orders that are made and the more sources from which orders are made the more we increase the possibility of bringing about these circumstances. For example, difficulties may arise in the case of both the Minister and the vocational education committee making lawful orders.  I would like to know what constitutes a lawful order of the Minister or of a vocational education committee. Who would arbitrate as to whether or not an order of a vocational education committee is lawful?  The vocational education committee may decide to issue specific instructions to a governing body, which in their reasoned opinion might seem fair and equitable, but they may not be acceptable to a governing body.  In those circumstances could the vocational education committee seek the dissolution of the governing body?  The more sources from which orders are made the greater is the likelihood of this section being invoked.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Ahearn, I would like the Minister to outline the circumstances that may arise in which a governing body would be flagrantly in breach of a lawful order of the Minister, thereby incurring the wrath of the Minister.  As Deputy Ahearn said, the Minister for the Environment can exercise his power to dissolve a local authority, as happened in the case of Dublin Corporation when the late Deputy Frank Cluskey was Lord Mayor of Dublin.  Dublin Corporation refused to strike a rate and the Minister for Local Government, Kevin Boland, used his absolute powers to dissolve the corporation and appoint a manager to manage their affairs until such time as the expiry of their term of office.  If the Minister gives examples of circumstances in which this section would be used we may be able to accept the powers enshrined in the section.</P>

      <P>I forgot to respond earlier <Col N="39" /> to Deputy O'Shea's question about whether regional technical colleges are national institutions.  They are regional colleges by definition and orientation. However, the CAO-CAS arrangements were introduced to respond to student and parental pressure for simplification of procedures, and they are widely welcomed. As regards the general concern about section 8, lawful orders relate to, for example, programmes and budgets where there is perhaps total overspending and, second, they apply to national norms of pay and conditions of staff.  As regards the position of programmes and budgets, if there is total overspending under section 13 and no account is taken of programmes and budgets it would be time to act.  In order to clarify the position further I will come back on Report Stage and spell out in detail where these problems may arise and where section 8 might be invoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has said he will come back to this matter on Report Stage.  When he is doing so he might look at the possibility of coming back with some amended version of section 8.  Where a governing body fail to comply with a court order, there will obviously be a remedy, presumably through the courts.  The implementation of the functions of the governing body under this legislation is an area that could be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the governing body could be removed if they differed with the Minister on a policy question. Much of the criticism of this Bill relates to the degree to which policy matters are being taken from vocational education committees and the colleges and are effectively being given to the Minister, and the degree to which the Minister has control over the colleges.  If the Minister gave an unreasonable direction and the governing body were exercising independence and courage in facing up to the Minister whose direction might not be in the interests of the college, it would be wrong to give the Minister power to dissolve the governing body.  The Minister <Col N="40" /> should consider restricting the application of this section to the exceptional circumstances he intends to outline to us on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 23, to delete &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;on a recommendation of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment also relates to the possibility of dissolving the governing body. The Minister gave us some examples as to how he envisages problems arising. Here we are essentially talking about court orders, national norms on pay and salary budgets and programmes.  Those areas are covered either statutorily or close to it and as Deputy Gilmore pointed out there is other recourse to the Minister to deal with the problems outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties could arise with regard to policy, and policy here allows conflict to develop.  The CAO-CAS system provides for students from any part of the country to take up courses in any regional technical college.  There is no geographical boundary.  If a governing body decide to provide courses to bring in students from all around the country, as distinct from courses with a particular relevance to the needs of an area, conflict could arise with the Minister.  If a Minister wants to dissolve a governing body of a regional technical college this amendment seeks to provide that it is done not after consultation with the vocational education <Col N="41" /> committee but on the recommendation of the vocational education committee. The recommendation of the vocational education committee would apply specifically to policy areas that relate to regional development as distinct from colleges which are becoming national institutions.</P>
    <P>If a Minister dissolves a board of management there is provision here whereby the Minister may appoint any person or persons that he so desires.  That would be different from the dissolution of a county council or a corporation.  Where a governing body of a regional technical college is dissolved, the vocational education committee remain.  It would make sense for the vocational education committee in question to assume the role of the Governing body for the time being, instead of perhaps bringing in somebody from outside.  Commissioners who have been appointed when local authorities have been dissolved are generally retired civil servants.  I put it to the Minister that such a person would not be as knowledgeable or as experienced in relation to local needs as the vocational education committee.  The recommendation of the vocational education committee is extremely important.  It can be argued that the vocational education committee is represented on the board of management but the board of management could be at odds with the Minister and they need not necessarily include any of the members of the vocational education committee.  It is in that context that the amendment has been put down.</P>

      <P>How binding is a recommendation from a vocational education committee?  What difference is there between &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; and &ldquo;a recommendation&rdquo;?  It is not really clear that a recommendation from the vocational education committee would have to be honoured by the Minister. Changing the amendment from &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; to &ldquo;a recommendation&rdquo; will not make as much of a difference as we might wish.  Deputy O'Shea's amendment may be relevant if his amendment to section 8 (1) (b), &ldquo;to comply with any <Col N="42" /> lawful order of the vocational education committee&rdquo; had been accepted.  The Deputy is saying that the vocational education committee would recommend that the governing body be dissolved because they failed to comply with a lawful order of the Minister.  I would accept the need for the amendment if it were accepted that the governing body could be dissolved by any lawful order of the vocational education committee.  It would logically follow that the vocational education committee should make a recommendation.  Because that is not included, I could not support the amendment. It is not logical that the vocational education committee should recommend the dissolution of the governing body because they wilfully did not comply with a lawful order of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is need for further clarification.  As the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; appears in this section it is open to wide interpretation.  Could it mean, for instance, that an official of the Department could telephone the chief executive officer or make contact with the chairperson of the vocational education committee or that a Department official could meet a group from the vocational education committee or the whole vocational education committee and hear their views, which could be given individually? Recommendation is about decision and about a vocational education committee taking up a very definite position.  A recommendation has standing in law as the legal view of the vocational education committee.  The term &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; is loose and capable of wideranging interpretation. Perhaps the Minister could tighten up what he means by &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;. As the Bill stands, the requirement on the Minister in relation to consultation would be met by answering a letter or adopting the opinion of a chairperson or of a chief executive officer.  It is too vague.  Even after recommendation, the Bill states that the Minister may take certain action.  It does not mean that the Minister must act on the recommendation of a vocational education committee but such a recommendation <Col N="43" /> obviously implies a decision of the vocational education committee.</P>

This has been pointed out by Deputy Ahearn.  This amendment and amendment No. 92 would not alter the position. Consultation is the correct approach.  It will be genuinely used to get the views of the vocational education committee. However, in circumstances where, for example, programmes and budgets or staff norms were ignored the Minister would need the discretion to act directly after consultation with the vocational education committee.  It would be wrong for the Minister to be dependent in this case on a vocational education committee recommendation.  This is not intended as a device to enable the vocational education committee or the Minister to run the colleges on a day-to-day basis.  I will look at this matter for Report Stage.  Consultation is the proper way.</P>

    <P>This amendment relates to the dissolution of the governing body, Section 8 (1) states:</P>
    <P>...the Minister may, after consultation with the vocational education committee, by order remove the members of the governing body from office and direct the nomination and recommendation of new members or, as the Minister thinks fit, dissolve the governing body and transfer the functions of the governing body to any person or persons.</P>
    <P>We are seeking that the word &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; be substituted in place of the word &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo;.  In the context of the Minister's agreement to come back on Report Stage in relation to the whole section, I would simply ask him to respond briefly on this point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 8, subsection (1), lines 27 <Col N="45" /> and 28, to delete &ldquo;any person or persons&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the vocational education committee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I alluded earlier to the background to amendment No. 95.  It relates to the dissolving of a governing body and the trans-ferring of the functions of that body to any person or persons.  The amendments seeks to provide that in the event of dissolution the functions of the governing body would be transferred to the vocational education committee.  When a local authority is dissolved, such as a county council, a county borough council, a corporation, an urban council or town commissioners, there is not a ready-made framework for maintaining the functions of that body in any kind of democratic structure.  It would make a great deal of sense for the parent body to assume the functions of the governing body <i>pro tem.</i></P>
    <P>Regarding the question of replacing the governing body by way of, say, commissioners, as I understand local government legislation, when a local authority are dissolved when they have refused to bring in an estimate the Minister can appoint as commissioners those members of the local authority who actually voted in favour of a balanced estimate.  There should be a similar provision in this Bill to provide that where members of a governing body were voted down but were not in favour of the line which would give rise to conflict with the Minister the members of the governing body could, if the Minister of the day so desired, be reappointed and the other places could then be filled.</P>
    <P>Essentially the amendment seeks to have the parent body, in relation to regional technical colleges, remain in that capacity and take over those functions which are within their general remit. Where a governing body has been dissolved the Minister of the day may require time to arrive at a more permanent solution as to which group of people should replace the governing body removed from office.  I do not favour in any circumstance the idea of one single person, be it a commissioner <Col N="46" /> in a local authority, or wherever, taking the place of a group of people who, through an extension of the local democratic process, as in this case, are elected to do the job.  I do not have a difficulty with the idea of persons.  In the highly unlikely event &mdash; I do not foresee it happening &mdash; of the governing body of a regional technical college being dissolved the proper course of action would be to have a new governing body put in place as speedily as possible but in the short term the functions of the governing body should be assumed by the vocational education committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the spirit of what Deputy O'Shea is trying to achieve by means of his amendment.  I take his point in relation to the undesirability of a single individual assuming the role of elected representatives in situations where disbandment or dissolution takes place.  It is most undesirable that such a circumstance should be allowed to persist for a long period.  Essentially if elected bodies are guilty of some misdemeanour which is sufficiently grave to have them disbanded it would be desirable that a replacement democratic body come to be appointed as soon as possible.  It would also be desirable that the body that would replace the previous dissolved body would be as representative as possible. This is a matter on which we hope to introduce amendments on Report Stage. A key to this dilemma may be found in section 8 (2), part of which reads:</P>
      <P>and may fix the tenure of office, duties and remuneration of all such persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, particularly, to focus on the words &ldquo;fix the tenure of office&rdquo;, because we will be introducing on Report Stage suitable amendments to have that tenure of office as short as possible.  In a situation where a governing body is suspended the period of office for the replacement agency, or person &mdash; it can be one person, as has been rightly stated &mdash; should be specified.  It should be for the shortest possible period to allow for a transition period and a new governing <Col N="47" /> body to be put in place as soon as possible. I would, however, have some anxiety in relation to who should be the caretaker during the interim period. Does it make sense on the one hand to dissolve a governing body, a large component of whom are members of the vocational education committee, and hand the powers over to the vocational education committee &mdash; a body which is substantially represented by vocational education committee members or by agencies or organisations nominated by the vocational education committee &mdash; and on the other hand give the powers directly &mdash; in the interim, for whatever the period may be &mdash; to the body from whom they have been taken?  This is a matter on which I would like to focus.</P>
    <P>All of us here have defended the rights of vocational education committees, their role and their input into vocational education at all levels in relation to bringing on board the entire regional technical college and Dublin Institute of Technology system of education and the very responsible manner in which they have discharged their remit and responsibilities. Vocational education committees are essentially second level management structures who, until now, also had a high input into third level management.  This is something we are trying to enshrine in this Bill.  I agree with Deputy O'Shea that we have whittled away many of their powers in an earlier section of this Bill, for example, in relation to the nomination of chairman.  Originally, it was intended that the chair of the governing body would come from within the membership but that has now gone and it will be by means of nomination.  I have doubts as to whether in the interim the powers should be given to the vocational education committee.  The way out of this would be that on Report Stage we should fix a specified period within which the alternative body would be nominated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection as it stands provides that the function of a dissolved governing body could be transferred to any person or persons.  Such <Col N="48" /> persons could, of course, include the vocational education committee, but not exclusively as proposed in this amendment. I would have the same fears if there were six members of a vocational education committee on a body that had to be dissolved, obviously that would leave a question mark over that membership. For that reason I would not be prepared to accept this limitation. Amendment No. 96 from the same Deputies proposes the deletion of subsection (2) and would not be acceptable on the same basis in that the subsection sets out the conditions under which a governing body appointed, in lieu of a dissolved body, should function. However, I would agree that in the event of dissolution a new governing body would be appointed as soon as possible. In making interim arrangements I would try to ensure that all relevant interests were represented.  I agree it would be wholly exceptional for one person to be appointed.  This is a matter we could look at when reviewing this entire reaction on Report Stage to ensure that the least possible time would pass before another governing body would be put in place.</P>

We would like to see a representative qualified body appointed in the interim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 96a:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 46 to 48, and in page 9, lines 1 and 2, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Each governing body shall, with the approval of the Minister, from time to time appoint in a whole-time capacity a person to be the Director and chief officer of the college.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill as initiated envisaged that staff, including the Director, would be appointed by the vocational education committee on the recommendation of the governing body, to be officers and servants of the college.  The selection of such staff would be a function of the college and staff would hold office on such terms and conditions as the college may determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staff would also be officers and servants of the vocational education committee for the purposes of certain sections of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1944 and the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1980.  The 1930 and 1944 Acts references related mainly to suspension and dismissal of staff. Action on these matters could, however, <Col N="50" /> take place only on the recommendation of the governing body.</P>
    <P>These references however, have caused considerable confusion as to the intent of the provision.  The problem was most recently raised by Deputy O'Shea at the earlier part of the Committee Stage of this Bill.  He sought clarification as to who the employer was and expressed concern in relation to the operation of Labour legislation in particular the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.</P>
    <P>In order, therefore, to clarify this matter my amendment No. 96a provides that the college will provide a person to be director and chief officer and amendment No. 110a provides that the college will appoint other officers and servants subject to the usual approval requirements. Consequently suspension and dismissal will be a matter for the college subject to the standard provision at amendment No. 116a that a college shall not remove or suspend any of its officers from office without the consent of the Minister.  Amendments 123a, 124a and 125a are consequential to this change.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1980, will continue to apply to staff as it applies to vocational education committee staff.</P>
    <P>These changes do not represent any disimprovement in conditions of service of staff.  Such conditions are copperfastened in section 12 of the Bill which stipulates that they may not receive less remuneration or be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than that to which they are now entitled.</P>

      <P>What is the reason for the change of heart in relation to these amendments introduced on 3 June?  The Bill as originally drafted provides that the vocational education committee shall, on the recommendation of the governing body of the college and subject to the approval of the Minister, appoint a person to be the director of the college in a whole time capacity.  Now there is a complete change of emphasis in that each governing body shall, with the approval of the Minister from time to time appoint, in a whole time capacity, a person to be <Col N="51" /> the director.  The prerogative is being taken from the vocational education committee and given to the governing body.  I am not saying that this is a good or a bad thing, but why the change?  Why have the draftsmen who created this Bill decided now to make a fundamental change in relation to who actually would nominate the director?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>With amendment No. 96a, we have reached a fundamental point.  Obviously this amendment did not emanate without consultation.  As I understand it there was not, up to this morning, any consultation with IVEA, a body who represent the vocational education committees.  I too, would like to ask the question put by Deputy Higgins. Was this amendment sought and achieved by the principals of the regional technical colleges?  Obviously it is not something that was sought by the vocational education committees and it was certainly not sought by their parent body.  This raises the question of why there was no consultation with the IVEA. I understand that the IVEA are greatly concerned about the lack of consultation. In view of the fact that this amendment effects such a large change and affects hugely the constituent bodies of the IVEA, was it right, proper or fair that such a change should be brought about <Col N="52" /> without any prior consultation with the IVEA?  The IVEA responded to the amendments that were circulated at the end of last year.  There was no further consultation with them.  Other bodies did have consultations with the Department in relation to the changes.  I would like the Minister to clarify why the IVEA were not consulted.  Until the publication of the 40 amendments last Wednesday they understood that the Bill would go forward as it had been published and as amended by the amendments of the then Minister, Deputy Davern.  The IVEA are the body representing employers who are part of a democratic process which provides for the only such educational group in this country.  I should respond to Deputy Higgins' statement that the vocatioal education comittees deal essentially with second level education.  Certainly I would not agree with him in that respect. The proof lies in the fact that regional technical colleges have developed to the extent they have.</P>
      <P>The Minister owes the House an explanation for the non-consultation with the IVEA about amendment No. 96a, which deals with a fundamental point concerning the respective functions of the vocational education committees and the IVEA, which, as the Minister knows, is the body that acts on behalf of vocational education committees in conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that the concerns of the IVEA in relation to the Bill were discussed with successive Ministers for Education.  They also held discussions with officials of the Department, including the Secretary of the Department.  Furthermore, the IVEA made a written submission in this matter and their submissions were taken fully into account. The IVEA themselves stated that it was inconceivable that staff could be officers of both the colleges and the vocational education committees.  I might add that last Wednesday night, on the adjournment of Committee Stage, I met members of the IVEA with the Assistant Secretary of the Department, and once and for all I want to refute the suggestion <Col N="53" /> that the IVEA have not been met or consulted.  Indeed, every other interested group was also met and consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister did meet representatives of the IVEA last Wednesday.  However, it must be stressed that the amendments make profound changes to the Bill.  The Bill now before us, with the amendments circulated by the Minister, is certainly not the same Bill introduced by the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and progressed by the former Minister, Deputy Davern.  It became an entirely new Bill on the publication of the 40 extra amendments last week.  My point is that consultation with the IVEA did not take place before the amendments were circulated.  As I understand the matter, the IVEA made a submission to the Department but the Department did not respond to their submission.  The IVEA have made several submissions down through the years.</P>
      <P>Last week we all received amendments that were published on Wednesday morning.  Deputies contributing to the debate had to absorb those amendments very quickly and relate them to both the Bill and amendments that had been tabled previously.  It seems that other groups had access to senior departmental officials in the run-up to the drafting of the amendments but the IVEA did not. I compliment the Minister of State for meeting representatives of the IVEA on Wednesday but, with the utmost respect to the Minister of State, surely that was rather like closing the stable door after the horse had bolted.  The amendments had been published and circulated and it was obvious that they had the full support of the Government.  A great deal of consultation is necessary in respect of all levels of education and it cannot be denied that the IVEA were bypassed in the run-up to the drafting of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who have been dealing with this Bill and with the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill since their introduction did not have physical possession of the full amendments before last week. <Col N="54" /> However, it seems that some members of the news media had prior knowledge of the 40 extra amendments.  As a Deputy and as someone committed to the democratic process and to the carrying out of the proper procedures at all times, I feel that that was a negation of the rights of Members of this House.  Changes proposed in legislation should not be leaked and published in the national press before those of us dealing with the Bill in the Dáil &mdash; indeed, all Deputies &mdash; are made aware of the changes.  That action was an extremely regrettable departure on the part of the Department.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister of State became involved very late with the presentation of the Bill on Committee Stage, due to the unfortunate incapacity of the Minister.  Once again, I take the opportunity on behalf of us all to wish the Minister a speedy recovery.  I should like the Minister to put on the record of the House an explanation for the drafting of amendments that have a profound effect on the future of vocational education committees without the Minister or the Department consulting the body responsible for conciliation and arbitration on behalf of the colleges and their staffs.  As the IVEA represent the parent bodies they are the representative of the regional technical colleges.  Why were they bypassed?  Who had the ear of the Minister and who encouraged him in the direction of including the amendments, following whatever representations were made, and why was the group most affected not consulted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall first respond to the matters raised by Deputy O'Shea. The fact that the IVEA and, indeed, the Deputy himself find so many problems in relation to staff highlights the difficulties in this regard.  Formal discussions on this aspect specifically did not take place with <Col N="55" /> other interests, such as the principals. Again I point out that the IVEA met the Minister for Education before the finalisation of the amendments.  As I said, I also met the IVEA last Wednesday. The Secretary of the Department offered to meet the IVEA yesterday but they were not available for a meeting.</P>
      <P>An examination of the number of amendments that I personally have made to the Bill as a result of my meetings and of the other representations made to me and also the amendments to the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, which were published this morning and will be taken this afternoon, is a further indiction of my goodwill towards the IVEA and of the steps we have taken to try to satisfy many of their needs.  That is indicative of what will happen the Bill on Report Stage.  The process of consulation has taken place.  As I said, the Minister for Education met the IVEA before finalisation of the amendments, the written submission was taken into consideration fully, the secretary offered to meet the IVEA yesterday and, as we all know, having been members of the House for a long time, the IVEA, like any other group, know how to lobby Members of the House.  Their message has come across loud and clear to me over the weekend and since.</P>

      <P>I am glad and satisfied that adequate and full consultation was given by the Minister and his Department to all the interested parties.  However, it is regrettable that amendments must be tabled at the last minute.  On a matter of clarification, will the director and staff be employed by the Department of Education or the vocational education committee? Will this amendment mean a change of status in the vocational education committees as employers of the director and staff?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to clarify that point.  It was provided in the Bill introduced by the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, that the vocational education committee would <Col N="56" /> appoint staff as officers and servants of the college.  The college were to be the employer and the vocational education committee links were only for the purposes of certain provisions of the VEA Bill, mainly relating to suspensions and dismissals.  In effect, staff were being treated as vocational education committee staff for purposes of pension and dismissal procedures.</P>

      <P>Section 9 (1) states: &ldquo;The vocational education committee shall, subject to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Third Schedule to this Act, on the recommendation of the governing body of a college and subject to the approval of the Minister, appoint to the college in a whole-time capacity a person to be the director of the college&rdquo;.  In other words, there would be a recommendation from the governing body to the vocational education committee and, therefore, the governing body would decide essentially who the director would be; that would be sent to the vocational education committee and approved by them, it would then receive the imprimatur of the Minister. From the point of view of semantics, from the point of view of vocational education committees, the strong representations which the Minister received from the IVEA, and the recognition of the contribution which the vocational education committees make to third level education &mdash; I take the point that they are a vital element and component in this regard &mdash; will the Minister agree to withdraw this amendment and allow the original section 9 (1) to stand?</P>

      <P>I will point out the reasons for the change; it is agreed on all sides that colleges should have autonomy, we have been saying that consistently and we should not lose sight of it.  Indeed, sometimes, I wonder if we are losing sight of it.  The fact that colleges appoint their own staff is an important, essential element of this autonomy.  The recommendation of the vocational education committee in this case was one without any discretion, the vocational education committee could do nothing <Col N="57" /> except appoint the person recommended by the governing body.  It has been widely agreed that there was a fundamental ambiguity in the fact that staff were employed in vocational education committees and colleges at the same time. This amendment seems to clear up this matter.  The role of the vocational education committee is very well covered by giving colleges the necessary autonomy to get on with the job, including the appointment of staff.</P>

      <P>In this amendment we are dealing with the same theme which we have been debating all through Committee Stage, the extent to which the vocational education committee should be involved in matters relating to the colleges, the extent to which the Minister should be involved or the extent to which the governing bodies should have freedom of autonomy.  While we have been debating those issues in the House I have been informed that, this morning, the Taoiseach informed his parliamentary party that it is now intended to defer Report Stage of this Bill to allow for a further period of consultation with educational interests, particularly in relation to the role of the vocational education committees.  I have also been informed that it is intended to introduce a further set of amendments to this Bill at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members asked for a deferral of the Committee Stage debate over the past couple of days.  To deal with the Minister's amendments in relation to the vocational education committees, is a waste of time and a nonsense exercise. The decision of the Minister to excise the vocational education committees from a whole range of areas in relation to the regional technical colleges is, apparently, now to be the subject of further discussions &mdash; quite properly, since those discussions had not taken place in the first instance &mdash; with educational interests over the coming period.  In response to that apparently a further set of amendments will be introduced in this House. Therefore, the amendment introduced <Col N="58" /> by the Minister may not be included in the final version of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill was originally introduced, we then had the mark II Bill and the Minister for Education, Deputy Seamus Brennan, tabled a whole series of amendments excising the role of the vocational education committees.  Apparently, as a result of this morning's meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, there will be mark III Bill.  It is like the Maastricht Treaty, we are debating something that may not come to pass.  I appreciate that the Minister of State may not be aware of the facts but this debate is absurd and perhaps in the lunch break the Minister will find out whether we are debating the real colleges Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a bombshell to those of us involved in the colleges Bill which has gone through so many stages. First, the Bill was presented, amendments were introduced by the former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, further amendments were introduced on 3 June and again today.  However, we now hear that further amendments will be introduced.  We are doing the regional technical colleges a disservice by not being able to proceed with a Bill relating to them without introducing so many amendments.  Deputy Gilmore said it resembled the Maastricht Treaty, I had just said the same to my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins.  It is about time the Taoiseach dealt with something in a straightforward manner without procrastination and making up his mind day by day on every issue which comes before us.  I can imagine the consternation of the staff and students in the regional colleges when this news is relayed to them.  It is devastating for those Members who have put so much work into the amendments and who are also working in the best interests of third level education.  It certainly raises the issue of the use of the valuable time of this House.  It must be pointed out that the Taoiseach created the mess and it is regrettable, in the interests of education, to have such a bombshell dropped.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the social welfare system which prevents an unemployed person in receipt of unemployment benefit from receiving such benefit while attending a ten-week language course after which a job would be offered; his views on whether the availability for work regulation in such cases is an impediment to job creation; and the plans, if any, he has to change this outdated system.</Quest>

      <P>Under social welfare legislation a person must be available for, genuinely seeking and capable of work in order to be eligible for receipt of an unemployment payment.  Prior to 1986, persons attending courses of education did not generally satisfy the availability condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years considerable flexibility has been introduced into the system in order to encourage unemployed persons to take advantage of educational opportunities with a view to their return to the labour market.  The vocational training opportunities scheme now operates in 53 centres nationwide with almost 900 persons participating.  While on the scheme the person is paid an allowance equivalent <Col N="60" /> to his or her unemployment payment. Persons may also attend other second level type courses without infringing the availability for work condition. In addition, a pilot scheme exists which allows unemployed people to pursue courses at third level while participation in part-time courses is also encouraged by my Department.</P>
    <P>The entire issue of providing encouragement to unemployed people to take up courses of education and training is being reviewed in the context of the area-based response to long term unemployment which is currently being piloted in 12 areas throughout the country under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that the unemployment payments schemes do not become a form of additional subsidy for people undertaking courses of education generally.  I am anxious, however, that every facility be afforded to genuinely unemployed people, and particularly the long term unemployed, to improve their situation and to avail of opportunities to get back into gainful employment.  The question as to what further incentives might be provided in the area of education courses will be considered in the light of the outcome of the schemes already in operation.  The prospects of, and success rate in, obtaining employment arising from the course of education in question will be one of the factors to be taken into account in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I tabled this question is that I want to illustrate how a young man was deprived of a job. Having being made redundant he was in receipt of unemployment benefit but was guaranteed a job provided he attended a ten weeks' language course.  He asked the Department to transfer his unemployment benefit payments from Galway to Dublin and was told that not alone could this not be done but because he would not be available for work while attending the ten weeks course he would not be entitled to receive his payments. All I can say to the Minister is that his answer reads very hollow for people like <Col N="61" /> him.  He was not in a position to pay for digs in Dublin and meet the cost of the course at the same time.  If there was flexibility in the system he would now be working and would not needlessly have to draw unemployment benefit for another year and a quarter in Galway at the tax-payers' expense.  May I ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Prior to that date there was little or no flexibility but since 1986 people have been allowed to take part in full-time and part-time education courses.  The schemes will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.  I am not aware of the case to which the Deputy referred but if he gives me the details I will have the case reinvestigated. In general, we have learned from our experience of the schemes that we have operated since 1986.  The schemes are reviewed each year with a view to introducing greater flexibility into the system.

      <P>Although there is no provision for obtaining a divorce in Ireland the law does recognise foreign divorces in certain circumstances.  In deciding an application for a widow's pension where a foreign divorce is involved, the Department must be satisfied that the applicant is a widow under the laws of the State before her application can be entertained.  The legal provisions relating to foreign divorces are to be found in the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, and not in social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>If a divorce is recognised in Ireland then the wife from whom the man is divorced cannot be regarded as his widow on his death and she cannot qualify for widow's pension.  In these circumstances if the husband has re-married then his second wife could qualify for pension in the event of his death.  If the divorce is not recognised in Ireland then his first wife is his widow and she may qualify for widow's pension.  In all these cases, qualification for widow's pension would be subject to the normal qualifying criteria under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1989 to extend the widows (non-contributory) pension scheme to cover widowers with dependent children.  This scheme was replaced by the lone parents allowance scheme in the Social Welfare Act, 1990 which made provision for the various categories of lone parents, including widowers with dependent children.</P>
      <P>The 1979 EC Directive on equal treatment of men and women in matters of social insurance did not apply to widows and old age pensions.  Accordingly, the issue of arrears does not arise.</P>
      <P>The issue of extending social insurance cover to widowers could arise, however, for consideration in the context of proposals published in 1987 by the EC Commission for the adoption of a further directive aimed at extending the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women to the remaining areas of social security including pensions.  The EC is continuing its examination of these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of social insurance cover for widowers is also being examined by <Col N="64" /> the National Pensions Board in the context of the proposals for a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's report shortly.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the extension to widowers of the present social insurance arrangements for widows would cost an estimated £25 million in a full year and clearly would have considerable budgetary implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it directly to the Minister that widowers are and continue to be discriminated against. Would he agree that it is very difficult for a widower who, on the death of his wife, may be left with three, four or five children? Furthermore, would he agree that, because there is no contributory widowers pension, resulting in there being no dependant allowances, a widower is placed at a particular disadvantage? Would the Minister tell all widowers, when we can expect to have this problem redressed?</P>

      <P>This matter was raised with me in the past week by the Association of Widowers and Separated Fathers' Association.  The reply I gave them was that I will await the final report of the National Pensions Board which, among other things, will address this matter.  Since the EC Commission proposed a directive aimed at extending the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women to the remaining areas of social security, including pensions, nothing further has happened in that regard.  The Deputy asked me directly whether I considered this was discriminatory against widowers.  The history of this matter must be examined. When the widows pension scheme was introduced the ethos at the time would have been that it would have been women who would suffer more severely when their husbands died.  That is how the widows pensions schemes came into being.  Over the years there has been a change of ethos, or whatever one likes to call it.  I would have to say that, on face value, it is now discriminatory that widowers do not qualify for a contributory <Col N="65" /> pension.  Of course, since the Social Welfare Act, 1990 they qualify for lone parents allowance, the same as anybody else. On the question of a contributory pension, I will await the report of the National Pensions Board.  There are cost implications of the order of £25 million in a full year.  After the National Pensions Board report we might be in a position to do something about it within budgetary considerations.</P>

      <P>Do I detect a note of concern on the part of the Minister, that if widowers resorted to the legal process right up to the EC Court of Justice, as did women in recent years, they might find they were entitled to retrospective payments also?  Would the Minister agree that it might be better for the Government to face up to the issue at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so because the 1979 EC Directive on equal treatment of men and women in matters of social insurance did not cover this issue.  It would be a foolish person now-adays who would attempt to anticipate a court decision, as we have learned in other areas.  It is my belief that the Department have fairly good grounds for defending this action because with the stamp, as it was known, or the PRSI contribution, as it is now known, there is built in part of the rate which allows people to have a widow's pension.  Therefore, people who would have been paying stamps over the years, in theory, would not have been paying for a widower's pension.  I do not think it can be justified on those grounds.  In fairness &mdash; while awaiting the final report of the National Pensions Board &mdash; we hope that something would be done to equalise it.  I do not think we would lose a case &mdash; I say that with tongue in cheek &mdash; in the courts in that regard because there would not have been a contribution made by way of the former stamp or present PRSI contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of arrangements made in 1986 for implementing EC Directive 79/7 on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security, the then Government put in place a number of temporary alleviating payments.  The purpose of these payments was to reduce the impact of losses arising where a spouse no longer qualified as an adult dependant.</P>
      <P>These alleviating payments, initially £20 per week for a person whose spouse was receiving a social welfare payment in her own right and £10 per week, plus half rate increases for children, where the spouse has income of over £50 per week from employment, were made from November 1986 for a period of one year.</P>
      <P>During 1987, the Government decided to continue the alleviating payments beyond the 12 month period set by the previous Government but they would be phased out over a period of time.  Phasing out began in 1988 with the payments being gradually reduced each year to their present level of £12 and £6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced in the context of this year's budget, the Government have approved the introduction of retrospective legislation arising from the delay by the then Government in implementing the 1979 Directive.  Accordingly, married women who were affected by the delay will have equal treatment arrangements applied to them retrospectively from the deadline for implementation of the directive, December 1984, to the actual dates of implementation in May and November 1986.  In 1992 £22 million has been provided for these payments which will be <Col N="67" /> made on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994.</P>
    <P>However, arising from recent decisions of the European Court of Justice, it has emerged that the alleviating payments, which offset the effects of the equal treatment legislation, are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment and cannot be continued.  Therefore, these payments are being discontinued with effect from 30 July 1992, coinciding with the date of implementation of this year's budget increases.  Many of the families affected by the discontinuance of these payments will be entitled to payments under the retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>The retrospective legislation which is being provided for by way of statutory instrument under the European Communities Act will be made within the next few days.  Full details of the overall package will be announced at that time.</P>

I want to place on record &mdash; arising from what the Minister said &mdash; that many old age contributory pensioners will be £6 per week worse off from 29 or 30 July next than they had anticipated.  I should have thought that the Minister would have continued to phase the alleviating payments out by £1 per year until they were eliminated. Would he agree that what this means is that several old age contributory pensioners will lose approximately £750 over the next five years which is not fair to that category of people?</P>

Indeed, the Deputy and I were Members of this House in 1986 when there were votes when different issues arose.  This has had a long, chequered history.  The alleviating payments <Col N="68" /> were meant to be just that and were not meant to obtain for ever.  As announced in the budget, the Exchequer will be contributing £22 million to the retrospective element of this legislation. I have to take into account also the recent European Court of Justice decision that the alleviating payments themselves are in conflict with the legislation and are being done away with from July.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I am, indeed, well aware of the trauma, loss and disruption of family circumstances suffered on the death of a spouse.  Where the spouse is in receipt of a long term social welfare benefit or pension, payment continues for a period of six weeks after the death.  A contributory widow's pension based on either the deceased person's insurance or the widow's insurance, regardless of their income, is payable.  A means-tested non-contributory widow's pension is paid where the conditions for a contributory pension are not satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes operated by my <Col N="69" /> Department, which comprise free travel, free electricity allowance, free gas &mdash; bottled and natural &mdash; free telephone rental and free television, are estimated to cost the Exchequer approximately some £77 million in this year.</P>
    <P>Free travel is available to all persons, including widows, aged 66 years and over and to persons under that age who are blind or in receipt of certain social security type payments.  Entitlement under the other free schemes administered by my Department is confined to the elderly or permanently incapacitated who are receiving certain social security type payments and who are either living alone or only with excepted persons.  Widows who satisfy these conditions qualify for entitlement.</P>
    <P>The extension of those schemes to additional categories of persons, such as widows not eligible at present for a variety of reasons, would have significant financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many women, after the trauma of losing their husbands, find themselves in a much worse position financially than they had been prior to the death.  For instance, take free travel, had their husbands been over 66 years of age and the wives under 66, under certain circumstances it is possible that both spouses could travel together with the wife as a companion, and after the death the wife finds she is not allowed free travel.  There are many other aspects of this.  Surely there must be a compassionate view that could be shown particularly for a period after the death to ensure that widows are given every chance to overcome their great human tragedy.</P>

The points have been made previously to my predecessors.  In fairness, my predecessors <Col N="71" /> improved the situation over the years.  Perhaps further improvement can be brought about but the cost is pretty significant.  I will take Deputy Browne's suggestions on board.</P>

      <P>The processing of social welfare appeals and of the Department's claims and payments generally was given constant and particular attention throughout the recent disruption to postal services and as a result there were relatively few delays of any kind experienced by social welfare clients.  Now that the service is returning to normal, this attention will continue to be given by the social welfare appeals office and by my Department to ensure that any backlogs of correspondence or claims which may have been withheld with be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the staff of my Department and to both management and workers in An Post for their appreciation of the difficulties which were faced by social welfare clients and for the special efforts they made to ensure that payments continued to be made in time and that any difficulties were reduced to the absolute minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards disability benefit appeals in particular, oral hearings throughout the country outside of Dublin continued to take place as normal throughout the recent disruption to postal services.  In Dublin only a handful of cases appeared to have been delayed due to difficulties in delivering notifications.  An examination of the total number of new appeals registered during the dispute was only slightly lower than the normal intake which would indicate that there is not any substantial number of appeals awaiting lodgment. However, I have asked the social <Col N="72" /> welfare appeals office to ensure that any cases experiencing delay should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am surprised at the Minister's reply but let me join with him in paying tribute on behalf of my own party, and I am sure like sentiments will be expressed by all sides of the House, to the postal workers for the manner in which they dealt with people on social welfare.  It was a great example of good trade union spirit and I am sure that is appreciated by the general public. Is the Minister aware that my information is that appeals were suspended in Dublin particularly, and elsewhere, because of the regulation which outlines that they must be sent by registered post and that was not possible during the period of the dispute?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the information available in my Department. Examination of the figures would indicate that there will be a slight drop in the number of appeals hearings etc. I, too, would like to thank the postal workers and particularly the staff of the Department of Social Welfare who worked long hours, some of them coming in as early as 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. to ensure that the system was manned as effectively as possible to get over the problems of the postal dispute.  I want to thank also the postal workers who co-operated in ensuring that social welfare recipients were not disadvantaged in any way.  It is only fair to place my remarks in that regard on record.</P>
      <P>I can give Deputy Bell some figures showing part of the difficulties experienced in Dublin.  There were no problems for the rest of the country.  We had advertisements in the papers telling people how they could lodge their appeals, etc. The figures seem to indicate that on a rolling monthly basis we do not have a serious backlog as a result of the postal dispute.  The social welfare appeals office will be taking the matter in hand in any event.  That is the information available to date.</P>

A similar question has been put down to other Ministers.  I do not think this question is really relevant to the Department of Social Welfare.  The person appointed to the National Pensions Board replaced a person who had moved on.  In the case of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Pensions Board, there is provision in the legislation for the disclosure by members of the board of their interests.  The chairperson of all semi-State boards have been asked to comply with the provisions of the guidelines issued recently by the Minister for Finance.

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will amend supplementary welfare allowance regulations to deal with the anomalous situation highlighted by the postal dispute, whereby the spouses and children of workers whose wages were not paid for several weeks were denied supplementary welfare allowance because they were still technically in employment, while the dependants of workers who were suspended qualified for support; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The entitlement of a person involved in a trade dispute to a payment of supplementary welfare allowance is governed by section 203 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  This section provides that a person who is without employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute at his place of employment is not entitled to an allowance in his own right but may be paid an allowance in respect of his dependants.  Persons in employment are not entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the recent postal dispute, which affected postal employees in the Eastern Health Board area, the board refused to pay supplementary welfare allowance to persons who remained full-time employees of An Post but who were not paid because of the problems which arose in their wages department.  The board took the view that these employees were precluded from receipt of supplementary welfare on foot of section 202 (1) of the Act and that the problem was <Col N="76" /> an administrative one between them and their employers.</P>
    <P>Amendment of the legislation, to include persons who are in employment, would have major financial implications for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I have no plans at present to introduce such an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me understand why amendment of the legislation to include persons who are in employment would have major financial implications for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme as repayments are recouped by the Department when the salaries are ultimately released to the workers.  I ask the Minister to elaborate further on the financial implications to which he refers.  As the Minister is aware, during the recent dispute in An Post 700-800 employees worked normally.  These workers are entitled to their salaries in any case.  However, the families of these workers had to go hungry in the meantime and their mortgage repayments accumulated.  Does the Minister not agree that the wives and families of postal workers who went to work for three or four weeks and got no wages and the lives and families of postal workers who were suspended have the same requirements? The supplementary welfare allowance scheme should be amended to eliminate this anomaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme caters for cases of exceptional need.  There is provision under the scheme to allow payments to be made to dependants of striking workers, which the Eastern Health Board did during the recent dispute.  However, the workers do not receive a payment.  I do not intend to change the legislation in this regard.  I am open to being convinced in regard to different aspects of life but I am not convinced that it would be appropriate to amend the 1981 Act to get over the problems to which the Deputy has referred.  The dependants of workers are covered and the health board can make payments to them but not to the workers on strike.  As I have said, I have not <Col N="77" /> been convinced that I should amend the legislation.</P>

      <P>This is an ongoing problem; every time there is a dispute there is a problem with the payment of supplementary welfare allowances.  Irrespective of what the 1981 Act says, I suggest to the Minister that the wife and children of a worker should automatically be covered once a strike takes place, and any question of qualification should be taken up by the spouse of the striking worker by applying to the employment exchange.  Will the Minister consider those proposals?</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme was set up to cater for the exceptional needs of people. Even though many supplementary welfare allowance payments are made when there are delays in the issuing of cheques by the Department of Social Welfare, I am endeavouring to get back to the situation where supplementary welfare allowances will only be paid in cases of exceptional need.  Community welfare officers pay supplementary welfare allowance to people in substitution for social welfare payments.  When these people eventually get their money the amount they receive by way of a supplementary welfare allowance has to be subtracted.  There is a great deal of bureaucracy in this system.  Community welfare officers have the power to pay supplementary welfare allowances in cases of exceptional need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to put into perspective my comments on the future funding of social welfare services during the Fifth Conference of European Ministers for Social Security which I had the honour to host in Limerick three weeks ago.  The conference was held under the aegis of the Council of Europe.  The theme of the conference was &ldquo;Social Security and the Labour Market&rdquo; and it is not surprising, therefore, that the issue of the future funding of social welfare services should be raised in that context.</P>
      <P>There is a clear commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to protect social welfare rates against inflation and to endeavour to improve as the resources of the economy grow.  This Government have honoured that commitment.  The question of further increases in rates is a matter for consideration at budget time in the light of available resources.</P>
      <P>My comments at the conference were directed at drawing attention to a common feature of social security spending which is being experienced by governments across Europe.  That trend is reflected in an increasing financial burden arising from factors such as rising unemployment and the ageing of the population. I made the point that we in Ireland are no different.  In our situation, our rate of unemployment is unacceptably high and is a major constraining factor on the development of our economy.  It follows, therefore, that with our rising number of unemployed and the high dependency rate inherent in our demographic situation we will find it more and more difficult to fund an increasing level of social welfare expenditure, without an improvement in the economic and financial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My comments in this regard are not new.  I made the same point during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1992, some weeks ago.  What I said at that time was that the notion that social security in this country was self-financing was a myth.  Employers and employees pay into what is called the social insurance fund <Col N="81" /> but the Exchequer also makes a very large contribution to that fund which makes good the deficit between what is received by way of contributions and what is paid out in benefits and pensions. The size of the Exchequer contribution this year will be £143.6 million as in the published Estimates for my Department.</P>
    <P>In terms of the problems facing us in the future, we need to consider whether a fundamental review of our social security systems is necessary, which will address the question of targeting our scarce resources to those most in need.  In addition, we need to deal with the problems caused by the sheer complexity, range and multiplicity of our social welfare schemes by simplifying and streamlining the system so that it can be more easily managed and understood.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently examining those issues.  I am preparing proposals at present for simplifying and streamlining the various means tests for social assistance schemes with a view to the introduction of one unified social assistance scheme.  The question of the links between social welfare and the taxation system and the scope for closer integration of the two systems is also under examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad my colleague, Deputy Stagg, put down this question because it afforded the Minister an opportunity of explaining the statement he made.  I realise he made that statement during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, but it sent shock waves throughout the country.  It was interpreted by the public at large, particularly the unemployed, that there would not be enough money to pay them, or that social welfare payments would be reduced.  Would the Minister indicate quite clearly that that is not what he meant by the statement which was reported in the national media?  Would he give an assurance to the unfortunate people who are on social welfare because we are not providing jobs for them that no such intention was envisaged in his remarks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about <Col N="82" /> people outside this House being surprised at what I said in Limerick people who were here during the Social Welfare Bill should not have been in the least surprised.  As I have said on a number of occasions, particularly during discussion on the Social Welfare Bill in this House and in Seanad Éireann, with gross expenditure in my Department in excess of £3,360 million for this year, with unemployment at such high levels, with an ageing population and higher dependency, with approximately &mdash; I am subject to correction on this figure &mdash; 1,384,000 people covered by single weekly payments and only about 1.4 million people paying into the PRSI fund, one would not need to be an economist of the Doheny and Nesbitt school, of UCD or any other university to realise that in the future, unless the economy grows at an enormous rate, Ministers for Social Welfare will have to target resources in the system.</P>
      <P>As I said during Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, we can stand on high ground, put up our hands and say we will have this present social security system forever and that we will die for it, but the day will come when we will not be in a position to pay pensions to the old and people at the end of the market.  Alternatively, we can make some effort to look at the whole social security system as it is funded at present.  Greater and large economies than ours in Europe have found it impossible to continue with their social welfare systems for the very same reasons of unemployment, ageing and so on.  We can sit on our high horses and say we will put up with the system as it is and do nothing about it but, as I have said on many occasions, I am not prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>We all agree that the problem basically is not with social welfare but with unemployment.  I hope the Minister makes as strong a case to his colleagues in Cabinet as he has made here to ensure that people get back to work.  People do not wish to be on social welfare and we should not create the impression that because they are on unemployment benefit they are receiving charity.  Would the Minister indicate whether we will receive assistance from the European Community in terms of the Maastricht Treaty which might help to get some of these people back to work, thereby reducing the bill he is talking about?</P>

      <P>Money is received to deal with the whole area of educational opportunities.  As the Deputy knows, there are various schemes in operation regarding training and so on.  I will get the information requested by the Deputy, on European funding, but at present my Department do not benefit in this regard. We receive funding under various programmes for women but we do not receive direct funding for unemployment schemes.  As I said yesterday in my speech on the Maastricht debate, EC funding may be provided in future as a result of the Maastricht Treaty to deal with unemployment and other problems, and that is something that can be considered.</P>

I hope the Minister is not saying that this is the best the Government can do in this regard.  As Deputy Bell pointed out we should start with the creation of employment. I hope the Minister will clear the air for the thousands of people who have worked extremely hard and paid their stamps and PRSI and expect a return in their old age.  If one is to judge from leaked comments on the dental scheme there will be a surcharge of 30 or 40 per cent for services rendered, on top of the PRSI contribution.  With all the straight talk the Minister is doing, it is time he cleared the air on where people stand with regard to their rights.  It is one thing to talk about the money in the kitty running out but it is very difficult to explain this to a family on the lowest rate of unemployment benefit, through no fault of their own, when on the other hand two Greencore inspectors can get £500,000 for a couple of months work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a retirement pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 24 contributions registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or the time they started insurable employment if later.</P>
      <P>Generally a person who had 40 full years contributions would be likely to qualify for a full contributory pension when they reach the age of 65.  If, however, a person was allowed the option of retiring with full contributory pension when they completed 40 years contributions, people could qualify for a full pension from the age of 56 upwards, depending on their age of entry into insurance.</P>
      <P>Any proposals which would allow for payment of pensions before the age of 65 would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the whole area of conditions for entitlement to pensions, including the question of pension age, is among the issues being examined at present by the National Pensions Board in the context of their final report on the future development of pensions generally.  I expect to receive the board's final report shortly.  Any changes in the contribution conditions for pensions will be considered in the light of the board's recommendations in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is a cost implication to the request, but I am sure the Minister will agree that many people have made major contributions to their employment and to their employers over 40 years and that they deserve to enjoy the years of their retirement, and should be given the opportunity to do so.  If <Col N="88" /> a number of people were allowed early retirement it would release a large number of jobs.  There would be a cost factor at one end but there would be a saving at the other end in social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised an interesting point.  This matter has to be considered by the Government as a whole but there are no plans at present to reduce the pension age.  To reduce the pension age by one year would cost, it is estimated, about £30 million in a full year.  To reduce the age by the number of years the Deputy is talking about would have other cost implications.  The National Pensions Board in their report may discuss this matter.  I am awaiting their report to see what they have to say but it is very costly to reduce the pension age by even one year.  The points the Deputy put forward have been discussed over the years and perhaps the proposition can be looked at again.  I cannot give a commitment on it at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan's question is very interesting.  I have made the point over a number of years in debates on Social Welfare Bills and elsewhere.  If the retiral age could be reduced to 60 years and if social welfare recipients were in receipt of full pension, I estimate that 60,000 would be transferred from unemployment benefit, the cost of which would be substantially higher than the payment of pensions.  I have asked successive Ministers to examine this point.  If this Minister does so he will find that even if it costs £30 million in one year the savings on the other end would exceed that amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter which the Government will be discussing when looking at all areas of the unemployment problem.  It is an interesting concept. Various bodies have put forward the idea.

Surely what Deputy Deenihan means is that each <Col N="90" /> individual who has 40 years' service should be entitled to a pension.  That would have to be costed very carefully. Will the Minister withdraw the statement regarding £30 million since it is meaningless in the context of Deputy Deenihan's question?</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that detailed information in relation to all aspects of social welfare entitlements is widely and easily available.  Much progress has been made by my Department in this regard over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information leaflets on each of the schemes administered by my Department have been revised.  These leaflets contain detailed information in relation to the particular scheme.  Those which refer to means-tested payments, including unemployment assistance, provide comprehensive information on the means assessment provisions.  In addition to the information leaflets, the comprehensive <i>Guide to Social Welfare Services</i> also explains the means test provisions.  A new <Col N="91" /> edition of this guide has been published recently.  I have made arrangements for copies of the <i>Guide to Social Welfare Services</i> and the explanatory leaflet on unemployment assistance to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In relation to unemployment assistance specifically, my Department have recently introduced new arrangements for informing claimants of how their means are determined.  It is my intention that these arrangements will be extended to all other means cases.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general issue of means tests, I am currently examining the feasibility of introducing a single means test for all social assistance payments.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I look forward to the fulfilment of the promises he has made.  Would the Minister agree with the International Labour Organisation that the welfare system has grown to a vast size in a fog of public ignorance and that there is huge difficulty in understanding entitlements and in coming to terms with a most complex array of means tested schemes?  We must admit that it is a quagmire, a swamp.  We need a simple breakdown of the means testing formula.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely agree.  On many occasions in this House and outside I have stated that my intention is to have a single means test which will be the foundation stone to the single social assistance payment.  One would have to be a genius to understand the conditions and entitlements in the social welfare system.  I could envisage a person on &ldquo;Mastermind&rdquo; taking the Irish social welfare system as a specialist subject but not getting 100 per cent of answers correct. Nobody in the Department of Social Welfare would be able to list all the schemes and conditions.  I have made progress in the past few months regarding a single means test.  I have made it a priority <Col N="92" /> to streamline and simplify some of the schemes.  I hope to have proposals before the House shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea of a single means test.  I and other Deputies on both sides have been calling for this for some time but particularly this year.  Would the Minister agree that one of the serious anomalies in relation to means testing is the fact that when there is a problem regarding social welfare, recipients have to go from one Department's office to the office of another Department, perhaps at the opposite end of town?  That could be rectified if the supplementary welfare allowance were paid in employment exchanges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  When speaking at the launch of the Combat Poverty Agency's booklet on schemes of last resort I made comments in that regard. It is nonsensical to traipse around towns such as Drogheda, Naas or Newbridge looking for information.  I have outlined some proposals in this regard which are being put into effect.  If we had a single means test a person would not have to be assessed in the employment exchange and again by the social welfare officer.  It is time wasting and ineffective.  With the growth of information technology systems in the Department of Social Welfare it will be possible in the very near future, if a single means test is introduced, to eliminate many of these degrading, time consuming and very expensive procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Minister has responsibility for the area of social welfare, the question relates to a pamphlet which would cover the whole range of means tests.  The number of such tests is in excess of 50, covering social welfare, certain areas of health, education grant schemes and the free legal aid scheme.  Would the Minister use his influence at Cabinet to bring together the various Departments who have means tested schemes and push for the publication of a single booklet or pamphlet?</P>

      <P>I agree.  I intend to put the Department of Social Welfare in order before I start trying to influence others.  I agree there should be a uniform system for all State support systems and new technology should make this relatively easy.  Apart from the schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare there are other schemes administered by health boards and local authorities.  We need an integrated system.  My Department have the responsibility for the RSI numbers and they are making some progress.  I may be able in the not too distant future to put forward a proposal in this regard.  I want first to deal with the means testing problems in the Department of Social Welfare. To get a uniform system creates problems.  Much work has been done in the past two months and I hope we will be able to think up something in the very near future.</P>

She is also entitled to a free fuel allowance of £5 per week during the annual heating season.</P>
    <P>The six-week payment of adult dependant allowance is only payable where the deceased pensioner had been in receipt of an adult dependant allowance in respect of his spouse.  As the person concerned was in receipt of a carer's allowance at the time of her late husband's death, it was not possible for my Department to pay her adult dependant allowance in addition to her late husband's personal rate of pension for the six-week period following his death.</P>
    <P>I would point out that in this case the person concerned was paid a total of £3,176.50 by way of carer's allowance in lieu of £2,688 by way of increases on her deceased husband's pension which would otherwise have been payable.</P>
    <P>Any change in the conditions governing entitlement in these cases would have cost implications and I will have them reviewed in the context of next year's budget.</P>

      <P>None of us likes to raise personalised cases such as this in the House but an anomaly exists in that the woman in question ceased to get the carer's allowance from the day her husband died.  Had she not been in receipt of the carer's allowance she would have received six weeks payment, not just of her husband's pension but of a dependant's allowance.  In actual fact, she received neither the carer's allowance for those six weeks nor the dependant's allowance.  I think the Minister can see the anomaly.  She feels she has been victimised and she has been.  Perhaps the Minister would rectify that anomaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined this case and I recognise the anomaly.  I cannot do anything at the present time for this person.  The reason for the anomaly is that prior to 4 April 1990 the payment of a six-weeks pension was only awarded when the deceased was receiving an increase in respect of a dependent spouse.  Under section 33 of the Social Welfare Act, 1990, this payment was <Col N="95" /> extended to cover persons in respect of whom an adult dependant increase would have been payable but for the fact that the adult dependant was not in receipt of old age, non-contributory or blind pension in his or her own right.  However, these provisions did not provide for the six-weeks payment if the dependant was in receipt of the carer's allowance as this allowance was only introduced on 1 November 1990.  I am prepared to say that in the context of next year's budget I will correct that particular anomaly.  I think that would only be fair because the cost implications must be very small.</P>

      <P>Measurements are taken regularly of the times taken to process the very large numbers of claims lodged with the Department under each of its various schemes.  These measurements show that there has been an improvement since the beginning of the year in the average times taken to investigate and determine applications for virtually all of the non-contributory social welfare schemes.  For instance there has been an improvement of almost three weeks in the case of old age pensions, over two weeks in the case of lone parents payments and almost one week in the case of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements relate to overall <Col N="96" /> average times taken to process claims which may not reflect temporary disimprovements in particular situations. Nevertheless any slowing down of processing times in any area is given immediate attention.</P>
    <P>My Department are actively working to introduce measures designed to permit further reductions in the time taken to decide claims.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a regional management structure has helped in this regard.  All decisions on unemployment payment claims are now given in local offices of the Department rather than centrally.  The recruitment of additional investigative staff and an arrangement whereby claimants, whose cases appear straightforward, are interviewed at the Department's local offices rather than in their homes, is helping to reduce the average time taken to put claims into payment.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Can the Minister explain why he said there was an improvement of two weeks?  If it is an improvement from a six months delay to four months and three weeks, or some such time, can the Minister defend that it takes a minimum of six weeks, or perhaps two months, before an official call to the claimant?  Obviously, those who have applied need the money.  It may take a further six weeks to process the claim.  Is it fair that it should take that length of time even though the Minister says there is an improvement but I do not think there is?</P>

      <P>I suppose the answer to this question is that there are lies, damn lies and statistics.  To put it another way, if you are chronically ill with the 'flu you may improve but you are still sick. I think the Deputy has unemployment assistance in mind.  There has been an improvement since January 1992, but since May 1991 there has been a disimprovement. The major constraining factor is that there are so many thousands of people on unemployment assistance. There has been an overall improvement since the beginning of the year but due <Col N="97" /> to the increasing numbers coming on to the live register, as everybody keeps reminding us daily in the House, further problems are created for the staff of my Department, so that it takes longer to process claims.</P>

      <P>Prior to the suspension of business the Minister of State made the point that we debated this Bill and a considerable number of amendments in great detail on Committee Stage last Wednesday and Thursday.  We have five versions of the Bill.  First, there is the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991; second, the amendments as circulated on 11 December which we took to be the final casting of the Bill; then 40 amendments circulated to us just minutes before we entered the Chamber last Wednesday, and we have another list of amendments today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has now emerged &mdash; and this is of interest to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; that a categorical assurance was given at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting today that the Report Stage of this Bill would be delayed and that the Taoiseach and the Government were willing to take on board a substantial list of amendments.  We will, therefore, have had five versions of this Bill.  This renders meaningless the exercise we are now involved in, that is, amending the Bill.  If we are to be faced in four to five weeks time with another list of amendments which will substantially <Col N="144" /> alter this Bill it makes a total mockery of the exercise we are involved in today.  We really should suspend deliberations if this is the intention.  Could we have some clarification in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absolutely amazed that Deputy Gilmore could come into the House just before the break and inform us of what took place at a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting.  Earlier, in response to Deputies in the House, I tried to outline the process of consultation that had taken place and I think everybody was happy enough that the consultation had taken place.  I further said that lobbying was obviously taking place and that members of political parties had been approached by certain organisations.  It is the most natural thing in the world that matters of concern would be raised at parliamentary party meetings.  Certainly the matters were discussed at our party meeting because Members were concerned at the direction the Bill had taken.  It was in that spirit that the response was given at the parliamentary party meeting that the amendments that I had introduced here this morning, which were widely welcomed, were the amendments referred to and that further amendments were being introduced in the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill indicating that there would be further changes on Report Stage.  That was the response that was given to concerned members at the parliamentary meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to re-state, for the record, the position in relation to the role of the vocational education committees and the amendments which I agreed to introduce in response to the views of <Col N="145" /> Members here in the House and other representations which we have received.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give colleges appropriate autonomy while defining the prospective roles of the vocational education committee and the Minister.  I want to reiterate that this Bill provides for a strong continuing role for the vocational education committees in the regional technical college sector.  They have the single largest representation on the governing body.  They have the continuing power to nominate the organisations that they consider require representation on the governing body and they have the power to approve or modify the programmes and budgets of the colleges.  I have already proposed the deletion of section 7 (5) and this has been widely welcomed in the House.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, concern has been expressed in the House and through representations to me that the role of the vocational education committee has been written out of the Bill or, at best, considerably diminished.  I think that I have demonstrated that this is clearly not the case.  However, as I have stated, I am prepared to further clarify the position in the following important respects.  I have already undertaken to come back on Report Stage regarding the Minister appointing ordinary members on the recommendation of the vocational education committee.  I will be accepting an amendment from Deputies Higgins and Ahearn on section 3 (3) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill to the effect that the vocational education committee may make recommendations with regard to other institutions to be covered by that Act and I will be introducing a corresponding amendment to the Regional Technical Colleges Bill on Report Stage. I am also proposing to accept amendment No. 145 from Deputies O'Shea and Garland to substitute &ldquo;approved&rdquo; for &ldquo;determined&rdquo; in relation to the format of the operational programmes in section 13 (1) and amendment No. 149 from the same Deputies and Deputy Mac Giolla to delete &ldquo;with the agreement of the Minister&rdquo; from section 14 (2).</P>
    <P>The Bill, however, has to strike a balance <Col N="146" /> between this role, the role of the Minister and the objective of establishing these colleges as third level educational institutions with the necessary authority to manage their affairs as intended in line with all other third level institutions.  It is a balance which I believe all sides of the House wish to see.  It is, however, a delicate balance and I believe that the position, as I have now outlined it, is the best way of achieving it.  This is the context in which discussion took place at the parliamentary party meeting and the proposals I have set out are the ones I will be coming back to on Report Stage. I hope that clarifies the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that all that clarifies is that this Committee Stage debate has become one great waste of time.  This House has, on a number of occasions, debated the relationship between the vocational education committees, the governing bodies, the regional technical colleges, the Minister and so on.  Various views have been expressed here about the balance to be struck, as the Minister of State has said. We thought a balance had been struck when the former Minister for Education, Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, introduced the Bill to the House.  Again we thought a balance had been struck when her successor, Minister Davern, introduced a varied version of it.  The balance was torpedoed by the set of amendments landed upon us after a bank holiday weekend, with Deputies being given little or no time to consider them. The effect of those amendments was to completely transform the Bill as it relates to vocational education committees and we are now dealing with one of those amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I raised the matter of the information that had come to me that while we were in the Chamber debating the detail of the Bill, and while the Minister of State was here defending the revised Bill, commitments were being given to the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting that the Bill would be changed.  As it happens, I am pleased <Col N="147" /> that those commitments are being given because the Bill as it stands and as it relates to the vocational education committees is certainly not acceptable.  Neither is it acceptable that we should carry on an absolute farce by engaging in a debate here the purpose of which is to pass the Bill through the Oireachtas, while another meeting is taking place elsewhere in which commitments are being given that the Bill will again be changed on Report Stage.  That completely undermines this Committee Stage debate.  At various stages since the Committee Stage debate was scheduled for several days' debate each of the parties on this side of the House have asked that it be postponed because it was scheduled to take place without the Green Paper having been published and without the presence of the Minister who apparently authored the set of amendments that have caused so much grief here.  The debate is now taking place under the absurdity that it is is acknowledged that the legislation will be changed in some shape or form.  I consider that it would be best to abandon this debate now and to return to it when we know what exactly the Government's policy is in relation to the Bill and what exactly the Government's plan is for regional technical colleges. We have heard three or four different versions of Government policy. That is no way to put legislation through this House.  The attitude taken by the Government on this Bill treats the House with absolute contempt.  I resent it, I reject it and I think that the House deserves better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing quite a number of amendments which are before the Committee.  I shall try to be more specific.  The amendments deal with the Minister's taking power away from the vocational education committees and giving it back to the Department of Education. With respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, until now I have not contributed on these amendments, some of which are mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly that the Minister of State should be able to prove that the vocational education committee management structure is inadequate or that <Col N="149" /> the vocational education committees as constituted at present have not done their jobs properly.  He has not made that case. This is a case of change for the sake of change or, worse still, of further centralisation of authority in the Department of Education.  I am totally opposed to the tenor of the ministerial amendments we are discussing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall move ahead as you have directed, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. We are dealing with the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I should like to make a brief comment by way to introduction to a point I wish to make.  When debate on the Bill started the post of director of the college was described.  We now find that the person to be appointed in charge of the college will be the director and chief officer of the college.  The term &ldquo;chief officer&rdquo; introduces into the legislation a new concept, a concept that is not dealt with in the definitions section of the Bill. I seek clarification of that term before we proceed from amendment No. 96a.  Will the director of a college in their capacity as chief officer of the college be the accounting officer of the college?  Heretofore the accounting officer would have been the chief executive officer, as I understood the position, and would be subject to audit by the Local Government Auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the new concept now introduced into the Bill signal a major change in emphasis, that the director, in the capacity of chief officer, will now assume the accountability duties that have previously resided with the chief executive officer of a vocational education committee? This query underlines the difficulties that those of us on this side of the House have had with the changes being made under different Ministers. Having been presented with amendments we have been given very little time to absorb them and relate them to other sections of the legislation.  I understand that a move is being made away from the Local Government Auditor in the direction of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If that is so, it is further reinforcement of the arguments <Col N="150" /> advanced by Deputies on this side of the House that in terms of accountability the principle of subsidiarity, which is such an important element of the Maastricht Treaty, is being disregarded by the Government &mdash; by the Department of Education in this instance &mdash; and that the colleges, their control, their accountability and their responsiveness to the local community are further being removed from the ambit of local democracy and again directed towards more centralised control.  I ask the Minister to clarify what that concept embraces.  What is meant by the &ldquo;chief officer&rdquo; of a regional technical college?</P>
    <P>The source of these amendments is not very clear.  However, I do not intend going over that ground again.  Will it add to the duties and responsibilities of the director of the college?  Does it mean that there will be a further undermining of the role of the vocational education committee in relation to the colleges?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been sidetracked as a result of hearsay information picked up in the corridor by Deputy Gilmore.  I went out of my way to clarify the position and I gave a reasonable explanation.  Changes in any shape or form &mdash; to use the Deputy's words &mdash; are in the amendments introduced by me this morning as a result of concern expressed by Members in this House and in other amendments which I accepted. The only other changes are those to which I said I would refer on Report Stage.  Again, I did that at the request of Deputies who were concerned at the direction in which the Bill was going. Deputy Garland did not seem to be aware of what was going on but it would have been difficult for him to keep track of the debate as he was in and out of the House. In reply to the point made by Deputy O'Shea, the director and the chief officer will be the accounting officer.  The role of the director is also dealt with in the Third Schedule which says that the director shall control and direct the activities of the college and shall control and direct the staff of the college.  It was correctly pointed out that the role of the director <Col N="151" /> should properly be dealt with in section 9.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 9, subsection (1), lines 9 <Col N="153" /> and 10, to delete &ldquo;appointed by the governing body&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section states that each college shall have an academic council appointed by the governing body to assist it in the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the college.  The amendment is in relation to the composition of the governing body, their formulation and appointment.  Members on this side of the House felt that the academic council should not be appointed <i>in toto</i> by the governing body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>While elections are considered appropriate for representatives of staff and students on a governing body &mdash; we have already debated this &mdash; they are inappropriate in the case of an academic council.  This is evident from the functions of the academic council, for example, to design and develop courses of study and appropriate structures to implement them.  Such functions require appropriate senior academic staff and their appointment, therefore, must be left with the governing body which are ultimately responsible for the operation of the college.</P>

      <P>There appears to be a lack of clarity here.  While I would go a certain distance with the Minister of State with regard to the difference between <Col N="154" /> electing members to bodies and establishing other bodies, such as an academic council, at the same time we would like to know what is envisaged in relation to the membership of the academic council. Who will pick the members of the council and what criteria will be used?  Will it comprise the heads of departments?  The Minister of State will note that we have tabled amendments in relation to the membership of the academic council.  For example, we suggest that the members &ldquo;shall be holders of academic appointments within the college&rdquo; and &ldquo;elected by the wholetime members of the academic staff&rdquo; to ensure that they would not be handpicked.  What selection process will be used in order to determine who should be members of the academic council?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the council will comprise members of the senior academic staff, for example, heads of departments.  With regard to the student representatives, these will be selected by the students.  I have made that quite clear already.  There is no doubt that the governing body, following consultation with the heads of departments, will finalise the make-up of the academic council.  It is envisaged, however, that it will comprise heads of departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a major difficulty in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; in the section which states that &ldquo;each college shall have an academic council appointed by the governing body ...&rdquo;&mdash; the phrase Deputy Higgins is seeking to have deleted.  It seems that if the staff are to be represented on the academic council it is only fair and just that this be done by way of universal suffrage.  It is undemocratic that the governing body should nominate heads of departments to be members of the academic council as the members of the academic staff would not have a voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always had a difficulty with what <Col N="155" /> could be termed selective democracy. Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to explain why the Department consider it more appropriate to include this provision whereby people will be nominated rather than elected by way of universal suffrage.  Members of the academic staff should have a vote and the right to put their names forward.  It seems that this amounts to a negation of democracy in its true sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) (a) states:</P>
      <P>Each governing body may by regulations made under this section provide for the membership and terms of office of the academic council.</P>
      <P>We have already discussed the question of staff and student representation on the governing body and it was agreed that it was appropriate they should be elected. However, I felt this would be inappropriate in the case of the academic council for the reason that it will be their function to design and develop study courses and recommended appropriate structures. The section states that it will be a matter for the governing body to decide on the question of membership.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea raised the question of universal suffrage but it would not be appropriate to select the members of the academic council by way of universal suffrage. It has already been agreed that it is appropriate that the members of the governing body should be elected and that body in turn, following consultation, will select the members of the academic council.  I go along with Deputy Higgins's suggestion and I will clarify the matter on Report Stage and specify how the members of the academic council will be selected.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> It has been represented to me that the academic council should assist in implementing rather than implement the study courses referred to in subsection (3) (a) and similarly assist in implementing any regulations which may be made by the governing body under subsection (3) (j).  Amendments Nos. 107 and 110 replace the word &ldquo;implement&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;assist in implementing&rdquo; in these two subsections, respectively.  It was also pointed out to me that the governing bodies should implement the academic regulations made under subsection (3) (e).

      <P>Before Deputy O'Shea gives his final assent to that may I draw his attention to amendment No. 120 in my name and that of Deputy T. Ahearn which seeks to insert, in page 10, subsection (3), line 48, after &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and after such officer or servant has been given a chance to defend himself/herself&rdquo;.  Rather than just a straight suspension we are seeking to enshrine there a fundamental right, that is to have one's case heard, the right to advocate one's viewpoint, the right to <Col N="162" /> defend one's actions before being suspended. That is an elementary human right that any individual confronted by possible suspension should have, to at least be allowed defend himself or herself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I would support that principle of natural justice just outlined by Deputy Higgins.  I should like to refer to one matter briefly, that is the definition of officers and servants of the college.  I would have to say I consider the term &ldquo;servant&rdquo; to be offensive; it is Dickensian, Victorian and is the type of terminology that should be consigned to the dustbin of history.  Would the Minister explain why it is necessary to retain such terminology in a Bill such as this? Obviously we want to give the colleges as modern, a &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; an image as possible.  Referring to employees of colleges as servants in legislation appears to me to be moving back into a bygone age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputy, I would not be too pleased with the term &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo; but it is necessary for the purposes of the Superannuation Act.  With regard to the other point made by Deputy Jim Higgins, I appreciate what the Deputy seeks to do in his amendment No. 120.  I should say that the suspension issue will be elaborated further on Report Stage also.</P>

      <P>As regards an earlier reference by Deputy O'Shea to discussions between the Teachers Union of Ireland, the Minister and his officials, arising from which and from subsequent correspondence certain assurances were given to the Teachers Union of Ireland, we are dealing here with the whole contract of employment of employees of vocational education committees, now regional technical colleges and so on, <Col N="163" /> which is quite complex and involves various Acts relating to their contracts, superannuation provisions and so on. Perhaps it would be helpful if the Minister could put on the record of the House the assurances which have been given to the Teachers Union of Ireland in relation to this area, or perhaps he could put on the record the correspondence which has been given to the TUI from which I understand commitments were given that new amendments would be introduced on Report Stage dealing with the various aspects of the employment issue which had been of some concern in the TUI prior to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that, as with other groups, consultation has taken place with the TUI and as a result of those consultations they were quite satisfied that they were being provided for in this Bill.  However, the fundamental issue on staff is that the Bill provides they cannot be less well off than under existing employment.  I am glad to be able to report that to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself at a loss at this stage.  Obviously, the amendments before us are very important and crucial in relation to the staffs of the colleges.  A very pertinent point was raised by Deputy Higgins in relation to natural justice. The Minister has given us an assurance on that.  In relation to existing staff, under the new arrangement I understand that their conditions cannot be any worse than they are at present.  Does this apply categorically to new staff?  In other words, will the same pay and conditions in every sense apply to staff recruited after the establishment date?  Is there any weakness or any possibility that new staff would not be as well catered for as existing staff?  I would like a definite answer to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On a small point of clarification, I understand from what the Minister says that staffs of the colleges will not be worse off than they are under their existing employment conditions, but will existing employees of vocational education committees and new staff also carry with them into the colleges conditions in relation to the review of their employment conditions which are no less favourable than those they have at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>One final point of clarification&mdash;the conciliation and arbitration system as it exists for the colleges at present involves the IVEA as representing the employers' side, so to speak, in the context of the colleges.  Will this position remain following the establishment date of the new regime in the colleges when this Bill has passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas and become law?  Basically I am seeking clarity about how the Minister envisages the conciliation and arbitration scheme will be put in place.</P>
      <P>The other point relates to the Minister's response to me on the matter of &ldquo;officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;servants&rdquo;.  Do the Government intend to look at the superannuation legislation with a view to deleting this insulting and archaic anomaly?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Shea, it would not be the responsibility of the Minister for Education if such a move were contemplated and I do not know whether the Minister of State is disposed to answering it.  That would be the responsibility of some other Department and some other legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  As I said, it is because of the superannuation Act that that term is in the Bill.  It is similar to the position we discussed earlier in regard to the chairperson.  At this stage I cannot indicate what legislation may or may not be introduced to alter that.  The conciliation and arbitration scheme can be amended and the <Col N="165" /> employer position will be clarified in the amending scheme but that is not appropriate to the legislation at present.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (4), line 2, to delete &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;research&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment to subsection (4) substitues research assistantships for teaching assistantships in response to a concern expressed that the original clause sought to introduce a new grade of &ldquo;cut-price&rdquo; teachers.  This was not the intention.  The subsection is to make arrangements for the offering of services on a temporary, part-time or contract basis and would mainly relate to research and development activities.  The term &ldquo;research assistant&rdquo; is therefore, I think more appropriate to what is envisaged.</P>
      <P>This amendment will meet the concerns of Deputy O'Shea in amendment No. 122 and Deputies Higgins and Ahearn in amendment No. 123.  I will not therefore, be accepting those amendments.</P>

These teaching apprenticeships as previously defined in the Bill are now to be amended in the new term &ldquo;research apprenticeships&rdquo;.  Do they relate solely to college staff, or when we get into the area of research and development as is provided for under section 5 of the Bill, is there provision for extra staff to be employed as part of campus companies which can be formed under the legislation to deal with consultancy research and development and so on? Where exactly do research apprenticeships fit into the scheme of things? Are we talking here about students of the college becoming research apprentices? What in general is the concept of assistantship about here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete the word &ldquo;college&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; in section 13 (1).  The section would then read: &ldquo;The governing body shall, on or before the 1st day of March in each year, prepare and submit to the vocational education committee in such format as may be determined by the Minister from time to time, operational programmes for the next two following academic years (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the programmes&rdquo;) together with the relevant budget as proposed by the college for the following financial year&rdquo;. We discussed this issue on an earlier section and we got an assurance from the Minister in relation to the participation by the vocational education committees. We accepted the spirit of that assurance. Deputy Ahearn and I believe that the word &ldquo;college&rdquo; is too loose.  Earlier sections provide that the college shall consist of a conglomerate of various groups, composite bodies and so on.  We believe that, from the point of view of a compact unit which at the same time will be fully representative of all the interests, <Col N="172" /> it would be better to use the term &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;college&rdquo; which is a looser, broader and a more amorphous term.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 24, to delete the definition of &ldquo;the Director&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `Director' means a Director of the Institute;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as published it was proposed that the principals of the existing six City of Dublin vocational education committee colleges would, if the governing body so recommended, be appointed by the vocational education committee as <Col N="177" /> heads of college.  Such colleges would be as determined by the Minister from time to time.  Strong representations were made with regard to this proposal.  It was felt it would diminish the status of the principals as compared with their colleagues in the regional technical colleges through the use of the term &ldquo;head of college&rdquo; rather than director and through the proposal that they would be appointed only if the governing body so recommended.  I fully accept the arguments made in both respects.  It is not intended that these principals should be treated less favourably than their colleagues or that they should be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than those to which they were entitled prior to the establishment date.  This principle is provided for in section 13 but in order to clarify the intent such principals will, under the terms of this and related amendments, particularly in section 10, be known as directors of the institute and will be so appointed by the governing body.  These amendments should be welcomed in that they rightly coppenasten the position of the existing principals who have contributed so much to the development of the institute and they should also be welcomed in that, taken with amendment No. 2, defining the president, they further reflect the high status of the institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alyward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `the President' means the President of the Institute;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deletes the term &ldquo;director&rdquo; and substitutes &ldquo;president&rdquo;.  This <Col N="178" /> amendment is introduced in response to representations made with regard to the Dublin Institute of Technology, other third level institutions and the regional technical colleges.  I would refer in this regard to the Second Stage speech by the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  She referred to the formal establishment of the Dublin Institute of Technology by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee in 1978 to bring about better co-ordination of the work of the colleges, who trace their origins back to the 1880s.  She referred to the extensive range of courses at apprentice, technician, degree, professional and post-graduate levels.  She mentioned also the wider activities of the institute, including centres to provide specialised training and computer-based services to industry and an increasing involvement in research and development.  Most importantly, she referred to the fact that there are now almost 9,000 full-time and over 10,000 part-time students in the institute, making it arguably the largest third level institution in the country.</P>
    <P>For all the above reasons it was considered essential that the title of the chief officer of the institute should be consistent with the status of the institute. This change is reflected in this amendment and in amendments Nos. 29 and 44 to section 6, amendments Nos. 54, 55, 56 and 57 to section 9, amendments Nos. 78 and 87 to section 12, amendment No. 100 to section 13, amendment No. 122 to the Second Schedule and consequential amendments Nos. 124 to 128, inclusive, to the Third Schedule.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 is in the name of the Minister. Amendment No. 4 is an alternative and amendment No. 6 is consequential on amendment No. 3.  I suggest therefore <Col N="179" /> that these amendments be discussed together.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Alyward Mr. Alyward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alyward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), lines 17 to 20, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and shall comprise&rdquo; in line 17 down to and including &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; in line 20.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment to clarify the intention of the Bill to set up a single institute to be known as the Dublin Institute of technology, to be constituted from the institutions specified in the First Schedule.  Amendment No. 6 is consequential on this amendment.  Amendment No. 4 is no longer relevant consequent to my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Institute shall be constituted from the institutions specified in the First Schedule to this Act and shall comprise such and so many colleges as may be determined by the Minister, from time to time, on the recommendation of the Governing Body made following consultation with the Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment proposes to delete that subsection.  I am not so worried about the sections contained in the Schedule but I am worried about the right of the governing body to make further recommendations from time to time in relation to additional institutes.  Our amendment No. 4 states:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 19, after &ldquo;recommendation of the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Vocational Education Committee or the&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would mean that either the governing body or the vocational education committee could make a recommendation. This is very important.  This section was included in the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  Dublin is a very big city, with over a million people in the greater Dublin area.  This Bill deals with <Col N="180" /> six institutes, namely, Bolton Street, Kevin Street, Rathmines, the College of Music, the College of Marketing and Design and the College of Catering. There should be scope for further development.  Not alone should it come within the power of the governing body of the new institute set up under the Bill but it should also come within the power of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to examine whether in the future development of the city there is scope or need for a further third level institution.  It is reasonably well catered for at present, particularly on the south side, in that we have Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. In addition, we have many private third level colleges.</P>
    <P>Under the Regional Technical Colleges Bill the new regional technical college in Tallaght will shortly come on stream.  We do not have an equivalent regional technical college on the north side of the city which has not got its fair share of cothrom na Féinne in relation to third level education.  The point may be made that there is St. Patrick's Training College, the College of Technology, Bolton Street and the College of Marketing and Design, Mountjoy Square but we would make the point that there is need for an equivalent regional technical college type institution in the north city.  Provision should be made for that in the Bill.  If a regional technical college institution is identified as an elementary need for the future development of third level education in the city, either now or in the future, the subsection which the Minister is about to delete, and we seek not alone to retain but to reinforce, should at least be retained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal by the Minister is a radical move, making a finite decision which leaves little or no scope to meet educational needs as they may emerge.  If we are to allow education to evolve and, in particular, if we are to ensure that education will meet the needs of our time we have to be prepared to accept recommendations, whether from <Col N="181" /> governing bodies or from vocational education committees.  The deletion of lines 17 to 20 of section 3 (2) not only prevents recommendations coming from anybody but it curtails the Dublin Institute of Technology, consisting of six colleges, as listed in the First Schedule.  Why has the Minister taken this step?  On what evidence can be make a decision that expansion of Dublin Institute of Technology colleges will not be needed in the future?  If so does it mean we will have to have new legislation?</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is short-sighted. It does not take into account what we have learned from the past that education continually evolves over a period, that new needs emerge and that new demands have to be catered for.  We wait so long for any kind of legislation in education that when we come to the point of enacting it we should include in it scope for further development.  Not only did we welcome section 3 (2) but we wanted it expanded to include recommendations from the vocational education committee. We accept that education will change and that the needs of the future cannot be decided on the information we have today.  It would be a pity if we took any step to hinder or impede development in the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing this amendment the Minister described it as a drafting or a technical amendment.  It seems to be far from that.  I am at a loss to know what the thinking is.  Section 3 (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Institute shall be constituted from the institutions specified in the <i>First Schedule</i> to this Act...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) goes on to inform us that whenever the Minister considers it necessary, and after consultation with the vocational education committee, he can identify other institutions which will form some kind of a relationship with the institute.  It goes on to say they could be included in the First Schedule, that they could be incorporated into the institute, <Col N="182" /> become a college of the institute, or be amalgamated with an existing college.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment presents us with two alternative scenarios, first, it would leave us with subsection (2) being clearly in conflict with subsection (3), if subsection (3) means that another institution, other than the six which are already identified, could become part and parcel of the institute and have the same relationship to the institute as any of the other six.  If subsection (3) does not mean that then we have a bigger problem.  I suggest we have a bigger problem because otherwise the Minister would not have introduced this amendment.  I can only conclude that the Minister has introduced this amendment in order that the new institutions, the new colleges, would have a lesser relationship to the Dublin Institute of Technology than the existing six.  I wonder whether the amendments have a remote relationship to the amendments we discussed some minutes ago where, and rightly so, the heads of colleges are now defined as directors of the colleges, a president is to be established and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to clarify this matter because it seems that we are setting the ground for a two-speed Dublin Institute of Technology.  We would have the six existing colleges who would be part of the Dublin Institute of Technology under subsection (2) and any new college would have a lesser relationship to the Institute.  I would be concerned about that as I would be about any prospect of empire building which may be somewhere in the background in relation to the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am somewhat baffled by these amendments.  Amendment No. 6 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3), lines 29 and 30, to delete &ldquo;and shall become a College of the Institute or be amalgamated with an existing College of the Institute&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole subsection appears to be in bits.  The provision remains to introduce another educational institution, or part <Col N="183" /> of an institution, which can be included in the First Schedule.  I do not find a definition for &ldquo;college&rdquo; in the definitions section.  Deputy Gilmore asked what would be the status of the addition if it cannot become a college of the institute, as would appear to be the case from what remains of section 3 (2) and (3).  Is this a device whereby the Department can bring in another institution, or part of an institution, without having a director of such an institution.  I think these are hastily conceived amendments and that they are referred to in an agenda which has not been presented to us.  I would like clarification of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>What is in question is the creation of a single Dublin Institute of Technology.  At present the new institute will be constituted from the six major Dublin colleges which are the third level colleges of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The Bill allows for the incorporation of other educational institutions or part of an institution. I would emphasise that what is in question is to create a third level institute. It would not, therefore, be proper to include non third level schools or colleges, for example post leaving certificate courses.  Post leaving certificate courses are not third level programmes although they are very valuable.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that in relation to post-leaving certificate programmes the Minister for Education last year established a National Council for Vocational Awards.  This body is charged with establishing a comprehensive certification system for these courses.  The certification system will include appropriate credit transfer arrangements. Accordingly, students pursuing the post-leaving certificate programmes could, in due course, proceed to third level, subject to attaining the necessary standards and to the availability of places, a constraint which applies to all students. Detailed arrangements in this respect will be worked out with the new certifying body and the institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to the two subsections, section <Col N="184" /> 3 (2) deals with the existing six colleges; and section 3 (3) deals with the possibility of including other institutions if the Minister or the vocational education committee considers that such should happen.  The deletion was made on the basis that the wording was superfluous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a clear reply from the Minister to the question asked by Deputy Ahearn: why was this put in initially?  The wording was not superfluous when section 3 (2) was drafted by the Department for a previous Minister.  There was a specific intention behind the wording and that was to allow scope for future development.  I would suggest that we are talking about future development on two fronts, the possibility of existing schools coming of age, developing their PLCs to a sufficiently high standard and eventually becoming fully fledged as such, or the needs identified by the vocational education committee or the governing body of the institute in a growing capital where there will be increased demand for third level, as we exhort people to stay longer in education and participate in the third level process.  This was the intention behind this.  Why the deletion at this stage?  It was not deemed to be superfluous at the time.  For some reason or other it has now been culled from the Bill and we have a greatly watered down version. I am very much afraid that what we are talking about here is a two-speed process, the elite group consisting of the existing six &mdash; and they are an elite group and do very fine work in their fields &mdash; and any others who come on board and who could at a subsequent stage be only second cousins to the existing six.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer given by the Minister of State does not clarify the matter as raised by the Deputies on this side of the House.  Both the amendments, the amendments to section 3(2) and section 3 (3) delete the word &ldquo;college&rdquo;.  It is clear that the intention here is to provide that no further college of the institute can be provided.  Institutions or part of educational institutions could, in <Col N="185" /> certain circumstances, be added to the First Schedule of the Act.  The bottom line here is that the strategy that I believe pervaded the Regional Colleges Bill is coming to the fore here again and it is to prevent this institute from broadening and including further services, further courses that in the fullness of time, could be very important in terms of equipping students to go out into the labour market and into society generally to find their places.  There seems to be an element here of trying to do it on the cheap by removing the prospect of a further college being added to the First Schedule.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify that for me succinctly.  Do his amendments Nos. 4 and 6 prevent another college being added to the First Schedule at a future time?  If an educational institution or part of an institution is added to the First Schedule at some future date, what exactly will its status be?  In the Regional Technical Colleges Bill as presented by Deputy Davern there was a new concept of a regional college.  This is a term that was not defined.  The term &ldquo;college&rdquo; is not defined here either.  There is something very woolly and inconclusive about that.  I believe there is some definite intention here and I believe that does not relate to the growth of the institute.  We are looking for straight answers to two questions.  Do amendments Nos. 4 and 6 prevent any college being added to the institute at any future time and if, as seems to be provided for under section 3 (3), an educational institution or part of an educational institution is added to the First Schedule, what exactly would the status of that additional institution be?</P>

      <P>I was listening to the debate in my room and felt it was an appropriate time to come and share the concerns of my colleagues on this side of the House and support the case they are making.  The establishment of the Dublin Institute of Technology is very welcome. With the separation of these colleges from the activities of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, there are serious concerns about the many <Col N="186" /> valuable features that system had.  The Minister's proposal touches on this area because there is a question of whether these colleges are to be an elite and become more and more detached from the vocational education committee system and very much distanced from some of the communities that currently have very close links with the colleges. We are anxious to ensure that some of that ethos be maintained.</P>
      <P>I was at a presentation of certificates in my local vocational education committee school recently and one of the issues raised was in regard to the very close links of great value that exist and allow youngsters who would not normally think of going to third level to move through it.  If the Dublin Institute of Technology becomes so separated from what were traditionally the important schools and colleges feeding young people gradually into full third level education, it would be of concern to us on this side of the House.  We are concerned that these amendments tend towards that kind of approach to the new institute.  We are concerned that some of those links be maintained however that is achieved.</P>

      <P>First I want to emphasise that future development is not precluded. New institutions or part of new institutions can be incorporated and the Bill allows this.  Any new colleges that are incorporated would be fully integrated within the new institute and would not have second-class status.  There will not be separate colleges within the institute. This is not a federation but an integration and that is borne out in the Bill.</P>

      <P>How would this come about?  In section 3 (2) we are dealing with the initiative coming from either the governing body themselves, the umbrella organisation who are in a position to see where the needs are and whether there is overcrowding in the individual units or collectively, or from the vocational education committee who again are in a position to assess.  If a large part of section 3 (2) were deleted and the provision relied on section 3 (3), the addition <Col N="187" /> of an institute or a part of any such institute would depend on whether the Minister considered that any other educational institute or any part of any such institute should be incorporated into the institute.  Whenever the Minister was of that view, he or she would be able, by order made with the consent of the Minister for Finance following consultation with the vocational education committee and the governing body, amend the First Schedule by inserting the name of the institute or a description of the part thereof to be incorporated.  In fact, we are waiting for the Minister and for those in Marlborough Street to determine whether or not there is a need for an institute or a part of an institute to be incorporated.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House are making the very clear case that the people best fitted, best equipped and closest to reality in relation to determination of the needs would be the governing body of the institute and/or the vocational education committee.  Those two organisations, individually or collectively, would know what the needs are.  The initiative should come from that quarter.  With the rapid change of Ministers for Education that we have had of late and with the distance from reality on the part of the Department and the Minister, we would be waiting a very long time if we were to wait for the initiative to come from the Minister. Surely any initiative in that regard should be at the instigation of the people on the ground, the vocational education committee or the governing body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with two issues, which are, of course, related.  The first issue is the Minister's wish to delete part of section 3 (2).  Having listened to the Minister's two replies on the subject, I am now more convinced than ever that if what he is saying is the case, that at some stage in the future additional colleges could be added and they would be incorporated into the institute on the same basis as the existing colleges, there is no necessity for the proposed deletion. In fact, the deletion proposed by the <Col N="188" /> Minister has raised the issue of whether or not new institutions would have the same status in the institute as the existing six colleges.  The best way to deal with that problem would be for the Minister to simply withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>I very much support the amendment proposed by Deputy Higgins.  A similar debate about the Minister and the vocational education committees was held in the context of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  It would be unwise to provide that the Minister alone would have the power to designate additional institutes.  That power should be given to the vocational education committee.  I might give just one example, perhaps, of what I mean by that.  Deputy Flaherty mentioned that she recently attended a presentation ceremony in her constituency. I had the same experience. Last Friday evening I attended an exhibition at the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  The college had a long history of being regarded by the vocational education committee as a third level college but being regarded by the Department of Education as a second level school.  It is only now that that issue has been ironed out and the Minister and the Department have at long last accepted the College of Art and Design as a third level college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience of the College of Art and Design gives an example of what can happen and of the difference in views that can exist.  A very fine institute was being developed by the vocational education committee but was not getting the recognition that it deserved from the Department of Education or from the Minister, for reasons relating to staffing, precedent, money and so on.  It can happen that the view of the vocational education committee and the view of the Minister may not be <i>ad unum</i> as to whether or not an institute is appropriate for designation as a third level college and, perhaps, for inclusion in the Dublin Institute of Technology at a later stage. It is very important that the vocational education committee have the role proposed by Deputy Higgins and Deputy <Col N="189" /> Ahearn in relation to the designation of colleges.</P>
    <P>I should not like what has happened in the past 15 years or more in relation to the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design to happen in the context of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The work, aspirations and drive of the College of Art and Design were being frustrated and but for the enormous commitment of the staff, students and the vocational education committee that college might not have survived and developed to the position at which they face the prospect of 450 full-time students next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not clear about the definitions and the explanation I sought from the Minister.  I shall put my questions in a different form.  Under the Bill as amended could a new college of the institute be put in place by the Minister? Could a new educational institute or part of an institute be amalgamated into an existing college?  If it is not the case that a new college could be created or that an educational institute or part thereof could be amalgamated into an existing college, what would be the status of the new educational institutes or part of institutes?  In this regard, my concern &mdash; among others &mdash; is that there could creep in a number of &ldquo;bits and pieces&rdquo;, bodies with no particular status, which could not become colleges or part of a college.  That would be an untidy and an unwelcome development.</P>
      <P>In general, I feel that the amendments proposed certainly do not improve the Bill.  More important, they would not give the institute the opportunity to grow, to expand and to have the full benefit of the wisdom of the vocational education committee, in this instance the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My three questions in relation to other educational institutes or a part of such institutes being incorporated into the institute have still not been answered to my satisfaction.  Could a new college be created?  Could an educational <Col N="190" /> institute or part of an institute be amalgamated into an existing college?  If it is not the case that a new college could be created or that a new educational institute or part of an educational institute could be amalgamated into an existing college, what would be the exact status of that institute?  What would the position be in relation to staffing?  In other words, would there be a director of such a new institute?  The position is very vague and I must say the debate so far and the Minister's response are not making the matter any clearer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a possibility that an amalgam of the combined amendments would achieve everything that we on this side of the House wish.  The Minister's amendment placing the option of the college or part of the college in the Schedule would not be a problem for us if he were to accept our means of including the vocational education committee and the governing body of the institute as groups who could initiate the process of including such a college.  As Deputy Ahearn said, there is a tremendous movement in growth and change in many of the institutes.  There are three senior colleges that I know of within the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  There is the college in Ballyfermot, the college in Ballsbridge and one in Finglas, at which college I also attended the presentation of certificates.  The college in Finglas started as a senior college only last year.  The number of students increased from 400 to 600 during that year.  The college offered an incredible range of courses which had all been developed there, not just locally but regionally and indeed nationally as regards some of the courses.  They run an accounting technician course and a unique course in the area of transport skills and the movement of goods throughout the Community particularly and beyond as required.  It is a two-year course which is proving extremely successful and innovative.  Given the pace of development in just one year, one could not set any limits on a college like that. <Col N="191" /> To achieve today's objectives, will the Minister accept the inclusion of &ldquo;vocational education committee and the governing body&rdquo;?  That would meet the views expressed on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>Section 3 (2) deals with the existing six colleges; section 3 (3) provides for the inclusion of other institutes if the Minister considers that this should happen.  As I said, the purpose of the amendment is to remove any ambiguity regarding the structure of the new institute.  It will not be a federation of colleges.  However, other institutes can be incorporated and integrated in the structures of colleges on the same basis as existing colleges.  I am pre-empting the debate but I should like to inform the House that I have decided to accept amendment No. 5 in the names of Deputies Higgins and Ahearn.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (4), line 33, after &ldquo;name&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and to acquire, hold and dispose of land&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as initiated all land which was vested in the vocational education committee for the purpose of the institute was to be held by the vocational education committee in trust for the purposes of the institute.  It was, however, a function of the governing body to manage and maintain all property of the institute, including land vested in the vocational education committee for the purposes of the institute.  As I said in relation to the regional technical college Bill, I consider that these provisions could lead to an overlap of responsibilities and are out of line with the aim of giving colleges as much autonomy and responsibility as possible within the framework of agreed policies and budgets.  I propose therefore to vest institute land in the institute.  This is provided for in amendment No. 109 to section 19, which amendment also deletes the original provision.  Amendment No. 7 is a standard provision consequent on this decision.  Amendment No. 20 to section 5 is also consequent on this decision enabling the Institute where necessary to acquire land subject to the normal requirement of the approval of the Minister.  Amendment No. 25 to section 5 is also consequent on this decision as it makes the provision at subsection <Col N="193" /> (4) to allow gifts of land to the institute to be held in trust by the vocational education committee unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 46 to section 7 deletes reference to the institute managing and maintaining all property of the institute including land vested in the vocational education committee for the purposes of the institute and again is consequent on the decision to vest land in the institute.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 to section 19 is also consequent on vesting the land in the institute and provides that in the event of a question arising in relation to whether land stood vested for the purposes of the institute or with regard to the transfer of rights and liabilities such question will be referred to the Minister for decision.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 3, after &ldquo;training&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including apprenticeship education,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is very important. Those of us who were privileged to work within the vocational education committee system in the past know the contribution it made to apprenticeship education.  The system turned out excellent apprentices and our vocational schools staff were, at all times, prepared to devote time and energy to the education of apprentices.  Over a period of time this responsibility has been given to FÁS, the training authority.  In addition, many changes have been made to the apprenticeship scheme.  Indeed, I criticise the way in which this matter is being handled because employers were led to believe that the existing apprenticeship scheme had been brought to an end.  As a result, many of those who would have liked to become apprentices find themselves in a vacuum and are not being taken on by employers because they are <Col N="195" /> waiting for the new changes to be implemented.</P>
    <P>At a time of massive unemployment if we are to check the unemployment spiral we will have to invest in apprenticeship education.  I believe that the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges should be given the responsibility to provide this education.  The one thing we have learned from other countries, Germany in particular, is that if people are made redundant they should be re-trained so that they can avail of further job opportunities. I am delighted to have this opportunity to move the amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.  It would be a step in the right direction as it would cement the apprenticeship scheme as we know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is also in my name.  When one realises that there are over 5,000 apprentices and craft technician students attending the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges one becomes aware that apprenticeship education forms an important part of the institute's activities.  The amendment includes the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;, and I believe that is the key word as apprenticeship education has as much to do with training as it has with the qualification obtained.  I also believe that provision should be made for education in its true sense because craft technicians should be exposed to the humanities as well as to technical training.</P>
      <P>It is very important that this amendment be made to the Bill as it would enshrine this concept in the preamble to section 5 which deals with the functions of the colleges.  I strongly suggest that the Minister of State should accept the amendment as it makes an important statement on apprenticeship training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the exhortations from Members on all sides of the House that the Minister of State should accept this amendment.  One of the main features of the 1930 Act is the provision which states that it is the responsibility of the vocational education committees to <Col N="196" /> provide training and education for apprentices.  Over the years, AnCO and FÁS were established and given responsibility to provide apprenticeship education. It is not just a question of providing manual training, there is also the education element.</P>
      <P>We have to acknowledge that the apprenticeship scheme is a farce and is not being operated for the benefit of those with a high degree of manual skill. If a person wants to become an apprentice he must first find a sponsor. However, in the present depressed economic climate it is virtually impossible to find one.  It is not possible for industrialists, manufacturers or employers to provide the money.  In addition, the scheme has become bogged down in red tape.  Would-be sponsors have become so browned off that they are literally walking away from the scheme; they do not want to see anyone coming to them looking for sponsorship.  Furthermore, because employers have to wait a long time before they are reimbursed and have to make numerous requests to FÁS &mdash; and to AnCO in the past &mdash; the good has been knocked out of the scheme by the time they get their money.</P>
      <P>In order to circumvent the difficulties in relation to sponsorship, many parents, in desperation, are now going to industrialists, manufacturers and employers to ask them to stamp the documentation and to say to them that they will do the rest.  As a result, only those people who can actually afford to meet the cost themselves can get into the scheme.  This means that many top quality people with a high degree of manual skill and ability, who would make excellent apprentices but do not have the necessary finance, end up in breakers' yards in Great Britain.  They end up plying their raw labour on the building sites of Wimpeys and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme, as I have said, has got bogged down.  There is an urgent need, therefore, to review the scheme in its entirety and to go back to basics.  There is also a need to acknowledge, as has been said, that these colleges provide top class instruction.  While a major question <Col N="197" /> mark hangs over the quality of instruction at certain FÁS courses there is no question mark hanging over the standard of instruction, which is <i>par excellence,</i> at Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.</P>
    <P>We need to review the 1930 Act in its entirety.  That Act vested in the vocational education committees the primary responsibility to provide apprenticeship training.  That is the reason I look forward to a comprehensive review of the entire scheme and I urge the Minister of State to enshrine the thrust and principle contained in the 1930 Act in this Bill by accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept many of the points made by Deputies and I am aware of the importance of apprenticeship education in the Dublin Institute of Technology. The provisions of the Bill aim to give the greatest possible flexibility in encompassing existing course provisions and future developments.  The provision in section 5 (1) was drawn up bearing in mind the diversity of existing provisions and including the apprenticeship area.  I am satisfied that apprenticeships can be satisfactorily catered for within the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, I recognise the value of apprenticeships and I have provided for off-the-job education and training for apprenticeships.  The Bill will allow this to continue.  In addition, students benefit from third level education.  I consider a specific reference unnecessary over and above the reference to technical education and training.  As Deputies are aware, FÁS are the statutory body with responsibility for apprenticeships.  Not all apprenticeship education takes place in educational institutions; for example, we have FÁS training centres.  This matter is under review at present.  It would be difficult for me to accept these amendments at this stage although I have sympathy with what has been said.  If I said I would examine it for Report Stage I might give the impression that we could do something about it.</P>

      <P>May I respectfully inquire whether the Minister has consulted <Col N="198" /> the 1930 Act?  I cannot quote the actual section but I will be in a position to do so when we resume our debate on Committee Stage.  The 1930 Act is quite specific in relation to the role of the vocational education committees as the bodies responsible for apprenticeship education and training.  The 1930 Act is the umbrella Act covering all of this, even though, if you like, we are establishing a new body of legislation to govern the new Dublin Institute of Technology.  If there are at present 5,000 apprentices, and a growing demand for apprenticeships in the Dublin Institute of Technology, why can we not accept this amendment which simply seeks the insertion of the words &ldquo;including apprenticeship education&rdquo;? We are not necessarily infringing on the FÁS remit.</P>
      <P>If these colleges had the £200 million going to FÁS at present I suspect they could do an awful lot with it in terms of cost/benefit and productivity, or a segment would achieve a tremendous amount in terms of apprenticeship training. Why can we not include apprenticeship education here?  These colleges are imparting education and are taking in apprentices.  Why not combine the two and insert the global term &ldquo;including apprenticeship education&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That undertaking on the part of the Minister would be acceptable except that there is a point that needs to be underlined here.  There are 24,000 students enrolled in the Dublin Institute of Technology, 5,000 of whom are apprentices.  This means we are talking about a group that represents more than 20 per cent of the student body in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I could foresee this difficulty with the Minister's response, that it could send out a signal that the apprenticeship content of the <Col N="199" /> Dublin Institute of Technology operation could possibly be moved away from the Dublin Institute of Technology within the context of the governmental review arising from the recommendations of the Culliton report.  I take it that is the review about which the Minister is speaking.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be more conclusive here.  The staff of the college, particularly those who deal with apprenticeships, might be very concerned that the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment.  I fully appreciate the Minister's difficulty in that there is a review taking place.  Nonetheless, I should like us to be as definite as possible as we progress through this Bill.  I would not be happy to leave Committee Stage without having received further clarification.</P>

But, as in the case of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, I propose to remove references to ministerial involvement except where they are considered to be absolutely unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is proposed to delete the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo; from section 5 (1) (a), (e), (g), (h) and (j). These changes are effected by way of this amendment and amendments Nos. 16, 18, 19 and 21.  This principle of deleting ministerial involvement is carried further in amendment No. 67 to section 11.  This proposes the deletion of the words&rdquo;, subject to such requirements as the Minister may from time to time specify,&rdquo; in relation to the academic council's function in the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students and in an amendment which proposes to delete &ldquo;such requirements as the Minister may lay down&rdquo; in paragraph 14 (a) of the Second Schedule, which deals with the function of the governing body with regard to admissions to the college and courses of study.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 5 (1) (d) and (f), I consider it necessary that the Minister should be enabled to determine conditions in relation to colleges engaging in research, consultancy and development work.  This would be envisaged as a once-off determination.  Therefore, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 15 and 17.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the concern of the Opposition in relation to these amendments.  Even though I have tabled amendments to section 5 (1) (d) and (f) I contend that the Minister must introduce regulations in the context of these two subsections, specifically to determine how a college can engage in research, consultancy and development work and provide such services in relation to <Col N="201" /> these matters as the governing body consider appropriate.  The later subsection refers in essence to the establishment of limited liability companies to operate within this same area of research, consultancy and development work.</P>
      <P>What is being offered here?  I should like to know what exactly will be the shape of the regulations the Minister will lay down.  I should like an undertaking from the Minister that, before the establishment date of the new Dublin Institute of Technology, the regulations which will pertain to section 5 (1) (d) and (f) will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into the difficulties and pitfalls that could arise unless there are strong and clearly defined regulations here.  Suffice it to say that there is, as I have mentioned, the business of discoveries of patenting and the question for instance, of what happens if a great deal of money is made on a particular R and D consultancy project by a campus company or, indeed, the opposite, if a great deal of money is lost because some R and D consultancy project comes off the rails.  Who is responsible and who will pick up the tab at the end of the day?  With limited liability companies the limited liability would be a protection for the college but, for instance, would it be intended that colleges would provide seed capital?  All these areas need to be clarified and again I ask that before establishment day those regulations be published and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Let me ask the Minister to explain why he has been selective in section 5.  Whereas he has been prepared to delete the term &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;, he is adamant in retaining it in subparagraphs (d) and (f).  Do those provisions involve a great deal of financial output?  Can he expand on the reasons he has been determined to retain the phrase in those subparagraphs and accept our amendments to the other sections?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (b), line 11, after &ldquo;give&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;degrees,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 (1) (b) as at present phrased provides that the institute shall have the following functions: to confer, grants or <Col N="203" /> give diplomas, certificates or other educational qualifications &mdash; this is the crunch &mdash; other than degree awards. Deputy Ahearn and I propose by this amendment to specify that the institute would have the power to give degrees. Indeed, subsequently we propose that the word &ldquo;other than degree awards&rdquo; be deleted and that the institute be empowered to confer, grant or give degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards.</P>
    <P>We all know that over a number of years as the Dublin Institute of Technology evolved, they have given a range of qualifications which are internationally recognised &mdash; certificates and diplomas &mdash; and in the past number of years they have awarded degrees in liaison or in conjunction with, or by virtue of a very welcome relationship with, Trinity College, Dublin.  One or other of the six colleges award the diploma and the diploma is then validated as a degree, having been cleared well in advance by the University of Dublin.  This is a very welcome development indeed but I think the colleges themselves would be the first to acknowledge that the linkage has worked, certainly to the advantage of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>If we are going to develop the Dublin Institute of Technology further and are putting in place here a body of legislation that is going to allow for the future development of the Dublin Institute of Technology, we should go all the way and the power to confer degrees.  The Dublin Institute of Technology have 7,700 wholetime third level students and 10,000 part-time students, and the college of music have 2,000 students.  As we have said on previous sections, they have 5,000 apprentices and are now the second largest third level education institute in the State.  They well and truly arrived.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology have provided undergraduate education to the highest international standards as assessed by external monitoring and examination processes of the Academic Council.  They have also provided tuition <Col N="204" /> and internal examinations on behalf of the professional bodies such as the Institute of Physics, the Royal College of Chemistry, the Institute of Food, Science and Technology, the Institute of Mathematics, and the Institute of Statisticians. The terminal examination and qualification of these professional bodies is of honours primary degree standard.  The Dublin Institute of Technology have provided supervision of post-graduate research leading to the award of masters' degrees and doctorates.  The Dublin Institute of Technology is structured in a manner similar to the technological universities and institutes which are found in mainland Europe, and in less than two weeks' time we hope to be in post-Maastricht Europe.  We are seeking to dovetail with the technological standards of mainland Europe and, therefore, we should make ourselves aware of what applies there.</P>
    <P>The legislation introduces an artificial barrier to the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology as a third level education institute by restricting to diplomas and certificates the level of award which can be granted.  We cannot see why an institute which is now the second largest third level institute in the country, which has reached a proven high level of academic achievement, which is well on the way to becoming an institute capable of rubbing shoulders with the primary degree awarding institute in this country, cannot have awarding of degrees in its own right.  We do not fully appreciate what type of mystique attached to the term &ldquo;degree&rdquo; as against &ldquo;diploma&rdquo; or &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; when the standard of induction, teaching and instruction and the examination levels are of a sufficiently high standard to be recognised internationally.</P>

      <P>I shall not reiterate the very logical and convincing arguments put forward by Deputy Higgins for acceptance of this amendment.  It would be very difficult for the Minister to put up counter-arguments to the arguments put forward by Deputy Higgins.  The proposal in our amendment would give <Col N="205" /> recognition to the fantastic work which has been done by the Dublin Institute of Technology.  They have exploited every opportunity to provide degrees of the highest international standards in conjunction with other universities.  We believe that the Dublin Institute of Technology are entitled to be given degree awarding powers at this stage.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Second Stage speech made by the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  She did not rule out the possibility of giving this power to the Dublin Institute of Technology in the future.  She accepted that there was a case for granting degree awarding status to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The only difference between this side of the House and the Minister at that time related to when the status would be granted to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  She said that it may be done at a future date.  We are asking that this status be conferred on the Dublin Institute of Technology now. If, based on the information available to us now, it is correct to confer this status on them in the future, I do not see why it should not be given to them now?  My colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, has put forward very convincing arguments for acceptance of this amendment by the Minister.  Our proposal would give due recognition to colleges who deserve it. As I said, the then Minister for Education did not rule out the possibility of conferring this status on them in the future. We agree with the views of the former Minister but we believe this status should be conferred on the Dublin Institute of Technology now under this legislation and not in the future.  Unless the Minister can put forward very convincing counter-arguments he should accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by the previous speakers.  I am not going to repeat the arguments put forward by other Deputies.  I wish to refer to the Minister's amendment No. 22 which seeks to amend section 5 (2) (a).  If I recall correctly, both former Ministers for Education were under the impression that degree conferring status could be provided for under the omnibus section <Col N="206" /> 5 (2) (a).  Obviously this has not proven possible.  As a result amendment No. 22 has been put down to this section.  I would be much happier with the amendment if it did not contain the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, which I do not think is definite.  It means the Minister of the day may or may not give the Dublin Institute of Technology the function of awarding degrees, post-graduate degrees and honorary awards.</P>
      <P>The validating body for diplomas, certificates and degrees awarded by regional technical colleges is the National Council for Educational Awards.  Up to now, the Dublin Institute of Technology have conferred their own diplomas and certificates and, as Deputy Higgins pointed out, their degrees have been validated under a special arrangement with Trinity College. I should like to stress that in terms of education and the awards given for the courses of study pursued in the component colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology, the academic freedom which should be available to the Dublin Institute of Technology is denied them because degrees are explicitly excluded under section 5 (1) (b).  This provision which takes from the status of the college should be amended.  The Minister may argue that amendment No. 22 proposes that the Minister of the day will have the wherewithal to grant to the Dublin Institute of Technology the function of conferring graduate degrees and honorary awards.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - North-South Joint Operational Programme: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy John Bruton on 9 June 1992:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to enter into immediate discussions with the relevant Northern Ireland authorities to agree on the preparation of a joint operational programme for the entire island of Ireland, for submission to the European Community to avail of the EC Structural Funds for the period 1993-97, with a view to promoting much more intensive trade between both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann supports the Government's policy of incorporating a strong co-operative approach with the Northern Ireland Authorities into its planning process for the post-1983 EC Structural Funds, both in the preparation of the respective Development Plans to be submitted to the EC Commission by the Authorities North and South and in the preparation of a new INTERREG Programme to succeed the existing Joint Programme, with the overall aim of encouraging greater co-operation in the economic development of the whole island of Ireland including the promotion of more intensive trade between both parts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said that I would like to see some consensus here in relation to the motion on Northern Ireland.  I am not sure if discussions have taken place between Fine Gael, who proposed this motion, and the Government who have tabled an amendment.  There is not a great difference in fact although there is some difference in emphasis between the motion and the amendment. It is extremely important, between now and 8.30 p.m., to make some effort to ensure that the consensus which has been fought for and which has been hard won by the Members of this House since the New Ireland Forum examined Northern Ireland, is retained, because the problems in Northern Ireland have such an adverse bearing on so many aspects of life here.  I would like to think we can keep the bi-partisan approach we have developed over the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commented on the scope for co-operation between the North and the South. There are many areas where this co-operation can manifest itself &mdash; in tourism, education, research, transport, roads, communications, energy policy and so on.  There are many areas where there is room for co-operation.  The Government and political parties here and the administration in Northern Ireland should take <Col N="211" /> a positive approach where there is room for co-operation so that opportunities which could benefit both North and South are not lost.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Maastricht debate can also have a bearing on the relationship between North and South and on the economies in both parts of the island. If we could develop a European focus, North and South, that would be very important.  We should not exaggerate the impact of European union on the link between North and South.  It is quite simplistic to think that it is the panacea for all the ills or lack of co-operation which affects the economies of North and South.  Nevertheless it would be a step in the right direction if we could start thinking European.  It might help to break down some of the barriers if we can direct our energies towards building a European consensus, towards contributing to the European economic area to enhance the economies of the North and South.</P>
    <P>One aspect that worries me in relation to the aspiration of this motion towards the development of better economic relations between North and South to avail of EC Structural Funds, is the size of the cultural gap between the North and the South at present.  Whereas some enlightened thinking has taken place in relation to the problems of Northern Ireland and some tremendous work is being done and has been done over a number of years by organisations such as Co-operation North and the Ireland Fund, there is still a significant cultural gap between the North and the South at a time when we are trying to build relationships with other countries, when we are trying to extend cultural relations far and wide.  We would need to focus nearer home in relation to ensuring that the community in the South have reason to want to get to know the communities in the North and to have an exchange of views, which has not been happening to any great degree in recent years.</P>
    <P>Much good work has been done in this area by the British-Irish Parliamentary tier.  It is regrettable that politicians <Col N="212" /> of the Unionist camp have not yet seen fit to take part in that.  The British-Irish Parliamentary tier holds out another opportunity for politicians in this island and in Britain to break down the barriers and the misconceptions which exist between the islands and on this island.  I hope that the Unionist politicians will in due course co-operate with the politicians from the South, our British counterparts and the SDLP who are participating in the British-Irish Parliamentary tier.</P>
    <P>There is a serious fundamental difficulty which pervades political and economic life here and this is the unending violence we see on a daily basis in Northern Ireland and in the UK as recently as this week.  In any discussion we have in this House, or in any other parliament, we must do everything possible to try to bring those who feel that there is some meaning in destruction and violence to see that absolutely nothing will be achieved by violence.  Violence begets violence and the turmoil, havoc and hardship and the disruption of families which is caused by the violence only develops and magnifies the hurt, the despair and the intolerence existing on this island already.  Everybody in political life on this island should make every effort to highlight the necessity for pursuing campaigns for peace to end the violence.</P>
    <P>In relation to developing economic and political links it is extremely important that tolerance is taught.  We may not totally respect or understand the views of those on other sides but as we face into the 21st century we must respect the traditions of both sides and have tolerance for the different points of view which manifest themselves in various debates that take place in this island.  We should approach the talks which we are attempting to have on this island with a new degree of tolerance, leave behind the old historical wounds and try to convince the men of violence that their ways are not in the best interests of those whom they claim to represent and do not represent the best interests of this island. The violence also has a cost in human and in money terms.  If we can move beyond the violence, if we can sit down <Col N="213" /> with respect and tolerance and try to tease out how to live on this island together, we can then move on to look at the economic side.  Economic steps can be taken to benefit the people, North and South.  I reiterate that if we can find unity within this House we should strive to do so before the debate concludes.</P>

      <P>A Europe without frontiers is now accepted as a commonplace idea.  When a Minister for Finance speaks of achieving such an objective it is often in the context of removing physical barriers such as tariffs and customs posts. The EC has long recognised that many of the invisible barriers to trade are a greater stumbling block: hence the adoption of the Single Market programme. Alongside the progress already made in these areas we must recognise that more fundamental obstacles often exist to full co-operation across borders, whether these be cultural, administrative and language differences or difficulties of a more political nature.  A basic tenet underlying recent developments in the EC is that closer co-operation and integration produce a synergy with benefits greater than those arising in a zero sum game. Everyone can benefit from closer co-operation and integration.  Nowhere is this more true than on the island of Ireland where our similarities far out-weigh our differences.</P>
      <P>We are both at similar stages of development in terms of GDP per head. Both our economies are very open reflecting the limited size of our respective home markets, our resources base and our long trading traditions, particularly with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Natural resource based industries of agriculture, fishing and forestry account for a significant proportion of employment in both parts of this island.  These <Col N="214" /> industries make a sizeable contribution, by way of external revenues and inducement effects, to total economic activity.</P>
    <P>Both areas have relatively high natural population and labour force growth by EC and British standards, relatively low population density, and high dependency rates.  Each has, furthermore, experienced significant migration flows, varying with prevailing economic circumstances. Because of this rapid natural labour force growth we are both faced with exceptional job-creation requirements.  While both our labour markets are integrated with those of Britain, our unemployment rates are well in excess of those in Britain or the EC as a whole, and have traditionally been higher.</P>
    <P>The peripherality, in a European context, of both North and South poses common difficulties: for access to markets, notably in continental Europe, for the development of industry and international services, or innovation and transfers of technology.</P>
    <P>Each region is affected, in its capacity to compete, by infrastructural limitations, reflecting location, low population density and dispersal of population.</P>
    <P>With the completion of the Single Market the integration of Community markets and economies should lead to closer economic and commercial relations between the economies of the North and South.  In time, we are likely to see more all-Ireland firms, with operations conducted across both regions, and more cross-Border mergers and acquisitions.  Because economies of scale in marketing and product development will be of crucial importance, joint approaches by firms North and South may be necessary if they are to survive and compete successfully in the enlarged European Market.</P>
    <P>In her address to this House yesterday my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, outlined the wide range of measures already underway to develop strong cross-Border co-operation in the area of trade and industry.</P>
    <P>A joint North-South approach to the <Col N="215" /> issues arising in the context of European integration has several possible dimensions. The imminent arrival of a Single European Market, the approaching economic and monetary union, and the pressures and opportunities these will create, emphasise the logic of exploiting to the full the available scope, in certain fields of activity, for practical co-operation on a bilateral basis.  In the present context of accelerated progress towards integration on a broad front, there is a particular need to ensure that joint concerns are adequately reflected in the policies of the European Community.</P>
    <P>From the standpoint of two regions of the European Community, North and South have shared interests in the development and application of Community policies.  Because of their structural characteristics, North and South face particular challenges in an integrated Europe.  They have a mutual interest in the development of appropriate common policies, and the extension of Community responsibilities, with consequential enlargement of its budgetary resources. Each has a vital stake in a strong European Regional Policy, to enhance their prospects of catching-up with more favoured regions of the Community, in terms of both productivity and employment opportunity.  The provisions of Article 130B of the European Union Treaty, whereby all Community policies must take into account the objective of Economic and Social Cohesion, can assist both North and South.</P>
    <P>Geographical proximity, affinities in legal infrastructure, similarities in business organisation, and shared historical, cultural and commercial experiences, provide powerful arguments for working together.  There are valuable examples of co-operation in place and these can become the foundation for closer links in the future.  As both parts of the island become subsumed, in the economic sense, in an integrated Europe, the cost of the current one-island/two-economy basis of operation in many areas will become a greater drag on economic progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> The EC Structural Funds, which substantially benefit both parts of the island, provide an opportunity for Ireland and Northern Ireland to work together cooperatively to our mutual advantage.  As Deputies will be aware, I have just returned from a Council of Ministers' meeting where we had some very difficult discussions on the Delors II Package.  I, along with my colleagues from other less developed member states, am strongly arguing the need for substantial increases in the Structural Funds in addition to the proposed new Cohesion Fund, in order to meet the new provisions on economic and social cohesion enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.  General increases targeted at Objective 1 regions obviously benefit Northern Ireland as well as Ireland.  Similarly we have supported the idea of flexibility in the determination of the threshold at which a region ceases to hold Objective 1 status.  This is of particular concern to Northern Ireland where GDP per head is very close to the limit of the 75 per cent of the Community average.  This is just a small example of the co-operative approach which can be adopted at EC level in relation to the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's motion and the Government's amendment are concerned more with the domestic planning and implementation aspects of the Structural Funds.  The negotiations on the Delors II Package are at a very early stage and proposals on the detailed administrative structures for the next round of Structural Funds have not been put forward as yet.  It seems likely that there will be a high degree of continuity with the present arrangements.  Thus Objective 1 regions, such as Ireland and Northern Ireland, will be preparing development plans for submission to the EC Commission as the first stage in the elaboration of the detailed Structural Funds programmes.</P>
    <P>As the current Structural Funds arrangements will expire at the end of 1933 it will be necessary to have all the new arrangements in place at that stage if a smooth transition is to be assured. Deputies will appreciate that the work <Col N="217" /> involved is substantial.  If the planning process is to be thoroughly carried out we cannot afford to wait until negotiations are concluded on the Delors II Package.  Accordingly, the Government have already commenced the preparation of a new national development plan. Work is under way in all relevant Government Departments.  Submissions have been requested from the social partners and from the sub-regional review committees.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will set out the Government's strategy for the optimal use of Structural Funds resources in contributing to our development goals. It provides an unrivalled opportunity for the advancement of North-South co-operation in economic development.  It is for this reason that I specifically asked Government Departments in preparing proposals for the development plan to examine their individual programmes and proposals with a view to identifying those elements lending themselves to cross-Border co-operation.  Senior officials of my Department have discussed with their counterparts in Nothern Ireland the desirability of enhancing the cross-Border element in both our plans. I will be asking my officials to continue their contacts with their Northern Ireland colleagues with a view to ensuring complementarity and synergy in the development strategies to underpin our respective plans.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Bruton's motion refers to an operational programme with the objective of intensifying trade between both parts of Ireland, I gather from Deputy Bruton's speech yesterday that he has in mind that the two parts of Ireland would submit a joint development plan covering all Structural Funds programmes and sectors which would in turn lead to a joint Community support framework and joint operational programmes. While this is a laudable objective it is not easily achieved in the short term.</P>
    <P>The main difficulty lies not in Community regulations which would not currently permit such an arrangement but more fundamentally in the different programmes <Col N="218" /> and priorities North and South. The development plans will set out the economic development strategy to be pursued and the utilisation of the Structural Funds to assist this strategy.  Though our problems North and South are similar, the economic development strategies to be pursued will obviously reflect the differing policies and views of two different Governments.  I am not saying that this is desirable.  I am saying that it is the reality and we must deal with the reality.</P>
    <P>If we were to pursue the course suggested there is a real risk that we would end up with a cobbled together development plan effectively comprising two different development strategies and two separate strategies and programmes for each sector covered.  Each Department or agency North and South would pursue their own policies and programmes and the two would be added together for reporting arrangements to Brussels. There is no reason to believe that the problem with the Dublin-Belfast road instanced yesterday would be any more easily resolved in the context of the work being part financed by the EC under one joint community support framework with the North and South providing matching finance for their elements than in the context of the EC part-financing it under two different community support frameworks.</P>
    <P>It is easy to refer, as did speakers yesterday, to a partitionist mentality or to the public service pursuing the familiar and following precedent.  I do not want to put bureaucratic structures in place just for the sake of being able to present something as a joint plan or joint CSF or joint programme.  I am seeking to create genuine co-operation in the economic sphere leading to genuine added value achieved from co-operative measures between North and South.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan, Community Support Framework and operational programmes cannot create or impose co-operation.  They must reflect co-operation already underway or be used as the occasion to foster the growth of co-operation.  Rome was not built in a day: neither can a two economy island <Col N="219" /> be turned into a fully integrated single economy by a wave of an EC Structural Funds wand.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that the Government wish to progress steadily but surely, putting one building block in place after another in identifying areas of fruitful co-operation within our respective development plans and aligning our plans as closely as is possible given the real practical and political constraints.</P>
    <P>Contacts to develop co-operation in Structural Funds programmes are facilitated by the close contacts already in place for the joint Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme under one of the initiatives.</P>
    <P>The programme involves approximately £58 million of EC aid from the three Structural Funds.  Matching domestic finance is being provided by the Government and local authorities on both sides of the Border as well as by the private sector, bringing total expenditure under the programme to just over £100 million.</P>
    <P>This programme, though not covering the full island of Ireland, is a joint operational programme.  It is administered jointly by the authorities in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The various levels of implementation such as the working groups assessing applications under each sub-programme are established on a joint basis with representatives from the relevant Departments and agencies North and South.  Many of the sectors referred to in Deputy Bruton's speech are covered in the programme.</P>
    <P>There is a concensus among the member states and the Commission that INTERREG has been a success and that this type of action needs to be continued. I am confident therefore that there will be a successor to the present INTERREG Programme which runs to the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>INTERREG, however, can only be one aspect to what should be done in the area of cross-Border co-operation.  An important limitation to INTERREG is that its application is confined to the eligible Border counties.  It does not, for <Col N="220" /> example, cover actions which might be undertaken on an island-wide basis.</P>
    <P>An INTERREG initiative extended to cover actions which could most efficiently be carried out on an all-island basis might meet some of the concerns expressed by Opposition speakers.  We would favour such a development.  However as the INTERREG initiative is targeted at Border areas, it may be difficult to achieve agreement at EC level on a wider definition of the areas which may be covered. In that case, we would cover these matters in our respective Community Support Frameworks.</P>
    <P>We on the Government side are in full accord with Deputy Bruton on what we want to see achieved.  It is in all our interests that a coherent economic development strategy for the whole of the island get under way and that Structural Funds are used in a complementary and co-operative fashion to achieve this aspiration. I would like to assure Deputy Bruton and other Opposition speakers that we are already on the road towards this goal.  We may differ from Deputy Bruton on the tactics or methodology to adopt or on the pace at which we can advance but these are minor differences when one considers the stakes involved.</P>
    <P>I would urge Deputies to support the Government amendment which recognises that a co-operative policy is already under way and which deals with the broader thrust of cross Border co-operation across all Structural Funds plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As with other Deputies I am happy to have the opportunity, albeit so short, to address myself to the spirit of the motion and the amendment.  It is both heartening and timely that this House is applying itself to the spirit of both measures.  The tragedy of Northern Ireland has, no doubt, embedded itself in the minds and hearts of all right minded people.  It represents the most urgent and pressing need for social, economic and political considerations, both on this island and on the adjoining island.  The unfortunate episode of the past 20 years has not been of our making, thank God, but rather of the men, and presumably <Col N="221" /> in some cases women who would presume to impose their Utopian views on, people, however reluctant they may be. It is unfortunate, notwithstanding all the tragedy, the injustice and lack of freedom that has emerged from the appalling deliberations of those responsible that as yet they have not come to accepting that nothing worthwhile can ever be imposed by might.  You must follow painstakingly what you are convinced is appropriate in justice and equity.  Having done that you can be assured that at least the results will remain.</P>
      <P>History shows what is achieved by might and by force is of its very nature ephemeral.  In the light of that I want to address myself, however briefly, to the spirit that has motivated the British-Irish parliamentary body.  I am happy to see sitting opposite me, Deputy Peter Barry. We talk in this House of people being for or against.  In all my years in politics the most heartening exercise for me has been membership of the British-Irish Parliamentary body where, as a team of 25 we have demonstrated that, first, we are aware of the situation and, second, that we are prepared to leave aside all other considerations so that we can arrive at a formula that would help to understand the people on this island; people of different traditions, origins and religions.  Such differences are immaterial as long as one's attitude is based on what is proper, good and just.</P>
      <P>It has been a most enlightening experience for me to sit beside, for instance, Deputies Peter Barry, Garret Fitz-Gerald, Rory O'Hanlon, Jimmy Leonard, Tomás MacGiolla and Dick Spring, each with the same objective &mdash; to bring about relief, greater prosperity and happiness for all the people who live on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say in passing, notwithstanding the benign neutrality which has been given to the body by our good Unionist friends, that I regret that as yet they have not joined us in making what would be an invaluable contribution as a result of which we could move towards the realisation of what is embodied in the motion and in the amendment.  It should <Col N="222" /> be said that even though we were established only in 1990, already we had a committee that had applied itself to discovering ways and means by which EC funds &mdash; whether Structural or otherwise &mdash; could be best utilised, and to tourism as affecting the whole island or, indeed, the situation as between ourselves and the adjoining island, and had produced very exciting and helpful documents on that aspect.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how, when I can meet that great man, Martin Smith, MP, at venues in other countries where he and I consider that we have a contribution to make towards the resolution of problems that exist elsewhere, for whatever reasons &mdash; some of which I do understand &mdash; as yet we have not combined to attempt to bring a solution to the problems here.  It is only by such co-operation that the problems can be resolved.  I said earlier you cannot impose anything that is good.  We have to discover, to come closer to, to meet more frequently our friends from the North.  We have to indulge in this exercise of discovering what is in our hearts and minds.  We have to court each other and build friendships but we cannot do that from afar.  We can do it only in association with each other, understanding our respective problems.</P>
    <P>From my association with a former chairman of the Fine Gael Party, Kieran Crotty, I realised, as did he, as far back as 1983, that we could no longer perpetuate the situation existing between the peoples on both parts of this island so we made this move towards better understanding. Bearing in mind the co-operation that exists at the British-Irish Parliamentary body it would be regrettable if, notwithstanding the unanimity that exists where we all share the one view, we should have to divide on a motion or amendment.  What difference does it make to the people who are so dependent on our assistance?</P>
    <P>I know that traditionally and characteristically there is a motion from the Opposition and an amendment from the Government party.  Here I appeal to Deputy John Bruton, Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and through him, to Deputy <Col N="223" /> Peter Barry.  In the name of sanity and demonstrating our sincerity on this matter and having accepted the motivation of Deputy Bruton's motion and accepting in all the circumstances that at any given time it is presumed that any Government has a slight edge over the Opposition, let Deputy Bruton do, as I know he and every member of his party would wish to do, that which would best serve all interests.</P>
    <P>I thank him for placing this motion before the House and giving us an opportunity of addressing ourselves to it, but let us show that we can demonstrate, particularly on this matter, that there is unanimity, a sense of purpose and let him withdraw his motion and not ask me to divide with him on a matter on which both of us are at one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to comment on this.  I support the amendment, especially the latter part of it.  The INTERREG Programme, 1991-1993, is drawing to a close and it is important that we look at the era post-1993. In doing that we must look at our progress from 1991 to 1993 and the lack of progress in some areas.  While there were many good projects, much more could have been done.</P>
      <P>I travelled down to Derry to meet Commissioner Bruce Millan during the initial stages of this programme.  I suggested a number of things to him, including the setting up of a structure to administer the programme in Border areas.  We should have involved voluntary organisations as well as the State Departments and agencies but unfortunately that was not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other schemes could have been initiated.  As far back as 1975 I initiated cross-Border development.  We have been very disappointed.  The atrocities committed along the Border were not conducive to co-operation.  Irrespective of that we continued our efforts.  I believe that at present the climate is much more favourable.  There is a programme for cross-Border co-operation between south Tyrone and north Monaghan. <Col N="224" /> It is part of the Ulster Way and it is part of the north-west passage recently proposed by the tourism body in the North.  There is a fund of goodwill and a realisation that the people in that area have much more in common than that which divides them.  An application was put in and I thought it was an ideal project for that area where so many atrocities have been committed.  Unfortunately, it was not successful.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the next tranche from 1993 to 1996 we will get a further opportunity. I hope that prior to that there will be a greater co-ordinated effort by Government Departments and agencies North and South and I hope that we will make better use of the Leader and INTERREG programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats believe in giving all the regions, including the different regions within the Republic, a greater say in the allocation and use of Community Structural Funds, and we believe that not all the decisions should be made centrally by Government in Dublin.  We believe that such a policy should be adopted in allocating the next tranche of Ireland's Structural Funds allocation.  We oppose the exclusion of the regions having a direct input into the formulation of this country's programmes for the 1989-1993 allocation from these funds.  We believe that only by providing the lower tiers of Government with a real say in the use of such funds can we expect that they will be used to maximum advantage in the interests of local communities.  It seems clear to us that adopting such a policy now in the allocation process would allow local communities to respond more effectively to the real needs of their regions and it would enable local communities in Border areas to co-operate in the use of funds to their mutual advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That there is need to co-operate in the use of these funds on a North-South basis, as this debate specifically proposes, is immediately obvious.  There are many projects where this island as a whole would benefit more through joint action than through going separate ways.  Perhaps <Col N="225" /> the most obvious example of an area for improving North-South co-operation arises in my own area of responsibility, which is energy.  It is clear that enormous economic benefit would flow from the restoration, for instance, of the cross-Border electricity inter-connector.  It is an absolute tragedy that the terrorism of the IRA has disrupted this vital energy link and I would clearly like to see it being restored at the earliest possible opportunity.  The fact that we are now in the process of building a gas inter-connector between this country and Scotland underlines the scandal of terrorist campaigns to prevent the development of closer economic links between the two parts of this island.</P>
    <P>Another area where cross Border co-operation is appropriate is in the upgrading of the rail line between Belfast and Dublin.  It is clear that this project, which is supported by the Community, could not have been undertaken without a joint approach in the use of the Community funds.  Similarly, restoring the navigation link between the Erne and the Shannon through the Ballyconnell canal demonstrates again the economic benefits to communities on both sides of the Border co-operating in using community funds.</P>
    <P>That there is real scope for increased trade between the North and South is self-evident.  As Europe completes the Single Market, we in Ireland must give effect to building and achieving our own geographical single market.  The Confederation of Irish Industry estimate that trade between the North and South could be trebled from its current level of £1.5 billion to £4.5 billion and the confederation goes on to suggest that this could result in the creation of 30,000 additional manufacturing jobs or a total of 75,000 in all on this island.</P>
    <P>It is also true that such co-operation is one of the most practical ways to advance the cause of peace in the North.  We can show that through the development of trade and through a co-operative approach to the use of Structural Funds all the people on this island can not only <Col N="226" /> live peacefully together but can prosper economically together as well.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, therefore, endorse the policy of promoting a strong co-operative approach with the Northern Ireland authorities to the use of these funds.  We are also convinced that this spirit of co-operation must extend to the various regions within the Republic.  Their input also must be welcomed in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity which is written into the Maastricht Treaty and which must be given substance in our own country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate generally in relation to co-operation between North and South of this island.  Too often we engage in rhetorical statements of good wishes in relation to Northern Ireland but rarely if ever do we debate the substance of what we might do to establish the kind of co-operation we seek.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that there seems to be a conflict between the Fine Gael motion and the Government amendment; there is not a million miles between either approach.  It would be unfortunate if at the end of this debate we had to divide on what is generally a proposal that all of us would support.  Falling out over the detail would be a mistake.  If that has to be so be it, but I hope the Whips of the Government parties and the Whip of the Fine Gael Party might arrive at some arrangement whereby we do not have to divide on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate is welcome.  I was particularly pleased that Deputy Bruton when speaking last night talked about the need to approach the issue of co-operation between the North and the South without a hidden agenda.  There is always the fear <Col N="227" /> in Northern Ireland that overtures from the Republic represent some kind of Trojan horse.  We need to do everything we can to allay those fears which are not unreasonable, particularly given the appalling campaign of slaughter in which the Provisional IRA have been engaged over the years against one particular section of the community in Northern Ireland and also their appalling campaign of attacks on commercial targets in Northern Ireland, a campaign deliberately aimed at destroying the economic infrastructure there.  It is important that we try to allay those fears and for that reason we cannot engage in this kind of debate without addressing, even if only in a passing way, Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  It seems to me that so long as we maintain hard-nosed attitudes in relation to Articles 2 and 3 it will be difficult to convince the people of Northern Ireland that there is no hidden agenda.  I recognise fully that there is no hidden agenda in the Fine Gael motion. I know that the Fine Gael intentions are entirely to do with developing the economy of both North and South and trying to ensure that there is work for the people of both North and South.  People in Northern Ireland who on a daily basis come under attack from the Provisional IRA, who claim to be operating on behalf of a united Ireland, quite rightly fear that Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution claim jurisdiction in relation to Northern Ireland.  That issue has to be addressed seriously before we will be able to make substantial progress on cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there are areas in which cross-Border co-operation can take place.  The Minister for Energy referred to the cross-Border inter-connector. I have raised that matter in the Dáil on several occasions and I spoke about it again in recent months.  I fail to understand the reason the British Government and the Irish Government have not taken steps to re-establish that interconnector.  The argument is that it could be a target for the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it would be, like <Col N="228" /> the peace train and the train link between the North and the South was a target. The people North and South, effectively took that weapon out of the hands of the Provisional IRA by demonstrating that they were prepared to travel up and down that line, at risk to their lives if need be, in order to show that the people of this island want to live at peace with each other.  An opportunity will be missed by both Governments if they do not proceed at all possible speed to re-establish that interconnector, which, in my view, would be not only a political gesture but would also have beneficial economic effects on both the domestic bills of the people North and South and the cost of energy to industry in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make arises from the Maastricht Treaty and the UK opt-out on the Social Charter.  Perhaps, in concluding the debate we might address the question of the way that might affect the economic relations between North and South, given that it would seem that the British Government sought that opt-out in order to maintain some kind of cheap labour approach to economic development.  That would be an appalling approach to the economy of Northern Ireland, which is virtually on its knees.  Apart from the input by the British Government in terms of the public services, the economic infrastructure and the industrial infrastructure are weak and shrinking.  The UK Government need to take a greater interventionist approach to the Northern Ireland economy.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point I wish to make in relation to Northern Ireland, which is somewhat linked to Articles 2 and 3.  I am referring to the talks that are with some difficulty trying to get under way in Northern Ireland.  I welcome those talks and I hope a <i>modus operandi</i> can be found to get the talks under way seriously.  In wishing those involved well, I urge them to address issues other than the constitutional issues in Northern Ireland.  There is little doubt that the alienation of a significant section of the population in Northern Ireland in <Col N="229" /> relation to the State there derives from the economic deprivation from which they suffer.  That is obviously true for that section of the population that is Nationalist but it is equally true for a significant proportion of the section of the population that regards itself as Unionist.</P>
    <P>Whatever marginal advantage the Unionist working class may have had in Northern Ireland because of the position of Unionism there, it has been virtually wiped out because of the near collapse of indigenous industry.  Recent reports bear out my opinion.  Unemployment, and the sense of alienation are fairly widespread amongst the working class people on the Unionist side of the divide in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The talks must address such questions as the economy and the social services in Northern Ireland and establish a support for any devolved governmental structures that may be established.  Unless that support comes from both sides on the ground, then such structures cannot survive. The weapon of the Provisional IRA and the UDA will not be struck from their hands if we leave the sore of unemployment and deprivation, from which those groups draw most of their personnel, to fester.</P>
    <P>I hope it will not be necessary to divide on this issue.  All Members want co-operation to develop.  I welcome the Government statement that they have proposals for the development of co-operation with regard to European funding and I do not recognise any great distinction between that and the motion.  Perhaps the Fine Gael motion is a little narrowly focused but it is nevertheless a valid contribution to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the contributors to the debate this evening and last night. Fine Gael Deputies were a little surprised that a Government amendment was tabled because we thought our motion was one that the House could support. If there can be agreement between the Whips between now and 8.30 p.m. on the motion and the amendment, my party would be very happy not to divide the House on what we consider to be an <Col N="230" /> important topic that needs an all-party approach.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party believe that cross-Border co-operation and a new approach to regional policy can benefit the island of Ireland and promote constructive development.  The development and evolution of the European Community has demonstrated the benefit of co-operation across geographical boundaries and the success of policies based on common interest.  The European Community has provided a positive model of political co-operation where former adversaries have learned to work together for peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>This part of Ireland benefited substantially from the Structural Funds; over the 1989 to 1993 period the European Community will have contributed some £3,000 million in Structural Funds to Ireland.  The funds contributed so far have been used in a variety of areas including industrial development, education and training, tourism and agricultural development.  The funds have also made a major contribution to the development of our infrastructure &mdash; roads, by passes, bridges, passenger and airline facilities, to mention just some of them.</P>
      <P>These funds could be put to even more effective use if they were harnessed to promote more intensive trade between the whole island and to promote policies common to both areas.  Transfers from the Community to Ireland have been central to improving our economy, our employment prospects and our quality of life.  Transfers from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Structural Funds account for 6 per cent of our national income and this proportion of funds is planned to increase as a result of funding to implement the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty which will come into effect in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because Northern Ireland is linked to Britain, which is a consumer society and a net contributor to the European Community, it does not benefit as much as the rest of Ireland and yet it shares many of the same problems.  That is a key point. It is unlikely, for instance, that Northern <Col N="231" /> Ireland will benefit from the new Cohesion Fund which will be set up in the Maastricht Treaty to honour the commitment in the Treaty of Rome to economic and social cohesion between the member states.  That point has not been finally decided, but four countries &mdash; Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland &mdash; have been mentioned in that regard.  I do not know whether the British Government will make a case for the inclusion of Northern Ireland, and one can see the political difficulties for them in relation to other regions in Great Britain.  Economically, Northern Ireland certainly qualifies to be included in the Cohesion Fund.  For many years I have talked to people about the problems in Northern Ireland, and when I spoke to Unionists, a recurring theme was how much better our farmers and local authorities are served by our Government in obtaining funds from the European Community compared to the British Government's support for the Northern Ireland economy.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion Fund has two objectives, one of which is to promote and finance projects that protect the environment. The fact is &mdash; as we know only too well when we look across the Irish sea &mdash; that environmental degradation, water and air pollution do not respect national boundaries, much less the boundary between the two parts of this island.  Co-operation in this area is vital and represents a positive opportunity to benefit both parts of the island.  The fund's other objective is to develop transport infrastructure, particularly for peripheral and island regions.  This is an area where all-island co-operation could be of enormous economic and social benefit. Last night Deputy John Bruton listed a number of areas where that could be done and which would benefit both parts of the island.  The Minister said tonight that there is still a lot of co-operation &mdash; and I am sure that is correct &mdash; but if a plan was put forward for the whole island for Structural Funds which was endorsed by the authorities, North and South, it would be very acceptable to the EC and <Col N="232" /> they would show a great willingness to overcome whatever kind of legal or bureaucratic difficulties might arise in supplying funds.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that a regional approach to policy formation would be much more beneficial to Ireland, North and South.  The development of integrated regional plans would harness local initiative, facilities, different policies and practice.  There has been far too much attention paid to policies which expect initiatives to come from the centre.  In Government Departments or State agencies regional diversity is needed to reflect the often very difficult regional weaknesses. Fine Gael believe that the power to take initiative should be devolved to the regions.  In particular, we suggest in our policy document <i>The Jobs Economy</i> that a network of regional authorities should be set up, each with a small board selected for executive ability, whose primary task shall be to develop their regional economy.  This authority would have direct control over a portion of Structural Funds from Brussels without coming through Dublin and they would be under the scrutiny of members of their constituent local authorities.  In my area, the most likely region would be Cork, Cork city, Cork county and south Kerry; under our plan each one of those would be entitled to nominate to the controlling body members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The aim of this approach is to promote strategic thinking about economic opportunities and to support real job creation initiatives coming from the regions and communities rather than having policies and projects imposed by the centre.  Fine Gael believe that chambers of commerce and industrial associations have great potential; such associations should adopt a development role instead of the present emphasis on lobbying.  They could evolve schemes for business plans in their area in training, marketing, data exchange and guaranteeing customer standards.  This is very much a continental Europe idea where the chambers of commerce play a completely different role from the one they play in Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>A regional approach would benefit the <Col N="233" /> whole island and allow local communities to take the initiative in the development of their regions.  In the South there is an attitude that decisions are taken to suit the centre, that the &ldquo;shower&rdquo; in Dublin get everything because of our lack of regional policy.  This problem will be exacerbated in a more integrated European Community as more decisions and policies will be initiated on a European basis.  I made the point earlier that people in the regions are becoming more dependent and apathetic, which could have serious repercussions for European Union.  Any Member who has been canvassing for the referendum on 18 June has found that people are disturbed about the number of decisions taken in Dublin in relation to their own areas.  They now fear that such decisions may be taken in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Political commentators and academics are already suggesting that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Danish referendum indicates that this process has already begun.  The suggestion is that the drive for European integration has been largely led by the politicians and the bureaucrats and that the people have been left behind.  They also feel that the Government have not done enough to inform, debate, explain and engage people in the process towards a more integrated and unified European Community.  That attitude was prevalent when I was canvassing last week and it is certainly one of the elements in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign which is eliciting a response from the people.  Our Government were initially complacent and would not debate the central issues in the Dáil.  They did not produce a White Paper until eight weeks before the referendum.  Now we are all under pressure to have complicated and complex issues debated and discussed in a very short period.  This is not good enough.  The Danish vote should have taught us that we need to rethink our whole approach to Europe, to our domestic policies and, in particular, our approach to regional policy. We must inform people on a continuous basis well in advance of decisions they are likely to have to make about Europe in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> The Fine Gael motion represents an opportunity to begin the process of regionalisation and the recognition that an all-island approach would benefit all our people.  The European Community is the first super-national body which sets out a common objective with member states, that is the achievement of peace and prosperity.  That is the objective of the European Community and those of us who argue for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote should remember that.  It is a mechanism through which former adversaries have learned to work together.  One of our objectives as a member of the European Community is to work with the people and leaders in Northern Ireland to achieve peace and stability.</P>
    <P>The New Ireland Forum, of which both the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I were members, in their report of 1984 outlined the enormous cost in terms of human life and economic hardship exacted by the continuing violence and instability.  Paragraph 21 of chapter 3 is worth reading even though at this stage, eight years on, the figures are very much out-of-date. The cost to the British and Irish Exchequers, in terms of security, were estimated, for the 15 years between 1969 and 1984, at £5,000 million for the British Exchequer and £1,100 million for the Irish Exchequer.  The figure has increased considerably in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The report also underlines the fact that the violence had destroyed opportunities for productive employment, severely depressed investment that could have led to new jobs and greater economic wellbeing and greatly damaged the potential for tourism.  Co-operation between both parts of this island makes sense, both socially and economically.  It also makes sense in terms of securing the future peace and prosperity of our people.  This motion marks a further step towards securing that peace and co-operation between both parts of the island.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion on Northern Ireland which was proposed by my party Leader, Deputy John Bruton, yesterday evening.  I should say in passing that I regret so little time has been made available for a debate on a motion which has attracted much interest and aroused such passion and that there is no flexibility to extend the time available so that we can have a full debate on this matter.  I hope, however, that we will not stop here and that, having put forward various proposals we will take a further step.  I also hope that we will not divide on this issue tonight as that would send the wrong signal from this House to the people who are listening to us and hoping that we are sincere.  I have no doubt, having listened to the speeches that have been made, that Members are sincere.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that there is a ground swell of opinion that people in Northern Ireland and both North and South should come together because the people have had enough.  There has been some great detective work done and I compliment both the Garda Síochána and the RUC in relation to the recent major arms finds. I believe that information is now being made available because those who supported the men of violence now see that what they are doing is wrong and are prepared to provide information to ensure that these deadly arms, ammunition and bomb-making equipment are confiscated.  This should be welcomed and we must build on it.</P>
      <P>It should be put on the record of the Houses that the present spate of violence has got nothing to do with the aim of a united Ireland or religious beliefs.  It amounts to nothing more than gangsterism. They are a Mafia-type organisation who play on the fears of the people, both North and South, and live off the proceeds of bank robberies, protection rackets and so on.  I would not be surprised if following this debate there was an upsurge in violence.  They will not go away but they are being and can be beaten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleagues in my constituency <Col N="236" /> of Cavan-Monaghan, and in other constituencies along the Border I compliment my colleague, Deputy McGahon, for making a fine speech last night.  I know of families who have suffered at the hands of these terrorists and gangsters.  Some of these families have been driven from their homes.  What right do these people have to go into a farmyard and brutalise the family with iron bars, to tie both the mother and father to the farmyard gate, to break their son's legs and place him in a van loaded with explosives and tell him to drive to the nearest Border post?  They have no right and have been given no mandate to do this.  This sickened many honest and decent people but I have to say that, unfortunately, it took incidents like this one to make them realise that these people were depraved.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Tunney, referred to the British-Irish Parliamentary group.  He has the great honour, along with members of Fine Gael and other parties in the House, of taking part in that group along with members of the British Parliament.  Last Monday, I had the great honour as chairman of Cavan County Council of hosting a civic reception for a sub-committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary group when they visited the border region.  I can assure Members of the House that 25 years ago such a reception would not have been held.  This is an indication that there has been a change in thinking. People in the area accepted invitations to attend and came to greet the members of the sub-committee.  We had a wonderful evening and a great discussion.  We hope that good will flow from it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of their visit was to see how cross-Border tourism could be promoted. In this regard I was given some interesting figures which were the source of some alarm.  Twenty-five years ago the concept of cross-Border co-operation in relation to the promotion of tourism was actively examined.  However, the Troubles put an end to that process.  In 1990, 19 per cent of visitors to Northern Ireland were tourists.  The remainder were made up by those visiting their families <Col N="237" /> or on business trips.  On the other hand, in the same year, 38 per cent of visitors to the Republic were holidaymakers. I was surprised to learn that 17 per cent of visitors to Northern Ireland were from the Republic.  I did not realise that the number was so high &mdash; I do not have a breakdown to show the number who travelled on shopping excursions and so on &mdash; but as against this only 8 per cent of visitors to the Republic were from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Both parts of the island are actively promoting tourism and have so much to offer.  Reference has been made to the need for co-operation in the Louth-Down area, which includes the Mourne Mountains, the Donegal-Derry area and the Cavan-Fermanagh area which includes the lakeland districts.  I think it was a mistake to include my area which had been included in the midlands region in the north-west region.  The opportunity should have been taken to combine the Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim regions with Fermanagh as this forms a natural hinterland where one could promote fishing, sailing, boating and other water activities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnel canal which is a major waterway and which links the Shannon and the Erne to one of the greatest lake districts in the country and in Europe for that matter, has been opened-up.  Much play has been made of the fact that one can travel from Enniskillen to Limerick; there has to be two-way traffic.  I fail to understand why, following the war which took place in the Middle East, when money was spent in America to attract Americans to this country we did not encourage our neighbours in Northern Ireland to visit this country.  We have many things in common and should be able to work together.  If the will was there it should be possible to find common ground not only in the tourism industry but also in agriculture and industry so that we could work together.  However, that is the one question mark that hangs over this matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism, it should be possible to adopt common trading standards <Col N="238" /> and qualifications in the industry to ensure standardisation of the hotel classification system and twinning arrangements between hotels of similar standard on a cross-Border basis.  As I have said in relation to the Shannon and the Erne, a special development programme encompasses measures to improve angling, cruising, water sports and other facilities on the two river systems.  This is unprecedented.  Opportunities are available if we are prepared to grasp them.</P>
    <P>There is no businessman more hard-headed than the Northern Ireland businessman who knows how to get value for money.  Indeed, I welcome the news this evening that people are now coming across the Border to our petrol pumps. Up to now it was all one way traffic.  As I said, I regret that we have not had more time to debate this matter.  However, I welcome the statements which have been made in the House tonight.  This marks a step forward and I hope we will not have to divide on the issue at 8.30 p.m.  We should accept each other's point of view and reach an agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should hold this debate on inter-regional co-operation at this time when the nation is debating the Treaty on European Union.  I accept the point which has been made by a number of Deputies that it will be unfortunate if we have to divide on this issue.  I appeal to the Fine Gael Party who have tabled the motion to accept the amendment in the name of the Minister. It would not be a question of one side gaining a victory over the other.  The Minister clearly outlined the reasons his amendment should be accepted, particularly as it deals with the reality of the situation as it obtains.  We could all accept the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I perceive with Deputy Bruton's proposal is that it would create another layer of bureaucracy while having the present structures in place for drawing up various programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member recognises the benefit of co-operation with Northern Ireland in any effort to develop the economy of the <Col N="239" /> whole island.  We are all aware there are significant opportunities obtaining for further development in industry, trade, agriculture, natural resources, financial services, tourism, transport, environment, energy, human resources and health.</P>
    <P>I am glad that, during my time as Minister for Health, very substantial progress was made by way of co-operation with our Northern colleagues in many areas. I met about twice a year my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mr. Richard Needham, Lord Schlensdale and Jeremy Hanly, MP, during their time as Minister for Health.  We were agreed that, in both parts of the island where there is a population of 5 million people, it was appropriate there be co-operation not only to combat disease and promote good health but also to ensure that the money available on both sides of the border was spent to the maximum benefit of the people who needed medical attention and in the general interests of health promotion. That co-operation is reflected in a very positive manner in a number of areas.  For example, at national level, we provide, in the Meath Hospital, the Lithotripsy procedure, the crushing of kidney stones, for the whole island.  In return, at Belvoir Park Hospital in Belfast the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Security provide the total body irradiation for children awaiting bone marrow transplants for leukaemia.  Formerly they had to go to Glasgow.</P>
    <P>Such co-operation obtains in other areas such as examining the price of drugs on both sides of the Border and a joint campaign for the eradication of infectious diseases such as measles, mumps and German measles.  When we were purchasing a magnetic resonance machine which cost £1.5 million they were purchasing one in Northern Ireland and included in the tender documents issued was the question: what reduction would be available if a similar machine was purchased on the other side of the Border?</P>
    <P>Those are examples of the co-operation that obtains.  Of course, there are <Col N="240" /> other opportunities not alone at central level.  For example, also along the Border the North Eastern Health Board and their counterpart, the North Western Health Board, co-operate in the provision of services at local level.  Opportunities for further development operate at two levels; at the central level and at local level.  It is important that the Minister continues to take account of the local level.  A number of Deputies suggested, and the Minister says he would like to see the INTERREG programme extended to the whole country.  It is interesting that Deputies Leonard, Boylan, McGahon or myself do not subscribe to that proposal if it is at the expense of the border regions because the INTERREG programme has been a particularly useful one for them.  In drawing up of new INTERREG programme I ask the Minister to take account of the recommendations of the very worthwhile cross-Border bodies that exist, for example cross-Border economic groups, who represent elected repesentatives and officials of local authorities on both sides of the Border.  It is very frustrating for them to serve on such bodies for years and not have their views taken into account.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Fine Gael Party on tabling the motion but I ask them to accept the Minister's amendment.  We all recognise the importance of the preparation of complemetary economic development strategies to underpin the proposed development plans North and South.  It is also important to identify areas of possible co-operation within our development plans and maintain contact with the Northern Ireland authorities, in the preparation of our respective plans, in order to maximise the benefit from the Structural Funds in both parts of this island.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry, our deputy Leader, said that if agreement can be reached among the Whips, we would be happy not to divide the House on this issue.  I understand that some efforts are being made to reach that happy solution, something I would like very much.  Most <Col N="241" /> Members will know that, throughout my political career, I have been a very strong advocate of cross-party agreement in this House in relation to Northern Ireland, an attitude I have long followed.  Certainly I would very much regret if it was necessary to force this motion to a vote.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Barry with great interest on the subject.  I listened to the plea of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in relation to the subject and his appeal not to divide the House on a motion on which we were in basic agreement.  I hope his hope and mine will be fulfilled.  I wish to pay a personal tribute to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the interest he has shown, the great sympathy he has for the Northern Ireland problem, and the hard work in which he has been involved over a number of years, north and south of the border, to find a solution to this problem. Indeed, his position in the British/Irish Interparliamentary group has been a culmination of many years of effort.  I shall have some comments to make on that at a later stage but it would be my hope that, through the deliberations of that group, we will find ourselves nearer to a solution to these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all of the participants in this debate.  Everybody would agree that it has been useful, constructive and has ranged widely over many subjects not mentioned in the motion or in the amendment.  Indeed, on occasions, I thought I was listening to a continuation of another debate which took place yesterday.  That was not necessarily a bad thing because it was a timely reminder &mdash; that Northern Ireland, as an issue is extremely important and is very central to many people's thinking in relation to the Maastricht Treaty.  If, in the course of this debate, we have established in the minds of a small number of people that there ought to be an attitude of thinking about Northern <Col N="242" /> Ireland, an examination of each issue as it arises in our parliamentary life in relation to Northern Ireland, asking ourselves what effect will decisions have on the Northern Ireland problem, on the people of Northern Ireland, on relationships North and South then this debate will have been extremely useful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring told us to think European. I agree with him but it is more than that.  We should think Irish as well as European; have a European mentality; have an Irish mentality but, for God's sake, do not have a partitionist mentality. As I have said on a number of occasions, I have had to recognise that, unfortunately, over the 70 years of our divided country, a partitionist mentality has grown up.  It has grown up on this side of the Border, in some respects, even more than it has developed on the other side of the Border.  There is a partitionist mentality among people, although they do not recognise it as such.  It has become so ingrained it is almost a natural reflex with them.  On occasions they become very annoyed when told they have a partitionist mentality, but if some of those people are made to question their attitudes as a result of this debate that will be beneficial.</P>
      <P>Dr. George Quigley has been much quoted in the debate, and no better man to quote.  I do not know him very well as Chairman of the Ulster Bank but certainly in my previous political existence on the other side of the Border I knew him as a much esteemed, respected, extremely capable civil servant at a time when there were not too many of them about, and a man for whom I have the highest respect on all aspects of his career.  He was the one who said we should build an island economy.  Both North and South would have signally failed to give substance to the 1992 concept if, occupying a small island on the periphery of the EC, they neglected or were unable to function as a single market.  That could be the theme of this debate and of our endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common ground among all the political parties in Northern Ireland that the British administration performed <Col N="243" /> extremely badly when allocations from the increased Structural Funds were last made in 1989.  Northern Ireland received an increase of only 9 per cent compared with an increase of 78 per cent for the Republic, 109 per cent for Portugal, 171 per cent for Greece and 147 per cent for Spain.  To make matters worse, because qualification for the Cohesion Fund is based on countries rather than regions, Northern Ireland does not qualify for any assistance from that fund.  It can, therefore, be taken for granted that, irrespective of the knee-jerk reaction of certain politicians, any development which had promise of additional EC funding would be welcomed on a cross-community basis in Northern Ireland; a joint approach by both Governments which would maximise our funding potential would also be to our advantage here in the South.</P>
    <P>Inevitably there will be those who will search for a hidden agenda and will be grievously disappointed if they cannot find one.  I listened to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, saying Rome was not built in a day.  That is not the hidden agenda, I would say, to our Unionist friends in Northern Ireland.  I would not like to disappoint those who look for a hidden agenda.  Let me provide one for them.  The only hidden agenda in this debate is provided in the words of Deputy John Bruton, Leader of the Opposition, speaking in the House last Wednesday when he said that the European Single Market, the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds gave the two parts of Ireland a unique chance to build a structure of peace on this island based on more trade between us, not on the supremacy of one tradition over the other.  Surely that is an agenda worth pursuing.</P>
    <P>Increased opportunities to build the structure of peace also represent the most cogent of all arguments for a vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty.  Whatever disagreement there may be over the effects of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, one thing is clear: the British have already decided to ratify the Treaty on European unity, and if we <Col N="244" /> vote against it, then Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will be in different categories of membership of the Community.  If that disaster were to befall us, then the whole process of what appeared to be the inevitable dismantling of barriers, North and South, will be reversed.  That cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>There are, Sir, as you well know, a number of organisations working away quietly, doing tremendous work for reconciliation, some doing it for years, without looking for any praise for it.  In this category Co-operation North has to be mentioned.  Brainchild of Dr. Brendan O'Regan, he and they have shown great sensitivity, great dexterity, to overcome what would have appeared to many to be insurmountable problems.  I would like to place on record my thanks and my admiration for the practical and sensitive job they have done.</P>
    <P>There is also the International Fund for Ireland which, as Members will know, is an international organisation established by the British and Irish Governments in 1986 with the objectives of promoting economic and social advance and encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland.  Contributors to the funds are the US, Canada, New Zealand and the EC.  The international fund is doing tremendous work.  I would like to have the time and the opportunity to put on record some of the work that has been done through that fund in the North and in those parts of the Republic which are close to the Border.  On another occasion maybe we should seek a debate in this House on the International Fund because in the US and elsewhere malicious people have tried to deride the fund.  I am an extremely strong supporter of it, and all of us in this House ought to be so.  Indeed, there may be a lesson to be learned from the activities under the International Fund in Northern Ireland that extend to the Border areas of the Republic.  There may be a job for a similar organisation in other areas of the Republic to do what the fund is currently doing in Northern Ireland, which <Col N="245" /> is focusing scarce resources on particular problems and particular areas, coordinating those funds with other funds that are available from all State, semi-State and private interests.</P>
    <P>Then there is the Ireland Fund &mdash; not to be confused with the International Fund for Ireland &mdash; the Ireland Fund of the US, of Canada, of Britain, of Australia and of New Zealand, which over many years has been doing tremendous work.  Many organisations in Northern Ireland, cross-community and in disadvantaged areas, owe their existence and progress to the Ireland Fund.  Also it has the great advantage that it takes away funds that in the ordinary course of events might go to Noraid and other extremist organisations, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>Pleas have been made for the Unionists to join the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body, and I join in those pleas.  In doing so I join not only with members of this House but with honourable Members of the British House of Commons and the British House of Lords who are Unionist in sympathy.  There are two or three reasons for joining that organisation without loss of face to themselves. It pre-dates the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It has nothing to do with the Anglo-Irish Agreement <i>per se</i>, so that should not discourage them from joining. It was set up not by the British Government, not by the Irish Government but by these Houses of the Oireachtas and the Parliament at Westminister.  I urge Unionists to participate; their friends already urge them to do so.</P>
    <P>While I was preparing for this debate I took time to examine the report which the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body, Committee B, prepared in October 1980, headed &ldquo;Co-ordination Within the European Community in the Context of Regional Aid and Associated Areas&rdquo;.  In that report we will find most of the ideas which have been mentioned here in this House this evening and yesterday evening and the common problems we have between the two islands and in Europe, the priorities, the need for infrastructural development, <Col N="246" /> the Structural Funds, energy, agriculture and fisheries.  I quote the draft resolution at the end:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this Assembly considers that Ireland and the United Kingdom's joint membership of the European Community provides an excellent opportunity for further developing the strong economic ties between the two countries; believes that it is in the interests of the people of the whole of Ireland, for the governments in Dublin and London, to deal with the European Community in a spirit of co-operation rather than competition, and calls for a strong commitment by both governments to cross-border initiatives which meet the objectives of the EC Structural Funds&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is what we have been saying in this House.  I hope the House will be able to agree to this proposal.  Supporting this motion and the thought which lies behind it is in line with the concept of living and working for Ireland but not shedding blood for Ireland.  That is the way forward.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform the House that the Government are withdrawing their amendment.  I am delighted at that decision.  The motion is being agreed with some amendment.  This debate has produced a worthwhile response, which is what Deputy Bruton sought when he introduced the motion.  May it be the first of many occasions on which I am on the winning side &mdash; one could not be on a better winning side &mdash; in this House.  All of us are on the winning side this evening.</P>

However, widespread concern has been expressed by the patients, their relatives and staff of the hospital about the proposal, which is now before the South Eastern Health Board, to move 80 non-ambulant patients from St. Patrick's Geriatric Hospital in Cashel to St. Luke's Psychiatric Hospital.  This proposal is contrary to the concept of integrating psychiatric patients into the community contained in the excellent document on psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future</i>, published by the Minister's Department.  This proposal is contrary to that concept as it proposes to move patients from a geriatric institution, where they have been for a long number of years, to a psychiatric campus.  I understand that this proposal was put forward in view of the fire hazard in St. Mary's ward in St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel. Even though fire escapes were provided in this hospital not very long ago obviously they are not adequate.  Our primary concern is for the safety of these patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated by the board of the hospital that the cost of removing these patients will be approximately £97,000.  I <Col N="248" /> suggest to the Minister that this money could more usefully be spent in refurbishing the ground floor accommodation in St. Patrick's Hospital so as to ensure that it would not be a fire hazard.  Under a rationalisation programme, this accommodation was recently vacated and laundry and kitchen services were centralised in St. Luke's Hospital.  This proposal could contain a hidden agenda; it may even be a sinister move on the part of the health board.  I ask the Minister to ask his Department to initiate immediately an investigation into this proposal as the health board will make a request to the Minister for funding to refurbish accommodation in St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel, to accommodate these patients.</P>
    <P>This proposal is a backward step.  We must have some regard for the patients and their relatives.  We must also bear in mind the fire risks which exist in the hospital.  I accept that patients from Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel would like to be closer to home, but St. Patrick's Hospital is the established geriatric unit for County Tipperary.  This hospital, which has provided a service for 150 years, was recently commemorated by a tremendous ceremony there.  Books have been written about the hospital.  As I said, this proposal is a backward step. The hospital has already lost its kitchen and laundry facilities.  The hospital authorities accepted this decision because it was part of a cost-saving and rationalisation exercise.  However, they do not want to lose half their patients.  I plead with the Minister not to accede to this request from the health board and to use his influence and that of his Department to use this money to refurbish St. Patrick's Hospital so that it will not be a fire hazard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that the public representatives in the South-Eastern Health Board area are very attentive to this matter.  Deputy Ferris, Deputy Davern, Senator McCarthy and Senator Byrne have raised this matter with me.  I congratulate them all on their vigilance in <Col N="249" /> bringing this very important issue to my attention in such a speedy manner.</P>
      <P>A proposal from the management of the South-Eastern Health Board to transfer patients from St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, to alternative accommodation in Clonmel is on the agenda of the special hospitals committee of the South-Eastern Health Board who will meet tomorrow, Thursday, 11 June.  The committee will consider the issues involved and recommend a course of action for decision by the health board.  The question of alternative accommodation for patients in St. Patrick's Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  I will await their decision in due course.</P>
      <P>I wish to give the background to this issue.  Following a recent inspection of St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, the fire authority came to the conclusion that the existing means of escape from the upper floors of the hospital were inadequate for the ready evacuation of non-ambulant patients.  The authority immediately notified the South-Eastern Health Board that they considered it necessary as a matter of urgency that such persons be relocated in suitable ground floor wards which had an adequate means of escape.  I believe all of us would agree with that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a subsequent letter they asked for details of the board's plan for these patients.  I understand that the estimated cost of complying with the fire officer's requirement is approximately £400,000. In view of the high costs of carrying out the fire precautions to the first floor accommodation in St. Patrick's Hospital it is proposed by the management to transfer 35 non-ambulant patients from the south of the county to a soon to be vacated free standing unit at St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel.  This unit is away from the main hospital campus.  Existing long-stay patients in Cashel would not be moved without their agreement.  Any proposed transfers would be discussed with patients and their families.  The unit would cater for elderly patients, mainly from the southern end of the county, including Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir. The assessment rehabilitation unit for the <Col N="250" /> elderly in south Tipperary would remain at St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel.  As the free standing unit would no longer be part of St. Luke's Hospital, management feel there would be no conflict between the proposal to transfer elderly patients to it and the policy in relation to psychiatric services as outlined in the document <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>
    <P>St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, and the unit in Clonmel would be operated jointly as part of a unified service and both would be under the nursing management of the matron at St. Patrick's Hospital.  Existing permanent nursing and non-nursing staff in Cashel would be given the option of transferring to Clonmel but it is not envisaged that there would be any compulsory staff transfers. Catering and laundry services for the Clonmel unit would be provided by the central laundry and the central kitchen which supply existing Clonmel hospitals. The non-pay costs would be met within existing budgets.  There would be four nursing posts, one non-nursing post and a part-time medical post, and a sessional physiotherapy and occupational therapy post would be required in addition to the existing staff.  The pay costs associated with the transfer of patients is estimated at £97,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this proposal will go before the special hospital committee of the board tomorrow &mdash; I compliment the Deputies and Senators concerned &mdash; and this committee will in due course make a recommendation for consideration by the full board.  In this context it may be premature to make a statement in relation to the proposal at this stage, but I have to say I would not be in favour of it.</P>

      <P>It is attempting to swim against the tide in proposing to bring elderly patients back to a location associated with a psychiatric hospital, when all our efforts at this time are, as Deputy Ferris rightly said to me today, devoted to transferring elderly patients away from psychiatric hospitals.  This is an important <Col N="251" /> proposal in the Green Paper on the Psychiatric Services which I launched last week.  I trust that we can rely on the good sense of the board members not to approve this proposal but to ask the management to come up with alternative options for meeting the requirements of the fire officer in this instance.</P>

      <P>Tarbert comprehensive school was opened in September 1973.  It was an amalgamation of Glin vocational school, St. Ita's College, Tarbert, and the private secondary school, Glin.  It had 2,000 students then with one junior woodwork room and one junior metalwork room.  In 1978 the building was adapted internally.  However, no extra technology rooms were provided but it allowed for junior and senior studies to take place in the same room.  In 1985 a new extension was opened which enabled the school to cater for 575 pupils. Unfortunately, no provision was made on that occasion for senior practical studies. From 1987 to 1989 discussions took place with the Department of Education regarding the provision of separate senior rooms for engineering technology and building technology.  The final detailed design submission was made by the school's architect to the building unit of the Department on 2 April last.  The project now awaits release to tender.  The final design is for an extension in the region of 461 square metres.  The existing accommodation cannot meet the demand for technological subjects.  The school has an outstanding reputation in this area and I would not like to see it diminished now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents' representatives who have been lobbying the Oireachtas representatives <Col N="252" /> of north Kerry and west Limerick are very concerned lest any further undue delay should adversely affect their children's education.  At present there is an intolerable problem regarding the provision of space in the two rooms available as they are used by five teachers, and there will be an even greater problem in September with the increased intake.  The parents feel that the skills concerned &mdash; namely, engineering, construction and drawing &mdash; are extremely important, particularly as there are a number of large organisations in the catchment area of the school, such as the ESB stations in Tarbert and Moneypoint, Aughinish Alumina, Kerry Group and Foynes Harbour.  It is feared that up to 80 to 100 students could be deprived of these facilities after September, with the resultant depletion in the future skills base in the area.</P>
    <P>The five teachers of the practical science subjects in the school are very concerned at the undue delay in providing senior accommodation for engineering and construction studies.  They feel that the totally unsatisfactory arrangement of having practical classes taught in ordinary classrooms has gone on for too long.  It has put undue pressure on students and teachers and has made a mockery of the subjects concerned.  The teachers have decided to refuse to take junior and senior examinations classes as they are unavoidably but contemporaneously timetabled with effect from 1 September 1992.  They have passed on their concern to their respective unions, the TUI and the ASTI, and also to the school's parents' association and the parents' association for community and comprehensive schools.  I appeal to the Minister to sanction this extension as soon as possible.  Tarbert comprehensive school has been a major success story and it is vital, if this success story is to continue, that the extension is provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Deenihan in this matter.  Although Tarbert is just inside the north Kerry border, many people from County Limerick, <Col N="253" /> from places such as Ballynahill, Loghill, Athea and Glin, attend this fine institution.  It has a very good reputation for education in the area and, as Deputy Deenihan quite rightly said, the Shannon estuary area has been fortunate in relation to industrial development. Indeed that school has acted as the power-house in providing many of the skills for the area.  I would not like to think that pupils would be turned away from the school in September due to a lack of accommodation, which will be the inevitable consequence if the extension is not sanctioned.  It is a tribute to the success of the school that so many pupils are trying to get into it.  I fully support Deputy Deenihan's case.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for raising this matter and I am glad to be in a position to outline the up-to-date position with regard to this project.  This project involves the provision of additional specialist facilities at Tarbert comprehensive school.  The complete project will provide 460 square metres of additional accommodation involving additional specialist classrooms to provide for senior metalwork and woodwork and building construction as well as an additional general classroom and other ancillary spaces.  The estimated cost of providing this accommodation is £250,000.</P>
      <P>As can be seen, the accommodation to be provided is of a specialist nature.  The school is not significantly short of classroom accommodation as such but is lacking in these specialist facilities which prevent it from offering the optimum level of service which it would be in a position to provide when these new facilities are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The architectural planning of these facilities is nearing completion.  The latest stage of the planning process, the combined detail design bill of quantities stage, is being examined.  When this stage of planning has been satisfactorily completed the next stage of planning will be the invitation to tender.  When the project is ready to go to tender the question <Col N="254" /> of advancement will have to be considered in the context of the many projects on hand and the finance available.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would have to be honest and concede that the Department of Education have many more projects in planning than there is finance to allow to start. At present the 1992 capital allocation is fully committed but the Department will be reviewing the cash flow position regularly before the end of the year to establish if any additional projects could advance to construction.  The position of Tarbert comprehensive school will be examined carefully in the context of these reviews, when the project is ready to go to tender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. My contention is that the Department of Education are refusing to recognise chronic fatigue syndrome as a disease which can incapacitate a teacher for many years.  In this case the Department have decided to cast serious doubt on the best specialist opinion on the disease which is available in this country.  I have information to suggest that the chief medical officer is prejudiced in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application by this teacher for early retirement was refused because the Department officials and the chief medical officer do not believe that the disease can incapacitate a person for very many years.  This teacher was referred by the Department to a heart specialist for a decision on his condition.  While the heart specialist is an eminent man in his own field, how can he be expected to make a fair judgement in an area of medicine in which he does not specialise?  Professor Feighery who specialises in immunology in St. James's Hospital has verified for the Department that in this case the teacher's condition is likely to be permanent.  Dr. Webb, who also specialises in the treatment of this disease, has done likewise. So also has Dr. Peter Moran, the GP who has treated this teacher for more than <Col N="255" /> four years.  Yet, this body of medical opinion was cast aside on the basis of an opinion from a heart specialist.</P>
    <P>Chronic fatigue syndrome also known as ME, known also as &ldquo;yuppie 'flu&rdquo; is a very modern phenomenon in so far as it has only been recognised as a disease in the past decade or so.  It is difficult to diagnose and quite obviously it is not yet recognised by some people including the officials in the Department of Education. The disease is very real and those who suffer from it are unable to continue working.  Some people recover after a time but in other cases recovery can be very slow indeed.  In this case the individual has not recovered after more than four years.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that early retirement is not permanent.  As far as I can gather it is subject to review every two years.  I request that the Minister order an immediate review of this application. This teacher should be offered early retirement in his present condition and should he make a complete recovery the Department will be able to reverse that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cotter for raising this matter.  The position is that paragraph 18 (i) (b) (ii) of the 1929 secondary teachers' superannuation scheme allows for the payment of a disability pension where the teacher:</P>
      <P>Satisfies the Minister for Finance that while actually serving as a teacher he has become incapable from infirmity of body or mind of discharging the duties of a teacher and that such infirmity is likely to be permanent.</P>
      <P>In this connection the scheme also requires that:</P>
      <P>Where a person applied for a pension on the grounds of infirmity of body or mind, such a person shall furnish to the Minister medical evidence of his condition and shall, if so required by the Minister for Finance, submit to such medical examinations as that Minister may direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> Where an application for disability pension is made to my Department, the matter is referred to the chief medical officer for the public service for his advice and recommendation.  This procedure was adopted in this case but the chief medical officer did not consider that the granting of a disability pension was warranted in his case.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Department must be guided in such cases by their professional advice.  I should add that in the case under reference, the chief medical officer sought a second opinion in the matter and arranged for a specialist to examine the teacher.  Having considered all the available medical advice, including the second opinion sought, the chief medical officer gave his views to my Department.  The teacher in question appealed the decision on a number of occasions but each time the chief medical officer confirmed his opinion.  In the circumstances, I trust that the Deputy will agree that a disability pension cannot be granted in this case. In view of the Deputy's special interest in this case I will have the matter further examined and will communicate with him in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue.  I am absolutely dismayed that Wicklow County Council this week were forced, fearing that they would have to pay compensation, to grant the necessary permission to Bridge Farm Limited to recommence tree felling a Tomnafinnogue Wood in County Wicklow. This is the last remnant of native oak wood in County Wicklow.  It is a part of Ireland's national heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision follows directly on the decision made by the Minister for Energy and his Department to effectively reverse the actions taken by the Government in 1987, when the Taoiseach intervened to save this woodland.  I said at the time that no thinking person could allow the company or their agents to come, equipped with a chainsaw within a five mile <Col N="257" /> radius of an oak tree.  However, I fear that this has happened.</P>
    <P>I wish to specifically raise the action taken late last night and early this morning in the woods at Tomnafinnogue, requiring the Minister's approval.  This morning the tags identifying all mature trees in Tomnafinnogue Wood were removed by a group of people responding to the county council's decision.  The action by &ldquo;Friends of Tomnafinnogue Wood&rdquo; arises from frustration, but it is intended to make it impossible for Bridge Farm Limited to comply with the felling licence issued by the Department of Energy.  The licence stipulates specifically that trees identified by numbered metal tags may be felled during each cycle over the next ten years.  With the tags removed from all the trees now the conditions laid down by the licensing authority cannot be adhered to without a new census of trees taking place, without a new licence being obtained and without new planning permission being obtained.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's intention in this matter?  What guarantees can the Minister give to the House that the firm who have destroyed the other woodlands at Coolattin and who have so blatantly ignored the previous conditions, will not commence felling, or will not be allowed to fell until such time as appropriate action has been taken by them to re-establish their rights to fell?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is as concerned as I am in this matter.  Will the Minister use his good offices to bring Bridge Farm to their senses and will he urge them to sit down with all those concerned to establish a trust on the lines of the Blasket Island Trust to buy out that woodland, to save it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I utterly refute the allegation made by Deputy Roche that Wicklow County Council were forced to make a certain decision because of some action on my part.  I suggest that Deputy Roche should familiarise himself with legislation that applies in this area.  I do not have responsibility for the preservation of amenities.  That is a role given under the <Col N="258" /> Acts of the Oireachtas to the local authority, in this case, Wicklow County Council, who have full powers under the Acts to preserve this wood if that is their desire.  I do not have the power under the Forestry Acts to preserve it.  My Department's forestry role and responsibilities lie in the commercial area and that is what I am promoting.</P>
      <P>I have inquired, however, into the removal of tags which the Deputy states took place yesterday.  It has been investigated by the owners of the property today and the owners have confirmed that the tags had been removed.  They state that this was not done by the company or its agents and they have requested the Garda to investigate.  I understand that they are also taking advice on measures to prevent trespass on their property.  I assure the Deputy that the removal of these tags will not interfere unduly with the monitoring of the licence.  Such tags are not normally associated with licences and were put in place by the company for their own purposes some years ago.  They relate to a register of the trees kept by the company. Removal of the tags at this stage is of no benefit to the company.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the regeneration plan to which I have agreed is based on a foresty management method known as the group system which has been drawn up by the professional foresters in my Department and is in accord with the best international silviculture practices.  It involves cutting selected mature trees in patches, each covering less than half a hectare, and fully replanting the patch which, together with retention of all younger trees, avoids the sudden impact caused by clear felling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roche, the other Deputies for the Wicklow constituency and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, were kept informed of the position when this plan was being prepared.  The patches of trees involved have been separately identified on the ground and have been mapped. These records alone would be sufficient to monitor the felling of the trees under the licence.  In addition, my staff have <Col N="259" /> spent considerable time on the site and are very familiar with the requirements.</P>
    <P>The preservation of woodlands or individual trees for amenity or landscape purposes is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  These considerations are reflected in conditions attached to the consent issued by Wicklow County Council, of which Deputy Roche is a member. These incidentally also mean that felling will not take place immediately.  References to imminent felling of the trees as reported on the radio this morning are inaccurate.  Arrangements to ensure compliance with the conditions is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>I regard Tomnafinnogue Wood as without doubt a plantation of great interest and outstanding local amenity.  I am very familiar with it, having spent a number of hours inspecting it about two years ago, shortly after I was appointed <Col N="260" /> Minister.  I again confirm that there is no proposal to clear-fell the wood.  There is no question of this oak woodland being under threat, except that caused by continuing neglect and advancing age unless remedial measures are taken.  It will in fact be rejuvenated and restocked for the benefits of future generations who will thank us in time for the actions we are taking now which will preserve woodlands at Tomnafinnogue for generations to come.</P>
    <P>I again assure the House that my Department will monitor the silvicultural operations closely to ensure that essential felling is undertaken in a most sensitive way.  I expect the owners to deliver precisely on the requirements for each stage. If they do not, no further felling will be allowed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 June 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The total asset value of Irish pension funds at the end of 1990 was estimated to be IR£8,100 million.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Act, 1990 which came into effect in January, 1991 safeguards the interests of members of occupational pension schemes by setting down minimum standards which all schemes will have to comply with.  It provides for a regulatory framework for the future supervision of pension schemes.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Act include the introduction of a statutory minimum funding standard for certain funded schemes, the mandatory disclosure of information to scheme members and clarification of the duties and responsibilities of scheme trustees.  The Act also provides for the establishment of a new statutory board to monitor and supervise the new statutory requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new minimum funding standard is designed to ensure that, over a period, there are sufficient funds in a scheme to meet liabilities in the event of the scheme being wound up.  Under the disclosure <Col N="99" /> provisions the trustees of a scheme are required to produce annual reports and audited accounts of their scheme and to disclose a comprehensive range of other information to members concerning the operation and the financial procedures of the scheme.  There are strict penalties for trustees of schemes who fail to comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Overall I am satisfied that these measures provide a high degree of security of members pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Pensions Act provides for equal treatment for men and women in occupational pension schemes.  A recent survey of pension schemes reveals that there are some areas where differences still exist.</P>
    <P>&mdash;5 per cent of schemes surveyed had different retirement ages for men and women.</P>
    <P>&mdash;12 per cent schemes surveyed have provision made for payment of widows pensions to the survivors of male members of the scheme, but no provision is made for the payment of widower's pension to the survivors of female scheme members.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board have advised me to bring the provisions of Part VII of the Act into effect form 1 January 1993.  I will shortly be introducing an order bringing Part VII into effect from that date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have approved the establishment of an interdepartmental Task Force to assist in the preparation of the White Paper and Charter on voluntary activity.  This Task Force will report to the Government by the end of October 1992.  It would be my intention to submit a draft White Paper to the Government by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The Government have also approved a package of measures to facilitate consultation with and involvement of the voluntary sector in the process of preparing the White Paper and Charter. These measures include the setting up of an expert group which will be made up of people with a wide exprience of voluntary activity and a detailed working knowledge of the issues facing the voluntary sector.  Opportunities will also be provided for voluntary groups to make their views known directly to the Task Force.</P>
      <P>The White Paper will look at issues in relation to how State support for the voluntary sector might be better co-ordinated. A possible way to achieve this would be through the establishment of a central unit which would provide a service of information on the range of voluntary and community work taking place and the range of supports available to those involved in this work from the State, EC and other sources.  Such a unit could be a focal point for both the voluntary and statutory agencies, not only for information purposes, but for the implementation of practical ways in which to co-ordinate and improve the services being provided by both sectors in the area of voluntary and community activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention that the funding of Community Development projects in selected areas by my Department has led to the appointment of full-time community development workers in those areas and the setting up of locally based resource centres which act as a focal point for community development.  These centres facilitate the networking of voluntary community groups active in the area.  At present there are twenty one projects in <Col N="101" /> the programme.  The budget for 1992 is £1.25 million, which will allow for expansion of the programme later this year.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of facilitating the development of voluntary organisations, I am making a special grant this year of £20,000 to Barnardos for the provision of a centralised administrative service for a number of small voluntary organisations.  Arrangements are being made at present to get this service up and running.  I will be interested in the outcome of ths pilot project which may provide a model for future developments.</P>

      <P>An amnesty against prosecution was available for employers between March and December of last year as part of my Department's anti-fraud campaign.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my reply to a Dáil Question on 25 February last, that it is not possible to identify separately from other PRSI receipts the amounts collected by or remitted to the Revenue Commissioners directly as a result of the operation of the amnesty.</P>
      <P>The amnesty was a special and probably once-off arrangement to allow employers time to regularise their affairs. My Department initiated a major stepping up of control measures in 1991 and this campaign will continue and may be further intensified.</P>
      <P>Should there be a future amnesty I will examine the feasibility, and the staff resources required, to maintain a separate record of amnesty receipts.  I cannot give a commitment not to establish such a record.</P>

      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government is committed to the following: (a) to continue to protect social welfare rates against inflation; (b) to move by 1993 to the priority level of rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, and (c) thereafter, to increase social welfare rates further and progressively, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, as the resources of the economy grow.</P>
      <P>In recent years, social welfare payments have more than kept pace with inflation. Long-term rates are generally above the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The lowest short term rates have been increased substantially, by 11 per cent in 1991 and a further 6 per cent from the end of July this year.</P>
      <P>This year's budget increases in social welfare payments represent additional expenditure of £140 million in a full year. It would cost a further £340 million annually to introduce, in full, the rates proposed by the Commission.  It is clear that this can only be achieved in the context of further growth in the economy.  I will continue to keep payment levels under review within the framework of the Commission's proposals, in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>I believe it is important that people should be able to contribute, over their working lives, to a basic level of pension.  As many as possible of the elderly should have the security of knowing that they have a right to such a pension. The policy in recent years has been to extend the categories of people paying social insurance so that additional groups like the self-employed now have access to state pensions.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing pensions is growing and will continue to grow as more people build up entitlements to contributory pensions.  For example, expenditure on the pensions referred to by the Deputy has more than doubled in the last ten years.  I am of course concerned about the financing of the system and our capacity to meet the costs in the longer term.  I am also conscious, however, of the need to protect the entitlements of vulnerble groups, and I have no plans at present to means test contributory pensions on the lines outlined.</P>
      <P>I might add that the final report of the National Pensions Board on the development of a pensions system is expected shortly and the future structure of pensions generally will be reviewed in the light of the board's report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>All promised legislation has now been enacted by the Oireachtas.  This includes the annual Social Welfare Acts, which are designed to give effect to the various improvements in the social welfare code, as provided for in the budget, and the Pensions Act, 1990, which provides for the establishment of the Pensions Board and for the regulation of occupational pension schemes.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced my intention of having the social welfare legislation re-consolidated.  I intend that a new Consolidation Bill will be enacted by the beginning of next year, prior to the introduction of the 1993 Social Welfare Bill.  In order to facilitate the consolidation process, I will be introducing legislation shortly for the purposes of streamlining certain existing legislative provisions.</P>
      <P>Apart from certain provisions contained in the recent Social Welfare Act, 1992, which will be brought into effect by Commencement Orders, all of the provisions contained in the Social Welfare Acts and the Pensions Act, 1990 have been brought into effect, other than the following provisions.</P>
      <P>Sections 19 and 20 of the Social Welfare Act, 1991 provide for amendments to the contribution conditions for receipt of Unemployment Benefit and Invalidity Pension as a consequence of the extension of social insurance, from 6 April, 1991, to all workers earning £25 or more a week.  These provisions will be brought into effect from the beginning of January, 1993, when the social insurance contributions paid since April, 1991 will become effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part VII of the Pensions Act, 1990 provides for the implementation of the requirements of EC Directive 86/378, which relates to the implementation of the principle of equal treatment in occupational benefit schemes.  This Part is due to come into force not later than 1 January, 1993.  Section 62 of the Pensions Act, 1990 deals with selection by members of funded schemes of persons <Col N="105" /> for appointment as trustees.  This provision will be brought into force by 1 January, 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already announced, I am examining the feasibility of introducing a single social assistance scheme, with standard rates of payment, in place of the range of assistance schemes which now exist.  I see this as a way of eliminating many of the complexities which exist within the present social welfare system, with different schemes, rates of payment and conditions of entitlement.</P>
      <P>I see the introduction of a single means test for all social assistance schemes as an essential prerequisite to the introduction of a unified scheme.  I am currently examining the feasibility of rationalising the present means tests into a unified test which would be applied to all social assistance schemes.  Clearly there are complex issues to be resolved in this regard because of the fundamental differences which exist at present.  However, I hope to have proposals finalised shortly for inclusion in a forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>As the House is already aware, a formal offer of settlement proposals has been made to the Irish Dental Association which I am confident will bring about an end to this long-running dispute and ensure that dependent spouses of qualified insured persons will again be treated by all dentists participating in the dental benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>The Irish Dental Association, in accordance with its rules, is conducting a ballot of its members and that ballot is underway at present.  Unfortunately, the postal dispute delayed the issue of the ballot papers.  I understand from the association that a result of the ballot should be available in time for their National Council meeting on Saturday, 13 June 1992.  I am confident of a positive outcome and that the intended implementation date of the beginning of July 1992 for the new arrangements will stand.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the settlement proposals comprise the introduction of a new contract for dentists participating in the scheme and a revised schedule of fees for dental treatment provided under the scheme.  The new dental contract is designed to more adequately reflect modern dental practices and includes mechanisms for improved consultation with the dental profession and improved monitoring of standards which will ultimately lead to a better quality of service for the patient.  The revised schedule of fees for treatment carried out under the scheme will give participating dentists a fair and economic return for their professional services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in implementing the social welfare commitments contained in the Review of the Programme for Government 1989-1993.  A full itemised list of achievements over the past few years would be quite lengthy and, accordingly, in the interests of brevity I propose to give a brief summary of the main achievements to date.</P>
      <P>Firstly, there is an ongoing commitment to protecting the position of social welfare recipients.  Over the last five years, the percentage increases in payment rates have either equalled or exceeded the prevailing rate of inflation. This year's budget improvements provided for a general increase of 4 per cent, which is once again ahead of inflation, and a further increase of 2 per cent (making 6 per cent in all) in the lowest rates of payment.  This leaves us well placed in reaching the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare by 1993.</P>
      <P>Another commitment was to further develop support systems for families. Again, the budget improvements provided for an increase in the income limits for family income supplement which will, in effect, mean increases of between £9 and £11 for most recipients.  Measures were also taken to protect the families of deserting husbands when legislation was introduced to impose a liability on a deserting spouse to contribute towards the maintenance of his family and empowering my Department to pursue defaulters through the courts.</P>
      <P>Other developments may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; Unique RSI Number &mdash; progress is being made towards the introduction of a single unique identifying number, based on the current RSI number, which a person would retain throughout his or her life and use as a means <Col N="108" /> of identification for social welfare, tax and other State payments.  The function of allocating RSI numbers was transferred to my Department in 1991.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Flexibility within payment schemes&mdash; a charge has often been laid that social welfare payments were very restrictive in terms of what the recipients could and could not do without jeopardising their payments.  Over the past few years, a degree of flexibility was introduced to enable recipients of unemployment assistance to partake in educational and training programmes. There is also a facility whereby unemployed persons can work part-time while receiving a supplement from the Department. Under initiatives announced by the Taoiseach recently, payments equivalent to social welfare rates will be continued for up to 12 months to persons on long term unemployment who wish to engage in approved self-employment enterprises within 12 designated pilot areas.  Participants will also retain any existing secondary benefits such as fuel allowance, butter vouchers, medical cards, differential rents, etc.  These area-based initiatives also provide for the retention of these secondary entitlements for up to 12 months in cases where a person on long term unemployment enters paid employment.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Broadening of the insurance base &mdash; Social insurance pension coverage was extended to self-employed persons from 1988.  In 1991, part-time workers were brought in to the system when the Class A rate became payable in respect of earnings above £25. Part-time workers will from 1993 have access to short term benefits such as sickness and unemployment benefits on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis and to payments such as retirement and old age contributory pensions at the full rate.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Delivery of services&mdash;through a process of restructuring and regionalisation, my Department is devolving <Col N="109" /> responsibility for the delivery of services to local level.  In the future, local offices which traditionally dealt with unemployment payments only will be able to facilitate the needs of all social welfare claimants.</P>
    <P>Progress is also being made in a number of other areas.  The question of the relationship between social insurance cover and occupational pensions provisions will be considered in the light of the final report of the National Pensions Board which will be available shortly.  Progress is also being made on developing links with the voluntary sector, including the preparation of a White Paper and Charter for Voluntary Organisations.  Also, I am preparing proposals for a single means-test system for all social welfare assistance payments.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to communicate directly with the Deputy in this regard and provide any more detailed information on the level of progress to date which he may require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy there is no such policy of discriminating against women on availability grounds.  Claims for unemployment payments by women and married women in particular are treated no differently from claims generally.</P>
      <P>I will outline for the Deputy the conditions that have to be satisfied by all applicants.</P>
      <P>It is a statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking but unable to find, suitable employment, having regard to age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances. These conditions are a common feature of unemployment schemes world-wide.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides also that the onus is on the individual claimants to prove that they are available for work.  It does not, however, state what form such proof should take.  It is accordingly a question for the deciding officers and appeals officers to decide whether any claimant has shown that he or she fulfils the condition having regard to the available evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All claimants are normally asked when making a claim for unemployment benefit <Col N="111" /> or assistance to complete a questionnaire regarding their availability to take up and efforts to find full time employment.  Claimants may also be asked subsequently at any stage of their claim about this matter.  In most cases, the replies given by claimants to this questionnnaire will, when taken in conjunction with other evidence available regarding the claimant's employment history, be sufficient to satisfy the deciding officer that the person concerned is available for and genuinely seeking work.  If, however, there is any element of doubt about the position, the deciding officer may seek further relevant information on such matters as.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extent to which the claimant has made efforts to obtain employment since becoming unemployed.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the type of work the claimant is seeking and the reasons for any restrictions which the claimant may be placing on the type of work he or she is available to do,</P>
    <P>&mdash;whether there are domestic or other commitments or circumstances which limit the claimant's ability to accept full-time employment which would normally be regarded as suitable,</P>
    <P>&mdash;whether the claimant has a history of leaving employments frequently, without good cause.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of the replies given to questions such as these that the deciding officer determines whether the person is or is not available for and genuinely seeking work.  Each case has to be considered on its own merits and it is a matter for the deciding officer to decide the exact evidence required in any case having regard to the individual circumstances of the claimant.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that the area of child care responsibilities can be a difficult and sensitive issue.  Staff in local offices are periodically reminded that the utmost care must be taken to ensure that any questions asked are relevant and that the <Col N="112" /> purpose of the questions should be explained so that the claimants will understand why they are necessary. Officers are also advised of the need to ensure that all claimants, both male and female, are subject to the same line of inquiry.  For instance a male claimant with young children would have to be queried about child care arrangements where his wife was working in exactly the same way as would be the case if it were she who was claiming instead.  This approach is designed to ensure that, in questioning claimants, there is no discrimination on grounds of sex, family or marital status.</P>
    <P>Claims are decided by locally-based deciding officers and any person who is dissatisfied has the right of appeal to the Social Welfare Office.</P>
    <P>In summary, my Department operates a clear policy of non-discrimination and where the wording of any statutory provisions underpinning the social welfare schemes is considered to be capable of being misconstrued or discriminatory, it is my policy to have it modified appropriately at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>The Government have decided to provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay in implementing Equal Treatment Directive on social welfare matters.  Payments will be made on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994.  A sum of £22 million has been made available in 1992 for the purpose of making the retrospective payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the measures to be introduced <Col N="113" /> will be announced within the next week.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently involved in identifying from its existing records all potential claimants to equal treatment arrears payments.  It is the intention to notify all such claimants on an individual basis of the new measures and invite them to formally apply for the arrears payments. It is estimated that up to 100,000 persons will qualify for such payments. A new central unit is being established to process these applications.</P>
    <P>Some 30,000 claims have been received in my Department for arrears of payments arising from the Directive.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to give credits to social welfare contributors on contributions rates other than A1 contributions who have had to transfer to the lower rate because of the change in employment regarding dental and optical benefit; if he would outline the cost of such changes and the numbers who would be affected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Treatment benefits are insurance based benefits which are available only to qualified insured persons, and their dependent spouses, who are paying reckonable rates of PRSI.  A person who is paying PRSI at a reckonable rate but whose employment subsequently becomes insurable at a reduced rate because of changes in his employment status can continue to be entitled to treatment benefits for a period of up to two years.  However, insurance cover thereafter is restricted to the specific <Col N="114" /> range of benefits and pensions covered by the PRSI contribution appropriate to his new employment.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 400,000 persons insured under the PRSI system at rates of contribution which do not provide cover for treatment benefits.  They include public sector workers and self-employed contributors.  It is not known how many of those would have previously paid Class A contributions.  It is estimated that the cost of extending treatment benefits to that group would cost in excess of £8 million in a full year and I have no plans for such an extension at the present time.</P>
      <P>Credited contributions are generally awarded in respect of periods of incapacity and unemployment which arise between periods of reckonable insurance and are, therefore, aimed at people who, for various reasons, are unable to continue to work and pay PRSI.  I have no plans for the award of credited contributions for the purposes of topping up benefit entitlements for persons already insured under the PRSI system at reduced rates of PRSI.</P>

      <P>The PRSI allowance was intended to reduce the burden imposed by Irish social welfare law on employees who paid contributions to the Social Insurance Fund at the high rates.  The Sealink employees are subject to a different social insurance regime; because they work on ships flying the UK flag, under EC law, they are required to pay social insurance contributions to the UK authorities.  There is no basis, therefore, for extending the PRSI allowance to the Sealink employees.</P>
      <P>Sealink employees who are resident in Ireland are subject to Irish tax and, apart from the PRSI allowance, these employees are granted the same range of allowances as other employees.  I am satisfied that the present treatment is equitable in that the availability of allowances to particular groups of workers is based on the possession by those workers of the relevant qualifying characteristics.</P>

      <P>Dublin Port is the principal multi-modal port in the country.  In 1990 it handled 52 per cent in value terms and 24 per cent in volume terms of the State's seaport trade.  With its pivotal position on the Central Corridor sea route Dublin Port will continue over the next five years to be a key port for Lo/Lo, Ro/Ro and bulk traffic.  In 1990 Dublin Port handled in volume terms 54 per cent of Ireland's Lo/Lo trade, 60 per cent of Ireland's Ro/Ro trade and 15 per cent of Ireland's bulk trade.</P>
      <P>Under the European Community's Operational Programme on Peripherality (OPP) the Dublin Port and Docks Board is providing additional port facilities to increase the port's capacity to handle Lo/Lo, Ro/Ro and solid bulk trade.</P>

      <P>Dublin Port and Docks Board and its terminal operators have been invited to put forward proposals for funding under both the upcoming Cohesion programme included in the Treaty on European Union and the expected follow-up post 1993 Structural Fund Programmes.</P>

    <P>Publicly funded research into cancer is primarily a matter for the Health Research Board.  The Board does not have any current research in progress into oral cancer.  However, I would refer the Deputy to a reply to a parliamentary question of 26 November 1991 &mdash; columns 926 to 928 &mdash; which dealt with cancer research generally and set out the position in relation to funding.</P>
    <P>Smoking is a major risk factor in oral cancer &mdash; particularly if associated with heavy alcohol use.  Many of the initiatives taken by my Department's Health Promotion Unit are targeted at these risk factors and, where appropriate, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Dental Health Foundation have been involved in these initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988 it is illegal to import, manufacture, sell or otherwise dispose of an oral smokeless tobacco product.  Such products are marketed towards young people and their use is implicated in certain oral cancers.</P>

      <P>The only specific provision on energy in the Treaty on European Union is the Declaration on Civil Protection, Energy and Tourism attached to the Treaty which provides that the question of including a specific Treaty provision on energy will be examined on the basis of a report which the Commission will submit to the Council by 1996 at the latest.</P>
      <P>Energy is also referred to in the Treaty chapter on Trans-European Networks. Article 129 allows the Community to contribute to the establishment of energy infrastructure networks.  The Council of Ministers and the European Parliament will be involved in the preparation of guidelines and programmes in this area and the Irish people will be able to influence policy through the Government and through their MEPs.</P>
      <P>No substantive change is made in the operating provisions of the EURATOM Treaty and thus voting procedures are unchanged.  However, because EURATOM shares its institutions with the EEC, changes in the institutional provisions of the EEC Treaty are applied also in the EURATOM Treaty through title IV of the European Union Treaty.</P>
      <P>These provisions provide greater power for the European Parliament and thus greater facility for the citizens to influence decisions.  For example, as in the case of actions under the EEC Treaty individual citizens will be able to petition the European Parliament and take up grievances with the Community Ombudsman.  The Parliament will be able to set up committees of inquiry. Other significant institutional changes introduced in line with similar changes in the EEC Treaty include increased powers for the Court of Justice to enforce its decisions in areas covered by EURATOM.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for overflights of the State by foreign military aircraft, including from the United Kingdom, are governed by the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952.  This provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over the State save on the express invitation or with the express permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is also provided, in relation to requests for permission to overfly the State, that the Minister may impose such conditions as he considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>In the case of Northern Ireland there are long-standing arrangements for aircraft from one jurisdiction to fly, with permission and subject to strict conditions, for a short distance into the other jurisdiction to help in dealing with specific incidents or suspect explosive devices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the importance of Turkey, a country with which Ireland has had diplomatic relations since 1951.  Ireland's Ambassador to Italy is accredited concurrently as non-resident Ambassador to Turkey.  Ireland also maintains a Consulate, headed by an Honorary Consul, in Istanbul.  The Honorary Consul reports to the Embassy in Rome which <Col N="132" /> also has consular responsibility for Turkey.  There is a resident Turkish Embassy in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Our network of resident diplomatic missions is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future, given our limited financial and personnel resources.  We do of course keep the possibility of its extension under review in the light of our changing national and international interests and the resources available to us.  It would not however be possible for me to speak publicly in advance about proposals, if any, which may be under consideration at any particular time since decisions in these matters have been agreed in each case with the foreign Government concerned and could be announced only in consultation with it.</P>
