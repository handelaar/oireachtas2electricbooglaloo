      <P>Is the proposal that Nos. 6 and 7 be decided without debate satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed. In respect of leave being granted to introduce <Col N="486" /> No. 8, the Supplementary Estimate to be decided forthwith without debate and any division thereon postponed until 6.45 p.m. on Wednesday next, 14 October 1992 &mdash; is that satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with the debate on the economy satisfactory?  Agreed.  Is the proposal in respect of tomorrow's sitting to commence at 10.30 a.m. and conclude at 4 p.m. agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that if a constructive, unambiguous and, above all, enduring consensus is to be sought on the substantive issues arising in the X case he should confirm publicly his view that a reasonable time should be made available to all parties for discussion and expert consultation? Will he confirm that he will promptly make available to all parties the supporting documentation he indicated he would be prepared to make available as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to what Deputy John Bruton said, and the request from him and from Deputy Spring, I should say I indicated to them that I would examine the timetable and extend the period for consultation to the extreme limit, bearing in mind that we have deadlines to meet in relation to publication of Bills and dates to be fixed to allow the referenda to take place on 3 December next.  I am having that done. It does appear that that will be some time next week; as of now it looks like Tuesday or Wednesday next.  I will be in touch with the Leaders of the Opposition Parties during the day to confirm that we will be able to do so next week and adhere to that timetable.  I will give them any help I can but it has to be accepted that Government documentation cannot be made available.  I will answer any reasonable queries and make available any synopsis of views in relation to certain words that may concern Deputies.  I will be as helpful as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas I welcome a reasonable extension of consultation time &mdash; I certainly felt the timetable was impossible <Col N="487" />&mdash; may I seek clarification from the Taoiseach?  While I understand that actual Government documentation will not be available to the Opposition Parties, do I take it that that will mean that some back-up documentation by which the decisions were arrived at will be provided to allow us fully to understand how those decisions were reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that documents used by Government in arriving at decisions are constrained for release under the Supreme Court confidentiality rules&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach write me a letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the decision of the Supreme Court, not mine.  I will be as helpful as I can within the parameters available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I am pleased the Taoiseach has agreed to extend the time available for consultation. May I ask him to clarify precisely what is his interpretation of the Supreme Court decision in relation to confidentiality?  What precisely is he able to give us in this respect?  My understanding of the Supreme Court decision is that it does not relate only to documentation but also to any discussions that took place relating to Cabinet decisions which are also excluded.  Is that right? Are we not hoist by our own petard in relation to this matter of confidentiality? Would the Taoiseach not seriously consider rectifying this anomalous position in which we find ourselves &mdash; that although the Government want to consult with the Opposition Parties they cannot provide us with documentation relating to decisions they have taken? Should they not proceed to remove this anomaly by referendum on 3 December next?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my estimation the <Col N="488" /> decision of the Supreme Court is very clear and unambiguous.  It says quite clearly that decisions taken by Government can be announced by anybody delegated by the Taoiseach in the normal way, such as by the Government Information Services or Press Service but that the contents of discussions are clearly confidential.  Discussions in relation to arriving at those decisions and consequently any documentation used in those discussions are confidential to the Government.  That is it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that with the advance of modern technology it is possible to change the heading on a document from &ldquo;memorandum to Government&rdquo; to &ldquo;background briefing&rdquo; and that once the document is entitled &ldquo;background briefing&rdquo; it should be possible for the Government to provide the necessary information on a different basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept what Deputy Bruton says, that it is open to the Government to cut the heading or description from the top of a document and put a different heading on it.  I am not in the business of trying to undermine Government business or finding ways around the Supreme Court decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is hiding behind that decision and misinterpreting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Whips have indicated that the Government are agreeable in principle to the establishment of two committees, a Foreign Affairs Committee and the relaunched European Affairs Committee, with a shared secretariat.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that this is the Government's decision and indicate when the necessary <Col N="489" /> resolutions will be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still not finalised by the Whips.  As soon as it is, we will deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to allow time in the House to address the outrageous attacks on the welfare rights of PRSI contributors?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Your interjection on the Order of Business in respect of that matter is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is savagely cutting the welfare rights of PRSI contributors and it is time the Taoiseach <Col N="490" /> allowed time to address what the Minister is doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will please resume his seat.  He will probably find an opportunity for dealing with that matter in the ensuing debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that since the arrangements for today's debate on the economy were agreed, a statement was made by one of the leading bankers that the present rate of interest might continue for as long as six months? Will the Taoiseach arrange for the Minister for Finance to meet the relevant financial institutions so that the Minister can make an authoritative statement to allay the enormous fears of many mortgage holders on hearing that news?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement made by one banker on this subject. I am also aware of a different statement made by a different banker.  Any statement made by the Minister for Finance, who I have no doubt will be intervening in this debate, is authoritative.  Other people outside the Department of Finance can speculate.  His statements are always authoritative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach if the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications will be making a statement which was promised as far back as Easter in relation to Shannon Airport? Will it be made in this session?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to No. 15 on the list of legislation circulated, the Bills to be published this session.  This refers to the setting up of the super agency for industrial development.  Will the legislation be taken this term?  Can the Taoiseach assure the House that the agency will remain under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce and will not be arrogated to the Taoiseach's Department, as has happened in the case of various matters recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the latter part of the question.  The Bill will be brought before the House as soon as it is available and, if possible, it will be taken this session.  It is in our interests to get it through the House as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points which should be borne in mind in this debate.  The first is that we have been faced in recent weeks with new economic problems and difficulties arising from international currency and interest rates developments.  These problems and difficulties must be faced by us &mdash; as by other economies &mdash; and measures taken to deal with them, but we should not be daunted by these new difficulties and problems &mdash; serious though they are. Above all, we should not be deterred by these events from the policies and strategies which have transformed our economy over the past five years.  That is <Col N="495" /> my second point.  Our economy today stands out for its underlying strength &mdash; an inflation rate among the lowest in the world, a substantial and sustained balance of payments surplus and a budget deficit which is the lowest in the Community. The Exchequer returns for the third quarter indicate that we are well on target for this year.  These are the foundations on which a modern, competitive economy is built.  These are the foundations on which we have built over the past five years one of the highest rates of economic growth in Europe, averaging nearly 5 per cent and well above the OECD and Community averages.</P>
      <P>Everyone in this House who speaks in this debate or who listens to it, will well remember when this economy faced insolvency in 1986 with the highest budget deficit we ever had, with a debt GNP ratio heading towards 130 per cent, with capital fleeing the country, with our currency devalued and unstable, with a substantial balance of payments deficit and with negative growth in the economy. In particular, the main Opposition spokesmen, who formed the then Government which was unfortunately as unstable as the currency, will be acutely aware of how the Governments which succeeded them retrieved the economy from that insolvency, which stared us in the face at the end of 1986, by the policies followed since 1987 which have restored the public finances and the economy to their present strength.</P>
      <P>The transformation of the economy and the public finances was brought about by the consensus approach we adopted of forming an alliance between the Government and the social partners representing employers, trade unions and farmers.  Together we agreed on how to develop our economy and create greater social justice.  Together we agreed that, for living standards to rise, we had to place our economy on a new competitive basis so that we could trade successfully in an increasingly competitive world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, in present circumstances, take heart, therefore, from what we have <Col N="496" /> achieved over the past five years.  We have even done something which so many other economies have failed to do &mdash; we have increased employment.  In the past five years, employment has increased by 45,000 as compared with a loss close to 80,000 in the previous six years.  Our strong economic performance is producing jobs.  Employment in Ireland grew annually by an average of 1.4 per cent between 1987 and 1990, that is seven times faster than the average for the past 30 years, but that is not enough.  We must do more.</P>
    <P>There can be nobody in this House who can suggest that our trading economy can generate additional jobs, except on the basis of a competitive economy based on low costs and low inflation.  That is the economy we have created over the past five years and we must maintain and improve that status in spite of the current new problems and difficulties which we hope will be temporary and transient.</P>
    <P>I can understand how the abnormal and unacceptable increases in the live register which we have been experiencing may make us overlook just how well, at least comparatively, we have been doing on employment.  That is relevant to this debate.  Let me outline what has been happening since the international economy began to slow down in 1990.  I will work from OECD estimates &mdash; published last June &mdash; of what actually happened in 1991 and what they foresaw for this year.</P>
    <P>Over the two years combined, the OECD suggested that Irish employment would rise, but marginally.  Our own indicators support the view that total employment has been broadly stable, with gains in areas like manufacturing, the financial sector and in services working to offset contraction on the construction side and in agricultural employment, but how well have other countries been doing?</P>
    <P>OECD estimates for the UK indicate a decline of virtually 5 per cent in employment over the two years.  In North America, broad stability was estimated for the US &mdash; on the basis of some recovery in 1992 &mdash; while Canadian employment was expected to be down by 1 per cent.  In Europe, reflecting the growth induced by <Col N="497" /> German unification, fairly strong growth was expected there, with a positive overspill into some neighbouring countries. While Japanese employment was estimated to rise strongly too, there were expected to be losses of 2 per cent in Australia and somewhat less in New Zealand.</P>
    <P>But what of other smaller countries, like ourselves, significantly dependent on external trade &mdash; Belgium, Denmark and Austria, for instance?  Over the two years, the OECD estimated an employment fall of 0.5 per cent in Belgium and of more than 1 per cent in Denmark. Austria, on the other hand, being placed to benefit particularly from the overspill growth effects of German unification, was estimated to see net employment gains of 2 per cent plus.</P>
    <P>In the round, these data point to a strong Irish performance, in particular in the face of the contraction of demand in the UK, our nearest neighbour and major trading partner where there has been such a substantial fall in employment.</P>
    <P>This gives the lie to propositions that, somehow, massive job losses lie behind the rise in our unemployment levels.  Falling employment is not the explanation for the simple reason that total jobs in Ireland have remained broadly stable. What, then, lies behind the live register increase?</P>
    <P>There are two main reasons.  The first is demographic.  The number of young people coming of age to begin work each year is far greater than the number reaching retirement &mdash; by about 25,000 annually at this point.  Second, while one cannot be precise on figures, we appear to have experienced some net inward migration in recent times, additional to the natural growth of our labour force. Preliminary population estimates for April last suggest marginal net inward flows over the 12 preceding months. These estimates relate to total population rather than to persons of working age only, but there has been strong recent growth among under-25s on the live register, 14,000 more this September than last.  Because of the substantial fall in UK employment since 1990, return <Col N="498" /> migration is already a significant contributor to the live register &mdash; as much as 10 per cent of new entrants to the live register in recent months.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is no consolation to the unemployed that we have been doing relatively well on jobs nor that it is growth in the labour force rather than net employment losses which lies behind rising unemployment.  Those without jobs do not want explanations but work. This is why, in addition to adhering to the macro-economic and budgetary policies necessary for growth, we have introduced a wide range of new measures and initiatives to create more employment, and we continue every week to seek out new job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years workers have had substantial real improvements in their living standards.  Take home pay of a married man earning the average male manufacturing wage will have increased by over 10.5 per cent between 1987 and 1992.  This improvement in workers' living standards resulted from a combination of reductions in income taxation, moderate wage increases under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and, of course, low inflation.</P>
    <P>It is not just those in employment who had improvements in their living standards. In the past number of years the value of basic social welfare payments has been more than maintained against inflation.  For example, the basic rate of payment for a married couple with two children on long term unemployment benefit went up by 38 per cent between mid-1987 and mid-1992.  In the same period, prices rose by less than 17 per cent, giving them a real rise in welfare benefit of about 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>We can continue to increase our living standards if we continue to maintain the discipline and the consistency of policy which has underpinned our economic and fiscal policy over the past five years.  I should also point out that the effects of the currency developments are not all negative.  Inflation could come down 1-2 per cent next year as a result of the fall in import prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> I am grateful for the wide measure of national support for our fundamental strategy which we have received during the current crisis.  This support has come from political quarters, from the social partners and, indeed, even in many cases from the sectors that have been badly affected by recent developments.  There has been an understanding by most people that we cannot afford just to look at the relief of short term pain, or at narrow sectoral interests, but that we need to take into account the long term benefits of a consistent economic strategy. I am convinced that the Irish economy can emerge all the stronger from this crisis, enjoying increased confidence at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>It is only with the currency crisis that we began to see the benefits of the policies we have pursued over the last five years.  Otherwise we would have been swamped as we were in 1986.</P>
    <P>Many ideas have been put forward over the last fortnight for mitigating the effects of sterling devaluation and recent interest rate rises, most of them made in a constructive spirit.  There was, however, the impracticable suggestion that foreign investors in Irish stocks should be given cast-iron guarantees against any potential loss, which showed a very strange set of priorities.  It was also proposed that the Government should restore full mortgage relief, and suspend or abolish employers' PRSI.  These would have been very costly measures &mdash; employers' PRSI for example, brings in about £1 billion per annum &mdash; with serious long term implications for the budget.  Parties opposite will recall that food subsidies brought in to meet a particular situation in the late seventies were not finally abolished until January 1987. The banks and some of the building societies have in different ways shown a degree of flexibility with regard to the sudden increase in repayments as they affect mortgage holders.  I understand from the banks and building societies that the option is available now to almost all mortgage holders not to pay the <Col N="500" /> increased mortgage rate over the next three months but to add the amount in question to the outstanding capital.  This is also the position with Dublin Corporation. This option will substantially cushion the effect of interest rate increases for those where a sharp and sudden increase creates hardship.</P>
    <P>As far as the productive sector is concerned, a carefully targeted measure such as the market development fund is a much superior method of getting to the companies that need assistance if they are to maintain output and employment. We will do ourselves no favours if we start showing a careless attitude to Government expenditure as our ability to maintain our position is based on the conviction of the markets that Government finances are firmly under control. Nothing must be done to shake that conviction. This is not the time to start thinking that we have leeway to increase the level of Government borrowing.  We all know where that path leads.  It is important that all of us be required to make some adjustment to meet the new situation rather than expect the Government to be able to insulate the country completely from changing external conditions. There is no merit either in throwing overboard the national consensus and alliance with the social partners which has allowed us to make so much progress together since 1987.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment provide an ideal forum for considering new suggestions and proposals that may be made in this House, and I would strongly urge all parties in this House to participate fully in it, at a time when it is important for all of us to be seen to work together.  I would say to Fine Gael: that if they have any workable ideas for new jobs they should send them to the Joint Committee where they will get careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I detect a growing public understanding that it requires more than an expression of strong political will or a burst of moral indignation to solve the unemployment problem.  Most responsible economic opinion believes that the Government are pursuing the right strategy, <Col N="501" /> even though further progress is needed on a number of different fronts, and that this strategy is capable of yielding substantial results, once general economic conditions improve.  The progress made in creating 45,000 net extra jobs in 1987-91 shows the potential of what can be achieved.  Moreover, the greater wealth that we have created since 1987 with an average growth rate of nearly 5 per cent has helped us to improve substantially in real terms the conditions of those dependent on social welfare.  The 4 per cent general increase in July is significantly ahead of inflation.</P>
    <P>Historical parallels have little relevance in a modern State that has proper social provision and it makes no sense to try to conjure up images of social revolt. The notion that the State can directly create tens of thousands of jobs by socialist style intervention is out of date and discredited; so also is the hollow political call to create more jobs without putting forward any new ideas.  The State has a role to play in creating the right conditions, and in encouraging and promoting development in particular sectors, but intervention beyond a certain point can be positively counterproductive. Unlike six years ago, most observers see an encouraging economic future ahead.  We should have the courage to persevere and not to give up because of adverse external circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that it is our firm intention and determination to defend the value of our currency.  We showed this by our actions at the height of the currency speculation and we will continue and maintain that policy.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance, his officials, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Central Bank for their part in the successful defence of our currency.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, the Government have pursued a consistent line in regard to our currency.  That policy is, and will continue to be, the maintenance of a firm exchange rate within the narrow band of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. That policy has delivered significant <Col N="502" /> benefits in the form of very low inflation and general economic stability. It has also created confidence abroad in Ireland's ability to successfully manage its economy.  In recent years, this growing confidence has led to large capital inflows, particularly inflows to Irish Government securities, and it is these inflows which helped reduce the differential between Irish and German interest rates from over nine percentage points in early 1987, to less than one percentage point earlier this year.  Maintaining our current exchange rate policy is the only way we can ensure a return to lower interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Government are acting resolutely and consistently to complement and reinforce all existing strategies and measures to deal with unemployment by new concerted efforts and radical approaches.  Through the initiatives which we have taken in recent weeks, the Government have shown their commitment and clear determination to take all possible measures to accelerate employment and reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>The essential purpose of the very useful and productive meeting I had with the CRC on 3 September, where I was accompanied by Ministers directly concerned with the issues under discussion, was to review progress under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> with special reference to the grave unemployment situation, and should be seen in the context of the ongoing process in which the Government are according top priority to job creation.</P>
    <P>In addition, we in Government had wide ranging discussions with the CRC on a broad range of strategies and measures concerning such sectors as tourism, agriculture, marine, aquaculture, forestry, construction and North-South trade which offer potential for significant growth and employment creation.</P>
    <P>The most important conclusion from the meeting was that the CRC is now examining, at my request, new strategies and measures within the framework of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to increase employment and will be submitting its recommendations to the <Col N="503" /> Government by the end of this month. For my part, I have given an undertaking to the social partners that these will be fully, carefully and quickly considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government have, in the light of discussions at the CRC, taken a series of specific decisions on establishing county enterprise partnership boards which I believe are of major importance for enterprise development and job creation in this country.</P>
    <P>The partnership boards will play a major role in job creation at local level. They also represent a significant step forward in the devolution of power to local communities.  Ordinary people will have the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting their lives &mdash; decisions which up to now have been made at national level.  No proper supportive structure to encourage the setting up of small businesses has existed and this new initiative clearly fills that vacuum.</P>
    <P>Each board, with directors drawn from all our main industries and State agencies, will provide for the close co-operation of the private sector and the public service.  The chairperson of the boards will be an employer representative.  The other members of the boards will include the chairperson of the local authority, the county manager and representatives of local communities, social partners and public agencies.</P>
    <P>The partnership boards will have three key objectives: the development of small and start up enterprises, employing up to 12 people; training and education, especially as linked to enterprise development; and local community development.  The partnership boards will prepare action plans for their counties and areas.  These plans will set down specific proposals, to be implemented through decisions of three key sub-committees of the boards, in the areas of small and start-up enterprise development, of training and education and of local community development.  A forum of relevant local organisations will be held in each county quarterly, to ensure an exchange of ideas and feedback to <Col N="504" /> local communities on the boards' activities.</P>
    <P>The funding of the boards, in addition to the drawing together of existing publicly funded initiatives, will consist of additional funds of over £100 million committed by the Irish financial institutions; in addition Irish public funds of £50 million will be provided by the Government and there will be additional EC funds.</P>
    <P>Funding from the financial institutions represents an important step forward. The four associated banks &mdash; Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank-Woodchester Credit Lyonnais Bank, the ICC, the ACC, the Trustee Savings Bank and the Irish Permanent Building Society have collectively committed funds of £95 million to be used in conjunction with the county enterprise partnership boards.</P>
    <P>These funds will be available for loans on favourable terms, including no guarantees in the case of incorporated entities and the underwriting criteria will reflect a balanced view of the financial institutions' good commercial practice and social responsibility in playing their part in achieving the aims of the county enterprise partnerships in tackling the unemployment problem.  In addition, there will be an active policy by the banks to provide specialist staff to assist in the evaluation and operation of projects on a &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>Enterprise projects submitted to county enterprise partnership boards for funding will be evaluated in terms of commercial viability by an enterprise sub-committee of the board.  Personnel designated by the financial institutions will assist in the evaluation and the board will decide the most appropriate method of funding, whether by direct grant, loan, interest subsidy or equity for approved projects.  Officials of my Department are now liaising, and will continue to liaise, with the financial institutions on the detailed implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Discussions are continuing with the financial institutions, in particular with other building societies and with the insurance companies on further contributions  <Col N="505" /> to the overall enterprise fund. The Government are satisfied that there will be a further positive response from the financial institutions arising from those discussions.  Equity capital will be included in the further contributions, in particular from the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The enterprise partnership boards will each have a small core staff that will transfer to them from county development teams, from regional tourism organisations, from IDA/ABT, Eolas, SFADCo/FÁS/VECs and, where available, from the social partners, including private sector employers.</P>
    <P>The county development teams and regional tourism organisations will continue in existence in each case until partnership boards have been established in the relevant areas.</P>
    <P>The process of establishing partnership boards will start immediately and will be undertaken in consultation with all existing interests, including in particular public service staff interests at both local and regional level.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of our resolve and determination, the following employment initiatives have been introduced by the Government in recent weeks beyond those I have already mentioned above such as our decisions on: the first phase implementation of the Culliton Report's recommendations; a two-year exemption from PRSI payments for employers who take on additional employees; a new payroll levy on employers to fund apprenticeship training in certain sectors; follow-up on recommendations by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment with increased places in the community employment development programme &mdash; 1,000 new places &mdash; in the vocational training opportunities scheme &mdash; 1,000 new places &mdash; and in the special employment scheme &mdash; 4,000 new places; introduction of a new financial services product involving private trusts which will provide additional employment in management and ancillary activities at the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>There is, in addition, a number of ongoing measures which will contribute <Col N="506" /> to reducing unemployment.  Since 1987 tourism has dramatically shown its ability to increase employment.  Employment in the industry rose by 31,400 between 1986 and 1991.  The task force on tourism will shortly report to the Minister who has already underlined that the way forward towards greater tourist earnings and greater employment is increased product development and marketing of holidays in specialised sectors where we are highly competitive and attractive.</P>
    <P>The employment subsidy scheme continues to make a steady contribution to new employment.  Already some 3,350 jobs have been created under the scheme.  The EC funded job training scheme has not yet made a significant contribution to reducing unemployment but with the new more flexible conditions I am assured by employers that the uptake will increase significantly.</P>
    <P>I have asked every Department to bring forward new ideas or projects for jobs for consideration with the Estimates for 1993 and this also applies to our industrial and commercial semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>As a speedy response to the new difficulties created for enterprises by the currency changes, the Government have established the market development fund of £50 million for the period up to the end of March 1993 to assist firms which have been seriously affected by the recent turmoil in exchange rates within the Exchange Rate Mechanism.</P>
    <P>The measures are intended to provide support for jobs in the manufacturing firms which could face serious difficulties in maintaining positive margins on sales in the UK market and in those parts of the domestic market and certain major overseas markets which are subject to strong price competition from UK firms. These developments pose a threat to many of the jobs involved unless firms take immediate action to increase their competitiveness in existing and alternative markets.</P>
    <P>By helping firms to help themselves the fund will also contribute to the achievement of the stability necessary to maintain Ireland's membership of the <Col N="507" /> Exchange Rate Mechanism at a time of considerable uncertainty.</P>
    <P>In establishing the fund, the Government emphasised that assistance would be directed very specifically at firms which would have temporary difficulty in maintaining employment and in adjusting to the recent fundamental changes in the market place arising from the devaluation of sterling.  Firms will need to demonstrate the ability, commitment and actions being taken to manage their way out of current difficulties.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see the positive response to the new measures by industry and by exporters in particular.  The support of the Irish Exporters' Association was especially notable in welcoming the new appreciation of exporters' problems the Government had shown.  The Government look forward to a constructive relationship with firms affected on export, and on the home, markets not just in the UK markets but including, for example, those affected in the sheep and pig meat and mushroom businesses.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in some quarters to decry our excellent economic fundamentals, as if they were irrelevant to unemployment and the &ldquo;real economy&rdquo;. The last few weeks have brought home to us that there is a very real connection. Without good fundamentals we would not have been able to maintain our exchange rate, or to sustain any confidence in the Irish economy.  We learnt in the seventies and early eighties that poor fundamentals, high inflation, a huge balance of payments deficit, and heavy Government borrowing, would sooner or later leave a trail of destruction in terms of jobs, with nearly 80,000 jobs lost between 1980 and 1987.  Poor fundamentals, particularly in regard to the public finances, meant that Deputy Bruton, as Minister for Finance, had to resort to unilateral devaluation in August 1986, despite his earlier forthright assurances to the contrary &mdash; with a resulting crisis of confidence and a big jump in interest rates, up by up to 4½ per cent by October 1986.  In sharp contrast, during the current international recession, there <Col N="508" /> has been a minimal loss of jobs, and we have been able to hold our course through present extremely turbulent conditions.</P>
    <P>In that context, I would like to quote from <i>Finance</i> magazine's annual survey of Irish economic forecasters, completed after the devaluation of sterling.  It begins:</P>
    <P>The Irish economy is set to continue to turn in some of the best performances of any economy in the O.E.C.D. area over the next three years, irrespective of the effects of the E.R.M. currency turmoil.</P>
    <P>My message in this debate is that we should take hope and confidence from the progress we have made since the dark days of 1986 and that we will similarly overcome the current difficulties which have been created for us by international currency and interest rate developments.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue the disciplined macro-economic policy which we have followed since 1987.  We have the support of the social partners, recently expressed in the CRC for that.  As part of that policy we will maintain a strong currency.  We will devote all our energies to the measures we have been introducing to accelerate employment and reduce unemployment in the face of the unique demographic pressure we are experiencing.  We have made a dramatic, radical and historic change in the approach to creating jobs by setting up county enterprise partnership boards to weld together at county and local levels the efforts and enterprise of local communities in creating new employment opportunities and a new economic vigour at community level.  We have in the past few days &mdash; with a speed which has been widely commended &mdash; set up a marketing development fund with £50 million to spend on overcoming for companies the worst effects of the sterling devaluation.</P>
    <P>We are on the threshold of the Single Market which opens its frontiers on the first of January next.  This offers us new potential for employment.  We are now one of the most competitive and low cost economies in Europe poised to take <Col N="509" /> advantage of the easier access to Community trade.</P>
    <P>And there beckons beyond the Single Market the prospect of Economic and Monetary Union which, through its coordination of economic and monetary policies, a single Central Bank and ultimately a single currency, will enable us in a market devoid of currency and interest rate fluctuations to gain for our people a much higher standard of living based on our efficiency, our productivity, our commitment to hard work and excellence, our high standards of education and our overall competitiveness.  These must be our ideals.  These we are now well on the way to achieving.  Let us not falter or fail at this critical time.  Let us not be blown off course by the sudden squalls that have hit us.  We have managed the economy well in the face of graver problems and we will continue to manage it with the same skill and resolution that have overcome those grave problems.  Together with the social partners and with the co-operation of firms affected by the current crisis we will come successfully through this ordeal which we hope will be of short duration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning on radio the chief executive of one of our major banks said that we might have even further increases in interest rates.  I do not believe that at any period since independence the real rate of interest has ever been as high as it is now.  This rate of interest curtails investment and rewards saving at a time when we already have far too little investment, too few jobs and quite sufficient saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banker to which I referred attributed the rise in interest rates to the flight of German money from the Irish market because of the fears by German investors that the Irish pound might be devalued and that they would be repaid less than they had lent.  He went on to urge maintenance of the exchange rate regardless of other consequences, social or economic. What he failed to say was that the Irish Government had rejected a proposal by Fine Gael that could have avoided this flight of money and the consequential <Col N="510" /> rise in interest rates by guaranteeing the German investors repayment at the present exchange rate.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government lacked the courage to adopt this proposal and were joined in their opposition to it by domestic banks and institutions who, quite unnecessarily, wanted to get a similar guarantee themselves.  They made the pathetic excuse that the Fine Gael proposal would have needed a change in the rules.  I assert that if Fine Gael's advice had been followed two weeks ago, the present rise in interest rates could have been avoided.  The pain and the fear for mortgage holders, for struggling businesses and for farmers trying to stock their land would have been avoided if the Fine Gael proposal had been adopted.</P>
    <P>The very Government that were so afraid to change the market rules to help mortgage holders, businesses and farmers to avoid crippling interest rates are now admitting that their proposed £50 million subsidy scheme for a minority of those affected by them is actually a direct breach of EC competition rules, rules which exist mainly to protect smaller countries and in whose enforcement Ireland has a vested interest.  If we had a proper Government in this country this would not have happened.  The fact is that the occupants of the principal offices of this State do not have any economic plan, do not understand international economics and have no vision of how Ireland fits into the European economy. As a result they react to economic events rather than shape them.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>In fact this discussion we are having today typifies all that is wrong.  We have no motion setting out a Government plan.  There is nothing to agree with, nothing to disagree with, nothing to amend.  There is just nothing.  All we have today from the Government is a series of bland statements, of which the Taoiseach's was a bad example, written by civil servants and read by Ministers who are probably seeing them for the first time as they read them.  There is no sense of direction.  There is no one in charge of the Irish economy at present.  The Taoiseach's <Col N="511" /> speech was an apologia for his failures; it was not a statement of where he believes the country should be led.</P>
    <P>The crisis affecting jobs and living standards is the issue on which the Government should have a clear statement of policy at present; yet it is evident from the Taoiseach's speech today that they are unable to form any plan for the medium term future of the Irish economy. As far as the protection of jobs and living standards are concerned there was no special sub-committee of the Cabinet set up six months ago to deliberate on the subject.  There was no offer of consultation with the Opposition and no deadline set for such consultation.  Jobs and living standards were not a sufficiently important issue to warrant such procedures.  Essentially, as far as jobs and living standards are concerned this Government are prepared to leave the management of the economy to their civil servants.  They have no proposals of their own.</P>
    <P>We now have a society where the misery of the mortgage payment is eating up the savings of young people who are paying vastly increased rates of interest. The Government are deaf and silent as a debate gets under way again on enhanced tax reliefs and other methods of relieving the appalling crisis facing so many homeowners.  Fundamentally, the argument should not be about tax reliefs but about how this entirely unnecessary increase in interest rates in terms of the economic situation should have been avoided and how, not being avoided, it can be rolled back.  That is what the debate should be about.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, two weeks ago I made a proposal that could have retained all the Deutsche Mark funds in this country, whose loss caused the increase in interest rates, thereby avoiding the pain for mortgage holders and others.  That proposal was rejected by the Government.  Yet since then they have initiated a variant of it themselves by borrowing Deutsche Marks, thereby undertaking the same risk.  They are doing what should have been done before the event and if done <Col N="512" /> at that time would have avoided the increase in interest rates.  This is typical of all economic policy making under this Government.  They treat the symptom rather than the disease; they offer palliatives rather than solutions.</P>
    <P>The Coalition are long past the end of their useful life.  They have lost the capacity for self-renewal because of the poisonous relationship between the Coalition partners that the Taoiseach has deliberately fostered and allowed to develop.  I blame the Taoiseach primarily for this because it is a task of his office, a task undertaken willingly by the Taoisigh of all previous Coalition Governments, to conciliate the strains that arise between his party Ministers and the Ministers from the other party.  This can and has always been done in the past by Taoisigh in Coalition Governments, without sacrifice of essential principle and within an agreed framework.  Yet the present Taoiseach is not doing this at all.  He is not only allowing inter-party bitterness to grow but he is deliberately fostering it, and in so doing he is deliberately destroying the decision-making capacity of the Government.  He is doing this for the most arrogant of reasons, because he wants to rule alone.  It would not be good for the country if he were to succeed in this ambition.  The Fianna Fáil Party have never been a policy-driven party.  They rely on monopolistic entities &mdash; favoured businessmen, organised interests and State companies and agencies &mdash; to provide the economic ideas that they lack in their own party.</P>
    <P>This leads to an unhealthy close relationship with certain individual business people, creating a sense that the free market is more free for some than it is for others.  It leads to policies where pay costs in the protected sector of the economy race ahead of productivity and where restrictive practices, be they in the professions, in banking or in the work-place, are never tackled.  In brief, Fianna Fáil's chosen style of Government condemns &mdash; and will continue to condemn as long as they are in office &mdash; the country to mediocrity.  It leads to the situation where the Government's main response <Col N="513" /> to a job crisis for half a million people is the creation of yet another &ldquo;super agency&rdquo;.  At a time when the nations of Eastern Europe are being advised to revive their economies by deconcentrating power, the Taoiseach wants to concentrate all industrial power in one super agency.  Thus instead of lifting the tax and regulatory burdens which prevent individuals from expanding their own businesses, he wants them all to apply for grants to county boards who will disburse someone else's money.  Instead of reducing the dependency of economic factors on the State, he wants to increase their dependency.  All assistance has to be obtained as a favour from somebody else, by means of a form which has to be filled up with the aid of an accountant.  Rather than giving people the ability to make their own decisions, to choose their own markets and to create jobs spontaneously, everybody is being made more and more dependent on the State systems of assistance, of which we have had very many in the last few months.</P>
    <P>Instead of telling the banks to cut their charges and face more competition, the Government want them to keep all their privileges on condition that they subscribe to the Taoiseach's favoured fund, where the Taoiseach will be involved in giving out some of the bank's money. Instead of having a banking system based on fair and open competition, our banking system has an unhealthily close relationship with the Government as a result of their participation in Government schemes.  The Government, in the final analysis, through Ministers of State, will be dispensing patronage rather than allowing those banks to face fair and open competition where their unduly high charges would be forced down by such competition.</P>
    <P>Much time has been wasted in the House discussing scandals which have occurred over the last two or three years. The House should reflect on the fact that scandals do not occur by accident, they occur because power, political or commercial, is concentrated in too few hands. Mostly that occurs because of the existence of State supported monopolies of <Col N="514" /> one kind or another.  I assert that the Fianna Fáil Party, behind all the public relations, are essentially a party which favour monopoly.  They are close to private or publicly owned monopolists and regard them as the vehicle of achievement of their own political and economic ambitions.  It is because of that intrinsic closeness to monopoly that, essentially, as far as economic management is concerned, the Fianna Fáil Party should not be in office.</P>
    <P>Ireland's job problem is now so severe that we do not need this reactive approach but rather a radical, policy-driven Government which will seek to remove all the obstacles to job creation that exist in their first budget.  If the issues are tackled in a leisurely way over a series of annual budgets the initial momentum of any Government will tend to be smothered by administrative inertia. As their term of office proceeds, all Governments, naturally, tend to become steadily more risk averse.  That is why a change of Government at this stage would enable a new Government to make a radical start in clearing away the blockages to the creation of jobs and the blockages to taking up jobs.  Such a radical new start will never be achieved by a Government on their last legs and whose Taoiseach is deliberately seeking to provoke the departure from the Government of one of the parties comprising the Government.  There will be no medium term planning from such a Government; it is politically impossible to expect any medium term planning from a Government who are feuding so poisonously within themselves.</P>
    <P>The ultimate cause of the lack of economic direction is political because of the induced ill-will between the two parties forming the Government.  That is why a change is necessary if we are to tackle the unemployment crisis.  Let me explain why a genuinely radical approach is needed to deal with the employment issue.  We simply cannot allow the present level of unemployment to continue to grow, for four reasons: (1) unemployment wastes the talents of 500,000 people who are unemployed or who have left the country; <Col N="515" /> (2) unemployment is the single greatest cause of poverty; (3) unemployment builds an ingrained structure of inequality into society and gradually corrodes the social order &mdash; in this I profoudly disagree with the Taoiseach who sought to minimise the corrosive effect of unemployment on the social order; he suggested that people who said that were Jeremiahs.  Gradually, slowly, the social order is being corroded by unemployment; (4) by creating more jobs tax yields would be increased, social welfare costs would be reduced; it would help to bring down the national debt and, above all, help our people to restore their sense of pride in themselves.</P>
    <P>Let no one underestimate the extent of the constant reminders which people have of the size of unemployment which essentially deprives all of us of a sense of pride in ourselves which we ought to have as Irish people.  It is the biggest single blemish on our national reputation.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot blame its present level of unemployment on the fact that it is a peripheral nation in Europe.  Iceland is even more peripheral than we are and their unemployment rate is only 2 per cent.  Portugal is also more peripheral than Ireland and their unemployment rate is only 5 per cent.  Scotland is more peripheral than us, yet their unemployment rate is only 8 per cent while our rate is 20 per cent.  Let us not hear in this debate about poor Ireland being the only island in Europe and being cut off, etc., from its markets.  The figures belie that. Other countries, equally peripheral, do not have even half our level of unemployment. The problem, as far as the high level of unemployment in this country is concerned, is that we have had no ideas of our own.  Instead, progressively, over the last 30 years or longer, we have systematically copied the tax, regulatory and welfare systems which were designed for other countries with different problems which had an employment shortage.  It is a central deficiency in the political system that people who think do not get into Government, if that Government are formed by the party opposite.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> We have had no original ideas of our own as far as employment is concerned. We borrowed other people's ideas and because those ideas were generated in countries where there was an employment shortage, as witnessed by the huge immigration from Third World countries to many mainland European countries, we have adopted policies which are profoundly unsuitable for a country with our level of unemployment.  We do not realise it because the party opposite simply see their job as imitating other people's ideas.</P>
    <P>If we are to solve Ireland's unemployment problem we will have to develop &mdash; perhaps for the first time in our history as an independent State &mdash; a genuinely Irish economic policy suitable to Irish conditions.  That is what my party published in their document <i>Towards the Jobs Economy.</i> It is a tailor-made policy for an economy which has a surplus of people needing employment; it is not a policy borrowed from another country, which is the type of policy we will get as long as Fianna Fáil remain in office.  This change towards a radical reappraisal of economic policy to make it more favourable to the needs of a country with a high level of unemployment will not happen until there is a change of Government. We must have a policy-driven Government who are willing to take risks, to confront special interests and bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The central issues which the Government will have to tackle as far as employment is concerned are very simple indeed.  First, at present it costs too much to take up a job if you are unemployed. Second, it costs too much to create a job if you have money to spend.  Creating a job is the last thing that anyone will do under our tax, social welfare and regulatory structures if they have money to spend.  Employers in this country will do everything they can under the present system to avoid creating jobs.  Those two elements have to change.  Every person should have an incentive to take up a full or part time job if a job can be got. Creating a job for somebody else should <Col N="517" /> be the most profitable, not the least profitable, thing that anybody can do with his or her money.  Those two fundamental flaws in our present structure will not be solved by this Government.</P>
    <P>First, let us take the perspective of the potential employee, the person potentially taking up a job.  Professor Brendan Walsh of UCD pointed out in a book, which was presented to the Taoiseach, that there is little net incentive for a married person to accept an offer of employment unless the gross economic wage offered exceeds £11,000 a year &mdash; almost the average industrial wage.  That is because a married person currently unemployed who takes up a job is likely to lose his or her medical card; is likely to find that the income earned from work is liable to PAYE tax and PRSI whereas the previous income was not; will lose his or her eligibility for higher education grants and civil legal aid; will, if living in a local authority house, have his or her differential rent increased and will pay substantial extra indirect tax through the cost of travelling to and from work.  In other words, the tax burden resulting from taking up a job means that almost half of those who are unemployed have no financial incentive to take a job, although there are many other incentives.</P>
    <P>Second, I wish to consider the potential employer.  The 1992 budget was prepared well after the Culliton report was published, yet in a recent letter to me a large Irish employer described that budget and the Finance Bill that implemented the budget in the following way:</P>
    <P>The most recent budget put a fullstop to many enterprise ideas.... As an act of sheer incompetence the introduction of a 10 per cent tax free deposit must rate without opposition as the worst ever introduced.  Goodbye to investment risk when you can get 10 per cent on deposit at 10 per cent tax against 3 per cent inflation.</P>
    <P>The position has worsened since that <Col N="518" /> letter was written.  Inflation is now much lower than 3 per cent and deposit interest rates have increased.  One can now get as much as 17 per cent interest for leaving money on deposit.</P>
    <P>Who would take money off deposit and put it into a job creation project, to pay 48 per cent take-home tax on any dividends or profits arising from that job creation project &mdash; if there is any profit made &mdash; when the money so spent could be left lying on deposit at 17 per cent interest and only 10 per cent take-home tax would be paid on the interest income that would definitely be received?  That equation renders job creation profoundly unattractive for anybody with money. The position has to change because people will not invest in job creation merely for the love of it, they will invest in job creation because they recognise a reasonable risk reward ratio.  So far as job creation is concerned at present the risks are much too great and the rewards are virtually minimal.</P>
    <P>That is the position that existed in this country before the development of the currency crisis.  The jobs now at grave risk as a result of the currency crisis are in small, mainly Irish-owned, labour-intensive firms in the directly productive sector.  Those firms are not advertising their difficulties.  Some of them probably did not even apply for the assistance available because they do not want their position to be known, they do not want to put at risk the credit they already have. The jobs at risk are found in the clothing, food, machinery, furniture and footwear sectors &mdash; all labour-intensive sectors in which the closure of firms would cause dramatic job losses.</P>
    <P>Those job losses are likely to occur at a time when because of the depreciation of sterling the nation as a whole is actually better off.  That is because Ireland imports more from Britain than it exports to Britain.  It has been estimated that the recent devaluation in sterling has meant that Ireland will have a net financial benefit of at least £200 million a year overall through reduced import prices.  For example, we will enjoy almost nil <Col N="519" /> inflation next year.  But at the same time, while the nation gains, some Irish people are likely to lose dramatically through a loss of employment.</P>
    <P>The biggest potential losers are, as I have said, those in the directly productive sector.  Mrs. Thatcher learnt in the period from 1979 onwards that once the directly productive sector is destroyed because of high interest rates it cannot be remade. The reason that Britain is in such economic difficulty at present and has such a balance of payments problem is not alone the fall in the dollar value of oil but because between 1979 and 1983, through a policy of high interest rates, Mrs. Thatcher in Government destroyed the basic productive sector of the British economy.  If this country continues to experience high interest rates and the sudden appreciation in the Irish púnt relative to sterling, almost exactly the same effect will be achieved in this economy as was achieved in Britain by Mrs. Thatcher's policies from 1979 to 1983.  I assert that the British economy has never recovered from the policies followed in that period and that is the position now being faced by the productive sector of this economy.</P>
    <P>I genuinely do not believe that the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce have any understanding of the profound change that is occurring.  They seem to think that palliatives, schemes, offering people application forms and having an announcement every week about a new initiative of some kind mitigates the profound change in the actual terms of trade in relation to risk reward ratios that affect the level of jobs in our economy at present.  Schemes will not solve the problem in the medium term.  If we are to have a credible economic policy as well as a currency policy, the £200 to £300 million that our economy will gain as a result of the sterling devaluation must be redistributed by the Government to help those sectors in which jobs would otherwise be lost.  If that is not done, the currency crisis will make Ireland an even more divided society than it already is &mdash;<Col N="520" /> with windfall gains for the majority of people who are in secure jobs and catastrophic losses for the minority who will lose their jobs as a result.</P>
    <P>A Government committed to a jobs economy could not and would not allow that to happen.  That is the reason Fine Gael have called for action on five points. First, we want temporary abolition of PRSI in manufacturing to cut labour costs in the exposed sectors and thus save jobs that would otherwise go.  Secondly, as I have already said, we want a guarantee of repayment at the present Punt/DM ratio for Deutsche Mark investors in Irish pound bonds, which would bring back the cash that we have lost in recent weeks and thus roll back the 3 per cent increase in interest rates, which was avoidable had the Fine Gael proposal been adopted initially.  Thirdly, we want a comprehensive budget for jobs, designed to restore the financial gain that should be there to the individual from creating a job for somebody else and to ensure that everybody has a financial incentive to take up a job if a job is offered.  Fourthly, Fine Gael want an immediate Government meeting with all of the social partners to discuss the cost competitiveness of Irish jobs, in direct competition with British jobs, at the new exchange rate. In that regard, it is not the cost competitiveness of our economy that is at stake, it is the cost competitiveness of individual employees in individual firms. If employing somebody in Ireland becomes uncompetitive relative to employing somebody in Britain the jobs now taken up by people in Ireland will be transferred to Britain, but the people will not be transferred with the jobs. Fifthly, there must be a convincing statement of the Government's medium-term economic policy, focused on the structural changes that must be made to sustain the current exchange rate in the long term without any loss of employment.</P>
    <P>What was most disappointing about the Taoiseach's speech this morning was to have no evidence whatsoever of a medium term economic perspective.  The Taoiseach's speech included a recitation of what was happening in other countries <Col N="521" /> and a recitation of the schemes that he planned to introduce, but there was no medium term statement about where he expected the Irish economy to go and there was no statement about what the Irish Government would be doing about economic policy either one year, three years or five years from now.  In the absence of a medium term statement, uncertainty flourishes and the exchange rate remains under pressure.  A Government that had a credible economic policy would have no difficulty in holding the exchange rate.  The reason our exchange rate is still under pressure is that there is no sense that the Government's currency declarations are backed by a coherent economic strategy.  As long as the Government fail to produce a convincing overall economic strategy the exchange rate will continue to be under speculative pressure.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are the only political party that have produced a comprehensive jobs policy, based singlemindedly on the objective of giving our people back the chance to create jobs for themselves.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;singleminded&rdquo;. Unless the Government are singleminded about removing the barriers to job creation and to taking a job they will tend to be distracted from the jobs agenda by a vested interest with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> proposals and, indeed, by Government Departments who have a longstanding agenda of ideas of their own many of which add to the cost of creating or taking a job when they are analysed properly but which tend to roll inevitably onto the Government agenda just because they are there.  Unless the Government have a clear sighted and singleminded view that their primary economic objective is to reduce the cost of taking a job and to increase the reward for creating a job, and unless every proposal submitted to Government from any quarter, including their own servants, is put to that test the Government will fail. That is why we need a Government singlemindedly and explicitly dedicated in the agreement entered into before they enter the Cabinet room for the first time <Col N="522" /> to removing the barriers to job creation and removing the disincentives to taking a job.</P>
    <P>Being singleminded about this issue means that jobs must be put at the top of the agenda and that means that other things must be put lower down on the agenda.  We hear much from politicians about priorities, we rarely hear from politicians of any side the notion that if you have a priority there must also be a posteriority for other jobs.</P>
    <P>Incoming Governments have tended, in my experience, to want at the same time to increase living standards, raise employment, cut Government spending, cut taxation and also reduce borrowing. Governments have got to choose.  In my view the primary objective of any Government, if they want to do all those things, must be to first create an incentive to create a job and create an incentive to take a job.  If they do that the other problems such as Government borrowing, taxation and so forth will eventually fall into place because of the increased revenue that will be generated. If the Government do not put jobs at the top of their agenda they will never achieve any of their objectives.  It is essential that there be a clear understanding of those objectives before the Government Ministers enter the Cabinet room for the first time.  Those priorities must be understood by every Minister and every proposal coming onto his desk must be tested against them.</P>
    <P>It must also be the case that everybody working in the Government service, whether in an employment exchange or in a local tax office, understands that they are working under a Government that have a clear view about creating an incentive to take a job and creating a greater incentive to create such jobs.  That is the overriding principle that should govern all their actions on a daily basis.  Unless the Government's objectives are simple enough to be understood at every level of administration, not just at the Cabinet table, they will not be achieved.  That is why we need a new Government here because this Government will not produce a reformulation of their economic <Col N="523" /> policy.  They have been saying too much in favour of the existing policy, which plainly is not working so far as employment is concerned, to be able to change at this late stage particularly in view of the poisonous relationship that exists between the two parties forming the Government.  A new Government is essential if jobs are to be put at the top of the national policy agenda.  That must be a policy agenda based on simplicity and singlemindedness if it is to be carried through.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made reference to the £100 million fund to which the financial institutions are supposed to subscribe.  I was in Brussels ten days ago and although that fund was announced several months ago at home with great fanfare &mdash; in fact it was announced three or four different times; the Government announced that they were going to announce it, then they announced it and then they announced that they had announced it &mdash; my information is that the Government at least ten days ago had not yet even lodged an application in Brussels for European assistance towards that fund.  If that is the case this is not a serious proposal.</P>
    <P>We also heard the tired invitation from the Government which obviously is on the word processor for all economic debates where they say to Fine Gael: &ldquo;we would like you to join our jobs committee&rdquo;&mdash; the back bench committee on jobs.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance if he will join the jobs committee. The reason we will not join it is because he will not join it.  If he does not have sufficient belief in this committee to spend even half a day talking to its members, and if he cannot arrange for his own Ministers of State to appear before it, why is he expecting the main Opposition party to take part in it?  The Minister is not taking it seriously. How can he and the Government expect anyone else to take it seriously?  We will join the jobs committee if the Government join it.  That is simple.  If Government Ministers are prepared to take part in that committee we will take part also. The day Government Ministers indicate <Col N="524" /> they are prepared to take part we are prepared to take part.  That is irrelevant because the Government will not do that.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Government that they will be in Opposition in one years time and we will set up an employment committee.  I guarantee them that the Government Ministers of the day will sit on that committee and we will invite Fianna Fáil to take part.  As long as the Government are in power they should not let us hear that hypocritical call on Fine Gael to join that committee.  How anybody who has self respect could join a committee that Government Ministers, who are ultimately responsible for the implementation of any proposals that may emanate from that committee, are not prepared to join, is beyond me.  That is why the Fine Gael Party will not join that committee until the Government join it.  On the day the Government join that committee we shall join it.</P>
    <P>The real problem here is that we do not have a Government who are prepared to govern so far as jobs are concerned.  We have a Government who are prepared to react to stimuli from other quarters but have no plan of their own.  The reason we need a general election more than any other at this time is so that we can have here a Government who are genuinely committed to a clear-sighted programme of priorities on the jobs issue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of discussing the present state of the Irish economy.  I also believe that the majority of the Irish people are looking to Dáil Éireann for some leadership and direction to overcome the crisis we are facing.</P>
      <P>It is of little comfort to many of our citizens to know that we are faced with the prospect of an abortion referendum on 3 December as the main political response to the current crisis.  It is not in the best interests of this State; it is not the response people are looking for and I am certain that the Government will not be thanked for imposing a divisive and embittering campaign on the country if that is the course they choose to pursue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it may well be that one of the main reasons, if not the main reason, why this campaign is being launched is because the Government desperately need a distraction from their own failures at present.  Surely it is now time that the people as a whole, instead of being involved in a divisive campaign about an issue that could and should be addressed by way of legislation, were instead given an opportunity to pass judgment on the performance of this Government, who have never received a mandate from the people.  I am afraid the people listening to or watching this debate will take little comfort from the Taoiseach's contribution this morning because, unfortunately, the Taoiseach failed badly to chart any course for the Irish economy for the next six to 12 months.  That was the main weakness of his contribution <Col N="526" /> this morning.  It is hard to believe that a Taoiseach in attempting to address the problems of our economy could speak in Dáil Éireann for 45 minutes and fail to mention once any question of Structural or Cohesion Funds.  For 12 months hardly a day went by in this House without a Fianna Fáil Minister telling us about the benefits post-Masstricht of Structural and Cohesion Funding.  This seems to have gone off the agenda.  I am sure many people wonder if they were sold a pup in relation to the Government's programme of many months ago.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling what happened during the recess and the Government's performance.  We are all familiar with the Government's assumption that the anger over the jobs crisis can be assuaged by cosmetic public relations exercises which involve money the source of which is questionable &mdash; for investment in projects that have not yet been identified. We have all noted the Taoiseach's dismissal of Opposition concern over unemployment &mdash; and, presumably, the concern expressed by churchmen &mdash; as nothing more than political catch cries while, in the same breath, he is calling for consensus on the issue.</P>
    <P>We have seen the dictatorial and sometimes questionable and illegal manner in which the Minister for Social Welfare implemented changes which affect the poorest people in our community. We have also seen by the stroke of a pen people stripped of benefits for which they have built up entitlements during their 30-40 years working lives.  We have seen the complacent and incompetent manner in which the Minister for Finance and the Government have addressed the increases in interest rates, apparently oblivious to the hardship being caused to families and to job protection and creation.</P>
    <P>During that time it has become clear that Fianna Fáil in Government have little or no idea of the pain and social damage mass unemployment causes, and less idea still of the policies that need to be implemented to begin to turn that situation round.  The internal wrangling <Col N="527" /> in Government about the Culliton Report, for example, demonstrates that the report has become an object of political point scoring between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats when the country is crying out for action on that report.  The people do not need that sort of politics.  The unemployed, the poor and everyone concerned for the future of this country are looking to their elected leaders for some imagination, some understanding of human problems and some courage.  They are getting none of that from this Government, and that is why it is time that this Government sought a new mandate from the people.</P>
    <P>Our economy is bracing itself already for another round of deflation, as the Government wrangle over Estimates and next year's budget.  This is an economy which is now experiencing, for the first time, second-generation unemployment. There are 18 and 19 year olds in Ireland who have never known a family member to have a job, 18 and 19 year olds who have grown up with an unemployed father, and a mother who considers herself lucky to be in part-time and casual, low paid employment, 18 and 19 year olds whose future is blighted by the past and by the assumptions of employers that they cannot be employable.  In short, this is an economy in which too many people are condemned to live on the edge, strugging always for some form of dignity, coping as best they can &mdash; and often not very well &mdash; with institutionalised inequality and disadvantage.  They are the new scapegoats as well as being, in too many cases, the victims of failed policies.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I referred to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, and to the fact that he is becoming known as the &ldquo;cut a fortnight&rdquo; Minister &mdash; hacking away at social welfare rights at the rate of about one cut every two weeks since the passage of the Social Welfare Act.  I went on to list about eight significant cuts he has made including restricting the eligibility criteria for maternity benefit and reducing the minimum payment under the scheme by <Col N="528" /> £26 a week; restricting access to disability benefit and reducing the rates; cutting injury benefit by £15 a week; making it harder to qualify for dental and optical benefit and increasing the cost to patients.  I also mentioned that he was penalising workers who receive redundancy payments; almost eliminating the alleviating payments under the EC Equality Directive &mdash; cutting the income of many families by amounts ranging from £7 to £23 a week; cutting the supplementary welfare income of people living in rented accommodation by £1.50 a week &mdash; surely the meanest and most cheeseparing cut of all; and cutting the access of people on very low incomes to the support provided under the exceptional needs discretion given to community welfare officers.  In my view, this latest cut is illegal and will be challenged in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister took exception to my attack on him at the time and responded in kind.  I must tell the House that I did him an injustice in the speech I made in Clonmel some weeks ago.  I referred to about eight cuts made by the Minister; the truth is that since the passing of the Social Welfare Act, the Minister has published no fewer than 21 regulations, the vast majority of which are aimed at worsening the position of people who depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>If anyone is in any doubt about from where this Minister is taking his lead, they only have to look across the water to the United Kingdom and see the spectacle at the Tory Party Conference yesterday when the Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security, Peter Lilley, launched a full scale attack on Britain's poor, branding them all as spongers and scroungers, egged on by the Tory faithful.  Given his recent performance, our Minister for Social Welfare might have felt at home at that conference.  The social vandalism of which this Minister has been guilty, presumably with the full support of his Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat colleagues at the Cabinet table, whatever about the back benches, will be compounded in the future as he moves on to <Col N="529" /> other areas of damage.  Already it is clear that he has decided in principle to tax all short term benefits and to mount attacks on part-time workers and deserted wives, among other groups.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in Clonmel, and I repeat it here &mdash; this has been repeated by others in recent days including the Bishop of Cork, Dr. Murphy &mdash; that this Minister is deliberately and consciously trying to create a new type of citizen.  He and Fianna Fáil think in terms of two classes of people &mdash; a donor class and a recipient class.  For very crude political reasons they are trying to exploit the fears and prejudices of this mythical donor class by turning the equally mythical recipient class into scapegoats.  I have news for the Minister; there is only one class of citizen in Ireland and all his efforts to create a second class citizen, based on an appeal to the politics of envy and begrudgery, will fail miserably.  The biggest fear though is that they might succeed to the extent of fuelling fear, the kind of fear that enables people to turn their backs on one another and leads to alienation among huge sections of society.</P>
    <P>If anyone doubts that the efforts of Fianna Fáil are geared towards creating a permanent second class citizenship, let me ask this question: why have the Department of Social Welfare been entrusted with the introduction of an identity card system, already being issued to some 11 year old children?  If these identity cards are intended to be used by all citizens, as in many other countries, why are they not being issued by the Department of Justice and why has no Minister come before this House to look for a legislative basis for the issue of these cards?  The truth is that these cards are not intended to facilitate anyone in expressing or fulfilling their citizenship; they are intended only to mark people out as members of some lower order of citizenship.  As long as the idea continues to be developed in this way, the identity card issue will be nothing more than an accurate reflection of Fianna Fáil's true intentions.  Nowhere can those intentions be seen more clearly than in Fianna Fáil's incoherent and jumbled response to the <Col N="530" /> unemployment crisis.  Only one discernible thread is visible in the series of panic measures announced so far.  The fact that we have 75,000 people long term unemployed and that that number is growing by the day and now moving into its second generation, does not seem to matter.</P>
    <P>All that matter are cosmetic exercises; keep making cosmetic changes, keep hoping the media will lose interest and find some other issue.  That seems to be the sum total of Government policy. Even a new bugging scandal must come as a relief to Ministers who do not have a clue what is happening or have the necessary response.  That is the first failure of this Government the failure to recognise that even in times of economic difficulty their duty is to protect the dignity and equality of all the citizens. However, there have been other failures. They can be summed up in three different ways &mdash; the failure to develop a coherent strategy in the face of the European monetary crisis; the failure to develop a coherent strategy in relation to Europe generally and the failure to take the wide-ranging and imaginative measures that are necessary at home.</P>
    <P>The Government's reaction to the interest rate increase and the collapse of sterling has been an inadequate and mealy mouthed response.  Businesses, home owners and consumers should not be expected to wait until the Government make their leisurely decisions before they can expect some relief.  None of the available strategies need include devaluation or anything like it.  The long term benefits of European economic integration should not be put at risk for short term relief.  Neither should Government strategy include crazy approaches like offering foreign investors or speculators guarantees if they buy Irish gilts.</P>
    <P>We have already outlined some effective strategies which are available for rapid implementation and results.  The Government must take action, if necessary, in the context of a mini-budget to protect home owners against the massive impact of increases in the mortgage rate. The Government must consider even on <Col N="531" /> a temporary basis, raising the ceiling for mortgage interest relief to a higher level, say 100 per cent of interest up to a ceiling of £5,000 per annum for a married couple instead of the present figure of 80 per cent of £4,000.  The Government say this is a short term crisis.  If that is the case, and hopefully despite the announcement made this morning by a senior banker it is, this measure will not cost the Government a great deal of money.  For several days before the National Treasury Management Agency took action, we were calling for them to use the mechanisms available to increase the foreign component of borrowing, to provide additional liquidity in the financial markets, and we welcomed their decision last week to draw down up to £0.5 billion in foreign currencies, but there is no reason they should not go a lot further and they should have acted more quickly than they did.  Indeed, if the Minister for Finance had not gone on radio prior to any increase in interest rates, and effectively sanctioned an increase before it was announced, that increase could have been avoided by prompt and effective action in relation to foreign currency.</P>
    <P>The agency have facilities available to them of £2 billion, which can be drawn down literally in a matter of hours. Using a substantial proportion of that facility would strengthen our reserves, strengthen the púnt and ease pressure on interest rates considerably.</P>
    <P>Much of the speculation against the púnt has been done by domestic businesses and some individual speculators and Irish pension funds.  Large transactions where Irish entities sell púnts to buy foreign currencies can be a breach of exchange controls unless they are carried out with the permission of the Central Bank.  The Government should be ordering the maximum monitoring and control of such transactions to ensure that exchange control regulations are strictly observed.  Any transactions which appear to the authorities to be purely for speculative purposes should be forbidden.</P>
    <P>The Government should establish a fund &mdash; part of the so-called £100 million <Col N="532" /> could be used &mdash; to assist targeted businesses which have been particularly affected by changes in sterling.  These would in the main be labour intensive businesses which export to the UK and/or which import raw materials from the UK. This fund should be administered by the IDA in the short term and not by the trade board, as I understand is the present intention.  Let me make this point clear.  The fund should be used in a properly accounted way and it should be used only to subsidise employment, not profits. It remains to be seen if these objectives will be met.</P>
    <P>However, these are short term measures.  It is worrying in the extreme that the Government have lacked the courage and imagination to take measures that are necessary in the short term.  What is far more worrying even than that is the fact that this Government have no apparent strategy, as clarified by the Taoiseach this morning, for dealing with the longer term implications of the present situation in Europe.  The assault on national currencies that has taken place and that has caused untold damage tells us a lot about the Europe we live in now and about the Europe that we need to build.  In a truly integrated and co-operative Europe the outburst of greed and avarice that dominated the financial markets over the last few weeks would not have been allowed to happen.  There has been much talk about speculators going to war against the ERM, as if we were dealing with a handful of individuals, armed to the teeth with briefcases and filofaxes, making a killing on the stock exchanges of the world.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;speculators&rdquo; who unleashed their greed on the financial markets were highly respected and powerful multi-national banks and other financial institutions &mdash; like pension funds, for example, set up to ensure security for working people in the first instance.  British banks, in all probability, made huge profits from bringing sterling to its knees. British pension funds have contributed to the thousands of job losses that may well flow from the damage that has been done to the British economy and to Irish competitiveness, as we have already seen <Col N="533" /> job losses directly caused by the weakness of sterling.  The philosophy that has underpinned this immoral and irrational outburst of greed is the philosophy known as &ldquo;free market forces&rdquo;.  Whatever the markets do &mdash; even if the actions of the markets bring countries to the brink of financial humiliation, as happened across the water &mdash; must be all right, because &ldquo;free market forces&rdquo; is the new religion, the markets are the new cathedrals, and the speculators the new high priests.</P>
    <P>There are, or there ought to be, lessons in all of this.  In the context of Europe the lesson surely is a simple one.  The only kind of Europe that will work is a highly co-operative Europe.  A Europe built exclusively on free market forces cannot survive indefinitely.  A progressive Europe must by definition be a social Europe as well as a highly dynamic and efficient one.  It must be a Europe prepared to distribute wealth wisely and fairly, as well as to create wealth.  When I attend the meeting of leaders of the Socialist Parties in Europe this weekend, that is the model of an integrated Europe I will be pressing for, and I know that view will be shared by all of my colleagues at that meeting.</P>
    <P>However, the principle of integration cannot be lost sight of either in the midst of all these setbacks to the Maastricht Treaty.  In many ways the Treaty is less important than the spirit of integration and the commitment to integration. The principle is this, European integration is vital, because the most likely alternative is disintegration and the chaos we have had for the past few weeks.  The spirit and the process must be rebuilt even if that involves making the kind of changes that will make the present Treaty more accessible and meaningful to citizens.  It will never be enough to build a Treaty supported by bankers and financiers.</P>
    <P>By the same token, European integration must not, and cannot, be built around the notion of a two-speed or a three-speed Europe.  It would be my hope and expectation that the Irish Government will fiercely resist the incipient moves already taking place in that direction. <Col N="534" /> In a recent newspaper article I argued that we have to make the case again and again that it would be a major historical miscalculation on the part of any EC member state to believe that the exclusion of Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece as well as Ireland, which account for 50 per cent of EC output, from any monetary union would not undermine, perhaps fatally, the EC itself.  The Maastricht treaties cannot be implemented on an <i>a la carte</i> basis.  They fall unless they apply to all.</P>
    <P>Neither will European Union succeed unless it addresses the needs of the millions unemployed in the Community, whose number is set to rise.  Uncertainty and unemployment are the twin effects of an economic policy which has exchange rate stability and low inflation as its overriding priorities irrespective of the consequences for the level of economic activity and employment.  The Bundesbank which, in the interest of German unification, was prepared to go along with parity between the East German currency and the Deutsche Mark was not so accommodating when asked to reduce German interest rates to preserve sterling's position in the ERM.  For an institution which claims to be independent of politics there have issued in the past two weeks a number of statements from its spokesmen, all of which seem to me a rejection in one form or another of both a European Central Bank and a single currency as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.  This is unhelpful to those countries, including us, which are coping with the severe adjustments necessary to stay within the ERM in the face of persistent speculation.</P>
    <P>The paradox for Ireland is that having taken corrective action to reduce inflation and our public sector deficit, which are now close to the Maastricht conditions for European Monetary Union, we find that interest rates are up by 3 per cent and may have to rise further to stay with the Deutsche Mark.  Germany's public sector deficit is well outside the 3 per cent target rate.  If Germany were to fund more of the costs of unification through increased taxes, German interest rates could be reduced, <Col N="535" /> thus helping other currencies to stabilise.</P>
    <P>Our Government could hardly be expected to achieve such a development alone.  However, it is in the interest of those countries whose currencies are under attack to strongly urge Germany to take account of the European implications of German monetary policy.  As our main trading partner, it is in our interest that Britain should not be shunned but rather encouraged back into the fold.  This is the only way to avoid devaluation of the punt, because there is no political possibility of Mr. Major bringing the Maastricht Bill before the House of Commons and the UK rejoining the ERM without some movement in German interest rates.  Until the Danes and the UK pass the Treaty the current uncertainty will persist and sterling will remain outside the ERM and probably continue to fall.  That would force us to choose between devaluation or crippling interest rates.</P>
    <P>Interest rates at current levels are unsustainable; they have to be brought down.  Apart from the measures which we can take here, Germany has to be encouraged to give positive leadership on this question immediately.  Otherwise the special summit in Birmingham could mark the beginning of the break-up of the EC and not just the end of Maastricht. Without a reduction of German interest rates, Irish rates are not going to come down and stay down.  The consequences do not appear to have been taken on board by the Government for a period beyond three months.  That would represent an unacceptable price for membership of any monetary union.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Finance will have an opportunity during the course of the day to comment on interest rates and the statement this morning by a senior bank official.  Many people will be dismayed by the fact that the high interest rates are likely to continue for a further 12 months and, perhaps, indefinitely. Direct intervention and clarification by the Minister is necessary today before there is further panic in business and domestic situations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> On the wider issue of the appropriate economic policies which EC countries should pursue, unless there is a co-ordinated European reflation the prospects of additional growth for monetary union, whether one-speed or two-speed, will simply not materialise.  The US and Japanese Governments are at least actively trying to stimulate their economies. Germany now greatly influences the macro-economic policy of the majority of EC countries.  The current policy may be working for Germany, but it is not working for the rest of the European Community.</P>
    <P>While I do not believe the Maastricht Treaties are a sufficient recipe for unifying Europe, we have had a glimpse over the past two to three weeks of the forces unregulated capital markets can unleash.  It is time the people of Europe were heard through their democratic representatives. Otherwise they may turn to those who offer apparent security in regionalism, nationalism or even worse. In my opinion that would be a disaster for Ireland and the European Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The stresses within Germany from the influx of East Europeans and refugees from Yugoslavia probably are not fully appreciated by other countries.  Those stresses can be resolved within a European context only through the development of a coherent foreign policy toward the new East European democracies.  I am hopeful that democracy will not fail Europe as it did in the thirties; but it will require a commitment to a Europe of full employment, equal opportunities and co-operation if it is to succeed.  The consensus for European unity will flounder if monetary union proceeds while these goals are overlooked.  It is time for us to begin giving leadership, if only we had a Government that recognised the urgency of so doing.</P>
    <P>There are measures we can take in relation to our difficult position.  Six months ago I referred to the unemployment crisis as a moral issue.  I believe it is a moral issue.  I repeated that assertion a couple of weeks ago, in fact on the same day that Cardinal Daly made <Col N="537" /> the same point.  But this Government appear blind to the reality of that moral issue, to the kind of all-embracing crusade we need to confront it.  The Taoiseach's remark this morning that the unemployment crisis is merely a function of demographic factors and inward migration &mdash; in other words, the people of Ireland are to blame for the crisis &mdash; is a good illustration of how blind are the Government to the reality.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party do not claim to have all the answers; nobody does.  This emergency warrants a response from everyone and will not be confronted unless we are all prepared to swallow unpalatable medicine.  That is why I say we must start from the point that it is an emergency.  The Government should make no bones about it.  There is an emergency and crisis confronting all of us in relation to the high levels of our unemployment.  There is not a household here that has not been touched by this emergency.  Equally, there is not a household here that cannot contribute to its solution.  We have to begin by agreeing that the time has come for a redirection of Government policy to the objective of full employment at adequate levels of income.  This must be sufficient to provide a standard of living which improves in line with the increase in wealth and income generated in Ireland and within the European Community.</P>
    <P>With total unemployment in the EC standing at 15 million people and Ireland's total out of work numbering 300,000, this may seem unrealistic.  Seven million people have been out of work for over a year in EC countries.  It must also be recognised that involuntary unemployment in the European Community, particularly in Ireland, will continue to grow unless Governments rededicate their main priority of public policy to full employment.  Nothing less will achieve the necessary political mobilisation of people and of resources which are available on a scale that did not exist after World War II or in previous decades.  In the context of that kind of mobilisation we can adopt the medium and longer term approaches the Labour Party <Col N="538" /> advocate in regard to the issue of industrial policy, the issue of State intervention, our opposition to privatisation and so on.  But we cannot ignore the urgency of acting now, if for no other reason than to prevent the explosion of the powder keg of social marginalisation which daily threatens our society.</P>
    <P>For that reason I want to put forward some constructive suggestions of what can and should be done now.  I shall repeat some I made in the course of the summer.  A great deal of Government time has been taken up with privatisation legislation.  The failure of the Government's one real attempt to actively promote, on a selective basis, the growth of a large indigenous manufacturer &mdash; Goodman International &mdash; may have profound implications for the prospects of the Culliton report's recommendations in that regard being implemented by any Government in the foreseeable future. The food industry, in particular the dairy co-operatives, is badly in need of urgent action to restructure it into businesses of sufficient scale to successfully compete and survive in the new Europe.</P>
    <P>While the IDA have been engaged in company development programmes since 1985 with a number of food companies, the critical issue of reaching the minimum turnover threshold of £2 billion to compete in Europe has been put on the back burner.  There is a serious danger that a combination of the Goodman fiasco and the distraction of a great deal of Government energies in privatisation of part or all of the remaining State assets may see a neglect of the development of even one large indigenous food company here.  The Culliton report's apparent urging or encouragement of foreign investment in the food industry at best would appear to be a second best strategy in addressing this dilemma.  The dairy co-operatives now represent the only serious capability of indigenous food companies with the potential to develop into Irish international food companies.  What is urgently needed is an integrated development plan which clearly spells out to the co-operatives that State support will be <Col N="539" /> supplied only in support of mergers among them in respect of their European operations.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the Government introduced a 3 per cent quota for employment in the public service for those with a physical or other disability.  The idea was a recognition that in the open labour market active discrimination in favour of a group which would otherwise experience massive discrimination was essential.  Unfortunately, that 3 per cent target, like the 0.7 per cent target for overseas development aid, has been honoured in a largely token manner.  In 1990 545 people only were employed in the public services which, out of a total of 179,000 people employed, was considerably below 3 per cent.  Unemployment among people with disabilities now is estimated at 80 per cent.  The long term unemployed fall into the same social category as the disabled in the labour market &mdash; they are out of sight and, sadly, out of mind.  In practice the disabilities from which they suffer are social &mdash; age, education, sometimes health-related, the number of dependants and lack of a recent employment record.</P>
    <P>In any programme targeted at the long term unemployed the Irish Government and society in general first should address the shameful neglect of the group most vulnerable to discrimination, those with a physical disability or mental handicap. The 3 per cent quota should be given the place it was originally accorded and met in earnest by Government.  In this respect the Government can give a lead by honouring their pledge in the public sector. In addition serious consideration should be given to legislation for a quota throughout our economy.  At the very least this issue should be on top of the agenda for any future talks between Government and the social partners.</P>
    <P>Ireland must recognise the growing plight of the 400 million inhabitants of the Continent of Africa in danger of suffering from drought, famine and disease while the countries of the north continue to prosper.  Of course, there are many countries of the Third World outside of Africa also in need of key personnel and aid. <Col N="540" /> In this respect President Robinson has shown us the way.  By increasing Ireland's commitment to overseas development aid from the current shameful level of 0.2 per cent of GNP to 0.7 per cent by the year 2000 we could provide up to 6,000 professionally trained Irish personnel, free of salary costs, to developing countries. This would create vacancies during the period such personnel were employed in the Third World while making a real contribution to the Third World.</P>
    <P>Already we have agencies in place with the necessary skills to train and place people in the Third World.  All they lack are commitment and resources on the part of Government.  There are hundreds if not thousands of people willing to volunteer for this work.  Incentives should be put in place to render it a practical proposition.  For example, nobody giving service in the Third World should lose out in the social welfare system; for example, there should be a guarantee of further education for anybody returning home if they want it.  As a first step the Agency for Personal Service Overseas should be asked to produce an urgent study on how we could contribute personnel and expertise if the necessary resources were put in place.  Development in this area could readily be funded by individuals and businesses willing to contribute to recognised Third World agencies working in co-operation with the Government and being able to regard such contributions as tax deductible.  The Labour Party will be moving an amendment to the next Finance Bill to enable this be done.  We urge the Government to accept this approach.</P>
    <P>Proposals developed by the Labour Party some time ago to increase the level of subsidy payable under a revamped employment incentive scheme are borne out totally by the empirical research into employer attitudes toward the long term unemployed and by economic analysis. A national employment job placement and training scheme for the long term unemployed is absolutely essential to reduce the long term unemployment figure to approximately 25,000 over the next decade.  It must contain the following <Col N="541" /> features.  It must be targeted at the filling of any vacancy, not additional vacancies, as is the case under the present employment subsidy scheme.  It must be confined to those who have been out of work for 12 months or longer, or who are currently participating in training employment schemes having been 12 months out of work.</P>
    <P>In addition, employer subsidies must be realistic.  I would suggest the following amounts: £132 per week in the first year; £120 per week in the second year and £120 per week in the third year.  I would suggest also a £2,500 cash grant to employers who retain long term unemployed in employment for a further minimum period of two years.  I suggest also an agreed quota of vacancies reserved for the unemployed in the public and private sectors.  This would be by agreement with employers and unions and initiated by Government.  All long term unemployed taken on under the provisions of the scheme should participate in FÁS-funded training and where necessary a national pre-return to work counselling service should be available to all of those recruited under the scheme.  Funding for the scheme should qualify under the terms of the second Structural Funds programme and be largely self-financing in the long term.</P>
    <P>In relation to FÁS &mdash; the national labour market agency &mdash; I might point out that in an analysis of the composition of labour market intervention expenditure the ESRI's Professor Gerry Sexton rejected the criticism in the Tansey/Roche report on industrial training that FAS were spending too much of their budget on training the long term unemployed.  Professor Sexton's contention that there should not be a completely separate training agency for those in work and the unemployed is at the heart of the issue of equality for the unemployed in their reintegration into the world of work.  There is a good case for the development of separate divisions within FÁS to deal with training and job placement for the unemployed.  Rather than reducing the role of FÁS as the main labour market agency, they need to have <Col N="542" /> their role clarified and focused with a view to supporting the skills training of those in work while actively expanding job placement for the unemployed following on training.</P>
    <P>The Government's £54 per week employment subsidy scheme targets additional employment vacancies over base employment as of 1 November 1991 for those people who have been two months or more on the live register.  This could prove to be a most effective incentive to employers to fill vacancies with young, well educated unemployed persons. However, it is predictable that employers will concentrate recruitment on those under 25 years of age not unemployed for more than six months. Because such young labour market entrants have a high probability of securing employment without any wage subsidy it is proper that this scheme be confined to additional vacancies. However, in the case of the long term unemployed, wage subsidies should be payable for the filling of any vacancy if the long term unemployed are to secure employment.  A certain level of displacement is the inevitable and necessary price which should be paid to enable their re-entry to work.</P>
    <P>Given that skills training will increase for those at work, it is crucial that FÁS retain quality training programmes for the long term unemployed.  By linking training with substantial job placement subsidies the balance of disadvantage, which would otherwise increase for the long term unemployed, can be tilted in their favour.  The role of FÁS as the national labour market agency should be established on a regional basis. Employers should be required to register with each regional labour market board.</P>
    <P>In regard to education and its contribution to the long term solution, I should point out that studies have shown consistently that perhaps low educational achievement is the biggest supply side factor contributing to the expansion of long term unemployment.  The prevention of future unemployment lies in a concentration of resources on expanding the extent and quality of education for <Col N="543" /> the whole population, but particularly for socially disadvantaged groups, and in their case it must begin at pre-school level.  The objective should be to raise the school leaving age to 17 years by the year 1995 and to increase the proportion of school leavers in third level education.</P>
    <P>A sustained expansion of education for vulnerable, disadvantaged children will in time reduce the flow into long term unemployment of the under-25 age group.  Given the chronic labour surplus that will persist until after the year 2000, an expansion of resources in education is the key strategy for improving the future mobility of labour market entrants to other EC countries.</P>
    <P>A national language training programme should begin for all children aged nine upwards and should include at least two European languages other than Irish and English.  Opportunities for young Irish school leavers within the EC will be greatly restricted until the national languages gap is closed.  Indeed our marketing effort in other European countries also will be restricted until we narrow that language gap.  Shortages within the under-25 age groups in Germany and Holland point to obvious choices.</P>
    <P>The expansion of educational services must be State-led and funded, with an important although subsidiary role for the market sector, particularly in language training.  The aim for the year 2000 should be a shift of resources towards education which will improve the work options in Europe for all school leavers. Opening up more choices to school leavers, however, should not be seen in the same light as the recent hidden policy of encouraging as many of our school leavers as possible to emigrate.  Language education is fundamentally important to our future ability to compete in the European marketplace, as well as contributing to the life skills and choices of young people.</P>
    <P>If Ireland adopts a policy of relying on voluntary migration as the main hope of reducing unemployment, we can hardly expect the major EC countries to contemplate a 5 to 10 per cent of GDP European <Col N="544" /> Federal Budget to accompany full monetary union.</P>
    <P>Another essential avenue to expand the number of new vacancies in the labour market is through deliberate expansion of less than full-time work through the promotion of work-sharing. The employment creating potential of work sharing is through the spreading of available work with the maximum possible participation from the employed labour force.  It is particularly appropriate if the vacancies are targeted to directly reduce unemployment, that is, take people off the live register or transfer them from training schemes.</P>
    <P>The national voluntary work-sharing scheme we have already published, which aims at creating 75,000 additional vacancies in the period 1993-95, has already received a measure of support from both employer and trade union organisations. It is long past the time that the Government, in consultation with the social partners, began to address this issue seriously.  I would be happy to supply them with a fully worked-out scheme which would make a substantial contribution to the resolution of the crisis we face.</P>
    <P>European trade unions now are looking at the possibility of shifting annual working hours to a standard year of 1,000 working hours and also to examine structural changes in the pattern of working life, a replacement of the old &ldquo;Three 48s&rdquo;&mdash; a 48 hour week, a 48 week year, a 48 year working life &mdash; by the &ldquo;Three 35s&rdquo;. This would envisage a 35 hour week over a 35 week year and a 35 year working life.</P>
    <P>These concepts are useful as benchmarks in examining the possibilities of a cost-neutral restructuring of working time, both on a weekly, yearly and lifetime basis.  They need not be taken literally and need not apply in any mechanistic way to every economic sector or to every employed person at the same phase in their working life.  However, if we are to accommodate in Europe the growing aspirations of women to fully participate in work, while also protecting the family and family life by providing real childcare facilities which are protective of the <Col N="545" /> family, and release women to participate in the workforce, if we are to eliminate long term unemployment and prevent its re-emergence, then no growth rate achieved even in the 1950s to 1970s period in Europe could achieve all three objectives through growth alone.  The test for Europe is whether it is a Community or simply a market.</P>
    <P>These are only some suggestions, put forward in a constructive attempt to persuade the Government that there are practical ways of beginning to address the crisis.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach referred to those who &ldquo;decry&rdquo; our economic fundamentals. Is he relying on the politics of <i>Alice in Wonderland,</i> stating &ldquo;the economic fundamentals are whatever I say they are&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The trouble with this Taoiseach and his Government is that they have completely forgotten that the real economic fundamental in Ireland is its people.  For as long as that fundamental is ignored, all the other fundamentals are meaningless. It is because this Government have consciously and deliberately failed their people that they stand accused today of ignoring and damaging the real fundamentals. That is why it is time for them to go and to let the people pass judgment on their performance.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to range very widely in my contribution but a number of basic things need to be said, specifically in relation to the savage consequences of the currency crisis, which is being presented by the Government and most media commentators to ordinary citizens as an act of God or something outside our control.  The chaos in the markets is above all else a failure of politics.  The high handed political élite who negotiated Maastricht behind closed doors created the circumstances for the assault on the markets by the speculators and profiteers.  Now the financiers and speculators are in control, dictating to the politicians and piling misery on ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of genuine European integration <Col N="546" /> is a fine aspiration but, as Democratic Left alone pointed out during the Maastricht campaign, the Maastricht Treaty is deficient, the process flawed, and the attempt to impose it on the people of Europe has failed.  For the Taoiseach to argue, as he did recently after the french referendum, that Maastricht was on course was a nonsense and the current crisis is a clear indication that it is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>The governments of Europe must go back to the drawing board.  They must respond to what is clearly a crisis not only in the UK but affecting virtually every economy of the EC.  The response from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance is apparently to carry on regardless. Maastricht cannot proceed and European Monetary Union, an intrinsic part of Maastricht, cannot proceed unless serious political control is exercised over the financial markets.</P>
    <P>The direction and overall control of national economies, not least in Ireland, has escaped the clutches of elected governments and is now in the hands of the financiers who have no interest in the public good, no interest in jobs, no interest in poverty, simply an interest in what can be made out of the latest round of speculation.  It is a curious fact that the speculators will make money regardless of whether our currency goes up or down or whether the British economy is in tatters or not.</P>
    <P>It ought to be the primary objective of our Government to win the co-operation of other national governments in the European Community in re-asserting political control over the financial markets. Repeating the mantra that the fundamentals of our economy are sound, as the Taoiseach did this morning, is nonsense when people are losing their jobs because of interest rate hikes and home owners are being punished in the vain search to persuade the vultures to bring the money back into the Irish marketplace. Without political control the untrammelled market becomes an agent of misery for ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Political control can only be effectively asserted in co-operation with other EC <Col N="547" /> governments.  It is a curious aspect of the way the EC has developed that by and large most governments within the EC and most parties refuse to acknowledge the degree to which they have lost national control over their own economies, markets and currencies.  They continue to pretend that they have power over these things when in fact the real power can be exercised only if they combine together.  The crisis is not an act of God.  One hundred times the Irish gross national product is being traded in the money markets in a frenetic drive for short term profit.  Meanwhile, RTE, our national broadcasting service, turn day after day for commentary to those very economic commentators who themselves, their banks and finance houses, have a vested interest in the crisis continuing.</P>
    <P>The chaos we have seen on the international money market reflects the worst elements of an archaic capitalism.  There is now an urgent obligation on EC Governments to take action to stop the speculation and ensure that entire economies are not destroyed.  Speculators are making huge fortunes on this market but they are speculating not just with currencies, not just with pieces of paper, but with the jobs and living standards of workers and their families here, in Britain and elsewhere.  People throughout Europe are looking in astonishment at these events and asking who is in control, the democratically elected Governments or the unelected speculators who are motivated only by greed?</P>
    <P>A number of Governments share the blame for persisting with national economic policies which were bound to create serious difficulties for other member states.  The seeds of the current crisis were planted when the German Government decided to attempt to fund the cost of reunification without raising the necessary revenue through additional taxation. However, it should not be believed that that is the only cause of the current crisis. In addition, we are also reaping the whirlwind of the Tory monetarist policy in Britain for over a decade.  The European <Col N="548" /> Community and all Governments of the European Community must share the blame for not putting the necessary structures in place to monitor trends, to anticipate these developments and to respond in time.  Speculators have been allowed set the pace and national Governments and the European Community are clearly in disarray.</P>
    <P>The chaos increases the case for more rapid progress towards monetary union, but the proposed European Central Bank under that proposal, which will have a crucial role to play in this process, must be under democratic control.  We must seize the initiative from the bankers and speculators and give it to the people representing us.  I am not arguing for political control in the sense that Governments or even the EC would interfere on a daily basis with the operation of a European Central Bank.  I am suggesting that Governments and the European Community must insist on Central Banks operating to criteria which ensure the development of the economies of the European Community, particularly the least developed areas, and must also insist that they operate within criteria which do not create chaos and destroy jobs.  It is equally important, if there is to be any serious move towards monetary union which will develop in a way which would ensure that the Irish economy is not left in a backwater, that such a move is tied in with a European wide industrial policy.  Unless there is an assurance that areas like Ireland will be assisted to develop their economies and develop wealth creating jobs and that there will be automatic transfers to less developed areas, monetary union alone will not solve any problems.  We repeatedly pointed that out during the Maastricht referendum campaign.  Unfortunately the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party ignored what we were saying on these issues.  The chickens have now come home to roost.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party is now doing astonishing U-turns on the position he announced during the referendum campaign on Maastricht.  I whole heartedly <Col N="549" /> welcome the fact that he has discovered the errors he made in relation to Maastricht.  We pointed out that the Maastricht agreement was a flawed document, that it represented a flawed compromise.  We pointed out that we were in favour of an integrated Europe but that we wanted a democratic Europe which moved towards monetary union on the basis of all the underdeveloped areas of the European Community being assisted to develop jobs and an economy which could sustain their populations so that people would not be sucked out of Ireland, Spain and Greece to other parts of the European Community and elsewhere to take up jobs when jobs should be created in the peripheral areas.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of comment about the position of sterling and what our relationship to it should be, now that sterling is outside the ERM and is floating freely.  That is an aspect of the current problem which the House should address.  Almost one-third of our exports are to the UK; in terms of value added, the proportion is greater than one-third. Since we are talking about our nearest neighbour and a market of more than 50 million people, it is reasonable to suggest that we will continue to trade at around 30 per cent with the UK.</P>
    <P>This is a large proportion of our trade that must be protected.  I am not arguing that we should hitch our wagon to Britain's declining industrial star.  There are fundamental and inherent weaknesses in the British economy which 13 years of Thatcherism has deepened.  It is this fundamental weakness in the British economy that set the scene for black Wednesday.  The vultures were only waiting to swoop.</P>
    <P>As I have said already the conventional wisdom that German unification is responsible for the sterling crisis is only part of the explanation.  Of course, if Germany was prepared to take fiscal rather than monetary measures to pay for unification it would have been less painful for all of us.  The Bundesbank vetoed that approach but if the underlying weakness of the UK economy was not a factor, the pound might have weathered <Col N="550" /> the storm.  It is wrong to suggest, as some commentators have, that we should renew the link with sterling.  There is no future for this economy in tying ourselves to an economy in trouble.  There is no joy for Irish people in the decay of the British economy which has given jobs to so many Irish people for almost 100 years when our economy could not, and still does not, provide adequate numbers of jobs to the people who need them here.</P>
    <P>If our economy is to expand and create wealth and jobs, our exporters must be induced to look for new markets in the European Community, in particular in Germany and the Benelux countries.  Our task therefore, is to protect what we have in the UK and expand our market share in the rest of the European Community. For that reason, I agree with the Government objective of staying with the Deutsche Mark.  However, if the pound was to continue to fall, although there are hopeful signs that it is beginning to stabilise, it is clear that there would be serious implications for employment in vulnerable traded sectors to the UK.  We are, without a doubt, between a rock and a hard place.  Provided political leaders can assert themselves in the manner I suggested earlier, a negotiated realignment within the ERM is the best of difficult options.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the man or woman in the street thinks the pound is worth £1.06.  The Government can, if they wish, talk us into the fast lane, it would be a bit like believing that the Olympics will come to Dublin some time, but talk about the fundamentals being sound rings hollow for the people who live in the real economy.  No economy that has 20 per cent of its people unemployed and 30 per cent of its people living on or below the poverty line can claim that the fundamentals are sound.  Therefore protection of existing employment must be a priority and subsidies, welcome as they are, can only be a short term remedy.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that it must be said that a negotiated realignment within the ERM may well be inescapable.  I do not believe that a limited move towards the pre-crisis status would necessarily be <Col N="551" /> punitive since I do not believe that it would be inflationary.  Even for those companies sourcing their imports in the European Community there are currently considerable savings for those importing from Britain.  The impact would be tempered by the fact that many of these imports are in any event intra-company transactions.  Certainly, when faced with the alternative, which is job losses, this approach is more acceptable.</P>
    <P>A number of issues arise from the current crisis which also need to be addressed and which I want to advert to briefly.  The fact that the Government have announced a £50 million package to assist exporters is certainly to be welcomed and I hope that it has the desired effect of protecting jobs.  However, there is also a need for strong action on the question of profiteering on the part of companies that are currently importing the bulk of their goods from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>In the past number of weeks the punt has been effectively revalued upwards against sterling be roughly 16 per cent, depending on the day the calculation was made.  While this obviously poses a threat to jobs in companies which export to Britain, it should also have led to an across-the-board reduction in the price of goods imported from there.  However, there has been no serious evidence yet of any widespread reduction in the price of goods.  Weekend shoppers will tell one that there has been some reduction but that the price of most goods has remained static and this is true not just of goods bought in advance but of items purchased on a weekly basis such as publications and perishable foodstuffs.  If private industry expects assistance when some firms get into difficulty because of the currency crisis, there is an obligation on them to ensure that the benefits are passed on as savings to customers.  In the absence of any immediate response from industry and businesses to this kind of appeal, then obviously the Minister for Industry and Commerce has an obligation to ensure that they do in fact reduce their prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> The other serious impact which the current crisis has had is on those who are attempting to buy their own homes. Increasing mortgage rates by 3 per cent is bleak news for householders.  It is virtually certain that in many cases people will have to find an extra £80 per month to pay their mortgages.  There are tens of thousands of families in this situation and their standard of living will be badly hit. The mortgage increase will, in many cases, more than wipe out the benefit of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increases over the past two years.  Workers on the average industrial wage would have benefited by about £16.70 per week from the combined 7 per cent <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increases over the past two years but if these same workers have a mortgage of £40,000 they will see a drop in income of about £21 a week.  Any reduction in the price of some goods arising from exchange rate fluctuations is unlikely to go anyway towards compensating people for that loss.  Householders who face a major drop in income are entitled to the same consideration as those exporters who have difficulty in selling into the British market.  Families will simply have to be compensated either by increased wages and social welfare payments or a reduction in the tax burden where that is applicable.  Ordinary families struggling to make ends meet must not be the only ones asked to put their hands in their pockets to pay the cost of the current appalling currency speculation.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that the current crisis is primarily a political failure of the Governments of the European Community to exercise control over the money markets.  It is not good enough to argue on the one hand that we can as a Community establish monetary union and, on the other, when weaknesses show up in the ERM, throw our hands up in the air and say we cannot control it, that, in the words of Margaret Thatcher, the market cannot be bucked.  If that is true then we may as well all fold up our tents and go home and stop pretending that we have any role in society whatsoever.</P>

      <P>This debate is taking place against the background of a currency crisis and a jobs crisis, of uncertainty about the European Community and the increasing loss of confidence in this Government.  To date their response to the crisis and the challenges facing the Irish economy has been inadequate and shortsighted.  They have given no indication that they have come to grips with the situation.</P>

      <P>The Government's failure to come to terms with the change in policies necessary to overcome the crisis is exacerbating divisions between different sections of our society and weakening our capacity to overcome problems and achieve progress.  I was astounded to hear the Taoiseach say this morning that the people who said that society was being weakened by what is happening, by the fact that we have 300,000 people unemployed, were harbingers of bad tidings. If he read any of the social documents being produced, if he listened to what was being said, particularly at the conference hosted last weekend by the Bishop of Cork about the effect unemployment is having in Cork and particularly on the north side of Cork, he could not come out with that statement.  Certainly the person who wrote that into his speech must have no understanding of the hardship being experienced by many families all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed market development fund is an example of the Government's failure to act imaginatively and to develop clear and practical policies.  The application and operation of the fund raises a number of questions and problems. For instance, what would be the cost to a company when they apply for assistance from this fund?  I have been speaking recently about the loss of competitiveness being experienced by Irish firms because of Government action in <Col N="554" /> this regard.  Here is another example. Even as I speak, I gather the rules relating to the fund are being rewritten. What was in the papers yesterday will no longer apply.  I am not sure if that is correct but I was told that in the last hour or so.  The subsidy will be based on the percentage of a firm's exports to or imports from the UK.  If auditors' accounts are necessary to apply for the funds, then the whole benefit of the fund will be destroyed because of the cost of making the application and the bureaucracy of going to auditors to go through accounts to make sure that firms are not using fictitious figures to get a grant.</P>
    <P>I have already made the point, in this House and elsewhere, that the cost of complying with more and more Government laws and regulations is having an adverse effect on the cost of doing business in this country.  Yesterday I asked the Minister if any assessment had been done as to the effect of Government regulations on the profitability of small and medium sized businesses.  He said that an assessment had been undertaken nationally in 1988-90, that in the course of their work the group who had been asked to do the assessment considered approximately 100 proposals from various interested bodies to lighten the administrative burden of business, that a number of these proposals resulted in the implementation of recommendations made to the Department and that no recent assessment has been done.</P>
    <P>The position has got considerably worse since 1988 in that regard.  One can be sure that if 100 proposals were forwarded by various industrial bodies in 1988 the number has trebled or quadrupled at this stage.  From my connections with the business community, both in my private life and in relation to my responsibilities in this House, I am aware that the cost of complying with Government regulations is high on the list of complaints of industrial bodies, business houses and others.</P>
    <P>For example, the provisions of the Finance Act, 1992, allow the Revenue Commissioners ensure that publicans do not <Col N="555" /> receive licences until their affairs are cleared up with them.  I object to the attitude, adopted by Members of this House and the media, that all publicans and owners of small businesses are dishonest crooks who are trying to do down the rest of the people.  Most of them are one or two man businesses and they are finding it extremely difficult to make a living given that they are continually under pressure from the bigger concerns which are able to sell drink at cheaper prices.  The Finance Act, 1992 will sound the death knell for many of these businesses which are social clubs in many parts of rural Ireland.  So far as business is concerned, the Finance Act, 1992 is the most disastrous legislation ever put through this House.</P>
    <P>Has the new scheme to which I referred, the market development fund, been approved by the European Community as it appears to distort competition and contravene the Competition Bill which was passed in this House last year?</P>
    <P>A number of other shortcomings and problems should be noted.  Data distortions caused by multi-national experts mean that much of the analysis of our dependence on the British market and our relative competitiveness is not soundly based.  The Taoiseach said that only 32 per cent of our export go to Britain and therefore the problem is not as great as people seem to think.  That is quite wrong because those firms which export to Britain are labour intensive indigenous industries such as the clothing, furniture and food industries which have low margins and high employment levels.  They are 100 per cent Irish owned. They are the firms affected whereas the big export firms are not exporting to Britain or if they are they are not as price sensitive as the smaller indigenous firms. For indigenous businesses, the British market is a vital one and in many ways it represents a base for sales without which many firms would be at risk.</P>
    <P>The currency change against sterling has come after a period of depressed demand on the British market so that the <Col N="556" /> loss of competitiveness being experienced adds to the list of problems that companies are facing.  The suggestion that we should use data such as the percentage of output exported to Britain as an indicator of the relative importance of the British market is too crude a measure because many firms which export, say only 10 per cent of their output, find that it is the 10 per cent of their sales that makes the difference between survival and loss on the one hand and failure and closure on the other.</P>
    <P>The criteria for compensating measures put forward by the Government need to be spelled out clearly.  If it is only to be available, as the media reports suggest, to firms which export more than 50 per cent of their output to Britain I am not sure if many of the firms in trouble will be eligible.  I understand that this is being redrafted and that the figure of 50 per cent has been reduced to 35 per cent. Evidently, the rules will state that a firm which exports 35 per cent of their output to Britain will be eligible for a subsidy of £50 per employee per week between now and 31 March next.  That is a ridiculous way to proceed because, the 10 per cent of sales to which I referred could be the vital 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is grossly unfair that a firm which exports 20 per cent of their output to Britain should be denied the benefit of a subsidy given that a firm which exports 35 per cent of their output will receive a subsidy.  It is distorting our market as well as distorting what is happening in the British economy.  I hope that when the rules are re-written note will be taken of what I am saying and what I said to the Minister in the House yesterday, that all firms affected should be subsidised to the extent that they are affected, be it 5 per cent of their sales or 95 per cent.  The subsidy should apply to the proportion of their sales affected.</P>
    <P>The Government should revise the market development fund because as it stands it is unworkable and unduly bureaucratic.  Many of the firms in difficulty will not qualify.  If the scheme was changed to allow firms to benefit in proportion to their UK sales it would have <Col N="557" /> a real beneficial impact.  In other words, firms which export more than 50 per cent of their output to Britain should receive £50 for each employee.  In addition, firms which export 20 per cent of their output should receive £50 in respect of 20 per cent of their employees and so on.  Such a provision would demonstrate that the Government recognise the problems facing businesses.</P>
    <P>In relation to who will be responsible for operating the fund, the Minister said that the fund will be administered by a special management team drawn from the relevant State bodies; that the establishment and management of the fund will be supervised and directed by a management board which will comprise the managing directors and chief executives of An Bord Tráchtála, FÁS and the IDA together with representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour and the Marine and a representative of industry/employer bodies and the ICTU.  That is fine but one of the major industries that will be affected is the tourism industry; yet there has not been one word about that industry or any indication that there will be a representative of any tourism body on the management board of this company.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister realises this but tourism is, in fact, an export industry.  Indeed, as we were told by the Culliton review group, it is one of our most important exports and has great potential for job creation in the future. At this time the tourism industry are trying to put together brochures, offers and holiday mixes for sale next year.  Yet, they are not going to be considered for a subsidy under this scheme and even if they were they would not receive a subsidy because it is due to run out on 31 March next.</P>
    <P>It appears therefore the Minister has not thought this scheme through.  Indeed, the attitude adopted by the Government towards the tourism industry is quite extraordinary.  They failed to include it on the list of matters to be investigated by the Culliton review group.  They then hastily put together a tourism investigation <Col N="558" /> board at the beginning of this year but so far as I am aware that board have not reported.  We are now in the middle of October which is the critical period in relation to planning for the tourism industry.  They are stuck with a Government which hardly recognise their existence and who have not published the report on the tourism industry they asked for at a time when the planning process for the 1993 season is proceeding. On top of this, the industry have been adversely affected by the change in the relationship between sterling and the Irish pound.  Despite this the Government are to exclude them and not allow them to benefit from this subsidy.  I hope they will look at this matter again.</P>
    <P>I suggested at the weekend that the Government should consider introducing a council on competitiveness.  Such a council could assess the impact of various measures proposed by the Government on the competitiveness of Irish industry. Firms face additional costs in complying with the increasing volume of Government legislation in areas such as environmental protection, fire regulations, product liability, safety, health and welfare at work and complying with the growing demands of tax legislation.</P>
    <P>Many of these measures set out to achieve desirable aims.  Nevertheless, there is a direct impact on individual firms through the cost of meeting the new regulations in terms of time and administration and the cost of advice.  These costs and their eventual impact on jobs must be recognised, estimated and explicitly stated at the time the Government measures are introduced and debated.  This has happened already in the United States.  A council on competitiveness could carry out this assessment. It would help to minimise the amount of regulation and bureaucratic control on business and examine all regulations to minimise compliance costs on business.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem facing Irish society and industry is that the policy process and procedures are outworn and outdated. We need to debate in a constructive and comprehensive manner the <Col N="559" /> role and functions of Government and the economic and social affairs of the country as we face the last decade of the 20th century.  I think our approach to public affairs has not changed and developed in line with the rapid and profound changes that are taking place in our society.  A very good example of this is the Taoiseach's speech this morning which comprised the statutory one third abuse of the Opposition, one third stating how much worse things were in other parts of the world and the final one third stating how great the Government were handling the situation.  It is palpably clear that things are extremely bad given that there are 300,000 people unemployed. There is a danger of a serious drift in the social structure and no one has any confidence in the Government to do anything about it.  Debates and views on major policy issues are stifled by sound bites and slogans.  This House is not utilised for proper debate and has not the policy-making role it should have.  Our role should be to mobilise the enterprise and initiative that exist in our people and to meet the challenge by competing in today's competitive national environment.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Finance Act, 1992, is a clear example of a Government who do not know what they are doing. That Act has had a more depressing effect on business than any other measure introduced in this House in the last 50 years.  Proof of that is to be seen in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of 19 July 1992 which quotes Mr. Padraig Kavanagh, one of Fianna Fáil's principal fundraisers in the last ten years, who was especially critical of the decision by Deputy Bertie Ahern, Minister for Finance, to introduce a flat rate capital gains tax of 40 per cent in last January's budget.  The list of executives who have left this country is endless.  Mr. Kavanagh has also left the country and is now living in Holland because he, a principal supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, could not bear the burden imposed by the Government. There is no necessity for me to further <Col N="560" /> underline the effects of the 1992 Act on businesses.</P>
    <P>I question the Government's willingness and ability to tackle these issues. I also question the sudden urgency in bringing forward the wording of the constitutional amendments to be put to the people by way of referenda.  The timing is suspect as it is designed to take the spotlight off the financial crisis.  At a time when the Government should be united they published the potentially divisive wording outlining circumstances within which abortion may be allowed.  I am referring to the Fianna Fáil proposal; I am not sure if the Progressive Democrats' proposal is similar.  It is obviously designed to try to take some of the headlines away from the much more serious problems facing the economy.  The social, political and legal questions relating to abortion are deserving of deep deliberation and discussion.  To raise these complex issues this week when so many people are preoccupied with the future of their jobs, their homes and their businesses, is inappropriate and is certainly not conducive to the quality of debate and consideration necessary to resolve these issues.</P>
    <P>The signal the Government appear to be giving is that if we ignore or play down the economic and financial crisis something will turn up, sterling will recover, German interest rates will fall and the Deutsche Mark will be revalued. In the meantime, business suffers and jobs are lost.  I have no confidence in this Government to do anything about the unemployment problem.  As has been said earlier today, the quicker they go and let somebody else who has the vision and the policies to do the job the better.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry has correctly outlined the difficulties facing industry and tourism in terms of the currency crisis.  I would like to briefly focus on the difficulties in the agricultural sector, particularly the food processing sector, resulting from the recent change in the currencies.  The effect of the currency crisis on the agriculture and food sector is negative because no sector is more <Col N="561" /> exposed than the food sector.  Income and profit margins for those involved in the export of mushrooms, sheepmeat. pigmeat and dairy products have been devastated.  The whole principle within the EC of common agricultural prices, whereby farmers throughout the Community get the same prices, has gone out the window with the currency variations. On top of this, as a result of the 3 per cent increase in interest rates, the agricultural sector is faced with a massive bill over a full year of £60 million, with increased costs and a reduction in incomes.</P>
      <P>I would like briefly to outline to the Minister of State who is here today some details regarding the subsectors on which I have been briefed.  There are 5,000 jobs in the mushroom sector.  We export on average 700 tonnes per week of fresh mushroom products to the UK.  The value of these exports in total is £55 million a year.  The sterling devaluation has, in effect, removed a profit margin of 6 per cent to a loss of 6 or 7 per cent.  The knock-on effect is not only job losses, loss of market share and loss of contracts because of fixed sterling prices but, as I have been advised this morning, the only thing exporters can do is transfer some of their inputs into sterling areas &mdash; for example, they are employing transport and haulage services in the North of Ireland and the UK instead of those in the west, and similarly with their packaging arrangements, they are using the services of companies in the North of Ireland and the UK because they charge sterling prices.  This will have a further knock-on effect on jobs in those sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to sheepmeat, the devaluation of sterling has resulted in a loss to the Irish farmer of IR£7 per lamb.  As the Minister will know, the slaughtering price has been reduced to 70p per lb. resulting in cutbacks in the 14 sheep slaughtering plants throughout the country.  In my constituency the Minister's son is manager of a plant which had to cut back the number of animals slaughtered by between 40 and 60 per cent, with a direct knock-on effect on jobs.  Our 52,000 sheep farmers have already lost £29 million through the change in the ewe premium <Col N="562" /> calculation.  Previously, the system operated on the basis of making up the difference between the Irish market price per lamb and the EC basic or reference price, but this year it is calculated on the basic average market price in the Community as against the basic price. Therefore, as our farmers get the lowest price for sheep, there will be a cut of £6.06 in the ewe premium.</P>
    <P>It is high time that the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government took seriously the difficulties of sheep farmers and ensured an increase of £10 in ewe premium.  The principle of common agricultural prices was implemented through a system of monetary compensatory amounts, with a levy on exports from countries who devalued their currency and a refund for those exporting into those markets with devalued currencies.  MCAs do not apply to the sheepmeat sector because there is no intervention for sheepmeat.  Therefore, there is no common sheepmeat price and no levies apply to British exports, which should apply in order to give equity.  As regards other food products it is assumed, for example, that MCAs protect the dairy sector but it is not taken into account that they only protect milk prices.  Processors do not have the benefit of MCA levies and refunds and therefore there is no basic protection.  Where the milk price is only half the cost of the finished product processors are at a competitive loss because the whole value-added element is not taken into account in the MCA system.</P>
    <P>The position is similar in regard to pigmeat.  EC rules prevent MCAs from operating fully and severe losses are being incurred.  Thirty per cent of all pigmeat output goes to the UK.  The effect on sterling is that there is no proper protection and Irish pigmeat contracts are being lost and there is a consequent reduction in the incomes of pig farmers. People often think that these problems relate only to farmers but every £1 reduction in agricultural incomes is a drop in national income, and that needs to be borne in mind by everyone in the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> In view of these serious losses in national income Fine Gael call on the Government to protect the agricultural sector with the following measures. Employers' PRSI should be suspended for one year in all the affected sectors to which I have referred.  The Department of Agriculture and Food should make available short terms working capital by guaranteeing through the commercial banks rates of interest available on foreign Deutsche Mark loans up to a level of £250 million.  This would relate to a fixed six month period of working capital, typically for farmers who are now subject to the 3 per cent increase for purchasing cattle for winter fattening.  The Government should immediately raise with the EC authorities the workings of the MCA system and its proposed abolition on 1 January next.  Given the instability and departure of sterling and the lira from the EMS bands and the devaluation of the peseta, the need for the MCA system was never greater.  The difficulty, I understand, is that from 1 January 1993, as a result of the Single Market, the Customs and Excise officers who operate the system will be put out of business.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, who is in the House and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, to ensure that, with the departure of Britain and Italy from the ERM, the abolition of the system will be re-examined.</P>
    <P>Levies paid to the Department at the point of slaughter on the products to which I referred should be dropped for one year.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should insist that the ewe premium will be increased by £10 to compensate Irish sheep farmers for the fact that we have the lowest sheep meat prices in Europe.  It is also the height of folly that the market development fund, £50 per week, applies only in sterling countries. A factory in my constituency sells parts to Fiat, Italy for radiators.  They also sell to the UK; however, there has been a 17 per cent devaluation of the lira, a bigger devaluation than the 12 per cent devaluation of sterling, but there is no proposed protection for those exporting <Col N="564" /> to Italy.  The same applies to Spain where the peseta devalued by 5 per cent.  The market development fund should apply to all industries, including the food processing sector, who export to Italy and Spain.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there will be benefits to the sheltered sector of the economy as a result of these changes.  The first is obviously a reduction to, perhaps, a zero level of inflation.  If benefits accrue, the exposed and vulnerable exporting and competitive sectors of the economy should, in turn, be cushioned from the results of devaluation.  For this period, there should be a net transfer of resources in the form in which I have spoken to protect jobs, maintain incomes and ensure that there will be no erosion of market share.  Unless these short term emergency measures are taken, I fear that we will see a further deterioration in farmers' incomes and a further series of job losses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will preface my contribution by congratulating Deputy Yates on his appointment as spokesperson on Agriculture.  As he has an agricultural background I have no doubt he will make a worth while contribution to the development of our greatest national industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  In spite of our difficulties &mdash; and we should not underestimate them &mdash; our economy is still very soundly based and has the potential for development which the Government's plan and policies will, I hope, achieve. Our capacity to survive in the face of the currency crisis in Europe, referred to by two previous speakers, particularly in relation to our closest trading partner, Great Britain, is due in no small measure to the foundation which was laid and <Col N="565" /> consolidated by the Government in recent years.  Our courage in defending that position and our capacity to hold our nerve is a tribute to the Taoiseach and the Government in their handling of an undoubtedly very difficult economic situation.</P>
    <P>We have recognised that this rigid holding of the line, which is in the best and long term interests of the country, has created economic problems of verying proportions for some of our exporters, particularly those trading with Great Britain.  However, if confirmation was needed of the effectiveness of the Government and their capacity to adjust quickly to changing economic challenges, one would not have to look any further than their speedy response in putting in place a fundamental package to assist Irish industrialists who are exposed to the worst effects of the currency devaluation in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>From the remarks of the previous two speakers, they seem to be unaware of the very effective action which the Government have taken for the purpose of cushioning and protecting those who are suffering from the effects of the currency problem in relation to Irish industry.  By their prompt action, the Government have demonstrated their national commitment to protecting the value of our currency, which was not highlighted in the debate so far, while at the same time providing support for industry and taking steps to protect employment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that I hope to be in a position to extend to the horticulture industry &mdash; for which I have responsibility &mdash; some degree of protection for the purpose of safeguarding a very valuable industry.  I refer particularly to the mushroom industry, mentioned by Deputy Yates, which now has a growth export potential of £50 million. It also has a very high employment content which makes a significant contribution to marginal family farms all over the country.  I hope, as a result of the very important package introduced by the Government, I will be able to assist in tiding that industry over its short term economic difficulties.  I also hope <Col N="566" /> that other sectors of the horticulture industry which have been exposed to the worst currency variations can be afforded some level of protection.  I know that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, is also examining ways and means of assisting the other vulnerable sectors of the industry referred to by Deputy Yates.  However, he should know that under the package provided by the Government we are aware of the problem and that the Minister is doing everything possible to cushion the effects on the more exposed sectors of the agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>I want to make a brief reference to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which has been well and truly analysed by every sector interested in agriculture.  Naturally we would all like to see farm incomes and profitability increased but we must face reality and realise that that is no longer possible. There is, and has been, gross over-production of many agricultural products within the European Community and the only way to protect agricultural income and the viability of the small family farms is through the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Of course we would all prefer if there were no restraints on our capacity to produce.</P>
    <P>I speak for the Minister when I say that we do not like the implications of policies such as the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; scheme which is alien to the ethos and professionalism of farming.  It does not make any sense to have policies like &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; while, at the same time, half the world is starving. It is a reflection on international Governments that we have not been able to devise a better system, where farmers could get on with the job for which they are professionally trained and qualified, producing food, rearing livestock and so on.  An international system should be devised whereby the fruits of their labours could be distributed throughout the world to solve the massive problems which we see every night on the television screens.  We neither welcome nor like that kind of policy.  My senior colleague, the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, has expressed that view on many occasions. <Col N="567" /> However, we are also realists and we know that, for the time being at least, set aside is part and parcel of overall Common Agricultural Policy reform.  I look forward to the day when restrictions on production can be removed.</P>
    <P>I have referred briefly to the small family farm unit.  Regardless of on which side of the House we sit, all of us here who are interested in agriculture are seeking the implementation of policies that will protect the living standards of those on small marginal farms.  I am very pleased that in the past few weeks I was able to deal with what has been a massive problem for a large number of Land Commission holders.  For a number of years many such holders, experiencing declining farm incomes, were unable to meet the continuing burden of paying annuities.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh and I were able to get Government approval for a package of measures which will, it is hoped, make it possible for the majority of those farmers to come to grips with their annuity repayments.</P>
    <P>One of the measures in that package is an endeavour to bring annuity repayments into line with the profitability of the farming enterprise.  The interest level has also been reduced to a common 10 per cent.  I was glad to be able to announce myself the introduction of a purchase scheme to enable those farmers to purchase their holdings at a 50 per cent reduced rate.  For the first time in the history of this State a Government have been able to face up to what was a talking point for many years.  We have delivered a package that should help resolve the problems faced by many of our farmers.</P>
    <P>In relation to small family farm units and the restructions placed on such units by Common Agricultural Policy reform, one has to give consideration to alternative farm enterprises and to every other aspect of economic development that could be introduced under a regional or a rural development programme.  The Leader programme is at present being implemented in 16 sizeable areas of the country.  I welcome the implementation, for the first time in this country, of a <Col N="568" /> sizeable and worthwhile rural development programme, a programme that will have funding made available from the European Community, funding provided by national Government and supplementary funding provided from within individual communities.  The Government recently announced the introduction of the small community enterprise scheme which provides a level of funding in individual areas for people trying to get a small enterprise under way.  Even more recently, county enterprise boards were established for the purpose of taking development from national level right down to each county.</P>
    <P>Resulting from the introduction of community enterprise boards applications for projects that have the potential to create jobs will be assessed for viability by people who are capable of making decisions and capable of recognising the potential of individual applications. Unemployment is undoubtedly our major problem and all of our policies must be geared towards resolving that massive problem and creating even a minimum number of jobs in each county. The county enterprise boards will comprise a good balance between the public sector and the private sector.  Those from the private sector will be people who have a proven track record, people who have made a success of their own industry. Those on the boards will be able to pool their managerial capabilities in order to assist people who have ideas in getting small employment projects off the ground.  A small employment project might be able to create one job; it might be able to create up to 15 jobs.</P>
    <P>The IDA will still be able to play a major role in attracting international large scale industry to this country, although in recent years the climate for large scale industry has not been good. The Government also acknowledge, however, that within each and every community there are people who have genuine ideas for a project that will create employment but who for some reason or another &mdash; perhaps because of a lack of knowledge as to the way in which a developmental project should be organised <Col N="569" /> or perhaps because of the unavailability of funds &mdash; have not been able to get that project off the ground.  It is hoped that the problems that have existed will be addressed by the implementation of community enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>I sense a new awareness at community level throughout the country.  At last people are beginning to realise that nobody owes us a living and that we have to do something for ourselves.  The Taoiseach, the various Ministers responsible for this scheme and the Government all sincerely hope that the new initiatives announced will provide the stimulus for worthwhile development throughout rural Ireland.  For the first time ever in the history of this country local communities are being given the opportunity to do something for themselves.  I am glad to be able to put on the record of the House today that there is a positive response from all communities to the Leader programme and to the small community enterprise scheme.  The amalgamation of the community initiative that I am talking about, backed up by national government policy will, it is hoped, result in a decrease of the unacceptably high level of unemployment.  I have already said that this is the first time in the history of this country that such an opportunity is being provided.  How will our rural communities develop if we fail to take up this opportunity?  That question is one to which we should all give serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent weeks there has been a rise in economic problems such as higher interest rates, higher unemployment and difficulties arising from international currency problems. Although those problems are severe, there are still many positive aspects regarding the economy.  Ireland's fiscal policy has improved.  Our debt: GNP ratio has fallen from 133.6 in 1986 to a forecast 109.5 at the end of 1992.  It is also important to recognise that Ireland's fiscal recovery has been maintained, despite the downturn in the United Kingdom and the world economy.  Our GNP growth has stayed positive, up 1 <Col N="570" /> per cent last year and with a projected increase of 2 per cent in 1992.  Although the inflation level has risen in Ireland, it is still well below that in many European countries and for the past seven years it has been below that of the UK.  Those achievements should be given due recognition, but the existing problems cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>Employment creation must be increased and existing jobs must be protected. The government recognise their position in facing the problems and have taken measures to deal with them.  I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Liam Hyland, for the initiatives he has introduced in the establishment of county development boards, which represent a very practical step.  As the Minister rightly said there is a feeling that people have a belief in themselves and are willing to create jobs.  As politicians one of the constant problems we have experienced in rural Ireland is that people were unable to get seed capital.  Following this announcement people with ability and flair will be able to create the necessary jobs.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment all those involved in the jobs forum.  Great credit is due to every political party and to the social partners.  At this stage I would invite the Fine Gael Party to join the jobs forum.  We have done a great job and excellent proposals have been made.  We were responsible for suggesting that seed capital was needed in rural Ireland to create small viable companies.  I have consistently said in this House that small firms have a major and significant role to play and this has been identified by the jobs forum; yet Fine Gael are outside a committee who are making a significant contribution.  One of the positive aspects of Government since 1987 has been the involvement of the social partners.  All the social partners, with the exception of Fine Gael, are involved in the jobs forum.  I would ask Fine Gael to have a rethink on this matter and let us all solve this unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to make special mention of the role of the <Col N="571" /> small firms association.  In 1987 the Government targeted 37,000 new jobs between 1988 and 1990 in three areas &mdash; small business, Irish industries and overseas industry.  Small business had an achievement rate of 86.5 per cent compared to 60.5 per cent by the other two. The comparison of the cost per job was significant.  The cost per job for Irish and overseas industry was £19,830 and for small business and enterprise development programmes, it was £9,773.  It is clear from these figures that both the Government and the jobs forum are on the right line in identifying small firms as the vehicles to create the necessary jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate and I shall refer specifically to the market development fund.  During the past number of years we have come into this House to discuss how the economy of the Border region was faring.  In 1983 the then Coalition Government imposed excise duties which had the effect of devastating the trading pattern of that region resulting in the closure of many businesses and filling stations, many of which never reopened.  The situation is different now; it is one not of our making but resulted from forces outside our control. Following the change of government in 1987, Ray McSharry and the present Taoiseach set about correcting the situation. Over the past number of years the Taoiseach has helped many businesses to become viable once more and many filling stations have reopened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again we have the threat of movement across the Border to avail of favourable currency rates.  The currency variation has had a serious effect on the mushroom and food industries on which the people in the constituency depend. Those most affected are the mushroom industry, people involved in food processing, poultry and dairy products, pig and sheep meat and the manufacturers <Col N="572" /> who are sourcing raw materials in other than sterling areas.  A textile factory located a short distance from my home had been closed but it reopened because the workers and some of the management took it over.  This enterprise has been very successful in the past few years but they have now run into difficulties because the product and the raw materials are sourced in this country. Had they been sourced from a sterling area, they would be in a more favourable position.</P>
    <P>The furniture industry in my county secured extensive markets in England but it is once again experiencing problems. As I said, most people in my county are involved in the mushroom industry.  It is an industry which is very close to my heart because I was very closely involved with it in the early years when more people distanced themselves from the project than supported it.  At national level this industry has a turnover of £50 million.  One large company in my constituency has a turnover of £31 million, a wage bill of £4 million to £5 million and a workforce of approximately 400 and that does not include the satellite growers and their part-time pickers which can number 900.  We have a large mushroom compost manufacturing plant giving good employment which is now facing serious competition from Northern Ireland. They use substantial amounts of poultry litter, straw etc.  Many individuals and groups are marketing their products directly to the British market where they have to face serious competition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the market development fund.  A feature of this Government from 1987, and especially in the last few years, has been that if a problem arose it was tackled in a practical, positive way and money was provided to assist the people involved.  I advise the Government to be careful in dispersing this fund.  The mushroom industry has had an increasing market share in the multiples in England but because of currency fluctuations the Dutch may move out and give us an opportunity for further expansion.  It is important that we continue to serve the <Col N="573" /> British market because it is closest to us and has been good to us.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that growers' labour input costs will qualify for assistance.  In return, I hope growers will continue to serve existing markets and purchase their compost from existing outlets and not go across the Border.  The Border has caused problems for that market over the years.  Because of fluctuations in markets and prices in England, vanmen have come over and picked products leaving the outlets to which they are committed short of supplies.  I hope this matter will be carefully monitored over the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Hyland, for what he has done for the mushroom industry and for continuing the policy initiated by the former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, when they saw an opportunity for development in the mushroom sector.</P>
    <P>As I said, there have been problems in other sectors also.  I referred to the textile and food processing sectors.  The number of people working in the food processing industry in my constituency is the highest in Ireland.  I believe an opportunity exists with the funding now being made available by the new enterprise partnership board to increase the number of people working in the tourism sector and small businesses.</P>
    <P>Another area which could be developed is alternative farm enterprises. I welcome the setting up of the new county enterprise partnership board. This is a step in the right direction.  Down through the years I have been critical of the systems we operated and the fragmentation of agencies within counties. As far back as the late seventies I suggested, both in this House and elsewhere, the extension of SFADCo, which has been so successful in developing the Shannon region.  At that time the director of SFADCo was Hugh Quigley, a neighbour of mine.  I suggested that a great opportunity existed for the development of our region through regional funding in the same way as had been done in the <Col N="574" /> Shannon region.  I would be hypocritical if I did not say that I am glad to see this is now being done.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of expertise in my area. I am particularly glad it has been recommended that the chairman of the board should be an employer.  There are many entrepreneurs of the highest quality in my constituency who would have much to contribute as chairman of the board.  I also hope that the members of the board will have a proven ability in certain areas and will have something to offer.  All too often in the case of rural community representation the best people are not selected to serve on boards.  I hope the Department will appoint the best people possible to these boards.  I believe the enterprise board, the Leader programme and the Cavan-Monaghan Co-Op can change the face of that constituency.</P>
    <P>I have been suggesting for a long time that there should be private sector involvement in this area.  We now have an opportunity to have that involvement, which I believe will create jobs.  I should say that it is not easy to create jobs. Governments are criticised for not creating jobs, but they do not create the jobs; they create the environment for jobs.  I have been a Member of this House for 20 years and I have to say that it is only in the past few years that that environment has been created.  It was created through low inflation, low bank rates and a reduction in our balance of payments, which had spiralled during the years before this Government took up office.  The environment has been created but the jobs have not materialised.  I have often been critical of employers, whom I thought could do more.  However, I would also have to be critical of myself as a public representative; we should be doing more to ensure that the funding that is available is taken up so that jobs are created.</P>

      <P>It was intolerable during this debate on the most serious economic problems and difficulties that have confronted this country for decades to listen to the Taoiseach yet again resort to the now familiar bland statements, dodging the real kernel of our problems. He had the audacity to try to point out to the thousands of people who are unemployed, and the thousands of people who are perhaps facing homelessness because of the increases in interest rates, that the underlying strength of the economy is good, that our inflation rate is the lowest in the world, that a sustained balance of payments surplus has been achieved and that our budget deficit is the lowest in the world.  I should like to say to the Taoiseach that the ordinary people of Ireland are not interested in our balance of payments surplus or our budget deficit; rather they are interested in having jobs, in having a reason to live and in being able to survive.</P>
      <P>No matter what the Taoiseach said this morning about the so-called achievements of his Government, I wish to remind him that all of this is very cold comfort to the 293,000 people who are now unemployed and the thousands who will no longer be able to meet their increased mortgage repayments and who as a result face homelessness.  It is also cold comfort to the many business people and farmers who face disaster and ruin as a result of the monetary crisis.  How can the Taoiseach, in the face of such massive social and human tragedies, speak about the soundness of the economy, an economy which has failed to provide employment, homes and security for over 20 per cent of our workforce?  I believe that these problems and difficulties must be faced up to and I would say to the Government: for God's sake admit the existence of these problems and their seriousness.  There is no way out; we are in a disastrous situation.  The quicker the Government face up to this reality and try to do something about it the sooner there will be some hope for the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two most important issues which must be faced up to are very different <Col N="576" /> from the two issues referred to by the Taoiseach this morning.  The two issues I want faced up to are that this country is going down hill at an accelerated pace and that the Government have no plans or policies to confront the major problems facing us today.  It is about time the Government set about developing our economy and creating social justice. More importantly, if they are not committed to doing this or not able to do it, as is obvious, they should let somebody else take charge.  They should let people with policies take charge, people like the Fine Gael Party, who have produced a policy document entitled <i>Towards a Jobs Economy.</i> We have produced a policy which will provide work for our people. We are the only party in this House who have produced a comprehensive jobs policy based firmly and singlemindedly on getting our people back to work.</P>
    <P>I say to the Government that no new agencies or regional bodies will provide jobs unless policies are put in place which will make it worthwhile for a person to take a job and profitable for an employer to create a job.  In short, people must be given an incentive to go to work and there must be a reward for creating jobs.  The Fine Gael jobs policy is based totally and absolutely on creating a jobs friendly environment by building an employment centred economy.</P>
    <P>Since the summer months, when the crisis of unemployment squarely faced the government &mdash; in one week over 1,200 job losses were announced &mdash; we have been inundated with a conglomeration of announcements from the Government none of which has any substance.  We have had a scheme for this, a subsidy for that, the creation of 1,000 jobs in the marine sector and 9,000 jobs in the tourism industry, etc.  Everything is to happen in the future.  As a result the public are so confused that they have no idea of what exactly is happening.  What the thousands of people who are unemployed want is immediate action.  We in Fine Gael demand a medium-term policy, an action plan which can be put into effect immediately and which will produce work for <Col N="577" /> our people.  This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government have failed to produce immediate proposals to tackle the unemployment crisis.  They are not committed to this enormous challenge. The real failure of the Government measures is crystal clear having regard to the employment subsidy scheme and the jobs training scheme announced in the January budget and, furthermore, relaunched on no less than four occasions in a blaze of publicity.  The reality, some nine months later, is that both schemes have been a downright disaster.</P>
    <P>The employment subsidy scheme, targeted to achieve 15,000 jobs, succeeded in employing a miserable 1,230 after six months in operation.  The jobs training scheme aimed to provide 10,000 places, but had an even more miserable outcome with an embarrassing take-up of only 64 places after six months.  It is obvious to everybody in this House that no preparation, consultation or planning took place before the budget announcement. Those schemes stand as evidence that the Government are not in touch with what is happening.  Of course, the Government will place the blame for the failure of the schemes on employers.  This is an indication of their commitment to pass the buck at all costs, to take the credit for successes but not to take responsibility for failures.  It is clear that those schemes were announced without any consultation with the people in FÁS or the employers, on whose co-operation the success of those schemes depended. There was no forward planning, no investigation into the needs of the economy at the time and no thought given to the needs of employers so that they could be encouraged to participate in those schemes.  The schemes, laden with bureaucracy, were nothing short of disastrous.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that at a time of unprecedented unemployment a Government should introduce such schemes with such little result.  Again, it is an indication of the &ldquo;make it up as you go along&rdquo; principle of the Government, but the messing does not stop there. Employers intending to participate in <Col N="578" /> those schemes were told that they must produce a tax clearance certificate.  Some weeks later they were informed by letter that a tax clearance certificate was not necessary and in September they were informed by a further letter that a tax clearance certificate was necessary.  Is that not a clear indication of total fumbling and messing, not having a clue about what is happening?  I readily understand how employers found it impossible to participate in those schemes.  The competence of the Minister must be seriously questioned if this is how he runs his Department.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme and the Teamwork scheme are just drifting from one crisis to the next with nobody knowing what the future holds.  The lack of direction by the Minister is adding frustration and uncertainty to the unemployed who would dearly like to participate in those schemes, but also affecting those involved in the running of the schemes such as local communities, local development associations and local authorities.  They cannot plan ahead because they do not know from one three month period to the next whether the scheme will be continued.  This is the response of the Government in the face of 300,000 people unemployed.  This is the reality on the ground.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister indicated he would replace the social employment scheme with a new scheme but last Friday, three days later, he indicated to the FÁS offices that the social employment scheme is to be expanded.  How can anybody work under this type of direction, saying one thing today and another tomorrow?</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme could have carried out much valuable work in local communities during the summer months, but at that stage it had virtually stopped.  There are 200 people willing to participate in those schemes in South Tipperary but since July we could not employ anyone because we would not be given the go-ahead until 26 September.</P>
    <P>Does anybody, even the Minister, know what is happening or what will happen in the future?  Will the social <Col N="579" /> employment scheme or Teamwork scheme continue to operate?  Will money be allocated for those schemes? This is the type of day-to-day cock-up management that is causing severe difficulties for the organisers and participants in the scheme.  In fact, this is the type of management that is being tolerated.</P>
    <P>The national apprenticeship scheme is in a state of collapse.  Over the past 12 months there have been promises of a new direction but there has been no action.  In the meantime, many of our young people who have just left school are finding it impossible to secure a place on an apprenticeship scheme.  This is another example of the fumbling and messing which is taking place in the Department of Labour, but it must cease. The Minister must decide now the direction he intends to take and act immediately. The massive increase in unemployment of people under 25 years demands action from the Minister.  The Minister should get his house in order and provide them with training and facilities and direction for such training.  It is a national scandal that the apprenticeship training has almost ceased.  The Minister must take responsibility for his actions. His dithering has denied those young people an opportunity to be trained and to participate in employment schemes, condemning them to a lifetime of unemployment because they will not be trained in any area which would give them an opportunity of securing full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The dream ticket we were supposed to have been presented with last February is now nothing short of a nightmare.  The Taoiseach must realise that he is the only one in the fast lane; everybody else is in the lane of reality.  It is clear from the Taoiseach's comments this morning that he is living in the clouds, that he has no realisation of the desperation, hopelessness, alienation and devastation that prevails in all rural towns and communities. He has no idea of the hopelessness and despair of the unemployed. He should quickly realise that talk about <Col N="580" /> surpluses, balance of payments deficits and sound economies means nothing to people without a job.  He spoke this morning about improving the quality of life of our people.  That is solid proof that he is totally out of touch with reality, and for that reason those of us who desperately want to get our economy moving, who desperately want to provide employment for our people, that gives us very little hope or confidence that anything will be done for our unemployed.</P>
    <P>Once again this morning the Taoiseach asked the Fine Gael Party to present their jobs policy to the Joint Committee on Employment.  I might point out to the Taoiseach that policies from the Joint Committee on Employment were presented to Government and published in July last. What action has been taken on them? None; there has been simply no response. At this stage we have no idea what the Government think of the proposals advanced by the Joint Committee on Employment.  It would be a reflection on us as a party were we to participate in such a show.  Were we prepared to put so much energy and resources into producing policies that will provide employment for our people; were we to participate in such a committee and allow those policies to lie there without receiving attention from Government &mdash; as has happened in the case of the first Report of the Joint Committee on Employment &mdash; we would be equally culpable.</P>
    <P>In the face of such unemployment it is imperative that we have a Government and Taoiseach who are in touch with reality, who will actually do something positive for our people.  Indeed, the last thing with which we should have had to cope at present was the monetary crisis confronting us and over which we have little or no control.  We must realise that this crisis adds to the desperation, desolation and torture of so many of our people who depend on this House to devise ways and means by which they can gain employment.</P>
    <P>I believe the Taoiseach's introductory remarks this morning were absolutely appalling in the face of the reality confronting us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indeed glad to be afforded an opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate.  I am enormously disappointed with the Taoiseach's general attitude to the crisis facing us at present.  Indeed, his antics in the Chamber this morning when my Party Leader was contributing in a very constructive manner, warrant an apology when he returns this afternoon or tomorrow morning.  The Taoiseach showed great disinterest.  I hope the television cameras will have registered him cracking jokes with his Minister for Finance, endeavouring to distract him from listening to my Party Leader's contribution.  In fairness, I should say that the Minister for Finance was showing great interest in the remarks being made.  The Taoiseach endeavoured to crack jokes with him, to the obvious annoyance of the Minister, and then left the Chamber.  I suggest that he should leave the House permanently and allow us in Fine Gael to get on with the job of running the country.  It was not good enough and an insult to the electorate.</P>
      <P>I am now convinced that the calling of a referendum on this emotive issue has been done simply to distract people's attention from the real crisis confronting the country.  When I realised that the date set for the holding of the referendum was in the middle of the first week of December I realised it would deny our young people an opportunity to give their opinion on that most important issue.  I suggest they reject all three proposals out of hand until there has been sufficient time allowed for their debate in full.  I found it necessary to make those comments in passing.  I contend it would be wrong were I to allow this type of behaviour to go unnoticed.</P>
      <P>Who would have thought in this House in July last that we would be entering the Chamber today with the country in crisis and this debate taking place?  Obviously it was indeed a holiday period for the Government during which they lost control and touch with reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness, I should say that the last Government speaker, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture <Col N="582" /> and Food, Deputy Hyland, met me on three occasions over the summer months. He has taken his brief seriously, as I would have expected.  He has travelled the country, met ordinary people and rural communities involved in his brief; he has launched Leader programmes nationwide, for which I should like to compliment him and, indeed, I congratulate him on his contribution here earlier though he did not touch on the real problems confronting the food industry. Nonetheless he is a sincere person. It is indeed sad to see such a person undermined by his Leader.  The party opposite should address that problem.  I suggest that they move over to this side of the House when we will take over.</P>
    <P>In regard to job creation, I must point out that it is practically impossible to set up a business here at present.  There is no incentive to do so.  Anybody in touch with people interested in doing so will say that the last thing they want to do is start up a business or create an extra job because if one does attempt to do so one will be visited by representatives of 11 different agencies set up by this Government. Each one of these is a little Hitler in his own right, demanding that this &ldquo;i&rdquo; be dotted, this &ldquo;t&rdquo; be crossed, armed with their bundle of papers and asking whether this or that is correct.  If one attempts to establish a business in an old building one will be confronted by the valuation officer who will immediately revalue the property and the rates collector then demands his pound of flesh. Then there will be the health inspector, fire chief, the Revenue collector demanding where one found the money with which to establish the business; asking whether one is registered for PRSI and completing one's VAT returns.  They will do everything to stifle initiative and no incentive or encouragement is being given.  The sooner such bureaucracy and red tape are abolished once and for all, allowing the people with the commitment and will to do something for their community, the better.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael did not participate in the Joint Committee on Employment because the Ministers responsible were <Col N="583" /> not participating in their deliberations. The Leader of my party made the Government an offer this morning, asking them to have their Ministers participate when our party would do so.  We took an initiative, launched a comprehensive jobs policy and we have done more than the Government with all the backing of State agencies.  We took that policy to the electorate over the summer months.</P>
    <P>I was proud to have our party spokesman on education, Deputy Jim Higgins, visit my constituency when we spent an entire day travelling around the constituency talking to small business people.  What I have just related represents the consistent story we heard from those small business people who are employing between ten and 150 people &mdash; that it is not worth creating extra space in order to generate extra jobs; there is too much hassle involved.  That being the case, something is drastically wrong. Those are the facts.  The sooner the appropriate Ministers realise that, hopefully the sooner this web of red tape can be untangled and abolished.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that there are golden opportunities if only they were tapped. For example, there are 300 million people in Europe in need of services and great play has been made of our fully-fledged membership of the EC from January next within the new open market. There is no point in having 300 million people on our doorstep if we do not avail of the opportunity and provide them with the services they demand.  There is no question that we cannot do that.  If a farmer approached his bank manager when his financial position was worsening and told him he had 20 acres of the best grassland in the county but he had not a cow to put on it his bank manager would not be too slow in telling him that he would be instructing an auctioneer to erect a &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign on his property. If he approached his bank manager telling him he had 40 cows but that grass and fodder were scarce, the bank manager would lend him the money he <Col N="584" /> needed because he would see he was a farmer who had his priorities in order.</P>
    <P>I am enormously interested in food production as I represent a constituency where it is best known how to produce quality food.  Throughout the years we have won awards in various food production areas.  The mushroom growing industry has been one of the greatest successes in this country but is on its knees at present because of the punt-sterling crisis, through no fault of the people involved.  Mushroom producers need help immediately not, as Deputy Leonard was advocating, next week or the following one.  Their problem can be solved quite simply &mdash; suspension of PRSI contributions until this crisis has blown over, by a simple stroke of the pen, in order to curtail the problem before it becomes acute.  That is how it should be dealt with.  It must be pointed out that that industry employs at least 3,000 people in Cavan-Monaghan.  It should be emphasised that, until this crisis broke, manufacturers were seeking additional growers.  It has been a marvellous success story which has given life to small farmers and others in hinterlands where there were spare lands on which they could erect their tunnels.  The Government have reneged on their commitment to them and have done nothing to resolve the crisis.  They appear to be waiting until all has been lost, when they may well devise all sorts of schemes to rejuvenate the industry, but by then the markets will have disappeared.  They must tackle the problem immediately before it is too late. I hope that message will have hit home.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the bacon and poultry industries.  The raw material is being sourced at home.  There is no benefit in the form of cheaper inputs because of the fall in sterling.  People in the food industry are experiencing a crisis.  We can produce the best in Europe and there is a market for quality.  It should not be the case that in this time of crisis the Government are so inept that they are unable to deal with it.  A solution must be found before untold harm is done. People are anxiously waiting; promises are not enough.  The Minister of State, <Col N="585" /> Deputy Hyland, will do a great service to the industry if he brings that message to the Minister for Finance immediately.</P>
    <P>Recent developments on the currency market are not a complete tale of woe.  I am quite proud of the strength of the punt.  I am also proud that it was Deputy FitzGerald's Government which rallied our currency after the disasters of the Fianna Fáil Government who, with the biggest ever majority in this House, put this country on its knees between 1977 and 1981 in an outrageous spate of borrowing and wilful spending, leaving sores which have not yet fully healed.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that the newspaper correspondents pay such glowing tributes to the leader of the Progressive Democrats, now seen as the fairhaired boy of Irish politics.  That man was deeply involved in that spate of borrowing and sat silently in the Government without raising his voice.  He knew there would be turmoil in the Government and in the Fianna Fáil Party, that Jack Lynch would be overthrown and that there might be an opportunity for him to become leader. Deputy Haughey came in and Deputy O'Malley failed; then he reneged and pulled out of the party.  That is history.</P>
    <P>These are the basic facts of how this country got into such a terrible mess between 1977 and 1981.  It was rectified by the following Government.  Now we have a strong currency and we should be proud of it.  I travelled to Donegal last weekend, passing through Enniskillen and Lisnaskea, and I was proud to see the punt quoted at £1.03 or £1.04 at petrol stations.  When one stopped at a pump one was not asked whether payment would be in sterling or in punts.  There are benefits in having a strong punt. Imported raw materials for manufacturing are cheaper, as well as items purchased in supermarkets.  The benefit enjoyed by that sector should be transferred to people who are manufacturing from raw materials sourced in this country. It would not be a major task but it would require initiative and imagination.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many people on the Government benches are aware that 300,000 people are unemployed.  Judging <Col N="586" /> by the way they are dealing with it, one would imagine there was no problem. Excellent schemes could be put in place which would be beneficial.  I have spoken many times about the condition of the roads in my county.  Now that other counties are nearly as badly affected, perhaps I will get some support in this House in calling for money for road improvements. Ireland is a development site and the first thing to do on such a site is to build a road.  The roads in rural Ireland are in outrageously poor condition.  Tourists will not come here and damage their cars on our roads.  Four hundred jobs could be created in Cavan-Monaghan in building and repairing roads.  The raw materials and the workforce are available within this country.  The only import would be tar to blend the stones.  Tar is a by-product of crude oil and it should be used for that purpose.  Imagination is required.  The SES scheme would be an excellent means of employing young people who would be proud to be part of a scheme to develop this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has made the outrageous announcement that an MOT test on cars over four years old will be compulsory from 1 January next. The Minister should put our roads in order first and then introduce his test.  A car is not a luxury.  It is a necessity to enable a family in rural Ireland to get to their church or shop or, if they are fortunate, to get to their place of employment. People are not speed racing in their cars.  The cars they own are adequate for their purposes.  I wonder how the Minister can dare to demand an MOT test when the roads are in such condition. He should be held responsible for any repairs necessary to cars due to the state of the roads.  That would be fair play.</P>
    <P>I hope somebody on the opposite side has been listening to my remarks.  Judging by the attitude of the Taoiseach this morning, I doubt it.</P>

      <P>There is little doubt that this country is engulfed in a most serious economic crisis brought on by forces outside our shores and outside our control. It is worth noting that but for the strength of the Irish economy, brought about as a direct result of policies pursued by Fianna Fáil since 1987, we would have been swamped, as we were in 1986.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about sheep farming, which is of such vital importance to my constituency of Wicklow.  The ewe premium has been referred to already in this debate.  The reduction in the ewe premium in the current year is a mortal blow to the economy, especially in my county.  The Minister is vigorously pursuing this matter and his aim is to redress the position regarding the forthcoming ewe premium payments in November and March-April next.  I wish him well in his endeavours and I remind him again of the seriousness of the position and the ever-plummeting price of lamb.  It is essential that he succeed in his efforts at EC meetings which are to take place later this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the unemployment problem, I question whether it is prudent or makes any kind of economic sense to introduce machinery which replaces jobs.  One must surely question the wisdom of grant-aiding the purchase of such machinery.  I refer specifically to machines being introduced in the Wicklow forests.  A machine is working not far from my home, while 35 men are signing on for the dole.  Were that machine not in operation, those 35 men would be extracting the timber.  I question the wisdom of the growing trend of grant-aiding the purchase of machinery while committing our forestry workers to the dole queue.  It makes no sense.  Will the Minister and the Government <Col N="588" /> generally review that situation and take the matter up with Coillte Teoranta with a view to having it re-examined so that forestry workers can get back to their traditional occupation?  We should go back to having some semblance of economic sense.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 1, 11, 15, 27, 33, 38, 40 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The target set for the Employment Subsidy Scheme was 15,000 while that for the Job Training Scheme was 10,000. A total of £23 million EC aid was made available for the two schemes in 1992.  It was agreed when the EC funding was put in place that the operation and funding of the schemes would be reviewed by Irish and EC officials in the autumn and <Col N="590" /> this review will in fact be undertaken this month.</P>
    <P>Up to 2 October 1992 over 3,300 employers had applied to participate in the Employment Subsidy Scheme and 3,543 employees were recruited under the scheme by that date.  Average recruitment on the scheme over the past month was 200 per week, which represents a significant improvement on the corresponding figures in the earlier period of the operation of the scheme.  Nevertheless, I am disappointed at the level of take-up to date.  I hope that, in conjunction with the Employers' PRSI Exemption Scheme announced last month, recruitment levels can be further improved.</P>
    <P>Up to 2 October 1992, 143 trainees had been recruited under the Job Training Scheme.  This level of recruitment is most disappointing.  I recently announced a range of changes to the scheme following discussions with employers and trade unions designed to achieve an increased level of participation on the JTS.  Among other things these changes allow unemployed persons not on the live register to participate in the scheme.  In addition, employers may now design their own training programme based on guidelines drawn up by FÁS.  The changes also provide for greater flexibility in the duration of training.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to employers to take advantage of the Employment Subsidy Scheme and recruit additional employees from the live register and to provide training opportunities under the Job Training Scheme for young people trying to get a foothold in the labour market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is an extremely disappointing outturn for what was the flagship of the response by his Department to growing unemployment?  Does the Minister not agree that the 200 people per week who are availing of the employment subsidy compares very poorly with the 7,000 people per week who leave the live register, as it would seem that only a tiny fraction of those who are finding work <Col N="591" /> are availing of this scheme?  Does the Minister accept that the scheme has been too bureaucratic in its operation and that there have been too many changes of mind &mdash; for instance, in relation to tax clearance certificates &mdash; to make this accessible to people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to have the impression that all of the 7,000 people leaving the live register every week are not finding work.  We have a fluid labour market.  It is wrong to suggest that only 200 out of 7,000 are taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The scheme is an EC assisted scheme. The criteria laid down require the consent and approval of the EC.  Because the take up in the JTS was not what we would have liked, we went back to the European Commission for consent to some of the modifications which employers were seeking.  As the Deputy will realise, at the end of the day market conditions dictate the level of take up of any scheme.  The general level of economic activity dictates the extent to which schemes can be successful or attractive in any given circumstances.  There has been an attempt to play down the importance of the Employment Subsidy Scheme. There are 3,500 now in employment as a result of assistance under this scheme. The Deputy should be a bit more circumspect in regard to the statistics he is giving for those leaving the live register every week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister fails to understand the point, which is that there are 7,000 people each week who get jobs of some sort and only 3 per cent of the employers in question are availing of this subsidy.  That suggests that the scheme is not accessible to employers who might be in a position to avail of it and that the Minister should look at it again.  Does the Minister realise that the starting date of this scheme and the starting date of the Minister for Finance's scheme have not been co-ordinated and that as a result employers would be foolish at the moment to take on a person because they <Col N="592" /> would sacrifice their eligibility for the PRSI relief?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the announcement of the PRSI exemption scheme we have not had a decrease in the number of people who are applying for the ESS.  I hope the numbers applying will improve when they can take advantage of the PRSI exemption scheme and the ESS when the PRSI exemption scheme comes into operation some time later this month.  In relation to the numbers who are taking up the scheme, I would remind the Deputy that this refers to full time employment only.  There is a lot of movement on and off the register, which probably reflects the varying types of employment available.  This scheme refers to additional full time jobs in the commercial State sector, the private sector and the voluntary sector.  Because this scheme is EC funded they put down the criteria and we have to abide by it if we are to take up the funding available for the scheme.</P>

    <P>Young people are eligible to participate in the Enterprise Scheme, the Employment Subsidy Scheme and many of the general FÁS and CERT training programmes, while the Community Youth Training Programme, Job Training Scheme and a number of both FÁS and CERT training programmes are directed specifically at young people. Teamwork is the temporary employment <Col N="593" /> scheme specifically for young people and up to 2.300 will participate in it this year, while training courses operated by FÁS and CERT will cater for about 25,000 young people this year.</P>

Would the Minister further accept that, to say that this is to be tackled within a generalised approach to unemployment is failing to respond to this disproportionate growth in youth unemployment?

I would make the point that a significant number of young people, 25,000 this year, have taken up both FÁS and CERT schemes.  This is a sizeable number of people being trained by the State agencies for the purpose of providing them with skills which will help them in the labour market.

      <P>Council Directive 90/270/EEC of 29 May 1990 on the minimum safety and health requirements for work with display screen equipment is due for implementation by member states by 31 December 1992.  The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is currently developing proposals to give effect to that Directive and I expect receipt of the authority's proposals in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal provisions of the Directive require employers: (a) to analyse VDU workstations in order to evaluate safety and health conditions which may arise for employees particularly as regards possible risks to eyesight, physical problems and mental stress; (b) to take appropriate measures to remedy any risks so found; (c) to take appropriate steps to ensure that VDU workstations first put into service after 31 December 1992 meet minimum requirements specified in the Annex to the Directive; and (d) to take appropriate measures to ensure that VDU workstations already in use before 31 December 1992 comply <Col N="596" /> with those minimum requirements not later than 31 December 1996.</P>
    <P>The minimum requirements arise under three general headings: (i) Equipment (including display screen, keyboard and work desk or work surface); (ii) Environment (including space, lighting, noise and heat); and (iii) Operator and Computer Interface (including software requirements and adaption of display systems to operators).</P>
    <P>The Directive also contains provisions relating to the provision of eye and eyesight tests and, where such tests show it necessary, ophthalmological examinations. The provision of special corrective appliances in certain circumstances is also provided for.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Directive will be implemented by Statutory Regulations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have still to be convinced that the Minister and the Department are serious about this matter given that the Directive was issued in 1990 and there is still no agreement with only three months to go to the implementation date.  Given that eye strain, fatigue, backache and related stress symptoms have been associated with the visual display unit, what guarantee can the Minister give to hundreds of thousands of operators throughout the country that the basic guarantees of this Directive can be implemented and not put on the long finger like many a directive in the past?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Those proposals are being developed by the authority's tripartite board involving employers, unions and my Department. The authority is also in consultation with a wide range of interests including Government Departments, employer organisations, trade unions, professional bodies and representative <Col N="597" /> organisations.  Workers are entitled to appropriate eye and eyesight tests before commencing display screen work and at regular intervals thereafter and if they experience visual difficulties which may be due to display screen work they will also be entitled to an ophthalmological examination if the results of earlier tests show that this is necessary. Where the results of such an examination indicate that normal corrective appliances cannot be used workers must be supplied with special corrective appliances appropriate to the work concerned. The Health and Safety Authority are working on this and a number of other directives and it will be implemented within the timescale set out in the Directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The current guidelines go back to 1985 and many employers when confronted by trade unions representing the staff say that they have no knowledge of these guidelines.

Finally, can the Minister guarantee that in relation to examinations, tests or spectacles for any of the staff, there will be no cost in future?</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to Council Directive 89/654/EEC of November 1989 concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace (commonly called the Workplace Directive), as published in the Official Journal No. L393 of 30 December 1989.  This Directive is due for implementation by Member States by 31 December 1992.</P>
      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is currently developing proposals for Regulations to give effect to that and several other EC Directives.  I understand that the Authority is engaged in widespread consultation and discussions with a range of organisations and bodies in relation to its draft proposals and I expect receipt of the Authority's proposals in respect of the Workplace Directive during the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of most of the provisions of the Workplace Directive will rest with the Authority in line with its powers and functions under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  I understand, however, that those provisions of the Directive which relate to the general issue of fire are already substantially covered by existing fire and building control legislation which is administered and enforced as appropriate by the fire authorities and the building control authorities.  I understand that the proposals for new regulations are <Col N="599" /> being drafted on the basis that existing responsibilities will remain in place.</P>
    <P>There are no specific provisions in the Directive or its Annexes in relation to Certificates of Means of Escape and there are no plans for their re-introduction under occupational safety and health legislation.</P>
    <P>In as far as the final part of the question is concerned the Deputy will appreciate that responsibility for legislation in the area of fire safety and associated matters is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>

It was tabled by me in response to representations concerning insurance and compliance costs in relation to these matters. Is the Minister aware of the concern that has been expressed in numerous quarters about the ability of people to comply with the statutory fire regulations arising from this directive and the building regulations which came into force recently?  Is the Minister aware that there is a need for transparency and clarify with regard to the requirements laid down as the regulations are not readily understood and, if not, would he consult with the relevant authorities and issue to the Irish market place explicit requirements which can be clearly understood so that everybody will be aware what they are supposed to comply with in order to maintain insurance cover?</P>

The percentage of those that produce such a statement is not what I would like it to be but following the establishment of the authority they can move forward and seek to improve the position.  Given that this is European Safety Year they are doing much promotional work to increase the level of awareness among employers of the requirement to produce safety statements, as laid down in the 1989 Act.  I hope this will be implemented.  While one must legislate to bring about improvements there is also a necessity to seek the co-operation of industry in general.  As a patron of European Safety Year, I have noted since I came into office, that the position is improving in that regard.</P>

      <P>The number of notifications of proposed redundancies notified to my Department under the Redundancy Payments Acts in the first nine months of 1992 was 12,876.  The totals notified in the same periods in 1990 and 1991 were 10,620 and 12,471 respectively.  At 405 the 1992 figure is, therefore, marginally higher than the corresponding figure for 1991.  The figures for both 1991 and 1992 are somewhat higher than that for 1990, but the full year total in 1990 of 13,292 notified redundancies was the lowest annual total since 1979.</P>

      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that employers are required under the Redundancy Payments Acts to notify the Department of the number of proposed redundancies; this may differ from the number of actual redundancies. In a number of recent publicised cases the number of proposed redundancies did not correspond to the number of actual redundancies.  It is true to say that not all redundancies are notified to my Department but if one looks at the trends and the statistics that are available within my Department one will see that the average figure between 1982 and 1991 was in the region of 22,500 per annum. We have come a long way since 1987 and this reflects the improved fundamentals of the economy resulting from Government policy.  This is a far cry from the position which obtained in 1984 when the figure was in the region of 31,500.  At that stage other people were on this side of the House.</P>

Would he also accept that the Taoiseach seriously misled the House this morning when he said we have not had a massive number of job losses in the economy given that the figures quoted by him today show that 102,000 have lost their jobs since his party came into Government?

      <P>As I said, the new spokesperson on employment is admirably <Col N="602" /> selective in relation to statistics.  I pointed out to him that the figure for 1990 was the lowest since 1979.  I have given specific statistics which show that this year to date there has been an increase of 415 in the number of notified redundancies compared with last year.  I also pointed out to the Deputy that when he was on this side of the House the figures were far greater.  Therefore there is no question of complacency on my part.  I would much prefer if there were no redundancies but when we compare our performance with that of previous Governments we all will see that in 1984 there were 31,500 redundancies whereas this year to date, in difficult international trading conditions, the number is only 415 higher compared with the figure for last year.  The facts are that 45,000 net extra jobs have been created in the economy since we came into office.  The Deputy should compare this with the performance of his party in Government between 1982-87 when there was a net loss of 70,000 jobs.</P>

      <P>Statistics show that three out of four return to the labour market within six months.  We have to look at ways in which we can intervene to provide those out of work for more than six months with training to ensure they will <Col N="603" /> become employable before they reach the stage where they will be described as long term unemployed, that is, 12 months or more.  It is not true to say that each person who is made redundant will automatically reach the stage where they will be described as long term unemployed because, as I said, three out of four return to the labour market within six months. We must look at ways in which we can intervene to provide them with training to prevent them being included on the long term unemployment list.</P>

      <P>There are nearly 300,000 people unemployed and each of these will tell the Minister that his policies have failed.  Would the Minister accept therefore that they have failed and that he should change them to deal with the problem rather than throw out statistics this afternoon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we deal with the facts and not with assertions which can be made by anyone on any side of the House.  Our policies have not failed.  The policies that failed were the policies pursued by Deputy Ryan's party when they were in Government between 1982-87 when there was a net loss of 70,000 jobs.  We have reversed this trend with the result that 45,000 net extra jobs have been created since 1987. However the size of the labour market is increasing and will continue to increase at the rate of 2.5 per cent per annum between now and the end of the decade. This problem must be addressed.  It is a daunting task but we must find an answer. However, I am not prepared to listen to assertions from the other side of the House given that there were fewer people working when they left office.  That is one charge that cannot be levelled against this Government.</P>

I would ask the Minister to seriously reconsider his attitude to this matter.

      <P>I will come up with every possible initiative, as will this Government, to deal with the problem of unemployment, but I will not allow people on the other side of the House to suggest that the problems began in 1987.  I will refer to the performance of the Deputy's party and ask the people to judge the credible alternative to the policies being pursued by this Government.  The Deputy is so fond of statistics.  The fact is that we are performing much better than did his party in the mid-eighties when there was a period of stagnation.  I was in the House at that time and I heard the Deputy defend those policies.  If the Deputy attacks this Government I will, at every opportunity, point out the failures of the past when we were on the other side of the House.  That is in no way to detract from the daunting challenges which this Government intend facing to the best of our ability.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the level of training provided by Irish industry, especially in view of the fact that over half of the employees receive no training of any sort in any year; the steps, if any, he is taking to increase the level of training; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on record as stating that the level of training being provided by Irish industry is inadequate.  The Cullition report identified the existence of a skills gap in the Irish workforce when compared with their EC counterparts.  I have had discussions with employer representatives in the context of the review of manpower policy on the need to increase training within firms and discussions are continuing at official level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assistance is available to small and medium-sized enterprises through the training support scheme administered by FÁS to help them improve their competitiveness through the training of their <Col N="606" /> employees.  I would again emphasise to employers the importance of a well-trained workforce for the competitiveness and viability of their firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that more than half of Irish employees receive no training of any sort &mdash; only one in five receives off-the-job training and only one in five receives on-the-job training &mdash; would the Minister agree that this is a serious indictment of employers, taking into account that in recent years substantial changes and technological development have been made in various industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the report to which the Deputy has referred, which was one of the reports submitted to the Culliton committee, points out that training has not been as much an integrated part of our work culture as has been the case in other countries with whom we compete.  Unless we bridge that gap we will put at risk not only our prospects for creating new jobs but for maintaining existing jobs.  I have had discussions with employer organisations &mdash; discussions which are ongoing at official level &mdash; to try to find a mechanism by which funding can be increased for on-the-job training and employers can consider training as an investment rather than a cost, as is the perception at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the failure to date of the scheme put in place by the Minister to promote employment in the workplace, does be believe that training should be considered along the lines undertaken by CERT where there was a clear linkage of training to the specific sector?  Would he consider that that might bring a greater consciousness to individual sectors of the need to upgrade training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The placement rates in CERT, now known as FÁS, are very high.  They are a very successful organisation and I pay tribute to them.  In relation to on-the-job training, there is a prospect that this will become a permanent <Col N="607" /> feature of the training system as distinct from the ESS which, by its nature, is a temporary response for which there is no guaranteed funding for the future.  I have impressed upon employers the need for them to consider on-the-job training as an investment rather than a cost.  While I appreciate that Irish employers are operating under difficult trading conditions at present, particularly those selling to the UK market, it would be short sighted in the extreme not to take up the challenge put to Irish industry by Culliton &mdash; that unless training here is put on the same footing and given equal status to that in other countries we will lose out, given the rate of technological change and product development outlined by Deputy Sherlock.  Basically, it is a matter of persuading employers that to spend money on training is the right road to travel.  I would not like to pre-empt the outcome of the discussions and I hope we can quickly reach agreement on the matter.</P>

      <P>In accepting that the scheme introduced by the Minister was a disaster may I ask him not only the reason he believes the take-up was so poor but why his own target of 10,000 was so much off the mark?

      <P>I would point out that funding was made available to provide that a maximum of 10,000 people could take up the scheme.  I have already met employers and modified the scheme.  I dealt with the concerns they raised, taking into account their claim that this was a bureaucratic problem.  I would point out that at all times I require the consent of the Commission in respect of any changes I introduce; I am not a master of my own destiny in that regard. All requests by employers have been dealt with and I now look to them to see <Col N="608" /> in what way they can take up the excellent advantages available under this scheme.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the number of jobs created by the private sector in 1991; whether he has satisfied himself with this number; if he had any discussions with the Federation of Irish Employers or the Confederation of Irish Industry regarding their contribution towards job creation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to provide employment statistics in relation to the calendar year 1991.  The annual labour force survey, which is the primary source of information in relation to jobs' levels, covers a 12 month period from April to April.  The CSO fieldwork for the survey for the year to mid-April 1992 has concluded and the preliminary results should be available within a few weeks.</P>
      <P>Since 1987, Government policy in relation to job creation has been based on the conviction that national development requires a consensus approach by all participants in the economic arena.  To this end, two national programmes have been negotiated with the social partners to achieve stated economic and social goals including specific job-creation targets. Both the Federation of Irish Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry were parties to these programmes.</P>
      <P>Under the current programme the aim is to create 20,000 new jobs each year in manufacturing and international services. In addition, 15,000 new jobs will be created in the economy under the tourism element of the programme.</P>
      <P>Since 1988, the overall level of employment has increased by 34,000 and employment in the private non-agricultural sector by about 45,000.  Despite difficult conditions last year, indications are that the overall level of employment has held up very well and that the increase in non-agricultural employment should accelerate slightly in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have regular contact with members <Col N="609" /> of the FIE and CII and, on a more formal level, the central review committee routinely monitor the progress of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and receive reports from the task force on employment.  Recently, the central review committee set up a number of working groups with the general aim of increasing employment.</P>
    <P>The continuing high levels of unemployment are of concern to us all and the need for a broad-based approach involving employers, workers, community and local bodies together with State agencies and the Oireachtas has been recognised. For my own part, I try to impress on all, including employer bodies, the contribution they can make to achieve an increase in employment.  In relation to employers, I would appeal for greater participation in the job training and employment subsidy schemes.  Employer bodies were fully involved in the formulation of both these schemes.</P>

The Minister for Finance is at present preparing a Finance (No. 2) Bill in which he is attempting to increase the level of investment which will be available for the productive sector of the economy, which, as the Deputy said, is the only way in which viable, long term employment can be created.</P>

      <P>In March 1992 £7.628 million was allocated to Ireland under the Horizon programme.  All these funds were committed to 42 projects; 31 of the 42 projects were related to the disabled element and 11 related to the disadvantaged element of the programme. Activity commenced in March-April 1992 and a first advance of half of the ESF allocation over the two years of the programme, amounting to £3.3245 million, was received and paid in May 1992.</P>
      <P>In July 1992 the European Commission made an indicative commitment of a further £6.773 million to the Irish Horizon initiative following representations which I made to Commissioner Papandreou.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures in essential services, was declared by order to be a code of practice for the purposes of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, in January this year.</P>
      <P>The aim of the code is to ensure that disputes are resolved without recourse to industrial action by providing practical guidance on procedures for the resolution of such disputes.  The code places particular emphasis on the avoidance of industrial disputes in essential services and sets out additional procedures and safeguards for inclusion in agreements between employers and trade unions in such services.</P>
      <P>The code has been widely circulated to Government Departments, State-sponsored bodies, employer organisations, individual employers, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and individual trade unions with a view to encouraging the adoption of its provisions in employer-trade union agreements, particularly in relation to essential services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employers providing essential services have been asked to inform the Labour Relations Commission as soon as discussions on procedures and safeguards as envisaged by the code get underway and to notify it of the arrangements put in <Col N="613" /> place to ensure continuity of essential supplies and services.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the voluntary nature of our system of industrial relations, codes of practice are not legally binding and no sanctions are provided for their breach.  They are intended to foster good practice and encourage reasonable behaviour in accordance with widely observed standards.  The provisions of codes of practice may, however, be taken into account by courts of law, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, rights commissioners and equality officers in determining issues before them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, I have not been in direct consultations with employers or trade unions in the essential services in regard to the observance of this code. That is a matter for the Labour Relations Commission, who are statutorily under an obligation to promote good industrial practice, and the wider acceptance of the code should be left with them.  Yesterday evening, at a meeting of the Institute of Personnel Management, I simply made the point that in these difficult circumstances it is very important that sectional interests of any kind should not hinder the national interest in these turbulent times.  I want the voluntary nature of our industrial relations practice to continue and I believe that there is sufficient responsibility on all sides of industry to ensure that this will happen.  I hope that what I suggested will not in any circumstances be necessary.  Since I took office I have at all times sought to give space to both sides of industry and given them the opportunity to deal responsibly with disputes.  There is sufficient <Col N="614" /> responsibility and commonsense in the whole arena of industrial relations to ensure that we will not put the vital national interest at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the present rules governing the European Social Fund, ESF, were adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1988 the Irish Government succeeded, against <Col N="615" /> considerable opposition, in having social employment scheme, SES, type employment projects accepted for ESF funding for a period of three years finishing in 1991.  When the proposed new rules, which will operate from 1 January 1994, come before the Council for discussion later this year I shall seek to have SES-type schemes readmitted for eligibility. I have already made contact with the European Commission in the matter and I intend to actively pursue it with them during the course of discussions on the post-1993 Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Community Employment Development Programme, CEDP, which is replacing the SES in the 12 partnership areas established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> will incorporate a training element.  EC funding by way of a global grant has been made available to assist these companies.  I will seek to capitalise on the availability of the global grant in the discussions on the restoration of ESF aid for the SES generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the apparent view of the European Commission that we should be building a greater training element into all our social employment schemes?  In resubmitting our case under the 1994 scheme to which he refers, would he arrange to upgrade the quality of experience enjoyed by people entering social employment schemes, so that not only will those schemes quality for ESF funding but also be more rewarding for those participating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Social employment schemes are achieving excellent results and the demand to participate in those schemes well exceeds the resources available, despite the fact that this year the Government are spending more than £72 million of Exchequer money on the social employment scheme.  I agree that there is a need to incorporate a training element into the schemes, where applicable.  The criteria presently laid down within the ESF regulations that decide which <Col N="616" /> schemes are to be ESF-aided and which are not to be so assisted are strictly economic and do not include the social dimension that is required in order to give more people who are out of work the opportunity of involvement in a scheme, whether it be a work experience programme or a training scheme or some other kind of initiative.  A social dimension is required if we are to obtain the kind of funding needed to deal with long term unemployment, which is becoming an increasing problem throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the first person to say that the social employment scheme is not the real way to deal with unemployment. However, there is a particular need and demand for the scheme at a time when there are nearly 300,000 unemployed and when many people wish to take up work on projects.  Would the Minister not agree that, by placing an embargo on various schemes throughout the country, he and his Department are causing the projects of many community organisations which depend on the social employment scheme for employment in sports centres, community centres, citizen day centres and so on, to fall by the wayside?  Would the Minister give a commitment that the necessary finance will be made available to enable those people who wish to avail of the social employment scheme to do so, pending the provision of proper jobs by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This year more than 11,000 people will participate in the social employment scheme.  That figure is in line with the participation level of recent years.  Demand for places on the scheme does outstrip the supply; that has always been the case.  The Government are spending £72 million of Exchequer money on the scheme.  When ESF grant aid of more than £12 million was lost the Government made that amount available from Exchequer funding.  The Government have, therefore, continued with the same level of commitment to this scheme despite losing the ESF grant that was <Col N="617" /> formerly part of the scheme's funding. As a result of the meeting of the Central Review Committee and as a result of requests from trade unions and others, the number able to participate in this scheme will be increased between now and the end of the year.</P>
      <P>It is true that some projects depend upon the social employment scheme.  I make the point that the scheme exists to provide temporary employment.  I receive inordinate requests from Deputies on all sides of the House that someone already on a scheme be retained, when in fact we should aim to get more people participating in the schemes.  I use discretion and common sense, and when there are exceptional circumstances I try to comply with the requests made.  My record since I have taken over this portfolio would show that I have done that even-handedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was somewhat misleading to say that the social employment scheme is costing the Government £72 million when some £50 million would have been expended in social welfare payments to the participants had those schemes not been established.  In view of the Minister's comments about the continuation of the social employment scheme, I ask the Minister whether he thinks those comments are compatible with a report which stated just last week that he intends to replace the social employment scheme with a new scheme.  Will the social employment scheme as we know it today continue?  Could the Minister help to erase uncertainty about the Teamwork scheme and state whether or not funding will be available for that scheme in the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments I have made in relation to improvements in the social employment scheme, the thrust of the original question asked by Deputy Bruton, are made in the context of post-1994 ESF funding, on the basis that the criteria cannot be changed next year. This year I have increased funding to the Teamwork scheme, as a result of requests <Col N="618" /> received from Deputies from all sides of the House.  While I cannot pre-empt the outturn in my Estimate, I am certainly seeking to make financial provision for the continuation of the Teamwork scheme next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Should we take it from the Minister's reply that the review body will examine the performance and the need for the social employment scheme and will recommend an increase in the number to be taken on in social employment scheme projects for the remainder of the year?  Would those recommendations apply, for example, to community groups that have sought permission for two workers but have received permission for only one worker? Is it correct that there is a problem with local authority social employment schemes in that there is some conflict with certain trade unions and that many schemes are held up on that account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an anomaly in relation to the application of the scheme in certain local authorities as compared to others.  I have pointed out that anomaly to the trade unions concerned and have asked that the issue be resolved as quickly as possible on the basis that it is unfair to local authorities that do not presently have participation in the scheme because of objections from certain quarters.  I should like that anomaly to be redressed.  Under the present circumstances, the arguments that have been used to stop the implementation of the social employment scheme in certain local authority areas are no longer valid.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's query regarding groups that have sought permission for the participation of more workers under the scheme than have been permitted, I advise that it is now open to those groups to contact their local FÁS office to find out whether an increase in numbers will be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if we were more honest about the use of European social funding, used the funds in a more upfront way and <Col N="619" /> recognised that there are many areas, including work with youth, community involvement, local authority work and environmental schemes, in which the funds could be used, he would not have to deal with the representations he is getting for a continuation of individuals on particular schemes?  People are getting involved in semi-permanent jobs and then are being let go.  They face the traumatic experience of having to go back to join the dole queue.  In fact, the work undertaken by those people was not part of a training scheme at all.  I ask the Minister to pursue with the Community the possibility of using ESF aid in a more social and flexible way, rather than having to pretend involvement in training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme is, in essence, a work experience programme and, therefore, does not have a training element <i>per se</i> and does not attract ESF aid.  Consequently the question of increased flexibility in the use of European social funding in the scheme does not arise at the moment.  If we were able to attract increased ESF aid for the social employment scheme by changing the criteria and by improving the training element in the scheme we would obviously be able to have more people on the scheme.  I take the point that perhaps there is a need for a more focused approach in relation to the kind of projects that should get priority in the social employment scheme.  I have spoken to FÁS in that regard.  I am mindful of the excellent work being done under the scheme, particularly in the voluntary sector.  I point out that in relation to the modified job training scheme I have issued an instruction to FÁS that those voluntary organisations that wish to get people on the job training scheme &mdash; which, in terms of allowances payable, is 75 per cent EC funded &mdash; should know that FÁS will make up the 25 per cent deficit.  Many voluntary organisations simply do not have the capital resources needed to meet the 25 per cent minimum requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> I am trying in every way possible to accommodate people in the voluntary sector who are doing excellent work and have positive things to do in the community to improve the take up of the scheme.  Obviously the 25 per cent contribution will remain in the private and commercial State sector.  The voluntary sector have a problem in terms of providing the funding to take up the members.  I am ensuring that that will not be an impediment in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>A study which was undertaken on behalf of my Department and published in 1980 estimated that 51 million hours of overtime had been worked in the production sector between June 1978 and June 1979.  A further 21 million hours overtime had been worked in those parts of the services sector covered by the study.</P>
      <P>The study suggested that in any reduction of overtime only 30 per cent of the hours would, at most, translate into full time jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986, a study of <i>Worksharing and the Public Sector</i> was published by the Institute of Public Administration. According to that study, the reasons for overtime in the Civil Service ranged from <Col N="621" />&ldquo;service outside normal hours&rdquo; to &ldquo;providing cover for staff absent on sick or annual leave&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no up-to-date estimate of the number of jobs that might be created in the public and private sectors if overtime were banned or restricted.  Arriving at such as estimate presents significant theoretical as well as practical difficulties.</P>
    <P>As far as commercial enterprises and the private sector are concerned, it is a matter for management and workers to agree on working-time arrangements through the normal collective bargaining negotiation process, having regard to the basic imperatives of efficiency, productivity and competitiveness while respecting existing legislation on hours of work.  Trade unions would also have a role in exploring the possibilities for substituting jobs for overtime at enterprise level.</P>
    <P>A draft directive on the organisation of working time has been drawn up by the EC Commission as part of the social action programme for the implementation of the European Social Charter.</P>
    <P>The draft directive contains, <i>inter alia,</i> proposals requiring a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours per 24 hour period and a maximum weekly working time of 48 hours.  The proposals will be considered at the Social Affairs Council on 3 December and if adopted will provide an overall framework on working hours and overtime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that even on the quoted figure he gave of 30 per cent of overtime hours translating into full time employment, the 1979 figures would suggest 80,000 extra jobs in the public sector?  Does he not consider that he should give this extra study to see to what extent we can start to realise some of these extra jobs at a time when we are very short of work opportunities for people coming on the labour market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that this is one of a number of matters which is being considered, discussed and explored in the context of the review of <Col N="622" /> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Subcommittees have been set up and it is an issue which will be examined. There is a need to look at every possible avenue to try to deal with the major social problem of unemployment in this country.  I believe there is a readiness on behalf of all sides of industry to sit down to see in what way they can examine these issues afresh without perhaps the arguments for and against which were used in the past, given the scale of the problem.  The Deputy can be assured that these are issues which will be fully explored in the review of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>I welcome the commitment in this area by the Minister this afternoon, given the extent of the unemployment problem.  I would ask him to extend his commitment beyond the overtime element and, perhaps, to examine work sharing, a shorter working week, early retirement, etc.  These are areas we will have to examine to try to generate some jobs.  In the context of overtime can the Minister or his other colleagues look at the embargo in the public sector which mitigates against some of these elements being included?

I do not think it would be wise to go any further than that.  We have achieved much success in this country based on the partnership approach.  That <Col N="623" /> is something to which we must remain committed.  It is only by that process we can achieve prospective gains in employment as a result of these labour market mechanisms, should agreement be forthcoming on all sides.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the provision of child care services for working parents is recognised as a factor influencing the achievement of real equality in the labour market.  The role of the Government in this regard is to stimulate the development of child care services by employers, individually and collectively, including the promotion of child care partnerships between public authorities and employers.  This not only calls for a co-ordinated response on the part of the different Government Departments  <Col N="625" /> involved, but will also necessitate collaboration with employer and community interests.</P>
      <P>This approach is in line with the EC Council Child Care Recommendation which enjoins member states to encourage a combination of interests, including the public authorities, the social partners and voluntary bodies, to co-operate in the interest of developing and making widely available good quality, accessible, and affordable child care arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Government has indicated, in response to the recent NESC Report on Women's Participation in the Labour Market, that they will develop specific policies and mechanisms to improve child care for working parents.  In developing such a policy, the Government will take into account the report of the Working Party on Child Care for Working Parents which was set up to devise specific recommendations for the development of child care partnerships between parents, local employers and community groups.  The working party has taken longer than expected to complete its report.  I understand, however, that it has sought to identify a pragmatic way forward for the development of child care initiatives involving a combination of private and public financing.  This approach would be in line with the policy measures outlined in the EC Council Recommendation on Child Care.  The working party has already provided an input to the deliberations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Task Force on Employment.  I look forward to receiving its final report by the end of this month.  The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women is also expected to make recommendations in relation to the development of child care in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> also provides for the introduction of child care facilities on a progressive basis in the public service with the State providing the physical facilities and the staff paying the running costs.  The recent establishment of a Civil Service creche is a further positive development.  I am glad, too, that a <Col N="626" /> number of public sector bodies provide child care facilities for their staff and that more organisations are planning to take initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of child care facilities for parents interested in training, the setting up of child care facilities in the vicinity of FÁS training centres, and the possibility of providing such facilities in partnership with local industry and local community interests, is being pursued on a pilot basis under the NOW Programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that a commitment was <Col N="627" /> made in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance on 29 January that the necessary arrangements to provide for a scheme of leave and a corresponding benefit scheme for adoptive mothers would be introduced later this year.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Department of Social Welfare are responsible for drafting the legislation to provide for adoptive leave and adoptive benefit, respectively.  As the Deputies will appreciate, the situation in relation to adoption has become more complex in recent years with the changing pattern of adoption, the increase in foreign adoptions and the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1991.  Accordingly, it has been necessary to examine a range of issues very thoroughly in order to ensure that the legislation when introduced is comprehensive and effective.</P>
    <P>My responsibility relates to the provision of adoptive leave.  The necessary legislation is being prepared and it is my intention to introduce it later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister that this issue has been complicated by the increase in foreign adoptions. Adoption is adoption; a child is adopted and the relationship between the adoptive parents and the child has to be developed.  I should like the Minister to explain the delay in introducing the legislation and to say why it is not ready to be introduced in the House now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to answer that question in my initial reply.  Despite the Deputy's assertions to the contrary, she can take it from me, as a legal practitioner, that adoption is a complex issue. I want to ensure in the introduction of maternity leave for adoptive parents that I cover all cases.  The issue of foreign adoptions is a separate one, and different legal considerations apply.  I have sought a report and looked at the matter, and I am satisfied that we are now in a position to proceed.  In line with the commitment given, I will introduce the legislation this year.  I would rather introduce the legislation a little later than expected to <Col N="628" /> ensure it is correct rather than introduce it early and create problems down the line.</P>

      <P>The European Community has shamefully failed its citizens in the continuing currency crisis.  Not only has it failed to protect their interests but by its inertia it has been, in fact, the root cause of the crushing individual and business problems in every part of the Community.  Nowhere is this more evident than in Ireland where homeowners, business people, farmers, employers and employees have become the innocent victims of the Community's isolation, dereliction of responsibility and surrender to ruthless speculators and money dealers.  The disunity and discord at the highest political level contrasts sharply with the proclaimed &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; statements of Maastricht.  The much vaunted &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo; and &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;<Col N="670" /> statements of Maastricht are taking on a new meaning.</P>
      <P>The well-being of the individual is subsidiary &mdash; that is where subsidiary enters in now &mdash; to the greed of the speculator. Cohesion, if it is evident, is evident only in the shared sense of alienation towards Europe, towards the Commission and institutions of the European Community, which is felt throughout by the peoples of Europe at present and is evident in public opinion responses throughout that community.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the ERM and of the EMS which preceded it was to underpin currency stability throughout Europe in the interests of the individual citizens of Europe and to ensure there would be mechanisms for regulating currency fluctuations within the European Community.  This could be achieved only through common action and fiscal discipline on the part of the member states and of the regulating and co-ordinating bodies.</P>
      <P>It is simply not acceptable that Ireland, which has adhered consistently to the disciplines, some of which were painful for our people, should now find itself and its citizens punished and penalised for the failure of others to do the same.  Those countries that failed to act within the disciplines and constraints required by the ERM in reducing their budget deficits, bringing down their inflation rates and adjusting their balance of payments &mdash; now floating outside the ERM system &mdash; have actually gained a sharp competitive advantage in internal European trade over Ireland which has adhered to all of those disciplines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are to be commended on their firm stance and their successful defence of our currency throughout the recent turmoil, which in no way was of their making.  They must also be commended on their package of measures to help industry and the enterprise sector cope with the consequences of the sterling depreciation outside the ERM.  Clearly there is a limit to the unilateral action that can be taken by the Government.  There is a limit to their capacity to alleviate the problems caused <Col N="671" /> by the currency chaos throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Our European partners, if partners we can call them at this point, the Commission in particular, should be reminded of the fact that in December 1978, when we joined the European monetary system &mdash; I attended that European Council meeting myself; Britain choose to stay outside &mdash; we were able to rely on European Community action to help us participate in the system.  Then the Economic and Monetary Committee, through consistent co-ordination and common action, the European Investment Bank, through subsidised loans, the Commission, through the application of the famous Ortoli facility, the ECOFIN Council and General Council of Ministers, through common political action and, above all, the European Council, through solidarity and immediate action, agreed at that time to make available a package of financial measures, in grants and loans, worth more than £225 million to Ireland to enable us participate in the system and cope with the competitive disadvantage which the anticipated depreciation of sterling <i>via-à-vis</i> the EMS would cause for our exporters.  In passing it must be said that that disadvantage never actually accrued as sterling appreciated rather than depreciated against the EMS currencies because of the discovery of North Sea oil.</P>
    <P>If Ireland in 1978 was entitled to financial support and solidarity from the European Community how much more are we entitled to it now because of the critical problem caused us by the lack of control or co-ordination within the ERM and by the lack of effective action by individual member states who have floated outside the system at this point?</P>
    <P>I welcome not only the action of the Government to date but also the Taoiseach's reaffirmation that our policy is and will continue to be the maintenance of a firm exchange rate within the narrow band of the ERM.  Our Government have certainly adhered to a consistent policy since 1987.  I should stress that it was not always easy.  Our people had to accept <Col N="672" /> the consequences of reductions in public expenditure to reduce our budget deficit and bring down inflation.  We did as we were required to do.  The same cannot be said of the European Community and its institutions in recent months.  It is simply unacceptable that those of us who have been constant and consistent, and our citizens, should now be punished for the inability and inconsistency of the European Community and its institutions. The Commission simply must not be allowed to insulate itself in comfortable isolation in the Berlaymont from the crushing problems of the citizens of Ireland and elsewhere.  The Berlaymont can be a very comfortable place, a splendidly isolated place, but they must not be allowed to isolate and insulate themselves from the reality of our homeowners, farmers or small business people and the reality of the impact on our economy of what they have allowed happen through lack of control.  We cannot be expected to shoulder this burden alone.  We can be expected to act in a disciplined fashion.</P>
    <P>In my view the very credibility, the very relevance of the European Community is at stake here.  That is what the people expect from a Community of common purpose.</P>

      <P>There can be no doubt at all that the Irish and other economies of Europe have entered an era of unprecedented challenge.  Though we can wring our hands and say that this challenge has been wrought on us by mindless speculation and a variety of other factors outside our control the reality is that, for whatever reason, we have entered an era of unprecedented challenge.  We have entered a period in which the economic well being of this nation, and indeed of our partner nations in Europe, is under greater threat possibly than at any time since the great depression of the early thirties.  One of the lessons that should have been learned from that earlier <Col N="673" /> depression was the importance of cohesive, coherent, trans-national action.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we, as a nation, as well as being a member of the EC, are at a very important crossroads in terms of our development.  In a sense the economic and financial difficulties we faced in the late eighties pale into relative insignificance in comparison with the problems we now face.  Of course, there is a difference in that the difficulties we faced at that time were long term whereas the current ones are not.  There was another difference, that is that the difficulties we faced at that time were home grown whereas the current ones are not. Because the problems are so great, because the stakes are so high, it is vital that we respond to the current challenges in a calculated and calm manner.  If we lose our heads now we will lose a great deal more.</P>
      <P>Over the past two weeks I have felt a sense of admiration for trade unionists and industrial leaders who, by recognising the gravity of the current position while in no way seeking to devalue the challenge we face, have held a common and sensible line.  There has been a common and sensible thread in statements from a whole range of groups &mdash; the small firms association, the CII, the CIF, major banks, serious economists from all sides &mdash; who have generally reached conclusions that existing policies and Government responses are best; that in spite of some considerable short term pain, we must stick with the ERM and, above all, not consider devaluation.  It would be churlish of me if I did not commend spokespersons of the Opposition parties, particularly Deputy Michael Noonan of the main Opposition party, who from time to time I chide in this House, for also holding what I would regard as a generally sensible and rational approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have to say I have less admiration, indeed something approaching contempt, for some of the glib commentators who, from the side &mdash; motivated either by a sense of mischief, a desire to illustrate just how clever they are with <Col N="674" /> the pen or word processor, or who simply seek self-publicity &mdash; have been touting policies which to my mind border on economic subversion.  Some prime examples of this gross irresponsibility were to be found in the columns of last Sunday's edition of the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> On the front page we had Senator Shane Ross, no longer putting himself forward as an Independent Senator, lashing what he chose to portray as the high cost of Ireland's devotion to the Deutsche Mark.  This Senator scorned the idea that the present solution was short term and he dismissed the idea that a positive trade surplus could have any beneficial impact on the life and livelihood of the averge citizen.  He dismissed, too, an inflation rate of 2.8 per cent as being of importance in the economic debate.  He chose not to mention the positive state of the public finances or the fact that public sector borrowing has been brought under control.  These fundamentals of the good sound economy he chose to dismiss as being of no relevance; at best, they were entitled to his scorn.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that those maverick views are the views of the main Opposition Party.  I would be very shocked if they were.  Those views can only be blamed on the author of the article.  The logical extension of the rubbish in that article and elsewhere in the same newspaper's columns last Sunday is that we should abandon existing policies in favour of re-establishing our link with sterling and ultimately in favour of devaluation.  Nothing could be more wide of the mark or more calculated to damage the interest of every Irish citizen.  The argument put forward by Senator Ross and by a small rump who favour the devaluation route is based on the view that such a course of action would help to counter the loss of competitiveness suffered by our producers who are competing either on the UK market or with British goods on other markets, including the home market.</P>
    <P>To my mind any thoughts of devaluation are not just subversive, they are close to lunatic.  A devaluation, no matter <Col N="675" /> what its superficial attractions, is not a choice for this nation at this time.  The extent of our dependence on trade would mean that higher import prices resulting from devaluation would creep very quickly into domestic cost and price increases.  Those arguing for devaluation also ignore the interesting point that, while the UK accounts for over 30 per cent of our exports, it also accounts for about 40 per cent of our trade imports. Devaluation or a re-link with sterling would have a very immediate impact on the latter, a point ignored by Senator Ross and people who take the same line. If we were to devalue, it would not be long before any beneficial effects &mdash; and they are doubtful &mdash; would be eroded, leaving us with higher prices.</P>
    <P>In this context I would draw attention to developments in the UK which merit some observation.  There has been a significant devaluation of sterling in relation to the dollar, the Deutsche Mark and other currencies continuously since the mid sixties and this does not appear to have done any long term good to the economy of the UK.  Re-linking our economy with the UK and our currency with sterling would be something akin to clambering on board the <i>Titanic.</i> Secondly, the effect of devaluation on domestic and foreign confidence in our ability to manage our affairs would be shattering. Capital would flee from the country, not only causing interest rates to rise but also putting further pressure on Government finances and on our currency.  The result would be a spiral of depreciation.  Facing these prospects, the endurance by us of temporary but necessary increases in interest rates is certainly the lesser of two evils.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that I in any way ignore the extraordinary impact that interest rate rises are having on home owners, small industry, farmers and across the community.  But it is by far the lesser of the evils we face.  No matter how hard the more lunatic commentators try, they cannot dismiss the very real economic achievements of this nation, nor can they deny that we as a nation, because of <Col N="676" /> the hard work that has gone into creating a sane, economic structure, have created thereby an economy which is well prepared to weather these storms.</P>
    <P>Earlier today Deputy John Bruton in his speech made reference to a speech given earlier this week by a leading banker at a meeting of the IMI.  I wish to refer to some elements in that speech. The speech was in line with quite a few that have gone before and quite a few comments that have been made in the press and media.  One of the conclusions of that speech was that high interest rates in Ireland would remain &ldquo;into 1993&rdquo;. This has been widely misinterpreted by sections of the media, particularly the broadcast media, as meaning that high interest rates will exist until the end of 1993.  At best, this is a misinterpretation, but if it were not so it would be wrong headed in the extreme to suggest that we should expect current abnormally high interest rates to exist for any more than a matter of months.</P>
    <P>The second conclusion in the speech in question was that growth would be adversely affected this year and next year.  I would suggest that this is perhaps a dismal conclusion which has been reached before we know all the impacts of the current economic situation.  There is no doubt that what is and has been happening will not in any way help growth, but the reality we should keep in mind is that growth in 1992 and in earlier years has generally been very good.  I look forward, particularly in the early part of 1993, to a return to growth policies.</P>
    <P>The central part of the speech concerned exchange rates and the policies which should be adopted by the Government at this time.  The speaker came to the unequivocal conclusion, as so many other sane speakers and commentators have done, that the present exchange rate policy must and should be adhered to.  In the longer term and in the short term it is the only hope for us as a nation.  The question posed is what should policy makers address and whether we should devalue our currency.  This commentator came to the unequivocal view, which is <Col N="677" /> shared by virtually all commentators and by me, that certainly we should not on this matter give a centimetre.  The first step in getting interest rates down is to maintain existing exchange rate policies.</P>
    <P>The Government will clearly have to address the various pressure points in the economy and the various problems in the economy which will emerge over the next two or three months.  The approach being adopted by the Government is the only sane one, the only one which has anything to recommend it.</P>
    <P>I conclude by supporting some of the comments made by Deputy O'Kennedy. It is a fact that the Commission of the European Community and the institutions of the EC have allowed a gulf to grow between them and the people of Europe.  The people of this nation have undergone a great deal of pain and hardship to bring our economy into line with the better European economies in the past few years.  We have the right to expect full support from our European partners and in particular from the strong economies of Europe.  I believe our future lies within Europe.</P>
    <P>If there has ever been a proof of the eloquent need for more comprehensive development of European cohesion and policies, it has been the events of the past few weeks.  If we had had a central European bank over the last four or five weeks, in which Irish, French, German, Dutch and the other member states could have had a say, the extraordinary unpatriotic behaviour of people who have made hay on the exchange markets would not have been allowed to happen and the economic turmoil which we have undergone would certainly have been less likely to occur.</P>

      <P>I had thought that a debate such as this would have ensured a full House.  I also thought that we would have had a two day debate.  It is stupid, to say the least, that today we adjourn at 5 p.m. when we could have sat until 8 p.m. without keeping anybody out of bed, and yet we will be back here at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow morning.  It does not make sense.</P>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to various contributors, particularly those from the Government side.  I commend the Government without reservation for, in a very difficult time, setting their face against devaluation.  I qualify that by saying that that is fine, provided they take steps to try to help the people worst hit by the amazing change between the value of our currency and that of our nearest neighbour, whatever about other currencies such as the lira and the pesata. Our big problem is with the UK, not only because of the change in the value and the rapid change of up to 20 per cent over two or three weeks, but because of the position in which it has put many of our small and not so small industries.  I commend the Government for providing a substantial sum, which I hope they will apply with alacrity to those who are in trouble on the British market and elsewhere, particularly those who are operating almost exclusively on Irish raw materials where there is no benefit accruing by way of imports at the lower cost of sterling.  Against a background of calamitous unemployment it would be extreme madness for us to visualise anything further in that direction.  Such a scenario would entirely change my mind about the Government's stand on devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary how those who supported the Maastricht agreement and portrayed it as the answer to all our ills are now indicating that it has let them down, that further union in Europe and a common currency and all that goes with it, which some of us opposed for very good reasons, are not likely to be such a <Col N="679" /> great thing now and that they feel very let down by their colleagues in the Community. Without exception the major parties supported Maastricht even though the electorate were not terribly well informed as to what it was about. Before we sign we should make sure that in the months ahead and from 1993 onwards we will not be let down by the things about which we feel let down today, as expressed particularly by Deputy O'Kennedy.  This is our last chance before signing to sort out some of the difficulties which were not foreseen by those who supported Maastricht.  Now is the time to get assurances and insurance from our colleagues against the worst features of Maastricht.  Without those assurances and insurance we should not sign despite the fact that on a 55 per cent poll we had a 70 per cent &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote for the Maastricht agreement, which was presented on the blind and accepted on the blind by the vast majority of our electorate who voted.  Almost half of the electorate stayed at home and that is a fair comment in itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard made an appeal for the mushroom growers centered around Monaghan.  There is no question but that they have been hard hit.  The mushrooms are growing at the moment and we cannot wait until next month to assist mushroom growers.  Without assistance they will be in a very desperate situation on the British market and in some other markets. There is a similar problem with fish products, including farm fish, which will be competing with the Norwegian supported products in Scotland.  Some of the biggest fish farms here are Norwegian as well, and more is the pity, but they are at grave risk.  The fish are maturing and are coming to the market; they cannot wait. Immediate support should be considered.</P>
    <P>Another aspect relates to farmers, particularly sheep farmers.  Deputies referred to the situation in Wicklow and a reduction in ewe premiums and so forth.  It goes far deeper than that.  Sheep and lamb prices have been disastrous all through this season.  The prices are suffering <Col N="680" /> still further.  People are competing in the British market against British production and the French market is being swiped from under our feet, even with the bad prices that obtained three weeks ago.  We just cannot compete at the moment and there are no MCAs which apply to other agricultural produce. There is no support other than these premiums and the premium is cut at the moment by £6 per head, not that that would make up for the loss that has been sustained over recent months.  The double loss that will occur in the weeks ahead should be considered in a special way by the Government and the Department and the Minister responsible for the administration of this aid to producers.</P>
    <P>I would ask those politicians who talk inside and outside of this House not to make a virtue out of necessity.  We are being told that if it were not for our strong economy, starting with 1987, we would have worse problems.  It is rather significant that we should talk about from 1987 onwards.  We should remember how we got into the mess we were in 1987. We should remember the rake's progress from 1972 onwards, the borrowing <i>ad lib</i> and the elections by auction which took place year in and year out when we had elections from 1973 right up to 1987, including 1987.  We got ourselves into the mess.</P>
    <P>Let us not start clapping ourselves on the back for doing a great job since 1987, because the people in Government and in Opposition today, jointly and severally, in the various Governments since 1972 onwards were responsible for £26 billion of debt from which we have never recovered and which we have not repaid or reduced by one penny.  The people who are paying for all of this are the 300,000 unemployed and the 3,000 to 5,000 people who have had to emigrate. Those are the people to whom we charge the bill for putting our economy in a state that left us able to stand up in the present chaotic world of finance and say that we can decide for ourselves, that we will not devalue and make things even worse.  Let the Government not congratulate themselves on having done something wonderful <Col N="681" /> since 1987.  The Government helped to get us into the mess and it is only right that they should not claim any credit for getting us out of it, particularly when it is the unemployed and the emigrants who have had to pay.</P>
    <P>We are all too prone to talk about the unemployed.  Recently £100 million was set aside for job creation and we have received many millions of pounds from the EC for training schemes in FÁS and so forth.  But what are we doing?  We have no houses for our people at the moment and we will not have houses in the future unless we pull up our socks and get our people back to work in the construction industry because when the construction industry is on its knees the country is on its knees.  That scenario has been repeated.  It happened in 1965, when we had a depression, and in 1955, when there was also a depression.  I will not go back any further because there were no ordinary times before that.</P>
    <P>Why can we not devote this £100 million to the construction industry?  Why can we not reinstitute attractive grants for house building?  What is the matter with us at the moment?  Ten years ago, when the depression was showing itself and we began to run down the house construction industry, I said we might even reach the point where our emigrants would come back and there would be jobs for them, but no roof to put over their heads.  I am saying this once again. Over the next year to 18 months the construction industry could absorb, in public and private housing, with grants supplemented by the earnings of our people, anything up to 60,000 of our construction workers who have either emigrated or are on the dole.  Houses would be produced rather than paying dole, which produces nothing and costs a lot to administer and which is, broadly speaking, money down the drain.</P>
    <P>I am very much a believer that one cannot idle one's way out of difficulty. We ought to work our way out of difficulty where we have useful work to do. Who can say that house building is not useful work?  It is essential and will cost us a lot more in the future than it does <Col N="682" /> now.  Private enterprise, encouraged by grants, would put more into the economy than would be taken out by way of grants. Through servicing the 60,000 thus employed, up to a further 1000,000 people could be put to work.  What a change that would make to all of us and to the economy in general.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect which has been neglected over the years since we made the fisheries agreement.  That agreement was daft, to say the least; it was done in ignorance and was not intended to have the disastrous results it is having today.  If we could double our fish quotas, which we would be entitled to since we have 16 per cent of all of the fish stocks in the entire Community, we could employ up to 30,000 people along the west coast processing the fish not required for the fresh market.  I urge the Government again to put the boot in in regard to our fisheries.  We have an unanswerable case.  The fact that we made mistakes is not a good reason for everybody from around the Community and outside to come along and scoop the one resource we have on our doorstep while our fishing industry is not allowed to expand and is in fact contracting.  I will say no more about that as I want to allow my colleague, Deputy Garland, to say a few words.</P>

      <P>My thanks to Deputy Blaney for allowing me in for a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to some points made by the Taoiseach this morning.  He spoke about the economy being sound, about the sustained balance of payments surplus, about the rate of inflation being among the lowest in the world and about a budget deficit which is ever decreasing. I agree that these are all very important objectives.  However, the Taoiseach does not explain why we are running this sustained and large balance of payments surplus. The reason for that was outlined by Deputy Blaney when he talked about the £26 billion that has been borrowed and mis-spent in this country by successive Governments since 1972.  I will not gild the lily by repeating in detail what <Col N="683" /> Deputy Blaney has said.  I totally agree with him.  The fact that we have to run this huge balance of payments surplus is responsible for many of the problems here and that should and must be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Let me also make a passing reference to the Maastricht Treaty, to which the Taoiseach referred.  Again he showed an alarming degree of complacency.  He seems to be totally out of touch with what is happening.  The fact is that the Maastricht Treaty as we know it is dead, and thanks be to goodness for that.  If and when it ever rears its ugly head again it will have to be renegotiated and I hope that we will have the sense to insist on a proper Protocol on neutrality.  The main reason the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty was because they were unhappy about neutrality.  Yet in this country anyone who mentioned neutrality was told it was irrelevant, that it was a red herring.  The Danish people did not think so and the French people who voted only by a very narrow majority in favour of the Maastricht Treaty did not think so. There is a serious problem there and the Government are not facing up to it.  It seems that we will get a second bite of the cherry and I hope that the Government do not let this opportunity slip to do something about that and have Irish neutrality copperfastened in the Treaty if it is to proceed.</P>
    <P>One thing I disagree with Deputy Blaney about is the sheep industry.  It is important that we retain as many people as possible on the land and many people derive their livelihood from sheep.  I would question whether or not the ewe headage payment is the best way to do that.  These payments have resulted in gross overstocking with consequent overgrazing of many areas, perhaps not so much in Donegal but certainly in Mayo and Galway.  I have talked to many sheep farmers who have admitted openly and honestly that they are flogging this thing for all it is worth, that in five or ten years' time huge mountain areas will be totally denuded of vegetation.  We all know what will happen then.  When there are excessive <Col N="684" /> periods of rain the topsoil will be washed away and we will be left with a desert, as has happened in the Himalayan regions.  What we need is a system such as they have in Great Britain where they have headage payments for lambs.  This would be a much more sensible system. Better still, we could have a headage payment for people because it is the people we want to keep there, not the sheep.</P>
    <P>There will be adequate time tomorrow, I hope, to deal with the catastrophic unemployment problem when we are debating the report of the Dáil Committee on Employment.  I will therefore not deal with that today except to say that I regard the Taoiseach's efforts to underplay the employment crisis as being absolutely deplorable; nor has the contribution from the Opposition been in any way constructive in this area.  What is needed is a new approach to the unemployment problem.  If I am given an opportunity to speak tomorrow I will outline Green ideas in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent currency crisis was not of our making.  I think this should be understood clearly by all at the outset.  For several years, the Irish authorities have pursued a consistent line in regard to our exchange rate policy.  Our aim has been, and continues to be, a firm and stable exchange rate within the narrow band of the EMS.  Our capability to sustain this position has been recognised consistently by our Community partners and has been reflected in the increasing interest on the part of foreign investors in Irish Government securities in recent years.  Earlier this year, following a rigorous examination of the Irish economy, the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers unanimously endorsed our position and paid tribute to the good management of the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent turmoil on the markets was caused by a number of complex factors. The speculative pressure built up on a number of currencies, primarily the lira and sterling, because of the persistent belief in the markets that the economic <Col N="685" /> performances of Italy and the United Kingdom could not support their exchange rates.  At the same time, the impact of German unification and the cost of rehabilitation of the economies of central and eastern Europe put enormous strains on European capital markets.  The situation was exacerbated by the decline in the US dollar and the consequent flow of funds into the Deutsche Mark.  Further difficulty was caused by Denmark's narrow &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on the Maastricht Treaty and by uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the impending referendum in France.  All these factors created tension within the European Monetary System which, once triggered, led to speculative attacks on the EMS currencies on a scale unheard of previously. The withdrawal of sterling and the lira from the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS and the devaluation of the peseta created further fears in the market that the EMS might break up, thereby fuelling further speculation against the Irish pound as well as other EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>There is no merit now in speculating on what might have happened if the Community authorities had acted with greater urgency in addressing the problems earlier and more decisively.  The disputes about inappropriate public statements and inactivity are not our concern.  Our priority from the beginning has been to see stability restored as quickly as possible and to stay on course for economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Only massive intervention by the central banks of the member states, utilising also the mutual support provisions of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, prevented the dissolution of the EMS.  By withstanding this extraordinary pressure the mechanism of the EMS has proved itself. All member countries were deeply involved in the defensive process that was without precedent, and the degree of co-operation is a tribute to the progress that has been made towards greater integration of Community currencies.</P>
    <P>At this point, I want to refer briefly to the speculators who appeared for a time to have a free hand in dictating the future <Col N="686" /> of currencies to an extraordinary extent. We had a situation, in fact, where a country's existing and prospective economic performance was dismissed by the markets as totally irrelevant to the value of its currency.</P>
    <P>We were subjected to some criticism because we acted promptly to stop entirely unwarranted speculation against our currency.  We were in the process of &ldquo;being taken-out&rdquo;&mdash; to use market phraseology.  There were no good financial or economic reasons for this, and freedom of markets can never be equated with deliberate and unjustified undermining of a currency for huge and immediate speculative gains.</P>
    <P>Our currency is continuing to experience the pressures arising from sterling's weakness.  Some commentators and market players still appear to doubt our ability to maintain our present parities. This may be due to comments by people who have a vested interest in uncertainty, since trading in currencies thrives on uncertainty and movements.  These people do no service to our country. Abroad, a few commentators who seem ignorant of our economy and policies also cast doubt on our ability to cope with the recent upheaval.</P>
    <P>In the face of the whirlwind on European markets, the options open to us were to stand our ground or to devalue the currency immediately.  There was no middle ground for us or indeed for any other member of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.  Standing our ground involved very difficult decisions that have difficult consequences for many of our people, but it is well to reflect on the consequences if we had chosen the alternative. We would have damaged beyond repair, for a long time ahead, the confidence that we have painstakingly built up over recent years.  Our case for entry into full economic and monetary union on schedule would probably be in ruins. Those who are naturally worried about the temporary steep increase in interest rates should be aware that devaluation would not provide a solution.  I will return to this question of interest rates later.  Of course, we would be rapidly plunged into <Col N="687" /> an inflationary cycle such as that which caused so much damage in the early eighties and our track record in reducing the national debt as a proportion of GNP would be placed at risk.  We have gained respect in the market place for our stand in the face of extremely difficult odds and this will be of great benefit to us in the longer term.</P>
    <P>Our external reserves have been consistently strong for a considerable time and this has helped us to withstand the recent assault.  We have had to cope with large outflows of capital with a consequent loss of reserves.  We continue to have adequate reserves to support our exchange rate and we can also call on the resources available through the EMS for this purpose.  Recent outflows can be attributed to two main factors &mdash; forward purchases of sterling and disinvestment from Government securities by outside investors.  I should add it has not been one way traffic and there have been significant inflows.</P>
    <P>To help replace the reserves lost through outflows from Government securities, the National Treasury Management Agency have been raising funds externally at very competitive rates.  This is a sensible approach and it is the approach that is being followed by other countries experiencing similar market pressures.  This borrowing will not add to the national debt.  It is a substitution for borrowing in Irish pounds, not additional borrowing.  The money borrowed abroad will fund the Government's deficit.  This deficit is determined by the gap between Government expenditure and Government revenue.  It is not affected by the substitution of foreign currency debt for Irish pound debt.</P>
    <P>The feeling that our economic achievements from 1987 onwards are in some way illusory has been a feature of the recent events.  This is untrue.  For a number of years after we joined the EMS in 1979 we did indeed lose competitiveness. In the period 1979 to 1986, measured in terms of changes in relative hourly earnings in common currency, our costs rose 23.5 per cent faster than in the <Col N="688" /> EMS narrow-band group of countries, 13.5 per cent faster than those of our main trading partners and 6 per cent above UK levels.  Meanwhile, the Irish pound fell in value against the Deutsche Mark, sterling, the dollar and the yen, and our effective exchange rate fell by over 13.5 per cent.  This was a period characterised by high inflation, falling employment and low growth &mdash; with declining output in some years.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 however, our commitment to &ldquo;sound money&rdquo; has borne fruit.  A firm exchange rate policy, backed by appropriate restraint in the public finances and in wage and other cost developments, has lowered perceptions of risk &mdash; and interest rates &mdash; and underpinned substantial growth in investment, employment and living standards.  Non-agricultural jobs increased by some 54,000 between 1986 and 1991.  In the period 1987 to 1991 competitiveness, measured in relative hourly earnings in common currency, showed substantial gains against our trading partners.  Of particular note is the fact that we gained over 15 per cent against the UK.</P>
    <P>Thus the reality is that the Irish economy has prospered and gained competitive advantage over the UK and other economies.  This should be a source of pride to us.  These gains should not be thrown away for the sake of some short term relief.</P>
    <P>In other areas, too, we have made substantial progress.  Our Exchequer borrowing requirement which stood at almost 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 has now been reduced to well under 2.5 per cent.  Recent Exchequer returns indicate that the EBR target for 1992 will be achieved.  Against a difficult economic background, this is a tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>Inflation has declined from almost 4 per cent in 1986 to a current level of 2.8 per cent.  Indeed, our trade balance shows a healthy surplus this year and is projected to be 10.5 per cent of GNP. This compares to a trade surplus of 4.5 per cent of GNP in 1986.</P>
    <P>I might add that this improved performance has continued in the face of <Col N="689" /> the prevailing slowdown in international economic activity.  The House will recall that economic developments and prospects for the year were set out recently in my Department's Economic Review and Outlook 1992 published in August, suggesting GDP growth for this year of about 2.5 per cent.  This forecast was not by any means over-optimistic.  In fact, it compared with GDP growth forecasts of 3.5 per cent and even 4 per cent published by the Central Bank and the ESRI respectively in September.  Economic growth in Ireland this year will be well ahead of the EC Commission's forecast of 1.75 per cent GDP growth in the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>As I predicted at budget time, we are seeing a modest recovery in domestic demand which is growing broadly in line with the rise in real disposable incomes. Retail sales so far this year are up by about 3 per cent in volume over the corresponding period of 1991.  Notwithstanding continued weakness on Ireland's external markets, the volume of merchandise exports in the first seven months was up by an estimated 12 per cent year-on-year; we expect growth for the year as a whole of at least 10 per cent. Employment appears generally to be holding its own.  The Economic Review and Outlook projected growth in total employment of about 2,000 compared with last year.  Up to the end of September, receipts from the training and employment levy show a rise of 7.5 per cent year-on-year which, taking account of incomes developments, is an encouraging pointer on this.  Unfortunately, however, despite employment growth, the continuing international down-turn has seen registered unemployment rising significantly this year.</P>
    <P>I want to return now to interest rates. Let me say at the outset that devaluation does not guarantee lower interest rates even in the short term.  We need only look back to 1986 to get a clear example of that.  Reductions in interest rates following the 1986 devaluation were very short-lived indeed.  Ireland devalued by 8 per cent in August 1986 and by October of same year, just two months later, <Col N="690" /> building societies announced that mortgage rates would have to be increased by 3 percentage points.  At the same time other retail borrowers had their interest rates increased by between 2 and 4½ percentage points.  The background to the market pressure in 1986 was very similar to the present situation, at least to the extent that the immediate cause of the market turbulence in 1986 was also a weakening sterling exchange rate and a weak US dollar.</P>
    <P>Devaluation did not help the gilt market in 1986 any more than it helped the retail borrower.  This was despite the fact that we were far less reliant on nonresident gilt holders at that stage.  For example, at end-June 1986, non-residents held around £1.1 billion of Irish gilts whereas at end-June this year the figure was about £4.1 billion.  In 1986, a higher proportion of the non-residents would have been matching liabilities in Irish pounds and in any event they only accounted for around 10 per cent of the market compared to about 30 per cent at end June last.  Therefore, in 1986 the Irish gilt market was much more a domestic matter than it is now.  Moreover, in 1986, with tight restrictions on capital movements in place, most domestic investors had far fewer investment options than they do now.  Despite all this, the August 1986 devaluation of the Irish pound was followed by sharply higher gilt yields; medium and long term gilt yields increased from about 9 per cent in the first half of 1986 to over 13½ per cent during October 1986.</P>
    <P>A firm exchange rate policy within the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism is the only policy that will ensure that, when the present temporary period of market turbulence comes to an end, we can move back to interest rates close to those of Germany.  It is the only policy that will leave us in a position to profit fully from any reductions in German interest rates.  The alternative policy will leave us with a large premium over German interest rates for many years to come.  I believe that premium could be of the order of 3 percentage points over what rates will be under our <Col N="691" /> existing exchange rate policy.  One clear reason for this is the adverse impact a devaluation would have on our non-resident gilt holders and other foreign investors. Clearly, as far as interest rates and gilt yields are concerned, devaluation would be very bad news indeed.</P>
    <P>For an example of the ongoing cost of higher interest rates we have to look no further than the mortgage rate.  I am well aware of the difficulties created by higher mortgage rates; that is one of the reasons I am determined to maintain our existing exchange rate policy.  It is the only way we can secure and sustain lower interest rates.  A 3 percentage point premium from a devaluation would cost mortgage holders dearly over the life of their mortgages.  A person on a £30,000 mortgage would end up paying £63 per month more than what they might expect to pay under our existing exchange rate policy.  Devaluation would maintain this additional burden for years to come.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer itself, and through it the taxpayer, would also lose heavily if the Irish pound were to be devalued.  At present the Exchequer has about £8,900 million of foreign currency debt and a devaluation of the Irish pound would immediately increase this by about £89 million for each 1 per cent of devaluation.</P>
    <P>If I am correct in believing that devaluation would have interest rates 3 percentage points higher over an extended period, then the cost of servicing the total national debt, and therefore taxation levels, would be up to £150 million higher each year than they would otherwise be. On the other hand, our existing exchange rate policy allows the National Treasury Management Agency avoid the excessively high cost of borrowing Irish pounds just now.  The confidence we have in our exchange rate allows it to borrow instead in foreign currencies, with lower interest rates.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not the only EMS country which has experienced high interest rates due to speculation against its currency in recent weeks.  The outflow of funds associated with this speculation has led to considerable increases in short term <Col N="692" /> money market rates in France and Denmark, two countries which have strong economic fundamentals.  In our case, the key one month Irish interbank interest rate which was at around 10½ per cent on Friday 11 September was quoted at well over 20 per cent at times during the following couple of weeks.  The Irish gilt market has also suffered as a result of the recent disruption.  For example, yields on Irish ten year bonds have risen by about one percentage point since 11 September, and yields rose even more on shorter dated stocks.</P>
    <P>Against that background the increase of 3 percentage points in the Central Bank's key short term facility interest rate, on 28 September, was a moderate reponse to the turbulence on the domestic money market and should be seen as a necessary short term measure to help restore order to the market.  Similar action was taken by the French when they raised a key intrest rate by 2½ percentage points in the previous week, in their absolute determination to defend the value of their currency.  I would now like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to those financial institutions, who took whatever steps were open to them, to limit the increases in interest rates for small business and who made arrangements to minimise the impact of the current turmoil on mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>The increases in official and retail interest rates were delayed as long as possible but they were the inevitable consequence of the disruption in the wholesale markets.  I expect that these increases will be temporary.  Last week, there were rumours to the effect that our retail rates would go still higher.  There was no basis for these rumours.  Already, wholesale interest rates are well below their peak. I cannot say when rates will come down, but I am confident that, in a few months at most, retail rates can fall again to previous levels.  The factors that will determine this will be the restoration of stability in the EMS and of normal currency flows.  The prospects are also improving &mdash; the German authorities will soon be in a position to further reduce <Col N="693" /> their interest rates and this will help ease pressure throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>Internationally, much work needs to be done to analyse the crisis and see what lessons can be learned from it.  Unlike other crises in the past, the ability of the markets to transfer vast sums of money between countries was a particularly significant feature of the recent disruption of the EMS.  This era of full freedom of capital movements is a new factor in assessing how markets operate in times of crisis.  It is noteworthy that this is a matter which is exercising concern in many countries and that, lately, the US Treasury secretary proposed that a study of the impact of capital flows on the global economy should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In our own case, the existence of certain controls, which still remain prior to full liberalisation at the end of this year, was of help in stemming the initial bout of speculation.  There was a lot of uninformed and damaging media comment about our use of these restrictions &mdash; that we had re-introduced the controls, that this action was in contravention of Community law, and other such comments.  I would like to emphasise, in the strongest possible terms, that these were restrictions which we already had in place and which, under Community legislation, we are entitled to retain up to the end of this year.  We thus did nothing that was exceptional or that was contrary either to the spirit or letter of our international obligations.</P>
    <P>However, capital controls cannot be, of themselves, an answer to the problem. The Community is committed to ending restrictions on capital movements to enable the Single Market operate efficiently.  Indeed, this is enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.  On our part we have been liberalising capital movements since 1988 on a phased basis and are committed to their abolition within the rules prescribed by the European Community.</P>
    <P>A return to exchange control regulation is not the answer to supporting a currency.  The best backing a currency can have is a sound economy.  This is what all parties have striven to achieve. <Col N="694" /> We have, since 1987, made enormous progress in putting the economy on the right path.  It would be disastrous now to attempt to change this policy because of short term difficulties faced by sterling in particular.  We are no longer attached to sterling.  Our future remains in the narrow band of the EMS whose members now constitute the biggest export market for our goods.  To follow sterling down would not only be a reversal of policy, but it would also mean attaching ourselves to a floating currency.  This would only add to instability for our traders and businesses.</P>
    <P>Our goal remains the achievement of economic and monetary union within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty and in accordance with the schedule laid down in it.  There has been much comment about a fast-track approach to European Monetary Union.  Finance Ministers have re-affirmed last week that there should be no two speed Europe. This reality has been emphasised repeatedly in recent days by the highest authorities and I expect that the Heads of State and Government will confirm this position at next week's meeting in Birmingham. There can be no doubt about our ability to fulfil the criteria for European Monetary Union.  Based on our inflation rate, our strong balance of payments position, our control of the budget deficit at a low level and our declining debt/GNP ratio, we already are one of those countries which can be considered to be ready for the final stage.  This is not just my viewpoint &mdash; it is a reality that has been endorsed by several spokespersons from other member states of the Community and by the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers.</P>
    <P>The immediate period ahead will be difficult for all members of the Community. We are in a period when rumour feeds upon rumour and it is in all our interests that the clear Community position should be spelt out without delay. Do not underestimate the will and determination of Community members to go forward together and to restore stability to a currency system that has served us well up to now.  The disruption of recent <Col N="695" /> weeks surely underlines the value of a single currency managed by a European Central Bank, as provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.  I believe that when the dust has settled this experience will actually strengthen the commitment to full economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I accept, however, that all this offers little consolation to those businesses, and their workers, whose jobs are largely dependent on exports to the UK or are open to serious threat from UK-sourced imports.  As announced on Tuesday last, the Government decided to establish a market development fund of £50 million for the period up to the end of March 1993 to assist firms which have been seriously affected by the recent turmoil in exchange rates.</P>
    <P>The Government took their decision after their consideration of the report of the inter-departmental working group established last week to look at the nature and extent of the problem and to make recommendations.  The working group had indicated that many manufacturing firms could not only be faced with serious problems in maintaining positive margins on sales in the UK market but also in those parts of the domestic market and certain major overseas markets which are subject to strong price competition from UK firms.  The Government recognise that such a situation could pose a threat to many jobs unless the firms concerned take immediate action to improve their competitiveness in existing markets and to actively pursue opportunities in alternative markets.</P>
    <P>As announced, the establishment and management of the fund will be supervised and directed by the management board, which will comprise the managing directors and chief executives of An Bord Tráchtála, FÁS and IDA, together with representatives from the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour and the Marine, and representatives from the industry and employer bodies and ICTU.  The fund will be administered by a special team drawn from the relevant State agencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> The assistance is being targeted at firms which face temporary difficulty in maintaining employment and in adjusting to the recent changes in the market place arising from the depreciation of sterling. Operational criteria for support under the fund will be worked out in the next few days.  The Government envisage that the scheme, which will be monitored regularly, will continue for about six months.  There will be a formal review at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view, however, it is crucial that the fall in sterling which will reduce the prices of many imports will be reflected in domestic prices.  There should be no question of businesses which have their costs reduced in this way taking windfall increases in profits. Instead it is vital that they fully pass on lower import prices so that they feed through into lower inflation and lower costs.</P>
    <P>I spent a number of hours listening to this debate and I may not have picked up all the questions, but I will do my best. Deputy Barry referred to the market development fund.  Application forms and guidelines will be available later tomorrow from the headquarters of the fund, An Bord Tráchtála, and in the regional offices of the IDA and SFADCo from next Monday morning.  Since the Government decision was taken on Tuesday afternoon this is a wholly satisfactory response and indicates the speed and urgency with which we attended to the matter.  In drawing up the guidelines the agencies are in close touch with the needs of the firms most affected and they will therefore reflect and respond to those needs.  There will also be need to maintain normal accountability for the considerable amount of public money being made available, but I am confident that this will not impose any great difficulties for firms who apply for support under the fund.</P>
    <P>We cannot implement Deputy John Bruton's proposal that we should underwrite the exchange rate risk for foreign investors in Irish Government bonds.  I have said this on a number of occasions outside the House.  All holders of Irish <Col N="697" /> Government stock are entitled to expect the same terms and such a proposal would be the equivalent, from the point of view of the State, of borrowing in Deutsche Marks at the higher pound interest rates, which does not make sense from a financial point of view.  Our excellent credit rating means that we can borrow Deutsche Marks without difficulty at Deutsche Mark interest rates and there is therefore no reason for paying Irish £ rates for what could effectively be the Deutsche Mark debt.  I have said this five or six times outside the House, but I wanted to make it clear in the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring and Deputy John Bruton suggested that by engaging in foreign currency borrowing at an earlier time we might have helped to defuse the currency crisis as it affected us.  I have answered this question outside the House, but I will repeat it here.  It must be remembered that the scale of the currency crisis in the middle of the month affected European currencies; it was unprecedented and if we had borrowed in the early days it would have been interpreted by the markets as a panic response.  We correctly avoided doing that, because a too quick recourse to foreign borrowing in the days following the events of 16 and 17 September would have promoted unwarranted fears regarding the strength of external reserves and given rise to even greater speculation.  It would have been a wrong thing to do. We had to wait until there was stability in the marketplace to move, which we did at the first opportunity last week.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton spoke at length about the special savings accounts.  I will not go into all the arguments in relation to them because I do not have time.  He seemed to think that these accounts are now in operation but they do not start until the final exchange controls are lifted.  As I said several times in the House over the last six months, at that stage I will have addressed the issue of special investment accounts in the Finance (No. 2) Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton also referred to the question of EC funding for the activities <Col N="698" /> of the new county enterprise partnership boards.  On 25 September the EC Commission announced an allocation of 10 million ECUs, £7.4 million, by way of a global grant from EC Structural Funds for local development in Ireland for 1992-93.  This new allocation is geared towards assisting enterprise creation and development training and education, operational costs and technical assistance. Deputy John Bruton's point was that we had not applied; however, the money has already been granted.  Some examples of the types of activities covered by the allocations are: assistance for small enterprises, provision of training and enterprise skills, improving job prospects for the unemployed, helping to build local organisations to enable them to participate in development programmes and assisting local groups with feasibility activities.</P>

      <P>A number of suggestions were made today regarding mortgage interest relief.  It has been suggested that full mortgage interest relief should be restored and that the ceiling should be raised to £5,000.  The first point which should be made in response to this proposal is that mortgage interest relief currently costs the Exchequer £184 million per year in terms of tax foregone. This is a huge cost and any proposal whereby the Government would add to this cost would not be in the national interest.  The Revenue Commissioners have also advised that the restoration of the relief to 90 per cent of the current £4,000 ceiling would cost £25 million in the tax year and that restoration to 100 per cent of the current ceiling would cost £50 million.  Some of the proposals made today would be very costly.  For example, Deputy Spring's proposal would cost £70 million in the current tax year.</P>
      <P>While the events that have given rise to the recent increases are outside our control, the pursuit of a consistent budgetary policy by the Government is crucial to investor confidence.  If concessions of the magnitude referred to were conceded they would have to be funded by increased taxation generally, by expenditure cuts or by increased borrowing which would not help the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent events in foreign exchange markets have been dramatic.  As a whole, our currency system has, like others, been affected.  Indeed, our whole currency system was shaken to its foundations. We responded immediately and <Col N="700" /> decisively to protect our currency.  We promptly introduced a range of measures to help businesses put in great difficulty by the sharp decline in the value of sterling. I pay tribute to all who have been involved in our co-ordinated effort, which has been a truly national effort.  I am encouraged by the support and advice that has come from so many sources and by the actions that people have taken on their own inititative.  I am particularly encouraged by the responses that have come from so many business people who have experienced severe short term problems as a result of a situation that was entirely outside of all our control.  We have shown a new maturity in trying to handle the problems and will continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important subject.  I also thank the Minister for Health for attending to hear me.</P>
      <P>On 5 May this year I raised with the Minister for Health in the House the completely unsatisfactory state of affairs in relation to the ambulance service provided for Tipperary town and district. The Minister, I believe, answered my questions that day in good faith but he was unable to be of much assistance to me because the South Eastern Health Board had made no submission to the National Ambulance Review Group.  In addition, the health board did not, apparently, have sufficient data to supply to the Minister which would enable an assessment to be made of the needs of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that to this day the Minister has not been supplied with the information he promised me in May.  For want of that information, it has not been possible to achieve success in making the necessary and vital case to the health board or to the National Ambulance Review Group.  I have been accused in <Col N="701" /> my own area &mdash; for political reasons, of course &mdash; of failing in my duty because I did not have that information.  Although the health board and the review group have received deputations from Tipperary Urban District Council on the subject, no progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I am aware of hundreds of complaints about the quality of the ambulance service, which has deteriorated rapidly since St. Vincent's District Hospital was closed by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987.  I am absolutely certain that if the Minister had all the facts at his disposal he could not fail to be well disposed towards a substantial upgrading of the ambulance service.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I take this opportunity to urge the Minister to press the South Eastern Health Board for a full submission of all the relevant data on the subject.  All I ask the Minister to do tonight is to agree with me that the needs of Tipperary town, and west Tipperary in particular, in relation to this crucial service will be considered with an open mind when the information comes to hand.</P>
    <P>I must stress that the partial picture of the current service being provided by the health board is not enough.  Since May the health board have been asked, in many communications from me, and, I am sure, from the Minister, to assemble data on a week to week basis on the number of ambulance calls and on the average length of response to the calls, including a detailed account of any and all delays.  I am satisfied from my knowledge that when the information is gathered and made available to the Minister &mdash; and to me &mdash; he will recognise clearly that there is a very strong case being made.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a man who is well prepared to listen to reason and when he is in possession of the facts I have requested I believe he will be prepared to invite fresh submissions on this subject matter.  I ask the Minister to ensure that when the information is available to me I will be permitted, on behalf of my electorate, to make the submission directly to the National Ambulance Review Group. That group have met the urban council <Col N="702" /> and they did not have the information.  I request to have an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister before decisions are arrived at following the recommendations of the review group.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  I regret I have had to repeat my request on the floor of the House on such an important matter.  On this occasion I hope the Minister will not spare the health board but will make them answer the relevant questions.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Ferris for raising this matter on the adjournment today and I welcome this opportunity to explain the current position in relation to the provision of ambulance services in Tipperary town and the west Tipperary area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arrangements for the provision of ambulance services in the South-Eastern Health Board region are a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  In 1987 a decision was taken by the board to close St. Vincent's District Hospital, Tipperary town and, in conjunction, to close the ambulance station attached thereto.  Ambulance services are now provided by ambulances based at Cashel and Clonmel.</P>
      <P>In September 1991 my Department, together with the health boards, undertook a major review of ambulance services nationally.  As part of this process, advertisements were placed in the national press inviting submissions from interested parties.  I understand that the South-Eastern Health Board have not formally made a submission to the Ambulance Review Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A written submission, dated 25 May 1992, was received from Tipperary Urban District Council in relation to the ambulance service in the west Tipperary area.  The council requested that they be given an opportunity to make an oral presentation on this matter and they were invited to meet the steering group of the Ambulance Review Body on 31 August 1992.  Four members of the urban district council and the town clerk attended this <Col N="703" /> meeting and they briefed the steering group on their concerns regarding the local ambulance service.  The members of the steering group also sought additional information and clarification where required and they will now give consideration to these issues during the course of their deliberations.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Deputy, in one of his parliamentary questions on 5 May 1992, sought information on the number of ambulance calls per week in the west Tipperary area between January 1987 and December 1991.  At the time, I replied that, as this was a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board and as the detailed information was not readily available, I would communicate again with the Deputy as soon as the information was provided by the board.  I very much regret to inform Deputy Ferris that, while some limited information has been provided by the board, I am still awaiting the detailed information from the board, despite numerous requests from my Department.  I am very unhappy about this situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to apologise to the Deputy for the undue delay and I wish to assure him that I have instructed my officials to pursue this matter vigorously and immediately with the board.  I will keep in contact with the Deputy on this matter. When the figures become available I shall arrange for the Deputy to make his submission to the National Ambulance Review Group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter applies to the sale of calves more than to other cattle.  Even if my original question was not clear, I hope the Minister will be able to reply to me this evening.  On 20 August 1992 the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced a number of concessions under the cattle headage and beef premium schemes.  On the occasion <Col N="704" /> of the Connemara pony show in Clifden the Minister said, in regard to the cattle headage scheme in severely handicapped areas, that his Department would accept dockets from official mart or licensed meat export premises for cattle other than cows sold on after Monday, 24 August for payment purposes under the scheme.  This concession applied only to cattle other than cows listed on application forms submitted under the cattle headage scheme in severely handicapped areas.  He advised that farmers should hold their dockets until inspection or until requested by their local office of his Department to forward them for examination.</P>
      <P>In regard to the special beef premium scheme, the Minister said he has arranged for its administration to be simplified considerably in 1992 in order to streamline and speed up checking procedures and ensure that all farmers who applied in June and July this year can be paid any premium due to them before the end of 1992.  That was most welcome.</P>
      <P>The anomaly that has occurred is that farmers in disadvantaged areas who have suckler herds are not allowed to sell their calves at present.  In a herd of, say, 20 suckler cows a farmer will have to hold on to his 20 calves until he has an inspection or until a date is given as to when he can dispose of them.  That is a source of major hardship to farmers in disadvantaged areas.  It is particularly so in my own county, where I have first hand information of it.  As the House will be aware, there are over 3,000 farmers on 230,000 acres of disadvantaged land in Kerry.  I call on the Minister to allow those farmers sell their calves and qualify for premia payments on presentation of a receipt from a mart or factory.  That is a reasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that farmers throughout the disadvantaged areas have suffered considerably from the bad weather experienced this summer.  Some of them are overstocked and will have to use their winter fodder earlier than usual.  It is a source of hardship to a hard pressed community.  If the Minister can see his <Col N="705" /> way to grant that concession it would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>Receipt of documents for cattles sales, both in disadvantaged and severely handicapped areas, does not apply to farmers who sell cattle to jobbers who call to the various farm yards and also to vets.  A legitimate receipt from either a jobber or a vet should also be accepted for payment.  I would appreciate if the Minister could apply himself to the calf problem in his reply.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for tabling the question.  I note he has clarified his intention in relation to calves, which was not clearly defined in the Deputy's question. Therefore, there is not much point in my reading out a fairly lengthy reply which relates only to beef cows and suckler cows and so forth.</P>
      <P>The case made by the Deputy is reasonable.  I am prepared to look at it and, if necessary, to review the procedures within the Department whereby we would be in a position to pay grants on calves.  We in the Department are anxious to streamline the system as best we can by allowing farmers who qualify for these grants to receive them as quickly and as simply as possible without too much bureaucracy.  I would hope that what we have done by way of streamlining the procedure for 1992-93 will lead to quicker payment of grants and also eliminate some of the difficulties which farmers have experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan made a reasonable case.  I have had similar experiences, although we do not have the more severely disadvantaged areas in the constituency I represent.  To the extent that he has made a case in relation to calves I am prepared to go back to the Department and examine the points he has made and if possible we will endeavour to facilitate him and the farmers.  I suppose I do not have to apologise, but I was prepared to answer a different kind of question.  I hope what I have said now will be an indication that I am prepared to look <Col N="706" /> seriously at the points the Deputy has raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is satisfactory and agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir.  Briefly, the situation is the following: the majority of fire officers employed by local authorities in this country are part-time; they are not full-time employees.  Some are on call 52 weeks a year, while others are on call 26 weeks a year.  There is a wide variety of situations.  Many are people who are otherwise unemployed. For those who are employed otherwise there is a difficulty for employers in that the employee is liable to be called out without notice &mdash; that is in the nature of the emergency service they provide.  That kind of situation creates a difficulty for those who are unemployed and who are seeking work, because very few employers &mdash; and it is understandable &mdash; will voluntarily take on a potential employee who may have to drop tools at short notice and leave.  For those who are otherwise unemployed there is a great difficulty in finding permanent employment. The people in question need to be contactable and they need to be mobile. When an emergency arises they have to be contacted quickly and they have to be able to get to their fire station quickly. For the majority of them that means they must have a telephone and a car.  A great many people who are unemployed do not have those things but these people have to provide those facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to recently those who were unemployed received the appropriate level of <Col N="707" /> unemployment assistance and, in addition, were paid on a fee per call-out basis by the fire service.  That income was not taken into account when deciding their eligibility for unemployment assistance. That situation has changed as that income will now be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>These part-time firemen now face the prospect of losing a certain payment in terms of unemployment assistance in return for maintaining their access to an unpredictable level of payment as firemen, because it depends totally on how long they are on call and how many calls they get.  That, Sir, will probably induce a great number of those people to leave the fire service.  The experience they have will be lost to the fire service, and the public service provided by them will deteriorate.  That is not good enough.  We need a better solution than this simple straightforward axing job to deal with that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for sharing his time with me and I thank you, Sir, for allowing this matter, about which I wrote to you last week, to be debated. Everything Deputy Dukes has said is correct. In County Wexford 60 per cent &mdash; six out of ten &mdash; of firemen are in this situation.  They are on unemployment assistance and they are on call.  The amount they are paid for being on call is 6p per hour &mdash; prisoners are paid more for work they do in prisons.  If they are called out to a chimney fire under these regulations they will receive £13.68 but they will lose a day's dole.  That is the rule.  A married man with three children could lose £25 per day.  These people risk life and limb in the interests of the community.  As the local authority cannot afford to pay them on a permanent basis there is no full-time service.  They are only needed on a part-time basis, especially in smaller villages, such as Bunclody in my constituency.  These people are paid quarterly.  It could happen, therefore, that for some weeks they would have no money to meet their mortgage repayments and family commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare system has, in <Col N="708" /> effect, subsidised local fire authorities who have not paid the full cost of having people available on a 24-hour, seven day a week basis.  I believe that is good value for money in the totality of things.  We do not want any industrial relations difficulties, and local authorities cannot afford to pay more.  Some small modification is required.  This wholesale butchering of their unemployment payment assistance is unfair and will cause havoc. The State has invested a lot of money in training these people but many of them will throw in their job because it does not pay them.  It is nonsensical.  I ask the Minister to take heed of what Deputy Dukes and I have said and defer the implementation of this measure.  He should reconsider it fully and sit down with SIPTU and other representatives and thrash out a fairer system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to apologise for the inability of the Minister for Social Welfare to be present.  I will try to explain the position in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>The unemployment assistance scheme was designed for and continues to provide support for those workers who are either not entitled to or have claimed their full entitlement to unemployment benefit.  It is totally State-funded out of taxpayers' moneys.  The central basis of the scheme is that applicants have to be unemployed, actively seeking work and, pertinent in the context of this motion, unable to support themselves from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The inclusion in the 1992 Social Welfare Act of a provision allowing the assessment of insurable income was undertaken to ensure that the above principles were upheld.  The provision is not aimed specifically at firemen but will affect a wide variety of persons who are working on a part-time or casual basis and claiming assistance for the days they are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are perhaps two specific reasons why a change in legislation was necessary; first, to ensure equity of treatment as between employees and self-employed persons claiming unemployment assistance who have always had their earnings <Col N="709" /> assessed as means and, second, in recognition of the extension of insurance cover to all employees earnings over £25 per week with resulting wider entitlement to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Self-employed persons claiming unemployment assistance have always been assessed with all of their self-employed earnings.  This contrasted sharply with persons working in insurable employment who heretofore were not assessed with any means from part-time or casual employment.  They could work for a few days in a week and qualify for unemployment assistance for the remaining days, regardless of their earnings for the days worked.  Accordingly, an unjustifiable inequity has developed <i>vis-à-vis</i> self-employed claimants.</P>
    <P>I should like to inform Deputies of the level of earnings received by part-time firemen as much is being made of the hardship that the new measure will cause. Evidence available indicates that in the 1990-91 tax year part-time firemen received on average, earnings of almost £90 per week without any reduction in their entitlement to assistance.  Indeed, many cases greatly exceeded this average. The firemen attached to one particular station had earnings of over £300 per week, on average, in addition to their assistance payments of £100 per week. Self-employed persons with the above level of earnings would have no entitlement whatsoever to assistance.  Clearly the continuance of this situation is indefensible.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made on many occasions by Deputies of all parties to the disparity I have just outlined.  The purpose of the change from July is to ensure that we have a consistent approach in this matter.</P>
    <P>The preferential treatment previously accorded the claimants with income from insurable employment has its origins in the establishment of the unemployment assistance scheme.  The legislation establishing that scheme provided that persons could have their means assessed while still employed so as to avoid any delay in authorising claims when they suffered a loss of work.  By excluding income from current employment, the assessment reflected the situation that would exist <Col N="710" /> when they became unemployed.  At the time, that was a very necessary provision in circumstances where entitlement to unemployment benefit was very restrictive.</P>
    <P>However, this is no longer the case. The scope of unemployment benefit has been greatly expanded since the assistance scheme was introduced in 1933, most recently with the extension of insurance cover to those earning over £25 per week and who will become entitled to the various benefits from the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>The commitment shown by part-time firemen in providing a local fire fighting service is well known.  The Minister yesterday acknowledged the special circumstances in which they operate and he has indicated that he is willing to review the current assessment procedure in a sympathetic manner while having regard to the necessity to ensure equity <i>vis-á-vis</i> other persons affected by this measure.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the announcement last week by the Minister for the Marine that the Celtic Sea fishery for herring is now open and that a quota of 10,000 tonnes of herring may be taken from that fishery.  I raise the matter in the House because of what happened in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sectors in the Celtic Sea fishery, the western sector and the eastern sector.  During October and November approximately &mdash; one cannot definitely predict when and how the shoals will move &mdash; the western sector is fished and during December, January and possibly February, the eastern sector is fished.  In 1990 the fishery was not properly managed by the then Minister and his Department.  As a result, all of the 10,000 tonnes of herring were fished in the western sector and no fishing was allowed in the eastern sector during December, January and February.  As a result, the Dunmore East fishery, which <Col N="711" /> basically is the eastern sector, received no quota whatsoever and there was a loss of several million pounds to the economy in the Dunmore East region.  This did not involve just fishermen but also several hundred shore workers and the local business community.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware that what happened in 1990 could happen in 1992.  I am asking the Minister to divide equally the quota between the western sector and the eastern sector so that 5,000 tonnes of herring are fished in each sector.  This was done in 1991 as a result of our protestations in this House following the calamity of 1990.  I should like the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, the situation which could arise again and to ensure that the catch in the western sector is carefully monitored so that no more than 5,000 tonnes is fished and that the other 5,000 tonnes is reserved for the eastern sector.</P>

      <P>I hope that the reply I have will be of some help in addressing the important matter Deputy Deasy has raised here this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Celtic Sea fishery opened on Sunday, 4 October last.  There are almost 10,000 tonnes of herring remaining to be caught between now and the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Minister's priority in drawing up a management plan is to ensure that available quota is spread as uniformly as possible throughout the herring spawning season while at the same time, maximising employment potential and economic return to the fishing and processing sectors alike.</P>

    <P>The Minister is acutely aware of the <Col N="712" /> importance of this extremely valuable fishery to the 600 fisherman and 1,000 people employed in processing the fruits of their efforts.  For that reason, and because of the importance of protecting the wellbeing of our future herring stocks, it is vital that maximum protection be given to spawning fish.  The fishery, which is essentially a roe fishery at present, may be divided into two distinct parts from a spawning viewpoint. First, the western part, which stretches from Dingle to Cork harbour, is an autumn fishery where usually roe is suitable for commercial exploitation from October to December.  The eastern part from Cork Harbour to Dunmore East is a winter/spring fishery, with roe normally being at its peak in commercial terms from December into the early New Year periods.</P>
    <P>The quota is divided between the winter/spring fishery and the autumn fishery to ensure that spawning stock are afforded the best possible protection and to guarantee that an equitable portion of the quota is caught by fishermen in each part of the fishery.</P>
    <P>This year already there is evidence of some herring in the eastern sector.  The port of Dunmore East has been opened to allow fishermen and processors to take advantage of this early boon.  The industry has been assured that for the remainder of the season, either Cobh or Dunmore East will remain open, thus ensuring a constant outlet to fishermen in the eastern sector.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Celtic Sea fishery has been carefully nurtured from being a vastly depleted fishery during the seventies to the major employment source it is to-day.  This has been brought about through intensive, carefully planned management regimes, using all available scientific and technical expertise, together with comprehensive control and monitoring by the Minister's Department. It is the Minister's intention to continue on this road and ensure the continuance of this vital lifeline to the coastal communities concerned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 9 October 1992.</P>

      <P>A review of the employment incentive scheme was commissioned by the Department in December 1986.  The main conclusions of the review conducted by the ESRI were that deadweight and displacement were high and it recommended that the scheme should be focused and targeted on disadvantaged groups.  The recommendation was accepted and the employment incentive scheme, as it currently operates, is directed at the long term unemployed, early school leavers and other disadvantaged categories.  The employment subsidy scheme has only been in operation since the end of February and recruitment to the scheme now stands at 3,543.  The operation of the scheme and also of the job training scheme will be reviewed later this month in co-operation with the EC as arranged when the schemes were first introduced.</P>

      <P>The Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, requires <Col N="629" /> that holiday pay be given in advance of leave and that it should be at the &ldquo;normal weekly rate&rdquo; of pay.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Normal weekly rate&rdquo; is defined in section 1 of the Act.  The definition provides for two separate modes of calculation of holiday pay depending on the nature of the normal weekly rate of pay. If the normal weekly rate of pay is calculated wholly by a time rate or a fixed salary or if the payment does not vary in relation to the work done, the definition provides that any regular bonus or allowance which does not vary in relation to work done must be included in holiday pay.  If the normal weekly rate of pay is calculated by any other method, holiday pay must be based on average weekly earnings for normal working hours over the 13 weeks ending on the day before the annual leave.  Such average weekly earnings would include any bonus, allowance or productivity payment etc. earned during normal working hours.</P>
      <P>Overtime payments are specifically excluded from the definition of &ldquo;normal weekly rate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that while I have endeavoured to outline the relevant provisions of the Act, I am unable to give an authoritative legal interpretation of those provisions. Definitive interpretations of the legislation and of its application to an individual case would be matters for the courts to determine.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the social employment scheme, SES, is meeting the objective set for it of providing work related opportunities for long term unemployed persons over 25 years of age.  The work undertaken is also of considerable benefit to the local community.  The current high level of unemployment generally and particularly among the long term unemployed means that there is a continuing need for a scheme such as the SES.</P>
      <P>The scheme is kept under review to see if changes are necessary.  It is being adapted on a pilot basis, in the 12 partnership areas established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and is being replaced in these areas by the Community Employment Development Programme which will contain a training element in it. However, the scheme will continue on its present basis in the remainder of the country until the end of the pilot period at least.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to establish priorities for the social employment scheme generally and also to have more projects sponsored by local authorities. These are matters I will be addressing with a view to ensuring that worthwhile opportunities are provided on a countrywide basis for those who are long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="632" /> current staff complement in the Labour Inspectorate Section of my Department is ten inspectors and four administrative support staff.</P>
      <P>The Labour Inspectorate is responsible for the enforcement of all Employment Regulation Orders drawn up by the Joint Labour Committees.  Enforcement is carried out through routine inspections and investigation of complaints.  In 1991, the Labour Inspectorate carried out 5,551 inspections under the various EROs representing a 21 per cent increase over the level of inspections undertaken in 1990. In addition, the Labour Inspectorate collected £279,723 in 1991 in respect of arrears of wages owing to workers covered by the EROs.  This figure represents an 85 per cent increase over the level of arrears collected in 1990.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to ensure that the statutory minimum wages and conditions set out in the EROs are effectively enforced.  As part of its continuing efforts to improve efficiency of enforcement, the Department is currently completing a major computerisation project on the work of the Labour Inspectorate.  When the computerised system is operative, later this year, it will lead to the maintenance of computerised records on all employments covered by the EROs and will enable more effective and efficient enforcement of the orders.  I am at present reviewing the operations of the Labour Inspectorate in the context of the new JLC for grocery workers and will take whatever action is deemed necessary to ensure the effective enforcement of the new ERO in the retail grocery sector.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Protection of Employment Act is to ensure that, where there is a likelihood of redundancies occuring, workers representatives receive advance notice and are consulted beforehand by the employer.  There is an obligation on the employer to notify me also and not to proceed with the implementation of the redundancies until 30 days have elapsed from the date of notification.</P>
      <P>I am apprised of collective redundancies in two ways mainly.  Usually, employers notify me, as provided for under the Act.  Workers or their representatives may also bring to my attention threatened or alleged breaches of the Act.</P>
      <P>Such reports are always investigated and followed up particularly with a view to ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act and that proper consultations with workers representatives take place.  In my opinion this is the most important feature of the whole process &mdash; employers and workers representatives discussing the possibility of avoiding or reducing the number of proposed redundancies and of mitigating their consequences.  I am satisfied that, in the vast majority of cases, the Act is complied with and that only a relatively small number of complaints have been received.  Recently I secured the first successful prosecution under the Act and further prosecutions are pending.</P>
      <P>As regards proposals to amend the Act, my Department is at present completing a review of the operation of the legislation with a view to assessing the need to amend it.  In addition the EC Directive, on which the 1977 Act is based, has recently been revised and our legislation will have to take account of the revisions contained in the Directive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that primary responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests with employers.

The actual number involved is a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>
    <P>The new apprenticeship system agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> visualises all apprentices being sponsored by employers with special provision being made for disadvantaged persons such as the handicapped and early school leavers.  The intention is that an additional 1,000 apprentices should be recruited each year under the new system in the currently designated trades.  In addition, FÁS is currently exploring how the new apprenticeship system might be extended to occupations outside the currently designated apprenticeships.  This would have the effect of considerably increasing apprenticeship opportunities for young people.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the protection given to employees in respect of eligible claims under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, in regard to awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The insolvency payments scheme, operated under the 1984 Act, provides protection for the employees of an insolvant employer i.e. an employer who has been formally declared bankrupt or put into liquidation or receivership, in respect of certain wage related entitlements. These entitlements include minimum notice and unfair dismissal awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal together with arrears of wages and holiday pay, subject to certain limits and conditions.</P>
      <P>In cases where employers are insolvent within the definition in section 1 (3) of the 1984 Act, no costs accrue to their employees in claiming their entitlements under the scheme.  However, in cases where employer companies cease trading but are not formally insolvent under the definition in section 1 (3), those companies are not covered by the 1984 Act. In such circumstances, Employment Appeals Tribunal awards or other employee entitlements are not payable under the scheme.  The employee's concerned may in those situations take proceedings to have the companies concerned declared insolvent so as to bring them within the scope of the 1984 Act, but, as such action would give rise to costs for the persons involved, it would be for themselves to decide whether or not to institute proceedings.</P>

      <P>In accordance with normal practice, discussions <Col N="639" /> took place at ministerial and departmental level in relation to aspects of the Government's Green Paper on Education which were of mutual concern to the Minister for Education and myself or which could have a bearing on my area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>The objectives of training, and facilities in relation to training, are set out in the White Paper on Manpower Policy, 1986 and the National Development Plan, 1989-1993.  The White Paper outlined the objectives of training as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  To ensure an adequate supply of highly qualified and skilled manpower for the needs of the economy;</P>
      <P>(ii)  To improve the overall skill level and motivation of the labour force;</P>
      <P>(iii)  To provide opportunities to acquire skills appropriate to jobs which are, or are likely to become, available;</P>
      <P>(iv)  To assist enterprises and workers to cope with occupational, structural and technological change;</P>
      <P>(v)  To improve the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for new enterprises by having available a highly trained, adaptable and versatile workforce.</P>
      <P>In relation to equality and equity, the White Paper outlined the following objectives:</P>
      <P>(i)  To promote equality in access to jobs and training;</P>
      <P>(ii)  To provide disadvantaged groups with access to employment schemes and training opportunities and so improve their employment prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of programmes are being implemented by training and educational bodies to implement these objectives.  A recent addition to the range of programmes is Youthreach.  Youthreach is a jointly sponsored programme by the <Col N="640" /> education and training agencies designed to help pupils who have left the education system with no qualifications.</P>
    <P>Current education priorities are being reviewed in the context of the Green Paper on Education.  Any consequential adjustments which may be called for in the training area will be announced in the White Paper on Manpower Policy which I hope to publish later this year.</P>

    <P>(ii)Excludes the effects of the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notes on Table</i>
    </P>
    <P>Column (a)</P>
    <P>(i)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1987 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1987-88.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The figures in column (a) of the table are based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>Column (b)</P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farming tax units which were formally assessed for tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1988 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1988-89, irrespective of whether tax was actually payable in all cases.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Full-time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations in respect of tax paid on their farming profits.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are, to some extent, estimated.</P>
    <P>Column (c)</P>
    <P>(i)  The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year from tax units whose main source of income is from self-employment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some of the increases in the average tax payments made by other self-employed in 1988 are due to the introduction of the withholding tax on professional fees in 1987 and the combined effects of the tax amnesty, the introduction of the self-assessment system and a full year payment of the withholding tax in 1988.</P>
    <P>The 1989 yield was first to reflect a full year's credit for withholding tax paid in the previous year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  A married couple who have elected or have been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband are counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the former composite rate arrangements are not included in the calculations.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The yield from farmers and other self-employed was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992.  Ordinarily these balances, amounting to about £30 million, would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the Current Year Basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.  The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1.  The figure covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>2.  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figure shown is, to some extent, estimated.  The figure shown is the tax paid by full-time farmers together with the estimated tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits only.</P>
    <P>3.  This figure includes tax paid on income from trades and professions (other than farming), together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes withholding tax on professional fees.</P>
    <P>The yield in 1991 from farmers and other non-PAYE was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992.  Ordinarily these balances, amounting to about £30 million, would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the Current Year Basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.  The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>
    <P>The figures in the table do not include receipts of deposit interest retention tax or of certain other miscellaneous tax payments. Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these tax payments which are attributable to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained. The percentage figures given must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in each of the sectors mentioned.</P>

    <P>*These estimates are very tentative and are subject to a wide margin of error.</P>
    <P>The figures of cost include preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.  The figures are gross figures, and do not take account of the yield from the levy on section 84 loan interest which was introduced in 1986.  This levy yielded £18.5 million in 1988, £24.9 million in 1989, £27 million in 1990, £20.2 million in 1991, and £11.6 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that measures were taken in the 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 Finance Acts to restrict the growth of section 84 lending.  As the cost figure provided for 1992 relates to accounting periods ending not later than 31 March 1992 it would only partially reflect the effect of the 1992 Finance Act measures.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The figures for 1990-91 and 1991-92 are provisional and subject to revision.  Some of the cost figures now provided differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>In regard to the estimates above relating to the cost to the Exchequer of Export Sales Relief, &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief and the reduced rate of tax for manufacturing profits, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises might not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of each cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Notes on Table</P>
    <P>(1) <i>Export sales relief and &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief</i></P>
    <P>The cost estimates relating to Export Sales Relief and &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief are based on the assumption that the profits involved would have been charged at the standard rate of corporation tax, which varied from 50 per cent to 40 per cent for the years in question, were it not for the reliefs.  These reliefs were terminated from 5 April 1990, with the profits becoming chargeable to tax at the 10 per cent rate where they qualify under the appropriate provisions.</P>
    <P>(2) <i>Manufacturing profits</i></P>
    <P>These figures represent the estimated loss to the Exchequer arising from the charging of manufacturing and other qualifying profits at reduced rates of corporation tax instead of at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>The cost increased in 1991 because the relief became available to companies which formerly qualified for Export Sales Relief.</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>Reduced rate of corporation tax for small companies</i></P>
    <P>The reduced rate of tax was terminated <Col N="650" /> as respects profits and interest arising after 1 April 1989.</P>
    <P>(4) <i>&ldquo;Section 84&rdquo; loans</i></P>
    <P>These figures include preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.  The figures are gross figures, and do not take account of the yield from the levy on section 84 loan interest which was introduced in 1986.  This levy yielded £24.9 million in 1989, £27 million in 1990, and £20.2 million in 1991.</P>
    <P>(5) <i>Capital Allowances</i></P>
    <P>The cost figure included for each year in respect of income tax is estimated by reference to accounting periods ending in the year to 5 April immediately preceding each of the years in question, e.g. year ended 5 April 1980 relates to the column headed 1980-81.  For corporation tax the cost figures relate to accounting periods ending during each of the years in question.</P>

Since the lease was granted the company in question has experienced some technical difficulties as a consequence of which it has been unable to bring the mine into sustained production.

      <P>The provision of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is very expensive.  It is important therefore that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected/handicapped.  Accordingly in 1985 my Department issued guidelines to health boards on the classification of cases awaiting treatment in descending order of severity/handicap.</P>
      <P>These guidelines provide the following classifications: Category A &mdash; The most severe cases, e.g. cleft lip and palate, somewhat less than 1 per cent of all children. Category B &mdash; Cases with severe functional handicap, e.g. marked disproportion between the upper and lower jaws &mdash; and, therefore, teeth &mdash; about 6 per cent &mdash; 8 per cent of children.  Category C &mdash; Non-handicapped cases about 12 per cent &mdash; 16 per cent of children.</P>
      <P>A further category, sometimes called D, caters for the simpler type of cases which can often be treated at primary care level by a non-specialist having sufficient skill and experience.  These guidelines are currently under review.  In mid-1990, the Department wrote to each health board asking that all orthodontic waiting lists be reviewed and all children be reassessed to determine their orthodontic need and to place them in the appropriate priority category in accordance with the existing guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past few years the Government have made available a special allocation specifically for the development of the adult dental services and the provision of orthodontic treatments.  A sum of £3 <Col N="660" /> million was provided by the Government in 1990 and a further £3 million was provided in 1991.  The special allocation has enabled health boards to bring an additional 2,500 orthodontic cases into specialist treatment in 1990 and a similar number into specialist treatment in 1991 and at the end of that year over 12,000 children were receiving treatment.  The allocations made available to health boards in 1992 include a repeat of the special provisions of 1990 and 1991 and consultant orthodontists have been recruited in the North-Western, Southern and South Eastern Health Boards.  It is hoped that it will be possible to make similar recruitments to a number of other health boards in the near future.</P>

      <P>Persons in receipt of incomes from abroad by way of pension or otherwise can experience gains or losses depending on the ongoing exchange rates between the currency in which they are paid and the Irish pound.  Many of those in receipt of pensions from the United Kingdom have experienced for some considerable time an improvement in income as their pensions gained in value during the period when the Irish pound remained below parity with sterling.

    <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in the value of sterling may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department provided their means do not exceed IR £60 per week.  A United Kingdom pensioner who is already in receipt of an old age &mdash; non-contributory &mdash; pension and whose means have dropped as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment at any time.  In either case, if current unfavourable sterling-punt exchange rates persist, these will be <Col N="667" /> incorporated in an average exchange rate system used by my Department to assess means.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of United Kingdom pensions who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size should also contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>
    <P>It is not yet clear if the current exchange rates between sterling and the Irish punt are a temporary phenomena or are likely to continue in the medium to long term.  The matter in so far as it pertains to social welfare pensions is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>The person named by the Deputy received a lump sum of £140.00 from her former employer on 2 September 1992, the date of her dismissal on redundancy.  According <Col N="668" /> to the information submitted to my Department in connection with the employer's rebate claim the amount paid represented the correct statutory entitlement under the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>
      <P>The amount of the statutory lump-sum payment which a qualified redundant employee is entitled to receive from his/her employer is calculated as follows: (a) a half week's pay for each year of employment continuous and reckonable between the ages of 16 and 41 years; (b) a week's pay for each year of employment continuous and reckonable over the age of 41 years and (c) in addition, the equivalent of one week's normal pay.  At present there is a ceiling of £250 on the gross weekly wages which may be taken into consideration when calculating the amount of statutory redundancy lump sum.</P>
