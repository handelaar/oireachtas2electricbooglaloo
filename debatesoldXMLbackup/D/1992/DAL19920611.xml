      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 10, 11 and 4 &mdash; Vote 32 &mdash; and that No. 4 shall be taken not later than 3.45 p.m.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the question necessary to bring the proceedings on Vote 32 shall be put not later than 12 noon tomorrow and the following arrangements shall apply to the debate: (i) the speech of the Minister and of the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael and Labour Parties shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case and the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes; (ii) a Minister of State may be called on a second time to make a speech in reply; (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes; (iv) in the five minutes preceding such reply, Opposition spokespersons may request the Minister to clarify specific issues during the course of his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of Votes 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 11-18, inclusive, and 44, which shall be taken tomorrow: (i) the Estimates shall be moved and debated together and decided by one question which shall be put not later than 4 p.m.; (ii) the aforementioned <Col N="262" /> arrangements for debate on Vote 32 also apply in respect of this debate; (iii) if a division is demanded tomorrow or on any Estimate today, such divisions shall be postponed until 6.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 24 June 1992.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the proposals for dealing with Vote 32 are satisfactory and agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Without disagreeing with item No. 4, there is a reference to questions being put before the Minister replies which the Minister is expected to deal with during the reply.  That does not allow for any interchange between Members.  The Member has to take it on faith that the Minister will actually deal with the question in reply but if he does not there is no comeback, so to speak.  It seems to me when dealing with this in future I would be better either to allow the Minister to reply to the question when it is put, if it is a specific query, or to have the five minutes at the end of the reply so that the questions that are asked will only be in relation to issues that have not been dealt with in the reply and the Minister would actually reply to them there and then.  The purpose of this is to have some dialogue about public spending rather than a series of monologues.  I believe this proposal does not meet that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that what the Tánaiste has said is correct and has been agreed; I am not questioning the agreement. I am hoping that the House might bear in mind the validity of what I have said in future arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the proposals for dealing with Vote 32 are agreed.  I must now ask if the proposals for dealing with Votes 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 11 to 18, inclusive, and Vote 44 are agreed? <Col N="263" /> Agreed.  Is the proposal for postponing divisions on Estimates called today or tomorrow satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night at 8.30 p.m. the House took what might be described as a historic decision, to ask the Government to co-operate with the Northern Ireland authorities in working together to draw up a programme for Structural Funds assistance from the European Community to promote greater trade North and South.  I welcome the Government's acceptance of the Fine Gael proposal.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Tánaiste &mdash; and this is in order, the Chair will be glad to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask, with the indulgence of the Chair, if the Government would agree to a debate before the end of this year, during the preparation of the operation programme, so that the House can review how the Government are implementing the decision taken last night that there would be a North-South dimension to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter can be considered by the Whips and put on the agenda if it finds favour.  I too am very pleased that there is an element of agreement with regard to the cross-Border planning and so on.  A great deal is going on in that regard on a voluntary and private basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to promised legislation, we have been informed in this House on many occasions by the Taoiseach that a sub-committee of the Cabinet was meeting to bring recommendations before this House in relation to a number of issues dealing with abortion, the right to travel and the right to information.  Can the Tánaiste inform the House at what stage the deliberations of that sub-committee are and if there is a <Col N="264" /> possibility of something being published by that sub-committee before the referendum on 18 June?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question, the possibility of publishing anything, I cannot make any comment.  However, the sub-committee is working on the problem which was given to it by the Government and has not reported to Government as yet.</P>

      <P>It is not rubbish.  If it is nothing to do with it why have we got a special investigative unit within the Army?  The Minister for Defence should be able to explain that.  He should not <Col N="267" /> hide behind the Chair.  He is misleading the people on this neutrality issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here to get mileage.  I am here to get the truth about the situation and whether Maastricht has to deal with NATO.  Why have a special unit within the Army to deal with this matter if it is not an issue?  This is the last day we have to have the matter clarified and when I raise it with the Tánaiste he points in your direction.  He is hiding behind the Chair on the matter.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1, in the names of Deputies Deasy and Connaughton, is out of order as it would clearly involve a charge on the Revenue.  The second amendment, in the name of Deputy Ferris, is out of order for the same reason.  This third amendment, in the names of Deputies Deasy and Connaughton, is also out of order as it would involve a potential charge on the Revenue.  We may discuss section 2 and Members may give their reasons for putting down those amendments.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the essence of the Bill in that it refers to the dissolution of the Land Commission.  On the Second Stage debate we objected very strongly to the dissolution of the Land Commission without an alternative or substitute body being put in place of the commission.  Unfortunately, our amendments to section 2 have been ruled out of order.  We maintain our objection to the dissolution of the Land Commission without an authority being set up to carry out specific functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The passage of section 2 would lead to an open season on land sales.  There will be no controls whatsoever.  That is not good enough.  There will also be a lack of control on the use of land.  We have requested the setting up of a land use authority.  I cannot think of a time in our history when the proper utilisation of our land was decided upon by a statutory <Col N="272" /> authority, In recent weeks during the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy severe restrictions have been put on the supply of agricultural products produced in this country.  That will leave a vacuum involving a considerable quantity of land.  It is important that an authority be set up to ensure that the use of land is overseen in an ordered manner.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly put down questions about the use of land, having regard to wildlife in particular.  My questions have been responded to by a pretty dreadful answer, if it could be called an answer at all.  It appears that there is no co-ordination within the Government about the way in which land should be used. Land will be set aside, people will be compensated, land is being reclaimed and habitats for wildlife are being destroyed, but there is no co-ordination between the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture and Food.  There should be.  The only way to achieve co-ordination is to set up a statutory authority that would decide what land should be used for which purpose. We all know that a reduction in this country's agricultural output will require us to find alternative uses for the land that will be set aside and cannot be used because of quota systems.  We all know that there will have to be some way of managing that land.</P>
    <P>An authority is needed to direct landowners into particular avenues and to make sure that land is used in a specific way.  It is just not good enough that the wildlife of this country should be exterminated while we in this House stand idly by watching the destruction of their habitats &mdash; whether the habitats be ponds, streams, marshlands, scrublands or wooded areas.  We need to have in place a supervisory body that will decide what should be reclaimed and what cannot be reclaimed, which habitats should be retained and which habitats could possbily be destroyed in the furtherance of land reclamation.  It is my view that no habitat should be destroyed but daily I realise that our future is being given away because of a lack of interest and a lack of a statutory authority.  We <Col N="273" /> are destroying the environmental aspects of this country.  From now on we cannot exist solely from agriculture.  We will have to use our land for other purposes, agri-tourism in particular.  Land management should be undertaken in an ordered way.  The Land Commission could have had some control over land usage. The commission is being dissolved and no body is being put in its place.  The Government will have to find a substitute for the present system and ensure an organised utilisation of our land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before the commencement of Committee Stage I received your notice, a Cheann Comhairle, that my amendment was out of order.  I respect your ruling but in tabling my amendment I envisaged that the procedure outlined in the amendment would not necessarily have involved a charge on the Exchequer.  I went into some detail in my amendment on the preparation of a land agency.  I included a reference to time in order to make sure the Minister, the Department and the Government would have an opportunity to examine a structure that need not create such a charge but would in fact involve voluntary organisations such as the IFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  Voluntary organisations of that kind have a vested interest in the future procedure involved in land sales or transactions, particularly in relation to the resettlement of families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 is the core of this legislation, in subsection (1) it provides for the dissolution of the Land Commission but in subsection (2)  it provides for the revocation of any of the existing commissioner's power to acquire land by compulsion or even on a voluntary basis. In the past, the Land Commission did excellent work in this area when large estates became available which would not normally have been acquired by small farmers, small family farms and by people with fragmented holdings and all the other categories for which the Land Commission were specifically set up.  As there will not be an agency in this area in <Col N="274" /> future, I am concerned that nobody will have any powers in law to address the problem of family farms and fragmented holdings.  This is still a major problem in parts of rural Ireland and it was on that basis I requested that my concept of a land agency would be in the area of representation, subject of course, to the Minister's approval.  It would not have created a charge on the Exchequer because it did not necessarily need a statutory role requiring legislation and the involvement of public expenditure. My amendment was intended to address the problem which will arise in the area of land resettlement and restructuring of fragmented holdings.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally, when the previous Government announced that they would introduce legislation to dissolve the Land Commission, members of the present Government initiated a campaign throughout the country to advocate setting up a land agency.  This was set up through various county committees of agriculture, ACOT and the General Council of Committees of Agriculture and was the subject matter of a special committee of the family farm section of the IFA and the ICMSA.  At the time I was chairman of the county committee of agriculture and the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, was also a member.  He fought for this concept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing a legitimate case based on the need for solving this problem.  There is a major debate at present about the Maastricht Treaty and the Protocol we managed to slip in when the midnight oil was being burned in December&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The Deputy should speak to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will hear me out, a Cheann Comhairle, you will realise that it is relevant.  The Danes inserted a Protocol in advance of the referendum which they held on the Maastricht Treaty which <Col N="275" /> would preclude other people, particularly Germans, from acquiring their land.  The Danish Government were concerned about protecting their own lands which they felt, for the future development of their country, should be within their own jurisdiction.  As a result of the dissolution of the Land Commission, land will now be available to the cheque books from the nations within the Community or the Council of Europe.  We are allowing strategic land here, which could be developed for organic farming and other uses, to be acquired by those who can afford to buy it.  If the concept of my amendment had been accepted there would have been some input by the farming organisations who would have been charged with the responsibility of protecting the future of family farms.  Of course they would have recognised that, constitutionally, people have certain rights to private property and the right to dispose of it to the highest bidder.</P>
      <P>The Government &mdash; and previous Administrations &mdash; always envisaged that the land of Ireland was for the people of Ireland.  It was always argued that people would have the right to own their own land; land in any part of the country is &mdash; and will in future &mdash; be very valuable.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the debate on Committee Stage has turned into Second Reading speeches.  I wish to dissuade Members from making such speeches on Committee Stage.  I have allowed Members to refer to amendments which have been ruled out of order by the Chair &mdash; for good and cogent reasons &mdash; and they should now concentrate on the section proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I accept your ruling on this matter.  Perhaps the Minister will, on Report Stage, address some of the concerns which I expressed and the reasons behind the tabling of my amendment.  We saw the farming organisations as having a major role, indeed their role in COPA would be of assistance to the Minister in debating a future agricultural development policy under the <Col N="276" /> revised Common Agricultural Policy.  I have respected the views of the Minister of State in this area for many years.  He comes from a rural background and has served on county committees, county councils ACOT, Muintir na Tíre and other bodies who aspire to this concept. Even though my amendments have been ruled out of order, the Minister of State should consider their content.  It should not be beyond the powers of an ingenious Minister of State with such a background to be able to address this problem.  If we do not address the problem we will have no power to control even the exchange of land.  Ministerial approval will be needed in that regard.  Earlier in the century there were absentee landlords whose benefits derived from fragmented holdings so that the tenant farmers continued to argue with one another instead of trying to ensure that their parcels of land were convenient.</P>
      <P>Section 2 is the Bill in total and if we dissolve the Land Commission without debating the possible alternatives, which are the responsibility of the Minister, we will have failed in our obligation.  The debate on Committee Stage is very restricted and will be even more restricted on Report Stage.  We want to express our reservations in the hope that the Minister will respond positively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food with special responsibility for horticulture and rural development, Deputy Hyland, on his appointment.  He has inherited this legislation which probably dates back to the time Deputy Deasy was in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we had a land agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill is dated 1986 and I can see no reference to the need to establish another land agency.  I should say to the Minister of State that he will have an opportunity between now and the Report <Col N="277" /> and Final Stages to reconsider all aspects of the Bill which he has inherited, which has been handled by at least three Governments and is only being debated in the House in 1992.  He should not feel under any obligation to have the Bill, as presented, passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I have a number of reservations about this Bill and they relate to the powers available under the Land Acts.  The Land Commission have served a useful purpose. When I was first elected to this House in 1977 the majority of the representations that I made dealt with the question of land redistribution and acquisition, while in south Roscommon there were major problems in relation to fragmented holdings.  Those problems have not been resolved to date.  Therefore there is still a role for a land agency.</P>
      <P>This work could be done by the Department of Agriculture and Food. Indeed, I would have great confidence in the ability of the Minister of State to do this work, with the support and assistance of Teagasc, other State agencies and the workers employed in the Land Commission, if he was given this responsibility. I would have no objection if the Land Commission were restructured but the residual powers should be retained having regard to the vital referendum that will take place on Thursday, 18 June, when, I hope, there will be a decisive &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>I should say in response to Deputy Ferris that the Danes had a Protocol included in the Treaty which relates to the acquisition of their land by non-nationals. Despite this, the Danes did not vote in favour of the Treaty.  I can assure the House that we, too, have a major difficulty at present in relation to the purchase of land and property by non-nationals and I would like the Minister of State to assess the purchases which have been made in recent years.  Land sales have been uncontrolled because the Land Commission have not been functioning for some time, because of the Bill introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government to dissolve the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> Post-Maastricht, it will not be possible to restore these powers as this would not be in keeping with the Treaty arrangements. Fortunately, this Bill will not be passed before 18 June.  I say this because we will have an opportunity to review its contents, specifically the proposal in section 2 that the Land Commission be dissolved.  It is my understanding that all legislation in place prior to 18 June will still be relevant.  In the circumstances, the Minister of State should take this opportunity to recall what was said in the discussions that took place at the meetings of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party in 1984, 1985 and 1986 on the excellent paper on land restructuring drawn up by the present Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith.  This document should be studied by the officials in the Department and, I suggest, re-studied by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The powers available under the Land Acts are substantial.  In relation to cutaway bogs, thousands of acres in the constituency of the Minister of State will have to be redistributed.  Who will have the responsibility to define policy in this area?  I believe it should be the responsibility of a revamped land agency under the aegis of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>In relation to the redistribution of commonages this was not a characteristic feature of my constituency but some commonages have been successfully redistributed by the Land Commission. It is my understanding, however, that difficulties are being encountered in other constituencies, for instances in Mayo.  I am sure my colleagues, Deputies McDaid and O'Donoghue, will highlight the problems being experienced in their constituencies of Donegal and Kerry. This matter will have to be dealt with by some residual agency.  We would be confident that an agency under the auspices of the Minister of State would be independent and would have the powers that are available under the Land Acts.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding also that the Minister of State &mdash; he may wish to comment on this &mdash; is examining the question of annuities which are being paid by farmers throughout the country, given the <Col N="279" /> hardship imposed.  Farmers in my constituency of Longford and Roscommon are experiencing great difficulty in meeting their repayments of annuities which were based on high land values in the late seventies and early eighties, when land was sold for up to £2,000 an acre.  At that time the Land Commission bought a considerable number of holdings.  I know of small farmers who are against the wall. We should provide some assistance to help them to have the date extended or the repayments reduced.</P>
    <P>All the amendments have been ruled out of order.  Many complaints were received about the manner in which land was redistributed.  However, the Land Commission also received many compliments. I believe that they have not completed their work.  The Minister of State who has special responsibility for rural development and horticulture may find it useful to have an agency under his auspices to control the redistribution of land to ensure it is retained in Irish hands and to avoid the possibility of non-nationals buying land.</P>
    <P>In relation to the afforestation programme, some control should be retained. Again, the Land Commission could be given responsibility to control afforestation because in some areas top quality land is being planted.  In parts of my constituency trees are being planted by ordinary farmers but, as against this, multinational companies are now buying large tracts of land, probably even in your own constituency, a Cheann Comhairle, that is if you still have a constituency at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, indeed.  I am also concerned about the Committee Stage of this Bill.  Clearly, we are having Second Reading speeches and that is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to you, a Cheann Comhairle, as far as I know you are serving your second term and even before your term this Bill was before the House.  This is 1992 and, in fairness, it must be said that we are dealing with a <Col N="280" /> Bill initiated as far back as 1986.  In those circumstances surely it is time that Deputies had an opportunity of debating all the issues relevant to 1992, the pre-Maastricht Treaty agreement and the post-Maastricht Treaty agreement?  It is time our land was properly managed.  The only organisation capable of doing so is the residual group within the Department of Agriculture and Food, who would have overall responsibility for such management. That is why I am concerned and am expressing here today grave reservations on the dissolution of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
      <P>As a backbench Member of the Fianna Fáil Party I appeal to the Minister to review all aspects of this Bill before it is returned to this House.  I sincerely believe there is need for the residual powers to be retained within the Minister of State's section of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I suggest that he be afforded that opportunity over the summer recess.  I strongly recommend that this Bill should disappear from sight for another few months, that he study it over the summer recess with his Departmental colleagues and his colleagues within the majority Government party. If necessary I will return on Report Stage to put this case again.  I will be lobbying for a change in this Bill and for the retention of the powers of the Irish Land Commission within the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely seeking information. The position at present is that any land that becomes available for sale goes to the bidder with the largest wallet or account book.  Unfortunately, that does not suit the vast majority of Irish farmers; in fact there are very few of them it would suit at present.  The only people that process would suit are those who want to invest money in land or in some business, people who are not very interested in engaging in farming at present.</P>
      <P>There is still no curtailment on people planting trees to within a few yards of somebody else's back door.  Therefore, the establishment of a land authority or agency, with authority to oversee the planning of forestry and the allotment of land to existing farmers, is vital.  It is not in the best interest of the country or of our farmers that land should be allocated to the highest bidder.  Since the only way in which a land agency or authority may be established is through the defeat of this Bill, then I look forward to seeing it defeated.</P>

It means that the Land Commissioners were influenced by Deputy Connaughton when he was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture.  That amounts to a charge of corruption.  That is not true.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Let us keep personalities out of this.  Let us adhere to the provisions of the Bill before us.

Within reason I understand their feelings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the amendments we tabled were ruled out of order, particularly taking into account what Deputy Foxe said a few moments ago, the only chance now available to the Opposition of ensuring a signal to the Government that this, as an agricultural country, needs a land authority of some description &mdash; into which I will go very briefly in a moment &mdash; is to put it to a vote on the floor of the House here in a few moments time.  If there is a majority in favour of not having a land authority, as such, then everybody will know exactly the Government's intention.  It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>There are two or three very important reasons we should have a land authority, one of which is of historic significance. The Land Commission have always been the poor relation in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I have no doubt that in the future they will not even be regarded as a first cousin in the Department. Once the people in the Land Commission retire or are moved out there will not even be a semblance of a land policy in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I say this having had five years experience in the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Deasy and others said, the work carried out in the future by a statutory land authority will be completely different from the work carried out in the past by the Land Commission.  All Governments over the past 20 years have to take some blame for not changing the land policy of Land Commission quickly enough.  Many things needed to be done in this regard.  The system of land acquisition and allocation <i>per se</i> was the most costly, cumbersome and outdated system <Col N="286" /> one could come across.  I genuinely hope we do not revert to a system of compulsory land purchase, where land is held for five or six years &mdash; and by the time it is allocated it is in some cases, impoverished &mdash; and that it will be allocated on the basis of social justice.  I believe that in many cases the allocation of land had little to do with a farmer's ability to farm it.  Having said that, I wish to point out that the Land Commission did great work during the early years and many people would not now be in farming if it were not for the Land Commission.  The joint purchase scheme initiated during the eighties was a great scheme.  I understand that 300 to 400 projects were set up under that scheme during one year at almost no cost to the Exchequer. However, because the Land Commission inspectors were sent elsewhere the scheme was scrapped.  The scheme enabled small farmers to come together and gave them a purchasing power which they did not have as individuals.</P>
    <P>Many people refer to the purchase of land by nationals and non-nationals.  I accept that there is a problem with non-nationals but our biggest problem relates to the purchase of land by people who have a great deal of money but are not involved in farming.  There are no restrictions on the purchase of land by these people.  As the Minister knows &mdash; he has a great interest in this industry &mdash; all that people need nowadays is money; if they believe they can make a few quid from land they go ahead and buy it.  We should not fool ourselves about this.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the type of land authority which should be set up.  I will be very brief because I think my views on this issue are fairly well known.  I think they are in line with the views of most of my colleagues in the House.  Any land authority who are set up will need to be very broadly based.  As Deputy Deasy has pointed out on a number of occasions, we need a land use policy. Many people who have nothing to do with land will want to have a say on how the country is run from the point of view of land use.  I am referring to the development of golf clubs, recreational facilities <Col N="287" /> and the very successful afforestation programme carried out in many areas. People in Connaught, particularly those in County Leitrim, are very worried that trees are being planted in areas where they should not be planted.  They believe that there should be a planning aspect to the afforestation programme.  The Department of Agriculture and Food, youth organisations', auctioneers, universities and a whole range of people should have an input to any new land authority.  It is very difficult to say how such a body should be constituted.  I am very worried that the Government do not intend to replace the Land Commission with a land authority.  All the Minister of State said was that their functions were being transferred to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and they would be operated by him.  I put it to the Minister that if no greater interest is displayed in this issue than was displayed in it over the five or six years, then a land policy will be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>Many of the points made by other Deputies will arise again in the context of later amendments.  The Minister will run into trouble with the legal profession if various offices are allowed to be run down by a reduction in staff.  For example, the records section is under-staffed at present.  I say this from personal experience.  This is a very important office and something needs to be done so that there is greater access to records.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that there are minimum qualification standards for entry into farming in all other European countries.  I should like the Minister to say if there are any restrictions on the purchase, by way of public auction, of a farm in Ireland by a farmer from France, Germany or Holland?  Is any examination carried out to see if those people are entitled to start farming here?  I know there are restrictions in the case of non-EC nationals.  If an Irish man or woman wants to buy a farm in Denmark they have to meet the requirements laid down in the regulations for entry into farming.  I would be very grateful to the Minister if would explain this point.  I <Col N="288" /> should like to know the qualifications for entry into farming here and whether these regulations are standardised throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>In view of our huge dependence on agriculture it is inconceivable that we would not have a land authority of some description.  I make a final plea to the Minister to indicate to us today that the Government are striving to set up a land authority.  I believe all the farm organisations and all farmers want a land authority. It does not matter whether it is a statutory authority or an interdepartmental group.  We will have done a very bad day's work for agriculture and our people generally if we do not replace the Land Commission with a land authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to become involved in fairy tales or any of the matters mentioned by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle but the section leads to general statements being made. Section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, provided that the Land Commission would have to consent to the sale of land to a non-national.  That is a very interesting point in the context of the debate that took place this morning.  When we joined the European Community in 1973 section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, as it related to EC nationals, all but became defunct.  An EC national was allowed to purchase land here, either through an agent or on his own application, on a &ldquo;rubber stamp basis&rdquo;.  Section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, had no application in practice to EC nationals.  The EC is structured in such a way that this must be the position not just in relation to Irish nationals purchasing land abroad but in relation to EC nationals purchasing land in Ireland. That is a major culture shock and, perhaps, places the entire situation in relation to European Union in its proper perspective.  That is the position and neither the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, or anybody else can do much about it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions which, as Deputy Connaughton suggested, provide that non-Irish nationals would have to have certain qualifications prior to entering farming here.  This would have a restrictive effect but would not prevent EC nationals from purchasing land here, which they were unable to do long before this Bill came before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the dissolution of the Irish Land Commission there is a very serious problem, which did not crop up today or yesterday, relating to fishery rights in Irish rivers.  Under the land Acts fishery rights on many rivers here were vested in the Land Commission. However, if one were to investigate the stretches of river owned by or vested in the Irish Land Commission it would take a considerable period of time to ascertain the true position simply because one would have to go back 100 years or more in order to discover ownership.  This <Col N="290" /> causes a considerable problem and has a debilitating effect on the Irish tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Where fishery rights have been identified large multi-national corporations and very wealthy people are purchasing the fishing rights on some of the best rivers and lakes here and retaining them for their exclusive use or for the exclusive use of their friends and others without regard to the common good.  In the context of the dissolution of the Irish Land Commission I strongly urge the Minister to identify the fishery rights along the rivers of Ireland to ensure that ownership is ascertained and that there is a broad national policy to prevent one of our most valuable natural resources from being handed over to or bought out by a chosen few.  There are indications of this along the rivers and lakes of this country.  It is of crucial importance in the interests of the tourist industry and the Irish people that the matter be resolved in the context &mdash; I stress this &mdash; of the dissolution of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances that section 5 has a specific provision for the transfer of fishing rights to the new Central Fisheries Authority, perhaps the Deputy would accept that he is anticipating that section and inhibiting himself from a much more generous contribution in respect of fishing by referring to it now.  There is no specific reference to that matter in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that as opposed to taking a fishing licence I have perhaps taken a poetic licence and in those circumstances I will reserve further comment in relation to fishing rights for section 5.  I would like now to refer to commonages.  In the context of the dissolution of the Land Commission I would like to refer to a serious problem in relation to the division of commonages. Very often we find that if a farmer who is living with his brother who has a farm nearby applies for a herd number to qualify for headage payment, he is informed that because his brother has a herd number and there is a possibility of interaction <Col N="291" /> or mixing of the herds, a herd number cannot be issued to him &mdash; herd numbers are issued on the basis of animal hygiene.</P>
      <P>At present, farmers who thought they owned fishing rights are being put off by foreign companies and wealthy people who seem to believe that they have an exclusive right to what belongs to the Irish people.  Farmers are demanding to know the position and tension is increasing. This inevitably leads to conflict and will continue to do so.  The first casualty is the river itself as poachers exploit the opportunity that arises.  It is a perceived renewed public justification for taking what these people consider to be their entitlements.  Recent experience has shown that this conflict does not go unnoticed by subversive elements who are only too willing to become involved. It is absolutely clear that the interaction of herds on a commonage is a far greater danger to animal hygiene than anything else.  There has not been a coherent policy in relation to the division of commonages since the Mayo case went to the High Court.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have done an outstanding job in relation to the division of land over the years.  It is most unfair that one landowner can hold up ten to 20 other landowners by refusing to agree to the division of a commonage.  There are compulsory powers for the Land Commission under one of the Land Acts in relation to the division of commonage, but since the Mayo case things have become very confused and land division seems to take an inordinate amount of time.  I strongly urge the Minister to ensure that there is some mechanism whereby commonages can be divided in situations where the minority disagree with the division.  It would be in the interests of animal hygiene, the farming community and farming in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was coming to.  When it was announced that the Land Commission were to be dissolved there was a widespread understanding that as the work of the Land Commission had not yet been completed some monitoring authority would have to be set up to continue that work.  In the absence of any such agency it is open season on the land market.</P>
      <P>There are many thousands of uneconomic holdings in the farming community. Because the holdings are inadequate they cannot provide a livelihood.  The people are intelligent, willing and capable of working the land.  We are now getting into the area of land speculation not only by foreign interests but by the forestry authorities, and not just private forest interests.  Recently Coillte Teoranta bought good agricultural land which was adjoining an uneconomic holding.  The young farmer, who had a family, was anxious to exchange land with Coillte Teoranta in order to make his holding more economic.  The exchange in his opinion would have facilitated Coillte Teoranta as well.  Coillte Teoranta said that their interest was in planting good land and they denied that family the opportunity to continue on an adequate holding.  This is a regrettable policy.  The future of rural Ireland, despite low farm incomes, is surely with a progressive farming population.  It is futile and anti-social to consider facilitating the planting of forestry on good agricultural land.</P>

      <P>I want to convey to the Minister the deep concern and frustration at the failure of the Government to introduce a statutory monitoring authority which would continue the land policy which had been carried out by the Land Commission.  I strongly urge the Minister to rethink with a view to restoring the confidence of landholders with uneconomic holdings and others who looked to the Land Commission for protection and support.  The Land Commission did a tremendous job in disposing of some 14 million acres of land.  It would be a major error not to establish some monitoring authority in its place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to voice my disapproval of the policy enshrined in section 2 which dispenses with the powers of the Land Commission without creating an alternative land agency.  As a Deputy <Col N="296" /> from an area bedevilled with intermixed commonages and small holdings which have been the cause of litigation for centuries, I believe there must be a replacement for the Land Commission.  The legacy of our historical land struggle has left us with the most landlocked tenure system in Europe, occupied by the second smallest proportion of young farmers and the second largest proportion of elderly farmers in the Community, together with a growing proportion of part-time farmers.  Only in Italy is the situation worse within the EC. The need for land reform in Ireland today is as critical as it was in 1870 when the first tentative measures were taken to replace the landlord and tenant system which had obtained since the 17th century. The need for change is as urgent today as then.</P>
      <P>I add my voice to the remarks made by Deputy O'Donoghue who pointed out the serious implications with regard to commonages. Bovine health is seriously threatened by the intermingling of cattle and sheep in mountain areas which have not been divided and kept under control.  It is necessary for the Minister, even at this late stage, to bring in some kind of arrangement to fill the vacuum left by the Land Commission. Unfortunately the Land Commission was bedevilled by bureaucracy and could not act properly in the division of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law which allows EC nationals to purchase land in any EC country should require that such people have a green certificate or some kind of degree in agriculture to prove they will be able to farm the land.  If our young farmers must produce a green certificate before they can get farm installation grant from the EC, the same should apply to EC nationals buying huge tracts of land here. We must safeguard the right of our people to farm the land that was dearly won by our forefathers.  We are throwing away that chance.  Responsibility for the division of land should not rest with the Minister and the Department.  The criteria should be laid down by a land agency formed by representatives of the <Col N="297" /> agricultural organisations and the duly elected Members of this House.  This would ensure that fair play and justice would prevail.  We must do away with the public perception that the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his Department decide who will get land.  It would be of immense benefit to our youth if we ensured some kind of continuity in the agricultural industry.  Do we want to make this country a wildlife reserve where there will be nothing left but briars and game hunting such as there is in Kenya?</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that amendment No. 2, in the name of Deputy Ferris, has been ruled out of order.  Had it not been I would have supported it because it encapsulates better than the Fine Gael amendment what needs to be done.  This amendment was ruled out on very narrow grounds but I will not dwell on the reasons.  Deputy Ferris referred to a number of organisations which he felt should comprise the land authority.  I am surprised he did not mention the United Farmers' Association which represents a large number of small farmers who are clearly unrepresented in the major farming organisations.  I agree very much with the points raised by Deputy Leyden and I hope he will join us on this side of the House when we go through the lobbies soon.  As a citizen of this country I am very concerned at the way we have sold so much of our land to foreigners whether EC nationals or not.  In Kerry, a foreigner has fenced off part of the Kerry Way, one of our long distance walking paths. We talk much here about agri-tourism and that is a typical example of how not to facilitate that form of tourism.  We do not facilitate agri-tourism by the decisions we are making to divide commonages. I have been examining this matter for some time and I am not satisfied that the division of commonages is good agricultural practice in spite what Deputy Leyden said.  I would remind Deputies that that means that areas of mountains which previously were free to walkers, whether nationals or non-nationals, have been fenced off and roads have been constructed, thus destroying the wilderness areas which is part of our agri-tourism business.  We should reflect deeply on the division of commonages; there is for and against that practice.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to another point raised by Deputy Leyden concerning the Denmark Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty which would give them some rights of restriction over non-nationals. I disagree with the Deputy when he said we want a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in this referendum.  We want a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo; so that we can have a similar Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty to give us rights to control the sale of land to EC nationals.  For that, and many other reasons, I will be opposing this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief following the great speech by my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, in defence of the small farmer.  Many foreigners are buying up large tracts of land and controllers of pension funds are buying up large tracts of land for forestry purposes.  Young people who wish to remain on farms cannot do so because the sale of agricultural land is not controlled. Foreigners and multi-national groups are buying large tracts of land for planting purposes.  They are in a position to pay more money than an ordinary family person who is anxious to extend his farm and remain in agriculture.  My native county, Leitrim, has the lowest population and the highest number of people leaving the county and the land.  If we are to survive we must have a vibrant rural community.  It is necessary that a body be established to control the sale of land and that farmers are given a better deal and more entitlements than at present. As the Minister is aware, there is no way anybody on a farm in Leitrim, Sligo or Roscommon can compete with the foreigners and large multinationals for land. For that reason I have strong objections to section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>While the amendments have been ruled out of order I am pleased that the Chair allowed a discussion in relation to each of them because the amendments get to the core of the problem we are discussing.  I have listened with great attention and care to the various points raised in a very responsible and sincere way by all the Deputies from the far side of the House.  I have ended up with a considerable amount of paper and quite a few notes, and I will comply with your request, Sir, to be as brief as I can and to confine myself to the relevant sections.</P>
      <P>It is important in the first instance to acknowledge that we are dealing with the dissolution of the Land Commision and that the Bill relates mainly to the powers of acquisition which the commissioners had formerly.  Once we have dealt with the removal of these powers, then generally the remainder of the activities carried out by the commission will continue to operate within the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I do not think any Minister as an individual would want to involve himself in the administration of any of these functions.  Therefore, the intention would be to delegate these transferred functions to a unit within the Department or at least to some senior official, for example, an assistant secretary. Therefore, there is no question at all of the Minister who has responsibility for the time being wanting to involve himself in the functions which are being transferred to him under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think most Members here will admit that the Land Commission eventually reached a stage where there was no further land available for compulsory acquisition. We have a policy, which is subscribed to by parties on all sides of the House, to retain the maximum number of farm families on the land.  If the Land Commission could, for example, continue with a policy of compulsory acquisition <Col N="303" /> the inevitable consequence in the long term would be to undermine the existing small family farm structure and reduce the number of people on the land. Therefore, the Deputies opposite were correct when they brought in a Bill to dissolve the Land Commission and terminate the powers of acquisition.</P>
    <P>If we are to attain our joint objective here &mdash; the retention of the maximum number of family farms &mdash; bearing in mind the outcome of the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform and all the restrictions which are taking place <i>vis-á-vis</i> European agricultural production, the only way we can substitute for the Land Commission is to put in place the alternative farming enterprises we are talking about and introduce worthwhile rural development programmes as we are now about to do.  Instead of being able to give additional land to farmers, as in the past, for the purpose of keeping them viable and economic, the only hope we now have of supplementing these small, uneconomic holdings and keeping them viable is the introduction of the alternative farming enterprises backed up by a worthwhile rural development programme. It is worth making the point that what was regarded as an economic holding say ten years ago, when the Land Commission brought farms up to 50 or 60 acres, is unfortunately no longer viable due to the circumstances all of us are familiar with.  A constant volume of money is coming on stream from Europe and my desire is that we spend that money wisely and productively and that we channel it as best we can towards those uneconomic holdings, thus supporting the structure of the rural communities.</P>
    <P>I accept that these amendments were tabled in good faith.  As I said they represent the sincerely held views of the Deputies who tabled them.  I have been considering the amendments.  Of course, they relate mainly to the institution of a new authority, in other words some national body who will have a say and an input into regulating and monitoring land use.  That is a fair point.  When talking <Col N="304" /> about land use up to now, we thought mainly in terms of traditional farming enterprises, but my thinking is much wider than that.  We must have a plan for the development of our entire national land resources and all the areas to which Deputies here referred very objectively and constructively in their contributions this morning.  There is a need to co-ordinate all these land activities <i>vis-á-vis</i> traditional agricultural enterprises, the alternative farming enterprises I have been talking about and all the other rural development programmes.  From that point of view I accept the spirit of what all the people opposite have been saying to me here this morning.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Sheehan will bear with me as I bore with him, and indeed enjoyed his contribution as I always do, I will convey to him my thoughts and perhaps even the possibilities available to me in the matters which have been raised here this morning. <Col N="305" /> Deputies will be aware that under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> proposals, which involve all the social partners, an expert working group have been set up within the Department of Agriculture and Food chaired by the Secretary of the Department, Michael Dowling.  That working group are currently considering every aspect of land policy development, and how our land resources can be best utilised to retain the maximum number of farm families on the land, and progress the development of commercial agriculture.  I am concerned about this matter, and I spoke last night with my colleague the Minister, Deputy Walsh, about the amendments the Deputies opposite very genuinely tabled.  I say to them here today that their proposals are well intentioned and it is their prerogative to decide whether to have a vote on them.</P>
      <P>Having listened to this debate, I am prepared to put the views expressed here before the expert group within the Department.  There is a need for some kind of co-ordinating authority.  I listened attentively to Deputy Ferris who indicated that he was not looking for some kind of statutory authority that would cost the Exchequer money.  I am very much in favour of voluntary organisations and perhaps there is some scope for a voluntary monitoring group in the initial stages of formulating an overall land policy.  It is a fair and reasonable point to put to the House.  Members of this House can also put their individual proposals to the expert review group within the Department.  I have noted the comments made here today and on Second Stage, and I am prepared to put these views to the review group.  I suggest that individual Deputies do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that some would say that that is just passing the buck.  However, the review group has been requested to report as a matter of urgency and I would hope that there will be a report this side of Christmas.  It is a matter for Deputies here as to whether to put this to a vote but I would say that there is no difference between my view and what they have been publicly expressing in relation to <Col N="306" /> the need for some kind of structure to pull together all the strands of the land resource problem.  I say that particularly in the context of Common Agricultural Policy reform and of the additional regional funds which are becoming available for rural development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the lack of control in relation to the sale of land.  I understand the point he is making. However, the reality is that there are controls under section 45 of the 1965 Act. The point was made that that has not been implemented to the extent one would wish in terms of controlling land sales but the provision is there and perhaps it is a question of revitalising that Act to some extent.  It must be remembered that there are restrictions in relation to the control of land sales because of our membership of the European Community.  While the 1965 Act remains on the Statute Book there is also the question of the constitutional rights of people to sell their property in an uninhibited, free open market.  We must be realistic and acknowledge that these problems exist and, if possible, address them within the framework of our membership of the European Community and national legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy and others also raised the question of the qualifications of people, national and non-nationals, buying land here in Ireland.  Under existing regulations we do require that people who purchase land here must have specific agricultural qualifications.</P>

      <P>People who purchase land in this country must give some evidence of their ability to farm the land commercially. Deputies will be aware that in relation to our own national schemes, for example, the installation aid scheme, one must have a green certificate.  It is important from a national point of view that land be passed on only to people who are professionally qualified to farm the land of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies may argue that these requirements are not being met.  That may well be the case.  Perhaps we are not as diligent as we might be in relation to it but these provisions are there so it is within our power to address the problem.</P>
      <P>A matter raised by all Deputies was the question of the division of commonages.</P>

      <P>Let me say that I will be dealing with that aspect under section 5 and I thank Deputy Deasy for bringing that to my attention because there is no point in duplication.</P>
      <P>Even though the amendments to section 2 have been ruled out of order, I accept that they were put down in good faith and I would ask that the Members allow me to put their views to the expert review group sitting in the Department and hopefully something effective can be done.  Regardless of whether the Deputies decide to put it to a vote, I will do so because I accept the spirit in which these proposals were made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <P>I compliment the Minister on his comments and I recommend that Deputies on all sides of the House accept his bona fides in this regard.  The Minister has indicated that he accepts the spirit in which the amendments were put down and will refer the views to the group who are studying the situation at the moment. In the circumstances Deputies Deasy, Ferris and others would be well advised to allow the Minister to do this.  He has been very open, very understanding and appreciative of the contributions made here today and will endeavour to ensure <Col N="308" /> that the spirit of those amendments is implemented.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been dealt with by various Governments over the last number of years but Deputy Deasy may be able to tell us who originally brought the Bill into the House.  He may be able to tell us whether it was the intention to establish an alternative agency and, if so, what was the point in abolishing the Land Commission on the one hand and, on the other, establishing a new agency with similar functions, costs and powers? There is something inconsistent in such a proposal.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I compliment Minister Hyland on the open and positive manner in which he considered and discussed the proposals put forward today. His comments certainly tie in with the statements I have made in the House today.  The Minister and I are at one with our views in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also praise the Minister for his candid series of opinions.  He has actually made our case for us by reinforcing what we have been saying.  The idea of a new review body is all very fine but my political career has taught me that one cannot depend upon these things happening.  Every year I hear about review bodies that are going to report within six months but if they ever report at all it might be 12 years later.  Because of that I cannot have any confidence in this new review body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in 1992.  While Deputies on this side of the House agree that the Land Commission should be dissolved as proposed under this section it must be borne in mind that the legislation now before us was spawned in the middle or late seventies.  It is 15 years out of date and it does not take into consideration the changing circumstances.  That is the reason the new review body should be set up before this Bill goes through the House.  It is because we have not taken changing circumstances into consideration that the legislation is so objectionable. The thinking contained in the Bill is 15 or 20 years old.  The legislation is out of date before it is debated and that <Col N="309" /> is what makes the House so irrelevant so often.  I know the Minister has the best intentions in the world but I am sure that he rcognises the truth in what I am saying.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael Deputies recognise that the Land Commission should be wound up but we want a meaningful body put in their place.  Deputy O'Donoghue, when he was in the Department of Finance, had very bright ideas about land usage for wildlife purposes.  Deputy Garland was right when he referred to the same subject as did Deputy Foxe.  A collection of agencies within existing Departments need to get together and actually manage the 17 million acres of land referred to by Deputy Sheehan.  The people involved in that body should be drawn from various agencies.  There should be representatives from the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; in other words, the remains of the Land Commission. There should be people from the Office of Public Works, who deal with wildlife. It would be ridiculous to have wildlife under the control of the Department of Finance.  If it is wanted to stifle a concept or kill it off it is put under the control of the Department of Finance.  We all know about that, from experience and nobody knows that better than the officials sitting on the other side of the House.  Everything to do with wildlife, habitats and so on, should be taken away from the control of the Department of Finance.  Also included in the new authority should be Coillte because, as so many speakers have said, a greatly increased quantity of land is coming under afforestation.  There should be proper policies as to where forests are situated and what kind of trees are grown.  The new authority should also comprise representatives of that section of the Department of the Marine dealing with inland fisheries.  Our inland fisheries should be an integral part of any land use policy.</P>
    <P>Here we are debating the passage of legislation that is out of date.  We should do what the Minister himself advocated five minutes ago: we should set up the review body.  This Bill should be put on hold.  Only when the new authority are <Col N="310" /> established should the Land Commission be abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's very forthcoming response.  I am only sorry that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was not in the Chair to hear the Minister's reply.  He would then have understood the dilemma that faced all of us in this stark section 2, the implications of which are in direct contradiction to what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle felt we were trying to do.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle thought we were trying to discuss amendments that were out of order when in fact what we were trying to suggest, without creating any demands on the State, was the concept subsequently spelt out by the Minister.  Surely what we were doing was legitimate during Committee Stage when the Committee are dealing specifically with a section on which amendments have been ruled out of order.  The concept behind the amendments was not ruled out of order and the Minister has accepted that in his reply.  It was in that spirit that we in the Labour Party, and our Fine Gael colleagues, tried to promote the ideas behind our amendments.  I assure Deputy Garland that I certainly would not rule out any voluntary input from any association throughout the country.  My amendment referred to &ldquo;other farming organisations&rdquo;, under which I would include the UFA and any other agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to accept in good faith what the Minister has just said.  As I understand the position, the review group are already set up and operating under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I accept that it is probable that submissions are already being made to the body for farming organisations. The review body need the <i>imprimatur</i> of this House and of the Minister in particular.  As far as possible, we want that to happen in a legislative way; it is not that we hope it will happen.  If we are to accept section 2, which abolishes the Land Commission, we want the review body to be given effect under legislation. If that does not happen there will be no order in future in the regulation of land <Col N="311" /> use, which is really all that we are talking about.  On another section I shall refer to the fact that although the Government have acquired land by compulsion and have not disposed of it under the constitutional requirements of the Land Commission, they now intend to sell it. Speakers from all sides of the House have reflected on problems in relation to fragmented holdings, commonages and so on.  We must all agree that there should be some hand guiding the use of land.  I suggest that the guiding hand should come from experts, who could include officers from the Department of Agriculture, officers from the Office of Public Works, fishery boards' representatives and people from any other organisation the Minister would like to involve.  The farming organisations, Munitir na Tire and other non-statutory bodies should have a specific involvement.  Those people have an interest in this matter, and their interest is yours and mine.  They want to make sure that in the future there will be some order in the disputed issues of rights, commonages, fishing rights and sporting rights.</P>
    <P>I never intended to create any charge on the Exchequer.  I think the Minister accepted what I said.  I was not presuming to put down any amendment; I put down amendments in good faith.  I did not try to influence my colleague Deputy Moynihan, who is an expert on this kind of legislation, having been a Minister of State in a portfolio directly involved with land.  I would not try to usurp either the functions of the House or those of the Chair in promoting Deputy Moynihan to be put out of order in any way.  I was reminding him that the Committee were dealing specifically with section 2, which is the core of the legislation in that it proposes to abolish the Land Commission. I want to put that on the record because interruptions at times from the Chair, in spite of the intention of maintaining order in the House, can sometimes misrepresent the rights and functions of Members in trying to be helpful.  Regardless of what anybody says &mdash; that also applies to the Whips &mdash; I am <Col N="312" /> trying to be helpful in improving and amending legislation and in getting a commitment from the Minister that, on Report Stage, he will address the problem, if possible, in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope we can work together to implement a framework in relation to the Minister's comments.  A Fianna Fáil Government published an excellent White Paper in 1977 and again in 1980 which addressed the role and functions of the Land Commission as Fianna Fáil saw them.  This was not condemned by anyone in Opposition.  Paragraphs 31 and 32 of the White Paper specifically confirmed the views of Members of the Opposition.  The position of the Government at that time has now been overturned by section 2.  We are trying to be constructive in this regard.  We all know what agriculture means to every town, village and parish in the country; if we do not have a viable family farm unit, which will survive, there will not be any towns or villages and there will not be an opportunity to benefit from the creation of wealth in rural areas.  The country is not dominated by cities &mdash; even though they contain the majority of people &mdash; it depends on ordinary people in rural areas.  If you dissolve the Land Commission, which regulated farms in the past, and do not accept that there is a need for a regulatory body in future, you could be missing the whole point of what all Members ever stood for, particularly rural based Deputies.  I make no apology to the Chair or anybody else for having tried to do my best in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not surprised at the contribution from the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, because, from experience, I know he believes that something will have to happen if the Land Commission are dissolved.  I would have been surprised if he had expressed a different view.  I spent five years in Agriculture House and I went, more or less, down the same road which the Minister proposed.  I interviewed daily many of the groups to which we referred in this debate and on occasions I spoke to them collectively.  We worked out all the <Col N="313" /> details, even down to who would be chairman, and the terms of reference. After the 1987 election we packed our bags when the people decided they wanted a change and it concerns me that there has not been a word from the various Governments since about a replacement body for the Land Commission which we hoped would have been in place when the Land Commission were dissolved. I do not believe that there is a will on the Government side to do that. This is an historic day as the Land Commission will shortly be abolished.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Minister of State will face immense problems and I am sure they will do their best.  Farmers know that they have a sympathetic ear in Kildare Street in regard to this but I genuinely believe that we are as far away as ever from setting up a replacement body for the Land Commission.  That is why it is incumbent on us to have in legislation &mdash; as Deputy Deasy rightly pointed out &mdash; more than an aspiration, however well intentioned, before we abolish the Land Commission.  Five years have elapsed and nothing has been done.  There is no point in blaming the Minister of State &mdash; I would not do so.  In another context the late John Healy said that nobody shouted stop; I am now shouting &ldquo;stop&rdquo;; we will be doing a great disservice to agriculture today if we do not have a replacement for the Land Commission.  I know that if the Minister of State gets his way something will happen and I will not waste the time of the House by listing all the ins and outs which I went through in five years to try to bring this on stream.  Even if a Fine Gael Government were in office I do not know what sort of land authority we would have.  However, I would be trying to influence all and sundry in relation to it.  When Deputy Deasy was Minister for Agriculture he was behind this concept.  Of course, there would still be problems but I am not satisfied that enough work was done in relation to replacing the Land Commission.  I want to make it clear that I am not blaming the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We should not try to fool ourselves in this regard.  I know that in some European countries you must prove that you have agricultural education and five years' experience in farming before you can purchase land. That should be implemented here because it is a matter of great concern that someone from outside the country can, without impediment, purchase land. I know that we have certain obligations within the EC system and I am not arguing against them.  Of course, non-nationals are welcome in this country but under conditions laid down for them. After all, there are conditions attached to our people going abroad.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister of State gets his show on the road very quickly and receives a commitment from the Minister for Finance and other parties involved, we could be back here 20 times over the next few years without having had any movement.</P>
      <P>It has been my sincere view for many years that the Land Commission should have changed the way in which they did their business. Indeed, I was one of the first people to say this in public.  In the mid-eighties, during the course of meetings, people said to me that I was wrong and was letting the small farmer down but I fail to see how the Land Commission &mdash; we are about to put them out of business now &mdash; could be used to make progress in the future.  That is not to say, however, that something else could not be put in their place.  As this has not happened all we can do is to register our protest on the Floor of Dáil Éireann.</P>

As I said in my previous remarks, there was nothing wrong with the Land Commission but they were muzzled and got bogged down in Departmental bureaucracy and red tape.  Members of the Land Commission had long years of experience and are still employed by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  We should avail of their talent and experience to get a land agency off the ground.  As Deputy Connaughton and Deputy Deasy said, we have not made one inch of progress during the past decade in replacing the Land Commission with a viable land agency.

      <P>In thanking the Deputies for their contributions let me say that I have no doubt that when Deputy Connaughton was in the Department he tried to resolve this ongoing saga, the land problem.  Let me put the record straight as I do not want to be accused of misleading the House.  While I accept the Deputies opposite are entitled to call on this section for a vote &mdash; it is obvious that that is what they are going to do &mdash; what I said was that an expert review group have been set up within the Department of Agriculture and Food under the chairmanship of the secretary of the Department to consider every aspect of this question, including farmers' incomes and farm development.  It would be very unwise, therefore, to jump in and establish some new body without first awaiting the outcome of their deliberations.  It is my hope that the review group will report this side of Christmas but perhaps I will be proved wrong.  In this regard I bow to the experience of those who have been through this before.</P>
      <P>I cannot anticipate what the outcome of the review group deliberations will be in relation to the structure or authority that we are discussing today.  I have given the House an assurance today that I will convey to the review group the views that have been expressed.  I invite Members of the House, in turn &mdash; perhaps their parties have already done this &mdash; to make their views known to the group.  As I cannot anticipate the review group's recommendations I cannot say today whether a new structure will not be in place.  I have to say this as I do not want to mislead the House.  We will have to await the outcome of their deliberations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister of State's bona fides in this regard, can he give me an assurance that the report of the review group will be made available to Deputies and will we be given an <Col N="317" /> opportunity to debate their findings as this might lead to the establishment of the structure we are discussing?  I am not sure whether this is an interdepartmental review group which will report to the Minister of State only but I ask him if at all possible to make their report available to Members of the Oireachtas, to place it in the Library of the House, and to support the call we will make to the Government for time to debate the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give an assurance that the report of the review group will be published and debated on the floor of the House, or to state whether it is an interdepartmental group.  I should have mentioned, <Col N="318" /> however, that the group comprises representatives of the social partners, including the farming organisations, and has a much broader remit in relation to economic and social activity; they are not dealing only with the agricultural industry. That is just one of the sectors that they are dealing with.  It would be wrong, therefore, to give the House the impression that the review group are dealing specifically with the agricultural industry.  As I said, they have a broader remit, which includes the food industry. I am not in a position to give Deputy Ferris a categoric assurance that the report, when it becomes available, will be debated in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the transfer of functions from the Land Commission to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I wish to raise a point with which I am sure the Minister of State is familiar.  Perhaps he will consider my remarks between now and the end of the debate.</P>
      <P>For the past few months a person who has applied, through the Land Commission, to sell land has had to apply to the Department's office in Cavan for the consent from the Land Commission to issue.  There is a procedural difficulty in this system which gives rise to extra administration.  I ask the Minister to look at this problem.  A person has to apply for consent to the office in Cavan and conditional upon every application is the redemption of the annuity.  Unfortunately, information on the annuity is not available in the office in Cavan. Therefore, it is necessary for the consent to be issued from the Department of Agriculture and Food in Cavan with a proviso that the annuity be discharged. In order for the member of the public to discharge the annuity a fresh application has to be made to the Department's office in Castlebar.</P>
      <P>I accept fully the Minister of State's commitment to the decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Like me, he is concerned to ensure that our constituency will be looked on favourably in the context of the decentralisation programme.  This practical difficulty in the present system is giving rise to extra administration.  I do not expect such matters to be sorted out on the floor of the House, but I urge the Minister to make every effort in the course of the decentralisation programme to ensure that the administrative consequences are such as not to give rise to hardship for the public.  At present people have to apply to the office in Cavan for consent but they cannot redeem the annuity because they do not know the amount, nor can they determine it from the office in Castlebar.  Nevertheless they issue the consent with the provision that the annuity be discharged.  As a result people selling or sub-dividing land have to make a double application &mdash; they have to make the first application to the office in Cavan and make the second application to the office in Castlebar.  This takes extra time and entails more administration.  I ask the Minister to look at this issue.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points made by Deputy Flanagan in relation to this matter but as he said it is an administrative problem.  I will ask my officials &mdash; I will also bring this matter to the attention of the Minister &mdash; to see if the system can be streamlined to meet the Deputy's concern.  This section only relates to the delegation of functions. Under section 4 the Minister can delegate to officials of his Department matters provided for under the Bill.  As I indicated earlier, I do not think any Minister for Agriculture and Food from whatever political party would want to be directly involved in the administration of schemes, particularly those which are being retained within the Department. Under the Bill the Minister will have the power to delegate that responsibility to senior officials of his Department.</P>

      <P>This section will enable cases scheduled for hearing by the judicial commissioner or the appeal tribunal to be continued before the High Court.  We believe that at least one of the lay commissioners should be a former commissioner of the Land Commission as it is unlikely one could employ at short notice a person with their experience.  We put down the amendment to find out what will happen to the judicial system after today.  A Minister who may not like certain functions may delegate them to senior officials in the Department.  That will probably be an executive function with powers similar to these vested in county mangers.  I assume that is what the Minister is talking about.

I pay tribute to them for a job well done in terms of dealing with land mobility.  I think everybody in this House would accept that the Irish Land Commission did a very worthwhile job up to the time it was no longer possible for them to continue with a programme of acquisition.  Naturally, we would be very concerned about every employee in the Department, particularly those employed in the Land Commission. Every facility will be made available in terms of their re-employment or deployment within the Department. Voluntary retirement has been on offer and will be taken up by some of those <Col N="323" /> who wish to avail of it.  A very genuine and positive effort will be made to meet the requirements, taking into consideration the disruption involved in transferring from one aspect of operations to another.  Personnel section of the Department will deal in the normal way with people who no longer have a function to perform.  They will be accommodated in so far as possible in operational programmes within the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.  Responsibility for the division of commonages is hereby vested in the Minister who shall, in particular, ensure that this responsibility is henceforth discharged by the Farm Development Service of his Department.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important section.  I am concerned about the vast acreages of commonages and bogland that will be transferred from the old Land Commission system to the Minister or an appointee of the Minister.  I have no intention of delaying the House but this is probably the last chance we will have of putting on the record our concern that there are major problems in this area, although not in national terms &mdash; if we spoke here for the next six hours a single line would not appear in the national newspapers about this matter.  As the Minister knows, people are frustrated because they can get nothing done by way of commonage division, identification of bog plots and so on.  I know that some people will say that there are more pressing matters to be dealt with on the Floor of Dáil Éireann, but let us be fair about this matter.  There is a great deal of wealth involved in this area which has <Col N="324" /> not been realised and is of no use to the potential owners of the land.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few suggestions which I believe will be helpful, and in doing so I take note of the High Court case that was taken in respect of the County Mayo commonages.  There are people in this House, including Deputies Moynihan and Ferris and my colleagues on this side, who have been interested in this matter for some time.  Everybody will speak for themselves but with one voice we are telling the Minister that whatever system he advises for the future will have to be ten times more effective than the system that existed for the last five or ten years.  I know the Minister will give the stark answer that commonages are being divided, that there are sufficient staff and that the problem is in hand, but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the Land Commission officials referred to by Deputy Ferris who have great expertise in this area will be treated as outcasts.  They are not agricultural officers in that they do not visit farms in relation to headage payments and so on; neither are they civil servants because there is no place for them in Agriculture House.  The worst thing we could do would be to leave them in a kind of limbo and pay them for doing nothing. That would not be their wish.  With their vast amount of information and knowledge, they could, given the opportunity, be of great help to people.  There are so few of them that they will be unable to deal with all the commonages.  Seven or eight groups have made representations to me in the last four or five years with a view to having their commonages divided, but despite my best efforts and the efforts of the ILC officials in Galway we are no further down the road in dealing with that matter today than we were four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>After much consideration over the years I believe that most commonages should be divided.  I have read the transcript of the court case in Mayo in which the judge raised one or two serious points.  If commonages of a certain acreage are to be subject to planning permission approval we are on the high road <Col N="325" /> to nowhere.  Deputy Garland and other environmentalists will get their way, but for a different reason.  I have spent much of my time trying to solve the problem of the majority shareholding decision process. One or two objectors should never have been allowed to succeed at the expense of the general concern of a group of ten or 12 shareholders.  There will always be one or two people who for ulterior motives will hold everything up. I understand that the result of the court case indicated that the judge believed that the greater good of the majority of shareholders should hold sway.  The proposal seems to be that where there are objectors they should be left with their portion of commonage for use as a commonage.  If one was not deeply involved in commonage division one would think that was a fair proposition but what would happen is that the objectors would object to the portion being allocated to them saying they wanted the commonage in the centre.  It would be very difficult for the legal process to decide on that issue.  I am very worried about that.  I hope the matter will be clarified because if not it will give rise to havoc in the Department afterwards.  If that is the way the law will be in terpreted, it will be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>Many Land Commission officers are getting old.  The younger officials in the service who went out to deal with the land tax are now in the Revenue Commissioners' offices.  In counties where commonages and boglands are creating problems the Department should transfer responsibility for division to the local farm development services.  There is no magic formula for dividing commonages; one does not need a university degree.  One needs patience and perseverance only.  Farm development offices are strategically placed throughout the country and particularly in the west where division of commonages is a fairly big problem.  While there is a shortage of staff, at least there are staff there.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem for groups of people is that they cannot get the officials to come out and talk to them because <Col N="326" /> there are always objectors of some kind or another.  The Land Commission inspectors could be attached to the farm development services and one person in each area office should be trained in land division.  That is the same concept as that employed in the group water schemes.  If the Minister says there are no staff the groups will have to employ engineers to prepare a plan of the commonages for submission to the Department for approval.  It is not even a second best solution.  Most shareholders want somebody they can trust from outside.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission officers were acceptable as objective, impartial and fair.  When I was involved in a group purchase of land scheme, as I mentioned earlier, it would not have worked were it not for the honest broker, the Land Commission officer.  This is the only way I can see this working.  There might be a better way but I do not know it.  Under my proposal we will at least know that there are identifiable staff available in a particular office.  This suggestion is compatible with the thinking in the Department of Agriculture and Social Welfare with regard to one stop shops.  One should have queries with regard to the headage schemes, land drainage and so on answered at local offices while at the same time be able to deal with the Land Commission personnel on the division of commonages.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that land division is a huge problem in certain parts of the country.  In some areas there are no commonages but it is big business in other parts.  A bigger problem relates to bog rights.  It is very important to have access to maps when dealing with bog rights. Every year in the months of March and April, particularly since one famous engineer patented a new type of turf cutting machine that can cut the low banks, there is almost civil war in some parishes, certainly in Galway.  I dread that time of the year because there is always a row about a bog.  Unfortunately, as the law stands there is no clear answer to this problem.  Something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I will be castigated for saying <Col N="327" /> this but I get the impression that people would pay a little more to get documents from the Land Registry office or to get maps of turbaries or commonages.  It may not be up to a politician to suggest imposing financial charges on people, but things are bad.</P>
    <P>If the farm development service could be used as I suggested the scheme could be localised and people in rural offices could work at local level.  If people were listening to this debate they would want us to pressurise the Minister to get this finished once and for all.  I hope the court judgment does not mean that there will have to be wholesale planning approvals for the division of commonages and that objectors can upset the good of the majority of the shareholders.  That would be a pity.</P>

      <P>Section 5 provides that sporting rights other than fishing rights are to be transferred to the Minister. It is intended to transfer fisheries and fishing rights to the Central Fisheries Board.  I want to highlight what I consider to be a serious and growing problem in relation to fishing rights.  There appears to have grown up a tradition whereby fishery rights are bought by large corporations or wealthy people and a system of exclusivity in relation to their user is then enforced.  The issues are so complex that they highlight a problem which is beginning to generate considerable interest and will undoubtedly be of great concern in the future.  Among our natural resources are some of the finest fisheries in the world.  There seems to be a creeping purchase of these fishing rights and this must give rise to extreme concern for the economy generally and particularly for the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to demonstrate how ill-prepared the State is to deal with the issue and the need to provide for the resolution of this problem in the context of the abolition of the Land Commission and the transfer of fisheries and fishing rights to the Central Fisheries Board.  Whilst I have no desire to take the House on a tour of the Ring of Kerry, although it would be a <Col N="328" /> very nice place to go, I wish to specify an instance in my own constituency.  A large section of the River Caragh in County Kerry was owned by an Irishman who also owned a hotel named the Glencar Hotel.  The hotel was sold about three years ago to a foreign company who employed private protection.  The private protection people told local farmers they were no longer entitled to fish the river or portions thereof.  These locals have correctly claimed that they have been fishing the river for up to 50 years and that the owners have no right to put them off.  While the fishery was in Irish ownership there was no attempt to enforce permits over the unimportant stretches and the tributaries.  It is most important to note that the rights claimed by the hotel have, to my knowledge, never been substantiated.</P>
    <P>The legal position in this instance and in many others is most complex and nobody appears to know whether in the Glencar Hotel instance they actually own the fishing rights to the entire system, including the tributaries or just the main channel.  This seems to be a problem in areas throughout the country.  Meanwhile farmers who think they own fishing rights are being put off.  They are demanding to know the actual position, and tension is increasing.  This inevitably leads to conflict.  The first casualty is the river itself because the conflict gives rise to a perceived justification for poachers taking what they might term their entitlements. This conflict has not gone unnoticed by subversive elements in the past, who are only too willing to become involved.  There are indications that this scenario is beginning to apply where fisheries are purchased by foreign interests in particular.  The fishery boards receive regular queries as to who exactly owns the fishing rights.  The Land Commission themselves have fishing rights. Over the past few years many farmers have been approached to take their fisheries back from angling clubs and to let them at significantly higher rates or sell them to other parties.</P>
    <P>The most important requirement to defuse tension and to allay fears and worries <Col N="329" /> is the availability of accurate information on ownership.  The information available is scanty and very poor.  In many cases it is likely that the State will have fisheries vested in the Land Commission and this would allay the fears of Irish citizens.  Where they do not, the earlier this information becomes available locally the less damage will be done on a long term basis.  Uncertainty as to title, not just in relation to what are claimed as private fishery rights but also in relation to Land Commission fishery rights, is the factor which allows the situation to fester.  Problems will always fester when property rights are involved. Since most of the land went through the Land Commission, information on title to fisheries can be investigated there, although it is a tortuous process.  Due to the intention to abolish the Land Commission it has been virtually impossible to get any information because sufficient staff were not available.  One could seek information from a particular file and wait years for a reply.  Accordingly on the transfer of fishery rights to the Central Fisheries Board it will be incumbent on the Minister to clarify once and for all the ownership of this extremely important natural resource.  In no other western country is it not possible adequately to identify fishing rights on important rivers. It is an absolute scandal.  In fairness to everybody involved it must be recognised that information sought will usually involve tracing ownership for the past 100 years or more.  This is time-consuming because large files have to be inspected to see if there are any references to fishing rights.</P>
    <P>The issue I have taken the opportunity of raising is likely to become of considerable concern in the future.  No satisfactory answers can be obtained because nobody in the Central Fisheries Board or the fisheries boards or in the Department of the Marine seems to have easy access to the required files.  Access to these files, in the context of the transfer of the fishery rights of the Land Commission to the Central Fisheries Board, and an arrangement whereby information can be extracted quickly are crucial if tension is <Col N="330" /> to be reduced and vitally important if this natural resource is to be preserved for future generations and for visitors to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to two aspects of this section.  The whole process of the division of commonages was very slow and cumbersome, and the Land Commission, with all their powers, did not resolve the problem.  I am not convinced that without the Land Commission the process will be any better.  Commonage land has become very valuable for afforestation and other purposes but also because of the growing popularity of outdoor activity centres.  Some of this land is attractive for building purposes because of its remoteness.  All these factors have made it very valuable and have increased its economic status, so to speak.  Therefore, there will be more pressure to divide existing commonages in future.  We should have some new procedures which may involve new legislation to ensure the speedy division of commonages.  This problem is likely to increase in the immediate future because people will realise the growing importance of this land, which in the past was of no great interest to most families; they knew they had commonage rights but never availed of them.  Now they will realise their importance, especially for economic advantage.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the Land Commission avoided this whole area as much as possible in the past and in some cases probably slowed down the process because of the complexities and legal questions involved. For example, people who had commonage rights perhaps left the country and could not be traced.  In my limited experience of dealing with cases of commonages in my county I realise how complex they can be and how frustrating they are for the Land Commission and for legal people.  I would like the Minister to give us, to the best of his ability, some views on how this process might be speeded up in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission constructed embankments in the past mainly in places <Col N="331" /> where Land Commission land was threatened by the sea.  I am aware of a number of embankments that were breached recently by the sea in places like Fenit and Carrig Island, and no-one seems to be responsible for the maintenance of these embankments.  The Minister will be taking over all the land formerly in the hands of the Land Commission.  Will that be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food?  Will they now take over responsibility for the repair and maintenance of these embankments?  In a number of places the coastline is threatened because of lack of maintenance over the past ten years or so.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy O'Donoghue speaking about fisheries.  I am aware of the ongoing problems in places like Kenmare, Cahirciveen and other places in south Kerry.  Fortunately, in north Kerry we have not the same problems.  We have merely the Feale River and its tributaries and for whatever reason there seems to be clear cut understanding between various angling associations regarding responsibility for the river.  I sympathise with Deputy O'Donoghue; south Kerry has a major problem as evidenced recently in the case of the Sheen Falls, that very fine development in Kenmare.  There is a major problem there with the local people in relation to the rights of the river which flows by the hotel.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to refer to how he proposes to speed up the division of commonages. Who will be responsible for the maintenance and repair of embankments in areas which will now be his responsibility?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the transfer of properties formerly held by the Land Commission, including commonages, in which there is a very considerable interest today.  The concept of the subdivision of commonages has grown very extensively over the last ten to 15 years and younger farmers, particularly, recognise that the old system of owning commonages meant nothing. There was no productivity, no reclamation, <Col N="332" /> no drainage and no fertilisers were used.  On that basis it was conceived that each individual tenant had his own sector which would be developed and would become productive.  That is vital now not only to individuals but to the national economy because huge acreage is involved.</P>
      <P>I subscribe to what Deputy Connaughton and Deputy Deenihan said.  It would appear that in order to expedite and simplify the whole system of subdivision, new legislation might be the best way to handle it.  This is a very big problem in areas of the west, especially Kerry. Much of the land that is in commonage is not mountain; it is perimeter land, capable of very substantial development, but no development has ever taken place, nor will it take place while that land is under the common ownership of ten, 20 or maybe 30 tenants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan said the longer the investigation goes on, the more difficult it will be to trace title, etc.  In areas of high emigration many of those who would have tenancy entitlement to commonages have left the country and may have left no heirs behind them.  Then there is the problem of search, possibly in America, Australia or elsewhere, to get the family goodwill.  This always creates problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question is that of division and subdivision of turbary rights throughout the country.  There was an excellent mapping system and an excellent record system in this regard.  Unfortunately, today, when many of those turbaries are in an advanced stage of development disputes arise in regard to boundaries and identification, and there is considerable difficulty in getting the necessary maps. People are confused.  I understand there is more difficulty in relation to some estates than others.  Because of the importance of continuing the excellent records that were there, instead of having them all in either Cavan or Dublin, where I understand some are retained, they might be decentralised to the counties concerned.  If necessary &mdash; I believe it will be necessary &mdash; the maps should be reprocessed and restored.  I have seen <Col N="333" /> many of them and they are at a very advanced stage of decay.</P>

As Deputy O'Donoghue said, it is doubtful whether the vested interests who control some of the best fresh water fisheries have title.  Perhaps that matter could be examined.  It could be claimed that these fisheries are in the ownership of the people of Ireland and are a tremendous tourist advantage to this country.  I appeal to the Minister to clear up the issue of the subdivision of commonages.  The development of these areas can lead to a substantial increase in production and therefore be of benefit to the local society of which they are part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to the question of the division of commonages which I mentioned earlier. The commonage problem is a complex one and the proposals to divide the commonages do not necessarily correspond with the best agricultural practice.  My understanding is that the sheep on the commonages require a considerable variety of grazing grounds depending on the season: they require different types of nutrients and shelter from wind and rain. Many commonages, when divided into small plots of 30 or 40 acres do not contain water or shelter.  It is a much more complex problem than people realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred briefly to the problem of hill walkers not being able to walk over the hills but I will not dwell on it further. Another problem is the grazing of sheep in many areas in County Mayo.  I do not like saying this but the reality is that these areas are being over-grazed because of the system of ewe headage payments.  We want to keep these sheep farmers on the land and to provide a reasonable income for them, but we must devise another method to ensure that our mountain land is retained.  Some areas of County Mayo are an absolute desert.  I am informed by <Col N="334" /> local farmers that those areas may never recover from over-grazing.  When talking about commonages we should not lose sight of the over-grazing of mountain areas generally.</P>

      <P>The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides for the transfer of property and land in the possession of the Commission to the Minister pending its disposal.  Sporting rights (other than fishing rights) are also being transferred to the Minister.  It is intended to transfer fisheries and fishing rights to the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if the Central Fisheries Board have the personnel and the financial allocations necessary to carry out the transfer of fishing rights to them?  What steps will the Minister take to ensure they will be provided with sufficient funds to carry out their extra duties?  Will they be compelled to take dicisions which may require legal advice?  Will the Central Fisheries Board have a back-up service from the Department of the Marine who will be delegating those powers?  At present the fishery boards are top heavy with work in their normal capacity.  Can the Minister enlighten us as to what he intends to do to provide those boards with adequate staff to carry out their extra duties?</P>
      <P>I disagree completely with Deputy Garland when he states that the mountains of this country are completely over-grazed by sheep farmers.  The potential of the mountainside is so great that if it were properly manured it could handle at least 20 times the number of sheep already grazing on it.  The mountain soil, to which Deputy Garland referred, never got a shake of fertiliser in the past three or four generations or perhaps longer. During the famine, potatoes were grown on the side of the mountains to sustain the population in Ireland at that time.  I have no doubt farmers are capable of utilising their tracts of mountain land to the fullest extent and are aware of the need for fertilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> The matter of commonages will need special attention from the Minister and his Department.  I would hate to see the commonage problem in this country being put on the back burner of the Department of Agriculture and Food in Kildare Street.  This question must be given priority above all other things in the country.  The dissolution of the Land Commission should not result in a continuation of the commonage problem that has existed for many centuries.  The commonages were created by landlords. It is of paramount importance that the Government, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Minister tackle the problem immediately to alleviate the serious problem that appertains throughout the country.</P>
    <P>During the past 20 years only a small part of the problem has been dealt with adequately by the Land Commission.  No resources were provided by the Department of Agriculture and Food to the Land Commission to tackle this immense problem.  I do not know of any other nation in Europe that has a commonage problem similar to ours, and a special financial allocation should be sought by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure that this problem is cleared off the decks within the next five years if possible. It is an impediment to preventing herds mingling with each other.  It works against the eradication of tuberculosis, as herds roam the commonages and the mountains throughout the country, which results in the spread of disease. Something similar happens to sheep. Sheep contaminated with sheep scab graze these mountain commonages infecting neighbouring flocks by mingling with them.  If this problem was dealt with there would be a big fall off in sheep scab. It is necessary to monitor and control the movement of sheep.</P>
    <P>Sheep dipping committees serve a very useful pourpose, but the maverick farmer who will not dip his sheep is the cause of the spread of this disease.</P>

      <P>These mavericks are aided by the commonage problem. Surely it would not be too big a task for the Department of Agriculture and Food to tackle this problem.  At the end of the 18th century the British mapped every acre of soil here and it is from those maps that our officials work in dealing with planning applications.  After 70 years of independence we have not produced an up-to-date ordnance survey sheet in respect of any part of our land.  It is a sad reflection on successive Governments that we have not tackled that problem. Shifting the responsibility from the Land Commission to the Department of Agriculture and Food will not solve the problem unless sufficient funds and staff are made available to divide the commonages.</P>
      <P>Where there is a will, there is a way and I urge the Minister of State to keep in close contact with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure this problem is solved.  Arising out of this Bill, I doubt that progress will be made at this late stage.  I have yet to be convinced that the Minister has the vision to proceed along the right lines.  This Bill is nothing but a conglomeration of words and, as I said before, pious words butter no bread. This issue must be tackled if we are to make some progress with this serious problem which has been a burden on Irish farmers for so long.  From past experience as an auctioneer I know only too well the difficulties that arose at the letting of Land Commission farms under the 11-month system.  One would want police protection at some of the leasing sales when aggrieved parties were bidding against one another.  The Department of Agriculture would let out lands for three, four, five and six years until grazing cattle and sheep had almost pulled the blades of grass from the roots&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the quality of the land deteriorated.  The Department of Agriculture, Land Commission, gained because of this.  No effort was made by any Government to solve this problem, it was always the Cinderella.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food is only one cog in the wheel of any Government. Other Ministers in the Cabinet may not understand the position.  I hope this debate will bring home to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and the Cabinet, the need for immediate reform on the division of commonages arising out of the extra responsibility the Department of Agriculture and Food have following the dissolution of the Land Commission.  The Minister will not be able to keep all his promises unless experienced personnel shoulder the responsibility of solving a very difficult problem.</P>

      <P>We are addressing section 5 and, unfortunately, I have not been able to address a number of other sections.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the concern of Members in relation to the problem of undivided commonages.  There is no doubt it is a serious matter and it is regrettable it has not been dealt with during the time span of the Land Commission which we are disbanding today.  That authority is now being transferred to my Department and I assure Deputies that we will continue to take responsibility for commonage division and assist local communities come to grips with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the concept of the local community.  I do not think it would be possible to enforce decisions about the division of commonage on individual farmers.  Commonage land is becoming increasingly more important than in the past.  I would, therefore, hope that local communities could address this question of undivided land and that we in the Department could be of maximum assistance in the mapping of the areas to be divided and in assising with the overall division.  I assure the House that that is my intention.  To the extent that I can I <Col N="338" /> am anxious to further the interests of commonage division.  Let me remind Deputy Sheehan, whom I always enjoy listening to, that there are no back burners in the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of embankments.  I have to confess that being new to this area I have not heard of the problem of embankments.</P>
    <P>I am advised that within the Department a fund was set up to deal with embankments.  What is left of that funding will now be transferred to the individual farmers involved and it is hoped that that will assist them to remedy the problem, which is obviously a matter of concern to many farmers.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my very sincere thanks to all the Deputies who remained in the Chamber for the duration of this debate and who made such very objective and fair contributions. As I indicated in my opening comments, I have made no promises other than to say that I am willing and prepared to forward the views expressed here, particularly those views concerning a new land authority, to the overall review committee within the Department.</P>

The service is to be augmented shortly by the recruitment of three additional psychologists.  The question of assigning a female psychologist to the women's prison in Mountjoy will be reviewed when the results of this competition are known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer.  I wish to stress that every effort should be made in the recruitment process to employ a female psychologist. I ask him to be mindful of the fact that the appointment of a female doctor to female prisoners in Mountjoy five or six years ago made an enormous difference to the prisoners.  If the Minister considers it important to keep in mind the recommendations of the report made by the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths, which dealt specifically with the stresses that prisoners are subjected to and which in many instances push prisoners to suicide, could he give to the House a commitment that a female psychologist will be recruited, in view of the fact that many of the women prisoners suffer from problems related to sexual abuse and find it extremely difficult to deal with a male psychologist?</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, the Deputy is pushing an open door in this regard.  The Deputy will understand that the number of females in custody at any one time is relatively small and might not warrant the appointment of a full-time psychologist.  I take the point the Deputy is making.  It would be best to judge what arrangement will be made to have a female psychologist available on some basis when the results of the competition are available.  I take the other remarks made by Deputy Fennell in the spirit in which they were offered.  I know that very good work has been done because of the improvements in the medical services in the jail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there has been an increase in crime in the past two years. As the Deputy says, it is desirable that the Garda have the necessary legislative framework to deal with the problem.

Would the Minister agree that such anachronistic legislation requires urgent reform?  Could the Minister say exactly when the new Criminal Justice Bill will come before the House? Will it be published before the vacation of the House for the summer or will it be published in the autumn?

It is a priority item on my legislative programme. Rather than saying that the Bill will be published before the end of this term, it would be preferable for me to say that it is my firm intention to have the legislation cleared through the House before the end of 1992.</P>

Why is it that the only law centre which has a waiting list which can be met within one month is in Castlebar? Why are adequate resources not provided to each of the other centres?

Other centres have a six or eight weeks' delay but I agree that there is a substantial waiting list in many of the centres.  However, we are trying to do something about it.  We have recruited extra staff to fill the vacancies; four new posts were authorised last year, which means that more clients can be taken on.  Unfortunately, the improvement in staffing has not led to a corresponding improvement in the arrears. I suppose that is because of the high level of demand for the service.  Deputy Shatter is right in saying that many cases relate to domestic violence and related matters and we would like to improve the situation.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 5 and Questions Nos. 25, 39 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the recent concert at Slane, it was a matter for the Garda authorities to decide, in the light of the circumstances of the event, what level of policing was necessary in order to ensure the safety and welfare of those attending the concert and the local residents and their property.  It is clear that as a result of the policing arrangements made the concert passed off without serious incident and the Garda are to be complimented for their efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>The cost of the operation was in the region of £150,000.  This figure includes overtime, Saturday and Sunday allowance, travel expenses and subsistence allowance.  It does not include an amount in respect of pay and other costs which would have been incurred by the Garda Síochána in the normal course.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for maintaining law and order in public places, which includes the vicinity of large-scale sporting and recreational events such as major GAA matches, soccer and rugby internationals, concerts and community festivals, is a matter for the Garda Síochána and there are no proposals to change this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the Hamilton Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control, I do, however, intend to introduce legislation later this year in the proposed Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will include measures relating to (a) the control of access to public events, (b) seizure of drink and (c) new licensing arrangements for major music concerts (indoor and outdoor) which will be concerned, <i>inter alia</i>, with the security arrangements for such events.  I will be <Col N="349" /> announcing the details of the new legislation in the usual way in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information he gave to the House. Will he explain why he estimated it cost £150,000 to police this event when a senior member of the Garda Síochána indicated that it cost £250,000?  Will he also indicate whether he agrees with the view that where a major, once-off event is held &mdash; a pop concert or other event &mdash; which will generate major substantial funds and profits for those organising the event, it is reasonable to have legislation which allows the State to impose a levy towards meeting some of the additional policing and security cost to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did ask for brevity, especially at the conclusion of Priority Questions.  Time is exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you would allow me to finish the question.  Would the Minister agree that when a once off event of this nature is held which gives rise to major security costs of an exceptional nature, it is not unreasonable for the State to have the power to charge the promoters of such events a levy so that they contribute a portion of the policing and special security costs?  Would he consider this suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the difference between the figure suggested in the national media and the actual cost.  It would appear that the chief superintendent included costs that would have been incurred by the State in any event such as Garda pay and the use of Garda vehicles.  The net cost is about £150,000.  I can give a breakdown of this figure if need be.  I do not think that it would be wise to charge every organisation involved in promoting a major concert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>I am pleased to hear it.  The general public are entitled to feel that the Garda Síochána are paid from public <Col N="350" /> funds to provide security and protect their property.  I think the Deputy will be pleased with what we have in mind so far as the new licensing arrangements are concerned.  I am satisfied that these will lead to a reduction in the number of gardaí that will be required to deal with these matters in the future.  We will wait and see how this works out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree <Col N="351" /> that the general principles should be that the State should, wherever possible, try to sell its services to meet the cost of delivering services and that in this instance we have the capacity and the expertise to raise considerable earnings from the contract work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate to offer training programmes to members of the public and private security firms.  At present the training college is fully occupied.  In addition, a huge range of in-service training programmes is provided for serving members of the Garda Síochána. Furthermore, English speaking training courses are being made available under the arrangements agreed between the TREVI Ministers who wish to see greater co-operation between existing police forces.  In the recent past members of the Hungarian police force attended the training college to determine if it could be used for this purpose.  It was never the intention to offer training programmes at the training college to members of the public or private security firms.  That is not being recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be worth considering the possibility of providing police force training programmes not to civilians, but to some of the developing countries which may welcome the possibility of having members of their police force trained at Templemore?  Given that the Garda Síochána are undertaking new police activities in a number of trouble spots around the world it could prove to be of benefit to the Garda Síochána, the State and developing countries to establish relationships with these countries and provide that type of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes down to a question of how the resources that have to be made available to meet the cost of training our own recruits in the Garda are allocated. They are fully stretched at present but the English speaking training courses are a step in that direction.  As I have said, <Col N="352" /> representatives of other police forces have attended the college to look at the facilities that are available there.  Perhaps these could be made available either on a contract or <i>ex gratia</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A case could be made for providing them on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis in certain circumstances to emerging police forces in Central and Eastern Europe. However we may put the existing services under enormous strain.  Many people do not understand that in-service training programmes are provided at Templemore on an ongoing basis for serving members of the force.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the problem of discrimination against women by certain clubs in the matter of membership involves issues of such a nature and scope that it is not suitable for resolution in the narrow context of a change in the law governing annual renewal of licences of clubs which are registered for the supply of intoxicating liquor to members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do; indeed it has long since passed.  This question relates to the licensing Act.  The fact that a club discriminates against women in its rules is not listed as one of the grounds on which one may object under section 5 of the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, <Col N="353" /> 1904.  It comes down, therefore, to a question of human behaviour and attitudes which are beginning to change.  I would like to see this problem resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In making an application for a club licence under the 1904 Act, as amended, it is necessary to produce a list of members and the constitution of the club.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept my proposal, would he agree that by implication this amounts to an acceptance on the part of the State &mdash; I accept that the licence is granted by the courts &mdash; that clubs continue to discriminate against women? I urge him to look on the proposal I have made as a neat solution which may lead to the elimination of this ridiculous anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, certificates of registration are renewable each year by the District Court and the renewal of the licence may be objected to by the local Garda superintendent or any resident in the parish. However, one may not object on the grounds suggested by the Deputy.  Consequently, I do not think that is the vehicle that should be used.</P>

Perhaps the Minister would consult his colleague. Would he not accept that some measures would have to be taken if what we were discussing amounted to racial or ethnic discrimination?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister agree that, as we approach the end of this century, it is ridiculous that there are clubs here that exclude women, not just golf clubs but many others?  Would the Minister accept that the primary difficulty is that many, if not all of these, are private clubs, not subject to public law; that they can be confronted only when they enter the public arena and seek a licence from the courts to do certain things?  Would he agree that the issuing of a pub licence, or a licence to sell intoxicating liquor, is the <Col N="355" /> one way in which they can be brought to their senses immediately because the inevitable loss of revenue would hurt them?  If we cannot appeal to their reason would the Minister not agree that there is a duty on Government to have them come to their senses by hurting their pockets?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of view.  We are all at one here in that we would like to see any element of discrimination finally removed.  The Deputy is talking to somebody who believes in that principle. I am very happy to support the unanimous view here.  It is happening but, of course, not sufficiently fast.  There are still some elements in some areas where something must be done.  I will be happy to exert any pressure I can with that in mind.</P>

Would he agree that it was not until other legislation emanated from his Department that we dealt with religious and racial discrimination? Would the Minister agree that discrimination against someone because of their gender is long since out of date and should have ended?  Is the Minister aware and does he accept that some golf and tennis clubs, and others, will never change without the Government bringing forward legislation and having it enacted by this House?

      <P>This review showed that the scheme has been exceptionally successful in enhancing the level and effectiveness of policing activity in the areas involved.  The garda in the 14 districts where the scheme has been operating have become increasingly mobile as a result of the combining of resources and the increased co-ordination in the service provided to local residents by the station parties in each of these districts.  For example, as a result of the scheme, all stations in the areas involved now have guaranteed fixed opening times each day, which was not the case previously.  There has also been greater involvement with community groups such as youth clubs and an increase in visits to schools and to the elderly living alone by the garda concerned.  Indeed, the Garda authorities have informed me that the response from the public in the districts in question has been overwhelmingly favourable, that people in other districts are pressing to have the scheme extended to their communities.</P>

      <P>The public response has been generally favourable.  Certainly, I would like to see it extended.  We are reviewing how we might do so on a phased basis.  Of course, it is expensive and the use of resources might not allow the extension to happen all in one go, but we do have plans to extend the scheme further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 19 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that information in relation to the value of property stolen and recovered is published in the Garda Commissioner's Annual Report on Crime, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The 1991 report will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply is entirely inadequate. If the 1991 Garda Commissioner's Annual Report on Crime is to be published shortly surely the Minister has the relevant figures at his finger tips now.  He should have given the House the information requested.  Will he give the House an estimate?  For example, would the figure be £35 million or £40 million?  I expect the figure would be of that order.  Has the Minister some indication in his files of the exact figure and, if so, will he inform the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a straight question.  Of course I have the provisional figures which would be regarded as confidential until the report has been published.  Therefore, the Deputy must not press me on that.  I will go no further than saying that the figures are in excess of the 1990 figures; in other words, the total value of property stolen in 1991 was greater than that in 1990.  I might add that the total value of property recovered in 1991 was also greater than that recovered in 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reason for the Minister keeping the 1991 figures secret since they are provisional figures and there is never anything secret about provisional figures.  Can he not inform us of the provisional figures for 1991 since he has them?  What is wrong with giving us them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

Perhaps the Minister would indicate to us what is the relevant increase?</P>

      <P>I told the Deputy that I do have the figures but they are provisional and confidential to me at this stage.  If they had to change I would be seen as having told a lie in the House.  I do not want that to happen.  I am telling the Deputy that it is more than £36 million. I do not think we should be wasting time getting into these details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the 1990 figures for the value of property stolen are alarming?  Since this property must be moved and resold &mdash; as happens in the case of a substantial amount of it &mdash; can the Minister tell the House whether he is aware, or whether the Garda Síochána know, of the huge racket involved in the resale of stolen property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree with <Col N="359" /> me that always there has been that difficulty, particularly when one realises that approximately 57 per cent of all crime is in respect of larcenies.  I might add that 40 per cent of all crime was against property in 1990 and that gives some idea of the amount of goods that go missing.  The Larceny Act, 1990, did make quite an advance in tightening up the law in two ways.  First, the organised receiving of stolen property which, of course, generates and encourages further crime, has been dealt with fairly effectively, so that the perpetrators of this corrupting form of activity can be pursued to conviction now with greater efficacy than was the case in the past.  The other major change effected by that Act is that it updates the laws against the practice commonly known as &ldquo;going equipped&rdquo;, that is having articles in one's possession which would have been acquired through larceny.  There has been a big improvement in the law in that area which, hopefully, will have the desired impact.  It is a rather insidious type of crime, very large sums of money are involved, and we must endeavour to deal with it.  This problem can only be dealt with by strengthening the law and the powers of the Garda.  This was done under the Larceny Act, 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>From reading between the lines of the Minister's reply, I take it we are looking at a figure in excess of £40 million, given that the figure in 1989 was £33 million.  I also take it that the Garda have been as ineffective in 1991 in recovering stolen goods as they were during previous years.  Would the Minister not agree that crime barons in this city and elsewhere are living ostentatious lifestyles from the proceeds of crime? Until such time as the Minister decides to tackle that problem and prove to people that crime does not pay, these figures will <Col N="360" /> continue to grow annually.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly raised the important issue as to how we should deal with the proceeds of crime.  Legislation in this regard is top of my priority list.  I should like to see that legislation put on the Statute Book this year.  Those who accumulate and amass fortunes from the proceeds of crime have to be dealt with in a specific way.  This is my top priority and legislation in this regard will be introduced in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish in any way to minimise the significance of this crime, but I ask the Minister to comment on the view that the figures can often be misleading.  The figures for stolen property are based on the insurance value, as given by people, but when the property is recovered its value seems to drop dramatically.  Therefore, there can be a massive disparity between the figures for stolen property and the figures for property which is recovered.  The Garda Commissioner has no control over this issue; he has to work on the figures supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case but we should not downgrade this matter.  A lot of money is involved &mdash; £36 million, plus the increase.  The recovery rate of stolen property is not great.  There is a lot of traffic in this market with people <Col N="362" /> buying and selling stolen goods.  The figure for 1990 of £36 million gives an indication of the amount of bad business taking place in this market.  I would like to think that the law dealing with the proceeds from crime will put a dent in the pockets of these crime barons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact figures.  I wish to read into the record the significant changes which have taken place under the Larceny Act, 1990.  This Act provides that as well as actual possession or control of stolen property the new offence will encompass such activities as undertaking or assisting in the retention of stolen property or its removal, disposal or realisation by another or arranging to do any of those things.  Instead of actual knowledge that the property was stolen, which is the way it was formerly, it will now be sufficient to show knowledge or belief that the property was stolen in order to obtain a conviction.  Of course, the handling of stolen property will in all cases be an arrestable offence.  That is a considerable <Col N="363" /> advance on the position which obtained heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Oral Questions Nos. 10, 28, 65 and 80 and Written Questions No. 87 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that visitors to this country can be subject to criminal attacks and I fully support and encourage the efforts of the Garda and tourist bodies to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that representatives of Dublin Tourism, the Irish Hotels Federation and Bord Fáilte met with the then Minister for Justice in 1983 and presented him with a document containing recommendations on measures which they felt could be taken to safeguard tourists and their property.</P>
      <P>These recommendations were carefully considered and a detailed reply was issued to the regional tourist manager which stated that most of the recommendations had already been, or were being, put into effect; it is certainly not the position, as some have suggested, that these recommendations were not followed up.</P>
      <P>The problem of attacks on tourists is being given special attention by the Garda authorities who work closely with Bord Fáilte and other tourist interests on an ongoing basis to find the most effective ways of dealing with the problem.  A number of measures have been taken including the deployment of additional Garda patrols, such as gardaí on plain clothes duty in areas of high tourist interest.  Arrangements have been made with various bodies for the printing and distribution of leaflets which offer tourists practical advice on such matters as car security and safety of personal belongings.  Advice on personal security at camp sites is now also being included in these leaflets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another measure designed to help in tackling the problem is the provision of the new Garda office which opened in March 1990 in O'Connell Street, Dublin. This serves as a centre for advising tourists on preventive measures which they <Col N="365" /> can take to safeguard themselves and their belongings.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the measures already implemented and the current policing arrangements are adequate to deal with the problem.  They inform me that they have made a number of important detections of this type of crime and that the incidence of such crime is on a downward trend.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there have been calls from time to time for the speedier processing by the courts of cases involving tourists.  However, in considering how the interests of tourists can best be safeguarded in this respect, regard must also be had for certain fundamental rights of the accused such as the right to sufficient time to prepare a defence, to obtain legal aid and in certain cases to opt for trial by judge and jury.  This matter has been carefully considered and special provisions in this regard are included in the Criminal Evidence Bill now before the House.  These provisions allow a tourist who is the victim of a crime to make an immediate statement before a district judge.  This statement may be used as evidence without the necessity for the victim to attend the subsequent trial.  The Bill also provides that the victim may give evidence from abroad by live television link.</P>
    <P>The fact that tourists are, unfortunately, the subject of attack in other countries and that in many cases the risks are far higher than they are here, provides no grounds for complacency.  This country has a reputation, recognised world-wide, for friendliness and hospitality which is second to none.  It is of the greatest importance that we keep it that way by taking whatever measures are necessary to ensure that the tiny minority in our midst who see any apparently soft target as fair game will not have their way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that our tourism industry is worth approximately £1.2 billion each year and that the State receives between £500-£600 million of this, would the Minister not accept that the one Garda information office that has been <Col N="366" /> set up in O'Connell Street is not sufficient to deal with the numbers requiring information, as is evidenced by the number of incidents that take place?  Would the Minister consider, in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, setting up other such offices in this city and in other cities visited by large numbers of tourists each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Garda are very active in areas where there are large congregations of people, particularly tourists.  I am pleased that there is a downward trend in attacks on tourists throughout the country, with a greater decrease in the number of attacks in the Dublin area, and that is encouraging. Obviously the operations of the Garda in co-operation with tourist organisations and the organisers of major events are successful.  Tourists are very vulnerable particularly when they congregate in large numbers.  Great care is taken in the organisation of events, with close co-operation between the relevant tourist centres and the Garda, and we are achieving a better result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is some small improvement in this regard but would the Minister not accept that there should be a second information office in Dublin and possibly an office in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, and every effort made to inform the tourist? Can the Minister confirm that some of the gardaí in the office in Dublin are in a position to speak more than one language?  If not, would he request the relevant authorities to consider training some of the gardaí to speak languages other than English?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say offhand whether the gardaí in the O'Connell Street office are mutli-lingual but I know that considerable technology has been installed in Templemore to deal with language training.  Because of the high academic qualifications of many of the trainee gardaí entering the force, obviously many of them would have other languages.  The suggestion is a good <Col N="367" /> one and I will bring it to the attention of the Garda Commissioner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about any scheme to deal with the matter in that way but a great deal of information is given in the location in O'Connell Street. Leaflets are available on car security and safety, personal belongings, personal security and so on.  The gardaí in that location are very co-operative and the office is very well used and appreciated by the tourists.  Substantial resources have been put into that office and it is proving a success.  Virtually the same number of attacks on tourists takes place in the Dublin metropolitan area as in the rest of the country and that gives an idea of what has to be done.  We must concentrate on areas of greatest demand, one of which is the city, and that is why the office was set up in Dublin.  Lessons are being learned; there is a downward trend in crime and we are happy to record success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not all crime takes place in Dublin.  I accept that there are competing considerations from the defence and prosecution points of view, but given that the Minister does not anticipate speedier trials in the courts can he give some indication whether there will be delays in the introduction of the television link, which is one of the most important ways of assisting tourists to give testimony and to play a part in our courts?  Once the laws are in place how soon will the television link be operative?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider introducing a scheme to provide leaflets to motorists coming off our ferries warning them of the dangers of leaving property exposed in cars in the streets of our cities? Finally, would the Minister accept that what is needed in Dublin is a secure parking compound for touring vans and motor cars?  Tourists with valuables and property are easy targets and there is no place central to the city of Dublin where they can park in safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wandering a little now.  We dealt with the television link on the Criminal Evidence Bill, and money is available to put that procedure into operation.  Contracts are being considered as to when and where these systems will be placed.  The first centre will be located in the Four Courts where a room is being prepared for that purpose, and the system will be expanded to other centres thereafter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Technology is being installed to cater for that.  Obviously there has to be co-operation with studios in other areas to enable the system to be operated.  It was proposed to introduce this system to deal with white collar fraud, but it will also be relevant in assiting tourists.  It is very important that <Col N="369" /> tourists who would be on the move would be enabled to make a statement direct to the district justice shortly after the incident, which could be taken as evidence in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difficulty that arises and that is the reason the link-up is so important.  There is no delay in this regard.  Money is available and priority is being given to a pilot scheme in the Four Courts.  I would be reluctant to provide for the tourist as soon as he comes into this hospitable country a leaflet telling him to watch himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All tourists will not have a bad experience and all of them will not be bound for the metropolitan area.  The incidents are very few when spread across the country.  Tourists are warned to be careful by tourist offices around the country without upsetting the whole tourist industry, which we would not like to see happen.  As regards a city centre compound, the Deputy is raising an issue in which the Minister had an interest in a previous manifestation.  He should not be testing this matter.  However, I hope that something will be done, but it would not be in the Garda area of activity.</P>

      <P>I took the opportunity last week to meet representatives of the traders in the centre city.  I met them on a number of occasions as Minister for the Environment on other related matters, so I was renewing old acquaintances.  They made the point the Deputy has made. They place great store on foot patrols. They regard them as a valuable way of indicating to all those who would seek to pursue crime that there is security on the streets.  I took it on myself to bring this to the attention of the Assistant Commissioner dealing with these matters.  It is an operational thing.  Quite a large number of gardaí are located close to O'Connell Street as there are four or five Garda stations located near there.  The Garda are making the best use of resources but I will pursue this question a bit further.  We will be having the report on urban crime and I hope to take that up specifically with the Commissioner in so far as patrolling is concerned in Dublin city centre streets.  It gives a great feeling <Col N="371" /> of security to citizens, not only to visitors. I support the Deputy's point of view.</P>

      <P>I took special note of what the Deputy had to say on this matter and I am pleased that it worked out well. Careful consideration is given to all visa applications.  It is not generally realised that we have a weekly average of about 300 applications and only about 15 per cent of them are refused.  We try to speed up the process as much as possible.

The Deputy will see that there is quite a small number of visa refusals.  We have to be very careful in this area.  The Deputy can take it from me that no decision is taken on an arbitrary basis. Perhaps it is because I insist that it is not done in that way that there is a slight delay sometimes, but we try to clear in about three weeks the type of visas with which Deputy Fennell is concerned.  I am taking a personal interest in the whole area of visa and immigration control.  I would like to see some changes taking place.</P>

Some very experienced people have been brought in.  The Deputy's question dealt specifically with the use of outside specialists in 1992, but that option has always been available to the Fraud Squad.  They can seek assistance from any specialist service if they require it on any investigation.  It is often forgotten that the vast majority of the gardaí in the Fraud Squad have completed specialist courses in this area and have completed the criminal investigation, Department CID course and that they attend specialist courses not just here but abroad.  One member of the Fraud Squad has an accountancy qualification.  The Fraud Squad are well equipped and also have the authority to employ outside professionals if they wish.

If the Minister would agree to the completion of Second Stage before the end of this session, the Fine Gael Party would co-operate in the establishment of a special committee to start taking Committee Stage in September, so that we could respond urgently to the ongoing increase in crime.  There is a crisis in this area and we must bring the figures down and ensure that robberies and burglaries do not continue to increase.  I ask the Minister to attach some urgency to this. He will have the co-operation of this side of the House if he does so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is a party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons but legislation will be required to enable it to be ratified.</P>
      <P>The basic aim of the convention is a humanitarian one which will make it possible for persons sentenced to imprisonment in a foreign country to transfer to their own country, where the two countries involved are parties to the convention, to serve out their sentences.  The Government are committed to achieving the basic humanitarian purpose of the convention.</P>
      <P>A major difficulty so far as this country is concerned is the potential imbalance between the number who might seek transfer into this country and the number who might seek transfer out.  It is estimated that there are up to 1,000 Irish nationals in foreign prisons, of whom up to 500 are in prisons in Britain, who could qualify for transfer to this country under the convention.  On the other hand, there are no more than 40 or so prisoners in this country who could qualify for transfer out.  While it is impossible to predict accurately the number of Irish nationals in prison abroad who would wish to return here, even low levels of transfer would pose a substantial problem for us because of the lack of spare prison accommodation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that an arrangement should be made to meet the more urgent and deserving cases and my intention, therefore, is to propose that we would ratify the convention on a basis which would limit the excess of inward over outward transfers to small proportions.  I understand that ratification of the convention on such a basis just might be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department already have a very long list of priority legislation on hands <Col N="378" /> and while I am conscious of the need for urgency, and intend to give ratification of the convention as much priority as possible, I cannot at this stage say when the required draft legislation will be finalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Government signed this convention on 20 August 1986 and that despite repeated requests in this House each year since then they have failed to ratify it?  Is the Minister serious about ratifying the convention and can he give a timescale for ratification?  Since he has given detailed statistics, can he say how many prisoners abroad have applied to be transferred to this country?  Does he not agree that the vast majority of those in prison abroad would have families in those countries and would not apply to come here?  Would he also agree that the Irish Commission on Prisoners Overseas have estimated that in the first year of ratification 50 prisoners at most would apply for transfer here and after that fewer than ten per year?  They have studied in detail the likely number of applications from prisoners abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that I was interested in ratifying the convention but that it would require legislation.  If it could be done without legislation, I would do it today.  It has not top priority. I have a few Bills which I want to bring into the House but certainly I would like to see the convention ratified as early as possible, on the basis that we would seek an understanding to limit the excess of inward over outward transfers to small proportions.  That is all we can cater for. I accept that many of the 1,000 prisoners might not wish to be considered.  Their families may not be in this country. Under the terms of the convention, both Governments and the sentenced person have to agree to the transfer.  It does not work unless it is agreed on all sides.  I am interested in seeing this brought about but a large transfer of persons would cause very substantial accommodation problems in our jails.  I should like to see <Col N="379" /> it happen for the most urgent cases as quickly as possible.</P>

If 1,000 prisoners opted to return it would cost the State £34 million.  That has to be a consideration.  There is no suggestion that any of the people being referred to have been wrongly convicted and sentenced in other countries.  Until such time as we solve our domestic overcrowding problems within our jails the State is not in a position fully to implement this convention and we should not pretend otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £182,942,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1992, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission and for payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This year's Estimate is for a gross amount of £475 million.  As I have indicated on previous occasions, this represents only a portion of the overall expenditure of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In addition, my Department spend well more than £1,200 million each year from the EC budget for the benefit of Irish farmers and traders and, on average, another £500 million funded from borrowings on the intervention purchase, processing and storage of agricultural commodities.  The position at the end of 1991 was that intervention stocks amounted to 247,000 tonnes of beef, 292,000 tonnes of dairy products and 84,000 tonnes of cereals.</P>
      <P>The year 1991 was again a difficult year for the economy generally and for the agricultural sector in particular.  I am glad to say, however, that in recent months, some positive indications have emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It now seems likely that the volume of <Col N="436" /> GNP grew by about 1.5 per cent in 1991. Our export performance was particularly impressive and this combined with improved earnings from services and increased EC transfers, produced an external current account surplus of £1,200 million or 5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The volume of GNP is set to expand rapidly in 1992 but is unlikely to exceed 2.5 per cent.  This growth rate is based on an improvement in both domestic and external demand.</P>
    <P>Good news for the overall economy is good news for the farm economy.  In recent months, there have been a number of positive developments for the farm sector.  The market balance for the main dairy products has improved, and EC stocks of butter and skim milk powder have declined.  The price of milk has risen in consequence, and average milk prices in 1992 should be higher than in 1991.</P>
    <P>There is also expected to be a rise in world trade in beef during 1992.  In particular, a more buoyant Middle East market is expected with imports forecast to increase.  The expected improvement in the supply and demand position should mean that prices will be at least held at 1991 levels during 1992.  This is a very positive development towards stabilised price levels.  Pigmeat production and prices are expected to increase in 1992.</P>
    <P>Overall, then, I would expect that farm income levels in 1992 should be somewhat improved by comparison to 1991.  I expect also that the level of direct subsidies will increase in 1992 following increases in the rates and scope of payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In addition, the various rural development measures and schemes, including Leader and the national rural development programme, should strengthen the income and employment situation in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The recent outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations has ended the uncertainty that had existed in the agricultural sector for more than 18 months.  This should help to stabilise farm incomes and enable the agriculture and food sector to continue <Col N="437" /> to contribute to the overall wellbeing of our national economy.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that the economic environment within which farmers will operate will become increasingly competitive. The challenges which this presents must be faced.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Reform</i> provides that a new development programme for the agricultural and food sector should be negotiated between the Department and the farm organisations. I am glad to say that work on this is proceeding, taking account of the Common Agricultural Policy reform decisions.  The Culliton report recommended that a development plan for the food industry should be drawn up by an expert group.  I have recently set up such a group including farmers, manufacturers, retailers and the State sector, and have asked them to report before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There can be few who are unaware at this stage of the importance of the agrifood sector to Ireland.  Accounting as it does for about £6 billion or almost one-third of our total manufacturing output, and making a significant contribution to employment and our positive balance of trade, it is easily the single most important industry in the economy.  It is important, therefore, for the well-being of the whole country that the industry is given every opportunity and encouragement to achieve increased growth and employment.</P>
    <P>The food industry is experiencing major changes both at national and international levels.  It is steeling itself to face the many challenges being presented by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, GATT, the environment, the safety of food and the advent of the Single Market.  Food producers and processors in Ireland and elsewhere are having to answer key questions on what, when and how food should be produced in the future.  One thing is abundantly clear, the food industry cannot continue as heretofore producing commodity goods for which there are no markets with an over-reliance on intervention.  The future lies in the marketplace.  The industry must <Col N="438" /> develop an effective market driven policy, which is fully conscious and sensitive to the demands of the consumer.</P>
    <P>It is consumers who are setting the future agenda for the food industry.  They are becoming more sophisticated in their tastes and preferences and are becoming increasingly interested in how their food is produced.  They are more aware of the environmental impact of food production at all levels of the food chain and are placing greater emphasis on quality and hygiene.  If Irish food companies are to survive in the marketplace, they must learn to satisfy these demands.  It is interesting to note, however, that the Culliton report sees this increased level of consumer awareness as an opportunity for Irish food producers to promote Ireland's unique position as a producer of high quality, environmentally friendly and safe food, while at the same time placing some constraints on those countries more involved in intensive production.</P>
    <P>The Irish food industry must prepare itself to take full advantage of this opportunity. We must adopt a truly European focus which is market driven, which may well entail alliances such as joint ventures and partnerships which can lengthen the reach of small companies and shorten their learning curve.  We must invest much more financial and human resources in marketing and research and development.  Less than 1 per cent of net output in the case of the food, drink and tobacco sector is currently invested in this area.  This is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>There is an extensive range of European Community schemes and programmes promoting R &amp; D which would have interest for the Irish food industry. Programmes such as Flair and Eclair, which are normally 50 per cent funded by the European Community, provide ideal opportunities for Irish companies to become directly involved in R &amp; D projects which would otherwise prove too costly.  Sadly, participation by Irish food companies in such programmes, however, has been disappointing in the past but I would hope that this will be rectified in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Government policy over the last number of years has focused on developing market-led, internationally competitive food companies.  Our approach and that of the grant-giving State agencies has been to support those companies who fit or have the potential to fit this mould.  The Government will be continuing with this policy in an effort to move away from bulk production of intervention products.  Ultimately, however, success lies in the hands of the industry itself.  It must listen and respond positively to the needs of the consumer if it is to achieve its full potential.</P>
    <P>I can hardly speak on agriculture without referring to Common Agricultural Policy reform.  I spoke in this House at some length on this subject just two weeks ago so I do not propose to dwell overlong on it at this stage.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that the reforms agreed will influence the production decisions of farmers for the foreseeable future.  The reform will also influence the management decisions of our agribusinesses.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements, direct payments, headage and premia, to Irish farmers will be in the order of £650 million in the first full year after reform. I am sure in these circumstances that Deputies and farmers generally will welcome the user-friendly approach to those schemes which I announced last week.  I have made arrangements to have a copy deposited in the pigeonholes for each Deputy and Senator.</P>
    <P>While the original Commission proposals could have involved net losses of some £94 million, the Department's initial quantification of the reform package is that there will be a net gain in the order of £70 million for farmers compared with the 1991 situation.  There will also be a substantial consumer gain, estimated by independent economists, at £100 million per annum.  I have already had a meeting with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, to set in train a mechanism that will try to ensure that the gains will <Col N="440" /> be reflected in the shopping baskets of her consumers.</P>
    <P>These estimates do not of course take account of productivity gains or changes in production systems which farmers will make in response to the new situation. Neither do they take account of the new incentive for the beef sector to become more market oriented.  The foundation has now been laid for the future.  It is now up to our farmers and agriculture based industry to take up the challenge and gain access to markets both inside and outside the Community.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the durability of the compensatory arrangements. While practically all sides agree that the compensatory arrangements are more than adequate, some concern has been expressed as to whether such supports can be maintained in the future.  This concern relates mainly to what might arise from the GATT negotiations.  In an ideal situation, it would have been better if the two sets of negotiations had been finalised in tandem.  However, the GATT negotiations became somewhat bogged down and when it was clear that there would not be an early agreement, the Community had to decide if it should proceed with Common Agricultural Policy reform independently.  It was decided to press ahead with Common Agricultural Policy reform and I fully supported that decision.</P>
    <P>It appears to me now that the completion of the reform negotiations has given the Community an advantage in the Uruguay Round negotiations.  We have made clear to the other 90 or so countries involved in those negotiations that we are prepared to put our house in order.  It is now up to them to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Another point to bear in mind is that had the GATT negotiations finished ahead of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy the results would have had to be taken into account in the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations.  Now the situation is reversed.  The results of Common Agricultural Policy reform cannot be ignored by any side in the GATT negotiations. We have firm assurances from the Com- <Col N="441" /> missioner that the necessary budgetary resources will be provided and that he will defend the compensatory payments in the GATT context.  In any event, I cannot see any of my colleagues in the Council allowing that agreement to be unravelled in the context of the GATT negotiations.  I certainly will not stand for any such occurrence.</P>
    <P>One other issue I would like to mention is the criticism of so-called &ldquo;cheque in the post&rdquo; farming.  By lowering support prices for the major products, Common Agricultural Policy reform has made Community produce more competitive on world markets and more accessible to consumers within the Community. However, there is no point in trying to make farm produce more competitive if at the same time you drive farmers out of business.  Compensation for the decreased prices is necessary and has been provided.  The added value of direct payments to farmers is that the money goes directly to them and does not get caught up in or grabbed by intermediate services or middle-men.</P>
    <P>It has to be remembered that one of the aims of Common Agricultural Policy reform is to keep a sufficient number of farmers on the land.  I fully subscribe to this aim.  Many of our farmers are operating at subsistence level or below in terms of income from their farms.  They make ends meet by their off-farm activities but sadly there is not enough alternative full-time employment available in rural areas. I hope the recently announced Teagasc small farm development programme, which is available free of charge, will be of considerable benefit to this sector.  The direct payment system will, at least, provide such farmers with some guaranteed income.  Of course, if Common Agricultural Policy reform had not taken the direction of substituting, to an extent, direct payment for market price supports, budgetary pressures within the Community would have led to increasing levels of price reduction without compensation. This would in the short term have had a devastating effect on our rural communities.</P>
    <P>In further recognition of the role of <Col N="442" /> farmers as protectors of the environment, the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures recently approved include a substantial agri-environment programme. This is designed to compensate farmers who are prepared to adopt farming practices which are particularly environmentally friendly.  When the details are finalised at EC level, this programme should enable us to implement a more comprehensive agri-environment scheme than our present rather limited environmentally sensitive areas scheme.</P>
    <P>The accompanying measures also include a scheme for early retirement for farmers which I expect to be of some benefit here in Ireland, though here again the detailed application measures will take some time to finalise.  We will be having detailed discussions with the European Commission when we are drawing up specific national programmes for these two measures.  In these discussions we will, of course, be highlighting matters of concern to this country so as to ensure that we can, in practice, gain maximum benefit from the schemes.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the individual sectors of agriculture, I am glad to note that in recent weeks cattle prices have firmed up.  This increase in prices, which is so vital to the viability of the winter fattener, was influenced by the successful approaches to the European Commission to buy more realistic quantities into intervention.</P>
    <P>The broad thrust of the Commission's reform measures in the beef sector is to get EC supports directly to the producer and reduce reliance on Community intervention. While the Community's commitment to underpinning producer income remains, it is very clear that our Community partners will not allow a situation to continue indefinitely whereby intervention remains the major outlet for our beef.  In future, the Irish beef sector will be expected to make greater use of commercial outlets.</P>
    <P>In the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations I vigorously resisted proposals which did not entail reasonable access to intervention as a means of supporting the market.  Given the extreme <Col N="443" /> difficulties which have confronted the beef sector over the past two and a half years, arising largely from the impact of BSE and the Gulf War, it is vital that intervention remains as a basic means of market support.  Nevertheless, the intervention system is now to change as a result of the Common Agricultural Policy reform, and operators will have to make greater efforts at commercial marketing than they have done up to now.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by the decision of two of the country's major co-operatives &mdash; Avonmore and Dairygold &mdash; to enter the beef sector.  The Irish beef sector, by virtue of its reliance on intervention, has been somewhat weak on promotion and marketing.  The arrival of these new entrants should provide the industry with much improved access to supermarket outlets in the United Kingdom and in continental Europe.  The agricultural coops have demonstrated that they are international in outlook and that they have the expertise and the commitment needed to compete very well with the major international food companies.  The fact that they are not single product companies &mdash; they have an involvement in both the dairy and meat processing sectors &mdash; is a decided advantage since their wide range of products will appeal to European retailers.</P>
    <P>The target of beef producers and processors must be to concentrate Irish marketing efforts not only on the UK but also on opportunities in continental EC markets.  Irish vacpac beef exports within the EC have been growing steadily.  Our beef exports to quality continental outlets are receiving renewed stimulus from the launching of the CBF beef quality assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>Even with a successful reorientation of exports towards EC outlets, the pattern of a heavy end year kill means that we will still require access to third country markets.  These markets are &mdash; Deputies will appreciate &mdash; more volatile than those within the Community.  They are buffeted by political as well as economic factors, particularly so in the last two years.  For 1992, prospects are brighter <Col N="444" /> as the work put into convincing third countries of the wholesomeness of Irish beef bears fruit.</P>
    <P>By retaining last year's significant increase in the grant-in-aid for CBF at £1.5 million, the Government are displaying their confidence in the contribution CBF makes to Ireland's effort to become more market-led, particularly in the beef sector.  Industry is playing its part by maintaining a voluntary contribution while producers, through levies, will continue to provide a major part of CBF finances.  The new board of CBF have a wide range of expertise in the beef sector and in marketing quality Irish agricultural products abroad.  They have a challenging task ahead.  Ireland's reputation as a quality food producer is only as good as the last sale.  A reputation cannot be bought.  It can only be earned day by day in the market-place.</P>
    <P>Major developments have taken place in the sheep sector over the past seven years.  There has been a rapid increase in the national flock from 4.4 million in 1985 to a current record level of 9 million head. Access to the French market has resulted in a profitable return to both producers and the industry as a whole.  Slaughterings for both the home and export markets came to 4.2 million head in 1991, reflecting an increase of 9 per cent on the previous year's level.</P>
    <P>In the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations on the sheep sector, I succeeded in maintaining existing limits of 500 and 1,000 ewes in normal and disadvantaged areas, respectively, for the purpose of payment of the premium.  Payment of 50 per cent of the premium above those levels will continue, though within the individual producer limits.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the variable premium and the abolition of the clawback on sheepmeat exports from Britain in 1992 will result in greater competition on the French market.  Clearly, the future development of the industry as a result of this and the Common Agricultural Policy reform will depend on a greater emphasis on the quality of produce and market returns than heretofore.  The sheep market, always liable to fluctuations, has <Col N="445" /> been going through a low price period in recent months, a period when we could be thankful for the existence of the EC premium to compensate producers.  I am glad to note a very recent up-turn in lamb prices.</P>
    <P>As for the pig sector, I am happy to report that the major development plan for the pigmeat industry, announced in 1987, is nearing completion and is proving successful.  All of the new slaughtering and processing plants envisaged under the programme are now operational, as are a number of downstream processing plants.  Some further processing plants are either in the course of construction or at an advanced planning stage.  Investment of over £90 million, which includes substantial Exchequer and EC aid, has already been approved.</P>
    <P>The success of the programme to date can be measured in the increasing levels of Irish pigmeat exports which in 1991 were worth over £130 million &mdash; the highest export level ever.  The programme has also helped to stimulate expansion in pig numbers which now stand at 1.16 million pigs.  Pig throughput has also increased very substantially, and in 1991, reached about 2.7 million pigs and it is expected that the target of three million pigs a year envisaged under the programme will soon be reached and even exceeded.  As regards pig prices, these are now at a reasonably good level, having risen steadily since last autumn and the prospects for the industry in the second half of the year are positive.</P>
    <P>Turning to the cereals sector, it has been clear for some years now that the large increase in Community cereals production and in intervention stocks could not continue.</P>

      <P>I interrupt to advise the House that the Minister has exceeded his time.  I appreciate the importance of what the Minister has to say and I would just like the House to agree that the excess time be deducted from the other Government speakers before he concludes.  I appreciate that Deputy Ferris is anxious to make his contribution by 5 o'clock and I am <Col N="446" /> assuming that the Minister will conclude by 4.20 p.m.  Is that proposal agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of other Government speakers, I will take responsibility for docking the time when the time comes.  I will endeavour to allow my colleague, Deputy Ferris, to get in before 5 o'clock.</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform outcome represents a very striking improvement on what the Commission had originally proposed.  In particular, the price cut of 29 per cent is less severe than the 35 per cent originally proposed, while the compensation arrangements have been substantially improved for both the price reduction and for set-aside.  While the setting of the threshold price &mdash; the minimum import price &mdash; at £40 a tonne above the target price will ensure that our production control measures are not undermined by increased imports of cereals.  In addition, the discontinuation of all co-responsibility levies, with effect from the end of this month, will benefit cereal producers to the tune of about £16 million this year.</P>
      <P>A further benefit will accrue to producers under the new regime as compared to the present system.  At present, if the Community maximum guaranteed quantity is exceeded, all member states are penalised.  Under the new regime, the Community will be divided into regional base areas and that is important for Ireland, as Ireland is considered as one region under the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>I would like now to turn to a number of specific subheads.  Under subhead B the Government are committed to ensuring that Teagasc have the necessary resources to enable them to continue to provide an effective and integrated service to the agriculture and food sectors. This commitment was demonstrated most recently in the 1992 budget when a special allocation of £1 million was provided for a small farmers' advisory programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ERAD, under subhead C.2, are allocated a budget of £42.75 million.  This is a slight increase in the out-turn for 1991 and is indicative of the ongoing commitment <Col N="447" /> to the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes.  The TB eradication scheme has had a long history.  This four-year term concluded in April this year. In accordance with the undertaking under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, I initiated discussions with farming and veterinary organisations to review progress under ERAD and devise an agreed consensus on the bovine TB programme for the next four years.  In the course of these discussions which have been extremely comprehensive, the thrust of the programme has largely been agreed with the exception of a small number of issues.</P>
    <P>However, the most important development is that the EC Commission has indicated a willingness to provide substantial support for the programme of the order of £20 million per year or £60 million over three years.  It is stipulating certain conditions which it considers important for the efficiency of the programme.  These conditions will cause a certain amount of disruption but I think the central issue should not be forgotten. We need a strong stable programme for TB eradication, the Community is willing to put significant financial resources behind such a programme and the cost for farmers and taxpayers can be reduced.  We cannot afford to dither over such an offer and I think the time has come for the interests involved to come to a final decision.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the 1992 allocation for the beef tribunal is £1 million. Expenditure this year is obviously in excess of that amount.  The final cost of the tribunal will obviously depend on the length of time required to complete its work.  This, Deputies will appreciate, is a matter which can be determined only by the tribunal itself.  It will be necessary for me to come forward with a Supplementary Estimate later in the year to deal with that subhead in particular.</P>
    <P>In so far as management and control in the beef sector are concerned &mdash; and there is concern about this &mdash; I can say that, following this year's budget in which £1 million was allocated for the upgrading <Col N="448" /> of intervention control of activities in the beef sector, significant progress has been made in recent months.  Within the intervention unit of my Department, a new beef field operations division has been established under the direct control of a senior superintending veterinary inspector. Full control for the operations at plant level of intervention activities in the beef sector will reside within this division and it will be staffed by veterinary inspectors and senior agricultural officers working from head office.  In addition, some 20 agricultural officers will be in place in meat plants throughout the country in time for expected intervention intake in September.  Increased training activities for officers, better communication facilities with head office and new contractual relations with beef producers will be in place very shortly.</P>
    <P>I shall be continuing to upgrade controls in the beef sector but would stress the primary obligation for ensuring conformity with the relevant regulations and contracts rests with the processor and the deboning contractors.  I intend reviewing the existing deboning contract to ensure that any ambiguities which may exist at the moment are eliminated, so that both sides to the deboning contract will be clear as to their respective rights, duties and obligations.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 minutes I have endeavoured to give Deputies a brief account of the current situation in the agriculture and food sector.  I have explained also the uses to which money voted to my Department will be put.  There are many such uses, but they all have one central aim.  That aim is to give maximum help to farmers and the food industry to adapt successfully to a rapidly changing European Community in a rapidly changing world.  Adaptation is feasible; the plentiful evidence of growing expertise and initiative in farming and food processing is evidence of that, and gives me confidence also that we can create in this country a farm and food sector to match any in the world.</P>
    <P>I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the Minister's <Col N="449" /> own admission that this Estimate is not a true Estimate.  The item for the cost of the beef tribunal alone is seriously wrong.  The figure mentioned in the Estimate is £1 million, yet in recent days we have been told that the cost to date could be as high as £40 million.  It is difficult to estimate the overall cost of the tribunal because it appears to be only about halfway through.  The major players in the inquiry, that is the politicians who were in office and were responsible for the payment of export refunds have yet to appear before the tribunal.  The Estimate is incorrect.  I should have expected that a figure bearing some relation to the facts would be put in.  It is not sufficient to write in an estimate of £1 million when the cost will be at least £40 million and perhaps £60 million or £70 million.  The House is entitled to be informed in this matter.  The House is discussing the Agriculture and Food Estimate but we do not even have an estimate &mdash; we have just a token figure.  When the overall figure will be approximately £40 million to £60 million it is not good enough to present such an inadequate figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was considerable speculation that the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy talks would be beneficial for Ireland.  That was two weeks ago.  The Fine Gael Party reserved judgment and said that we would have to wait and see what happened.  I made the point that the whole strategy adopted by the Government and the Minister was high risk.  Lo and behold, in the past two days it has transpired that the strategy is indeed high risk and that the figures put before us here two weeks ago may not be the figures that will emerge.  There have been developments even in the past 24 hours that are quite frightening.  It is found that the President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, is having to fight a rearguard action in his effort to justify what was agreed in the talks on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, for instance, feels that the amount of money being granted under the reform proposals is not acceptable.  He is thereby in direct conflict not only with his own two Commissioners <Col N="450" /> but also with his Minister for Agriculture.  It is obvious that the countries who are net contributors to the Community budget believe that the EC cannot afford the compensatory measures.  That is an area from which we did not expect an attack.  In recent times we have really been dependent on Mr. Delors in many respects.  One issue, of course, is the £6 billion hoped for if the Maastricht Treaty is ratified by the 11 member states.  The other issue is the ratification of the Common Agricultural Policy agreement by the Finance Ministers of the Community.  Recent indications are that the agreement may not be ratified.  We have to consider that we may have to revise our figures and our estimates downwards.</P>
    <P>Much more serious is the threat that I have mentioned in the House repeatedly in the past 12 to 18 months, the ongoing GATT negotiations.  The Minister referred to those negotiations at some length in his statement.  The GATT negotiations were always highly dangerous from Ireland's point of view.  I notice that in the Minister's statement today he is now casting some doubt over the validity of the compensatory payments that we were told so much about in recent weeks. The Minister talks about the durability of the compensatory arrangements.  In the past 24 hours we have experienced the Americans digging in their heels.  The Americans say that they will not accept the compensatory payments, subsidies or direct payments &mdash; whatever we might wish to call them &mdash; and that if the EC does not reduce them the Americans will embark on a trade war involving agricultural commodities.  If that trade war transpired it could blow the kernel of the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals to smithereens.  If the compensatory payments are taken out of the Common Agricultural Policy agreement there is nothing in the agreement for Ireland other than huge losses, because of the removal of support systems such as intervention and market export refunds. The deal was that farmers would receive compensation to make up for the loss of market support mechanisms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> What may well happen, what is tending to happen and what the Americans are demanding will happen is that the compensatory payments will be eliminated or, if not eliminated, considerably reduced.  Ireland stands to get the worst of both worlds.  If that happens the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations will have been a disaster.  By the Minister's own admission today we can have very little confidence in the outcome of those discussions.  Two weeks ago it seemed that the outcome would be reasonably okay, although, as I did say, they were high-risk proposals.  The proposals have now become a much higher risk.</P>
    <P>The GATT negotiations have two highly dangerous aspects, one is the resistance to compensatory payments, about which I have just spoken, not just by the Americans &mdash; they are the only people who have spoken so far &mdash; but we can be sure that the Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians and South Americans will all adopt the same attitude because they resent our system of supports within the EC.  They will support the Americans and, indeed, 50 or 60 other third countries could also support the Americans.  It may well be that the European Community will not be able to maintain its present position.  The Minister's statement in relation to compensatory measures is frightening.</P>
    <P>When I say that the EC may not be able to sustain its present position I am talking about the onslaught resulting from the American election in November. From now until then the Americans will demand that compensatory measures will be either toned down or totally removed and they will have a great deal of support. If the GATT negotiations are concluded before November we will be in deep trouble; even if they are not concluded we could still be in very serious trouble because the incoming president &mdash; whether it is President Bush or, perhaps, Ross Perot &mdash; will see fit to maintain that <Col N="452" /> line.  That is the danger and there is also a danger within the Community.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Andriessen, Commissioner for Competition, will be negotiating on behalf of the EC; those of us who know him realise that he does not have any sympathy for subsidies, grants or compensatory payments.  He comes from a country where farmers and agri-business are self-sufficient.  He is a Dutch man and, like the Danes, the Dutch are so highly organised in the agricultural sphere that they can get by without compensatory payments.  He is the chief negotiator of the European Community and we will not get much sympathy from him.  We have already had this onslaught by the United States, other countries have yet to wade in and the Commissioner's sympathies will certainly not be with us in this regard.  Indeed, I suspect that a number of other Commissioners have very similar views to those of Commissioner Andriessen.</P>
    <P>The second element which worries me in the GATT negotiations is the demand by third countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada and South America for access for Community markets.  They will fight tooth and nail to get into those markets and, if they succeed to any significant extent over and above what they have at present, it will be a very serious problem for us.  Most of these countries can produce beef and grain at half the price of ours because of the size of their farms and their climate.  New Zealand can produce milk at one third the price at which we produce it.  If there is increased access &mdash; and I suspect that there will &mdash; by these and other third countries we will have an additional and significant problem.</P>
    <P>We certainly cannot afford a trade war, which was threatened today, because of the decisions taken under the recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Americans have already drawn up a hit list &mdash; as it has been referred to in the media &mdash; which would mean that Irish liqueurs, in particular <Col N="453" /> Baileys, by far the biggest seller, which makes something like £100 million per annum for this country would be banned in the US.  Casein also has a earning capacity for Ireland in the United States of £125 million per year.  We also export soft cheeses to the United States, it is a fast growing industry and it is very hard to put a figure on it but it would probably be in the region of £60 or £70 million per annum.  We simply cannot afford a trade war.  As individuals we cannot retaliate although the Community might be able to retaliate slightly by banning cereal substitutes.</P>
    <P>Many countries in the Community are very vulnerable to reprisals in a trade war.  What would the French do if their wine was not accepted by the United States?  What would the Danes do if their bacon was not accepted?  What would the Dutch do if their cheeses were not accepted?  What would the Italians do if their spaghetti or pizzas were not accepted?  They would all be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The Americans have a very strong hand so, far from describing the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations as superb or a magnificent victory for Ireland, my attitude all along has been to wait and see the outcome of the GATT negotiations because they will supersede anything decided in the Common Agricultural Policy reform talks.  There is a very serious risk that we could lose heavily both ways because the Community has reduced our support mechanisms and compensatory payments may not be forthcoming.  It would be a disastrous outcome for us if we had the worst of both worlds.  It is frightening because at present, as we all know, we depend on market supports to get rid of something like 60 per cent of our main commodities, beef and milk, in storage or intervention. If that support goes and if we find if difficult to sell because of increasing competition from abroad &mdash; when I say &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; I mean outside the Community &mdash; we will be in a very dangerous situation. I do not think that people here <Col N="454" /> realise that 60 per cent of our product is in intervention; they do not realise that we fail to sell 60 per cent of what we produce.  Our track record indicates that we will not be able to sell it in the future unless we buck up considerably.  It is a tremendous challenge but our performance to date indicates that we are not good at marketing.  If we cannot sell we will obviously have a real problem on our hands.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the GATT negotiations, Mr. Dunkel, is not sympathetic to compensatory payments.  He supports the Americans and holds the view that such payments constitute unfair competition. We should never have agreed to a reduction in the price support mechanisms until the GATT negotiations had been concluded.  At least they should have been decided in tandem because we are now exposed to the worst of both worlds.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and his predecessors, have spopken optimistically for the last two or three years about improved prospects for selling our beef and cattle to North Africa and the Middle East.  What happened?  Nothing.  I do not think people are being very honest in this regard.  I was recently informed by a reliable source that the Iranian trade will not be as easy to regain as we had been led to believe.</P>
    <P>Even with export refunds we are still finding it hard to sell beef to Iran at a competitive price.  The Australians can sell unsubsidised beef at a more competitive price than we can even with subsidies from the European Community. That is frightening.  I learned this in recent times from contacts within the trade.</P>
    <P>The reason we have not been able to find markets for our beef in the Middle East and North Africa is not the mad cow disease, the Gulf War or any scare that may have been given in recent years but rather that our prices are not competitive enough even with the aid of export refunds.  I would like to see people make <Col N="455" /> the position clear and, if what I am saying is true, they should verify it and, if it is not true, contradict me.</P>
    <P>While I have great confidence in CBF personnel &mdash; I welcome the fact that additional moneys are to be made available for that body &mdash; I still think they do not have the capacity to sell all our beef. More money needs to be provided for our marketing effort.  We can support it in other ways as well.  At Foreign Affairs Question Time last week I mentioned one specific example, I have seen the New Zealanders in operation at first hand and when I say New Zealanders I mean the New Zealand diplomatic corps.  They are not career diplomats; rather they are appointed to the diplomatic service and their primary function is to promote their goods overseas, in particular their agricultural produce, be it butter or lamb.  On the other hand, our diplomatic service is just that, a diplomatic service.  I wonder if we can afford to continue in this vein.</P>
    <P>We need people in high places who can make contacts, lobby and do much good for the country.  This may not go down well with those in Iveagh House but I am not too concerned about them or about the people in Agriculture House for that matter.  We never worry about the people in Iveagh House because they do not have any confidence in their ability when it comes to doing something good for this country.</P>

      <P>In the short time remaining to me I will try to conclude my contribution but, if necessary, I will come back tomorrow.  Before speaking on the Agriculture Estimate before the House today I would like to take this opportunity to make a few points relating to Common Agricultural Policy reform. The Minister touched on this matter in what was a wide ranging speech.  Despite all the criticism the Common Agricultural Policy reform package has been positively received by most of the interested farming organisations.  The Government must now deliver on all the promises that have been made.  In particular, they must deliver on the promise to put cheques in the post and to publish user friendly documentation.  Our aim should be to pay people grants to compensate them for the drop in the price of the product.</P>
      <P>The future of agriculture lies in our own hands.  We must plan for the future now taking full and proper account of the changes that are being made.  For example, the Culliton review group in their report have already called for the publication of a national food plan and this must be seen as the first priority of the Government.  For years we have been calling for the publication of a proper plan for the development of the food industry which would include all the relevant interests.  The essential ingredients of such a plan would include processing, efficiency of production, pricing of product, quality, diversification, green agriculture, downstream industry, rural development and value added products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the European Community will continue to help us in developing a more rounded approach to our main industry if we are serious.  In other words, this is not the time to criticise or abuse one another or to pat one another on the back &mdash; that would be a waste of time &mdash; because we cannot say <Col N="457" /> what the outcome of the GATT negotiations will be.  It is essential, therefore, that we unite to make sure that it is to our satisfaction.  The outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations should form the basis of ensuring that the GATT negotiations are successful.</P>
    <P>In relation to the by-products of the milk industry about which we are all concerned, producers of Irish cream liqueurs and other products should not be intimidated and should have confidence in the future despite the fact that the Americans are waving the big stick.  I am particularly interested in the Avonmore by-product, Miloko, which is produced in my own constituency and which has been the subject of disparaging remarks on the part of the Americans in relation to the efforts being made to have it sold on the American market.  The future of Irish agriculture starts now and all the essential interests must be prepared to work together.</P>
    <P>In relation to Common Agricultural Policy reform, various mechanisms have been reformed to allow us achieve our aims.  In examining this matter we should recall what happened in the past with regard to the mechanisms that were then in place and which have been defended by some speakers.  For example, during the past 20 years thousands of people who were engaged in agriculture have left the land.  As against this the owners of intervention companies, the suppliers of deep freeze outfits, the owners of shipping companies and storage companies became millionaires.  On the other hand, there were very few millionaires on the land apart from those who had large quotas.</P>
    <P>We are still waiting for Commissioner MacSharry to deal with the other aspect of his brief, rural development.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Hyland, has special responsibility for this area. We have already touched on its importance but having regard to the fact that <Col N="458" /> thousands of farmers are being forced to leave the land it is essential that the Government emphasise the importance to the European Commission of a comprehensive rural development programme for rural Ireland.  We await the Commissioner's proposals in this regard. He should receive our support in his fight to have such a programme introduced.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party remain committed to the principle of European union and are more than aware of the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package in developing a proper food industry.  As I said already, we are anxious that the European Commission introduce a rural development programme to assist rural societies.</P>
    <P>The Agriculture Estimate before the House today illustrates the Government's determination at times to under-resource essential agri-services.  These are imperative if we are to develop a viable indigenous agri-business.  According to Government figures, some 5,000 farmers leave the land each year.  In the present economic climate the only options available to them are to either emigrate or join the dole queue.  Therefore, there has never been a greater need than there is now for Government investment in research and development in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate before the House today we note that the Government have reduced their funding on research.  In the case of Teagasc, in particular, the Government having been scaling down their actions, functions and role, leaving the agency with no choice but to severely rationalise their services, forcing them to sell part of their property and offices nationwide.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, some 5,000 farmers leave the land annually resulting from uneconomic holdings.  There is a very great need for an independent research agency to advise small farmers. I am pleased to note that henceforth Teagasc will provide this service to small farmers.  This is an essential part of their <Col N="459" /> function.  However, with the new management of Teagasc, bearing in mind cutbacks and rationalisation of their services, they could now be described as a self-funding consultancy agency rather than a national advisory service.  Their advisers now operate on what is described as a commission basis, so that only farmers with a reasonable income can afford to avail of their services.  I am pleased to note that some account is being taken of small farmers' needs.  The Government are being particularly shortsighted in restricting funding to Teagasc even if it would appear there has been a slight increase overall in their budget. Now is the appropriate time for Government investment in research and development into alternative methods of farming with no further cutbacks.</P>
    <P>At times the Government have continued to delay approval of the re-classification of designated and disadvantaged areas.  Under the Structural Funds allocation areas classified as disadvantaged will be entitled to financial assistance. The Government, in delaying approval, have not honoured their commitment to reclassify existing disadvantaged areas and have excluded some that should have been included in the past.  It is essential that all regions of the country in need of re-classification in one form or another must be effected without further delay in order to finance activities in such difficult areas.</P>
    <P>In this revised Estimate I notice that the Government are prepared to allocate a meagre £69,000 to research and testing under the disease eradication programme. That paltry sum must be reviewed in the light of the fact that 36,832 reactors to bovine TB and 3,482 reactors to brucellosis were identified and removed last year.  Those cases resulted in the locking up of many of our 172,000 herds nationwide.  It is time we acknowledged that the present method of testing and research is totally inadequate to deal with the nature and scale of our bovine <Col N="460" /> TB problems.  What are described as the realistic expectations of the ERAD scheme have led to two main conclusions being published by the board.  Their report states that largely because of a significant wildlife reservoir of bovine TB &mdash; which cannot be addressed effectively without a vaccine of TB in badgers and/or cattle, together with the absence of a laboratory-based diagnostic test for bovine TB, along with a computerised movement permit system &mdash; bovine TB cannot be eradicated in Ireland in the short to medium term.  This is the opinion of the board of ERAD, a very serious assertion on the part of any Government body.  Their report also states that mainly because of a range of socio-economic limitations associated with the testing arrangements, cattle movement, commitment and manpower resources, as well as the control of badgers, under this programme Ireland's persistently high bovine TB levels cannot be reduced significantly within a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>Based on those conclusions it would appear that the present intensive ERAD programme should be replaced by a &ldquo;least-cost, least-hardship&rdquo; control programme in the short to medium term, which could be undertaken in a cost-effective manner by way of a bovine TB licensing scheme.  ERAD propose that a number of the current disease eradiction measures be discontinued, which should result in savings.  In addition, they propose that disease levies be reduced to the level considered necessary by those concerned to provide an adequate compensation system jointly funded by farmers and the State.  Ultimately it is recommended that the current disease levy/compensation system be replaced by an insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>Since ERAD were established, close on £200 million has been spent on bovine TB eradication.  The exhaustive programmes implemented in the past three years had to be undertaken.  It must be underlined that contrary to the widely <Col N="461" /> held view that led to the establishment of ERAD, exhaustive testing, even when combined with a wide range of new, improved disease eradication measures, is unlikely to solve Ireland's persistent bovine TB problem.  More importantly, the programmes implemented over the past three years, for the first time clearly identified and quantified the obstacles to progress and ultimate eradication.  It is true that in practical terms we are not significantly nearer to halving the prevailing bovine TB levels which was the traget set by ERAD in 1988.  Moreover, expenditure of an additional £200 million or more over the next three years is unlikely to lead to the progress expected. If the programme continues to be operated as at present it could be a complete failure.  I should like to see more funds available for epidemiology and all the other necessary research in order to ascertain why and how these diseases are transmitted from animal to animal. Otherwise every farmer nationwide will be bankrupt through endeavouring to achieve levels of TB eradication within our system.  Of course, there have been technological advances with regard to blood testing, vaccines and computerised movement systems which should be of help.</P>
    <P>It is crystal clear from this revised Estimate that the Government have no intention of introducing anything like such a comprehensive system.  The Government reacted very swiftly to the cucumber scare the week before last.  The Department of Health have begun a testing programme on Irish-grown cucumbers.  In the meantime, Irish producers, who were not responsible for the scare, are unable to sell their produce in the marketplace. I should like to see a quick conclusion to that investigation and publication of the results so that we may know what did happen in this instance.</P>
    <P>Then there is the matter of the inadequacy of the funding of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry. There has been a reduction in the <Col N="462" /> subhead which otherwise would have ensured that departmental officers were of sufficient number, paid sufficiently by way of overtime and so on, to be on the spot in all our factories nationwide.  This would have ensured that what happened in the past will not recur, so that we could never again have to initiate such a tribunal, which is costing between £40 million and £60 million.  We should have learned the major lesson of being unable properly to control and patrol the beef industry in the past.  I welcome into that industry people from the co-operative movement who have a track record in the food industry second to none, particularly under the milk regime they had been operating.</P>
    <P>I should like to have had more time to have dealt with the greyhound racing industry where there has been increased Government input.  Possibly we should examine the possibility of eliminating taxation from the fees paid on stud dogs, as we did in the case of the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>We should also better utilise the food aid programme to fulfil our commitment to the Third World since we are such a rich country in food production.  Any other additional costs imposed on agricultural people by Coillte Teoranta or others, in the fencing off of lands, or in respect of grazing rights must be addressed by the Minister and his junior Ministers.  This will have to be done if the provisions under this Estimate are to have any relevance whatsoever in agriculture.  A considerable amount of taxpayers' money is involved and we now know that it will not be sufficient to cover all eventualities.</P>
    <P>I see that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is looking at me pleadingly to conclude. Even though I am three minutes short of my allotted time I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Bradford, who will resume the debate tomorrow morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised on a number of occasions with successive Ministers the need to reintroduce the two-week annual training camp for members of the FCA, which was withdrawn in 1983.  Apart from a sympathetic hearing from the Minister, I have been unsuccessful in achieving my objective due to financial constraints. This sympathy sounds very hollow when one realises that approximately 50 per cent of FCA members are being denied the opportunity to attend the annual training camp.  This scandalous position must be addressed and rectified as a matter of urgency before it affects the morale of the force.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 15,000 members in the FCA.  These young men and women have given great service to this country.  At a time when many of us are enjoying ourselves, they sacrifice their leisure time to provide this service. They train in all types of weather both during the week and at weekends in the interests of this country.  In recent years there has been a dangerous and spiralling drift downwards in the number of members permitted to attend annual training.  If this is continued only enough hours will be available for officers and NCOs to attend summer training camps. This is a scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current Estimate for the Department of Defence only provides funding for 9,000 members of the FCA to attend camp for one week's training.  Not all of these weeks are allocated to annual summer camps.  Given the current strength of the force, it is obvious that all eligible to attend the annual summer camp will not be able to do so.  This means that approximately 8,000 to 9,000 members of the FCA and Slua Muirí will <Col N="464" /> not be permitted to go to camp.  Some infantry companies in the Eastern and Southern Command, with an establishment of more than 180, will only be permitted to send 45 members from all ranks to camp.  I believe the same is true for the Western and Curragh Commands.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree it is unfortunate, to put it mildly, that these young men and women in over 120 centres, for example, Swords, Cavan, Limerick and Dublin, are being told at this later stage in the year that they cannot go to camp as there is not enough money to pay them.  Many units encourage recruits to join the FCA early in the year. These recruits are now effectively being told they can go wherever they like but they cannot attend summer camp.  This is having a drastic effect on the morale of the force.  I hope the Minister will address this problem.</P>
    <P>The annual gratuity paid to members of the FCA is based on attendance at annual training camps.  This is an incentive for recruits, particularly those who are unemployed.  Members who parade throughout the year and who are not committed to attend the annual summer training camp will not receive their gratuity, which will remain static for a number of years.  These issues must be addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to voice my concern at the drastic reduction in training for FCA personnel.  During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Defence, Members on all sides of the House noted the loyal and dedicated service given by members of the FCA to this country.  I paid tribute to the voluntary organisation for the work they do. It is only right that their contribution should be acknowledged on the record of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not destroy the morale of this voluntary group who over the years have proven their ability to act as a back-up service to the regular Army.  The Minister <Col N="465" /> should give a positive response to this voluntary group who have given up their leisure time and holidays to give service to this country.  The least that should be done is that the commitments given to them when they were recruited should be honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say at the outset that I do not accept there is a crisis in the FCA in regard to annual training.  The level of training for members of the FCA and Slua Muirí will be the same this year as it has been each year since 1983 &mdash; I do not have to tell the House who was in power in 1983 &mdash; when it was found necessary as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the levels of public expenditure to curtail annual training for members of the Reserve.  Accordingly, the annual training period for members of the FCA and Slua Muirí has been reduced to seven days per year.  However, provision is also made for a certain number of personnel to attend courses of instruction of up to 14 days duration.</P>
      <P>In the selection of personnel for annual training priority is given to those with the longest service and good attendance at local parades, etc.  Every effort is made to facilitate those wishing to attend for annual training but, unfortunately, not all personnel can be accommodated, particularly during their first year of service. Approximately 9,000 personnel undergo annual training each year.  In addition, some members also perform security duties at various military installations. Due to business or other commitments many members of the FCA and Slua Muirí are not available for attendance at annual training, but the military authority have indicated that the vast majority of those wishing to attend for annual training are facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to mention that apart from annual training members of the FCA and Slua Muirí undergo a considerable amount of local training, for <Col N="466" /> example, weekly training parades, field days and overnight camps.  These activities will continue to operate this year at the same level as in previous years. Resources available within the limits of current financial constraints are used to the best advantage to achieve a reasonable balance of expenditure in the supply of new equipment, uniforms, continuation of training, etc.  A gratuity is issued to all members of the FCA and Slua Muirí who complete a course of annual training or other full-time courses of instruction.  In addition, they are paid at the same rates of pay as apply to corresponding ranks in the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the reduced period of annual training, which has been applied in the case of the FCA and Slua Muirí since 1983, the gratuity payable to qualified personnel who complete the maximum permissible period of training is at the full rate and not at the reduced rate which would normally apply in respect of attendance for a shorter period.  The same arrangements apply this year.  The current cost of annual training is estimated at over £2 million and the estimated additional cost of restoring the normal annual training arrangements is approximately £2 million.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to annual training to kept under review with the objective of restoring the normal situation as soon as circumstances allow.  The fact that annual training has been reduced does not reflect a lack of appreciation of the voluntary efforts made by members and the contribution made by them in their regular attendance at local training. The FCA and Slua Muirí provide a valuable contribution to the overall effectiveness of the Defence Forces and every effort is made to provide them with the best equipment and facilities possible within available resources.  I should like to endorse the tribute paid by both Deputies to the FCA.  I wish to express the Government's appreciation for the <Col N="467" /> work of the members of the FCA and Slua Muirí who give such a fine example of good citizenship to the youth of the country on an entirely voluntary basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food if his attention has been drawn to the serious threat of sanctions being imposed by the United States Administration on the export of Irish liqueur and cheese products, and if he will give details of the steps, if any, he intends to take to counteract this serious threat to Irish exports?  It is clearly evident that this is a very serious threat to the Irish dairy industry and should not be taken lightly.  It is also evident that President Bush's administration seems to be intent on striking the most vulnerable section of our agricultural industry, our dairy farmers.  The value of our casein exports last year to the United States was £120 million and the value of Irish liqueur exports was over £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the United States want dialogue with their EC partners they should not proceed by wielding the big stick on the most vulnerable section of the community in the EC, Irish dairy farmers.  The Americans must realise that we cannot live on fresh air and cold water.  Apart from agriculture, fisheries and tourism, our three natural resources, we are not blessed with great industries.  Such a threat from the great United States to one of the weakest nations in Europe is a stroke against democracy in the western civilised world.  It brings home to me in no uncertain fashion the actions of our EC Commissioner when he entertained American negotiators for GATT in Dromoland Castle in the latter months of last year in red carpet fashion.  He threw in the towel by offering those American tycoons a 30 per cent reduction in EC exports.  It is clearly evident that the EC Commissioner should have fought more <Col N="468" /> sternly on behalf of the under-privileged section of the agricultural community.  I can see no reason for throwing in the towel at such an early stage of negotiations. It failed hopelessly to portray the serious impact that any reduction in agricultural exports would have for this country.</P>
    <P>Various agreements have been made between the EC and GATT countries as a result of which our Irish farmers have suffered annihilation.  I have yet to be convinced of one factory farm in Europe closing down as a result of a reduction in quotas but I have seen to my dismay thousands of Irish farmers closing their gates and giving up supplying milk because it was uneconomic.  This is the straw that will break the camel's back.  I hope that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will put on the boxing gloves and make sure he wins the fight against this serious American threat.</P>
    <P>It is clearly evident that this threat was made by President Bush's administration to gain a rural vote from the mid-west farming community, but does President Bush realise that there are more than 40 million ethnic Americans in the United States, a sizeable force which could decide any future presidentail election in that country?  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in conjunction with the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs, would meet representatives from the Bush administration and ask them to let common sense prevail and to withdraw the serious threats to the Irish agricultural industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this topic by my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, because it is a serious matter. I deplore the fact that the US administration has published this retaliation list.  Even though we know that there will be no application of it for at least 30 days from yesterday, I regard the list as unjustified, unnecessary and badly biased against this country.  Rather than putting <Col N="469" /> on the gloves I suggest to Deputy Sheehan that I should take off the gloves because this is bare knuckle stuff.  I should say that this is not the first time such lists have been published.  I see this as a tactic designed to force the Community's hand and to provide the US with a tactical advantage in forthcoming talks with the EC about oilseeds.</P>
      <P>Let me remind the House briefly of the background.  Some time back, the EC made changes in its oilseeds regime designed to move that system towards acreage based payments.  Those changes were intended to meet earlier US objections against the system.  However, the US objected to that move also and a GATT panel was set up which found against the Community.  The Community rejected the panel's findings, but is nevertheless prepared in principle to negotiate with the US about possible compensation; since third countries other than the US are involved and EC Council clearance will be needed it could take some little time for the Community to finalise its negotiating stance.  The US should, in my view, recognise the EC's intentions on this, which I support in principle, and be prepared to wait for the short extra time involved without feeling the necessity to make tactical threats.</P>
      <P>These threats are counter-productive. In this country they cannot but cause anti-US feeling and anti-GATT feeling, which would be an unfortunate result.  In proceeding in this way the US is acting wrongly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Community as a whole and, as Deputy Sheehans said, wrongly <i>vis-à-vis</i> a small country in the Community, namely, Ireland.  This country's participation in the EC oilseeds regime is miniscule.  Nevertheless, the list contains threats against exports to the US of major Irish products such as casein, cream liqueurs and cheese, and is jeopardising the jobs of the personnel in the companies producing those products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times such as these we can be particularly glad to have the support of the European Commission, with the whole <Col N="470" /> economic clout of the EC behind it.  The Commission, as Deputies will know, is the Community negotiator in GATT matters.  We have been in contact with them for some time in anticipation of this issue and we are now again contacting them in the light of this latest development. I am also making direct contact with the US authorities, Secretary Madigan, the US Embassy in Dublin and our embassy in Washington, in the expectation that they will value Irish-US relations and US-EC relations enough not to proceed with this unnecessary and provocative threat.  I have confidence in the negotiating powers of the European Commission, and indeed in the ultimate good sense of the US.  With the Commission we will do our utmost to ensure that genuine negotiations on the dispute take place, leading to an acceptable outcome, and that these unjustified threats do not become a reality.  I have been in contact with the US Embassy in Dublin and will be meeting later this evening personnel from that embassy to put our views to them.</P>
    <P>I would add that, in a statement just issued, the European Commission said that it deeply regrets the US decision, which it regards as inappropriate and counter-productive, and has emphasised that the Community will come forward with a concrete proposal before the GATT Council on 19 June.  The Commission states also that the US action is without any legal basis pending conclusions of the GATT Council on that date.  I agree with the Commission's viewpoint and applaud the stance it is taking which is in the interest of this country as well as of the EC as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It concerns cuts which have been made by FÁS in the numbers of participants being recruited on social employment schemes.  This is extraordinary <Col N="471" /> given our rising level of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Over the past two weeks sponsors and co-ordinators of social employment schemes have been informed of an unannounced policy to reduce the number of participants in these schemes.  Already one important inner city scheme, the Lourdes Community Resources Centre with 20 SES workers has been closed down because FÁS did not allow it to roll over on 8 June.  A second scheme in the city centre, the Grapevine Arts Centre is due to close on 19 June because it, too, is not being permitted to roll over.</P>
      <P>In my constituency a number of SES schemes which are sponsored by Dún Laoghaire vocational education committee and Dublin County vocational education committee have been informed that recruitment of participants is to be reduced by 50 per cent.  This means that SES schemes which are doing important and imaginative work in local communities are under threat.  Schemes such as &ldquo;Options&rdquo; in Ballybrack, Community Action Television, Loughlinstown Employment Group, Sport-Eco and Choices in Shankill are now under threat.  The 50 per cent cut in participation will not only reduce numbers but will threaten the viability of these projects because their administrative and supervisory budgets are based on the number of participants.  If the number of participants is halved so too is the finance for the schemes' overheads.  These groups operate community radio and television services, run unemployed centres, organise women's groups, produce community magazines and carry out environmental works.  This type of activity requires continuity.  If it is disrupted by massive reductions in participants it will be difficult to resume it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister explain why these cuts are being made?  To date, FÁS have made no statement to explain to either the sponsors or the participants of schemes the rationale for the cuts.  I <Col N="472" /> understand that it may be due to the arrangements that exist for the funding of FÁS schemes.  If this is so it should be corrected immediately and those involved in SES schemes reassured that the work is valued and is secure.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that these cuts in the SES schemes are coming just before the launch of the community employment development programme.  This programme was given pride of place in the budget speech by the Minister for Finance last January.  Could it be that SES money is now being held back to kick start the CEDP later in the year?  Is this another case of robbing Peter to pay Paul?  We are owed an explanation and an assurance.  With the unemployment figure now heading towards 300,000 and unemployed people willing to participate on SES schemes it does not make any sense to cut back on these schemes.  The Minister should address this question as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, for example, there is a number of schemes which are shortly coming up for renewal and for renewal of participation in the schemes.  If there is any delay or refusal to renew these schemes not only will it affect individual participants, but it will affect the schemes, because they need a certain amount of continuity.  Many of the schemes and projects require a great deal of planning and management.  If the numbers of participants are depressed at any given time, it throws the whole operation of the project askew and it could undermine the viability of them.  The Minister should address this urgently.  I hope he will respond positively to these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise at the outset that the social employment scheme is in operation and will so continue.  An Exchequer allocation of £72.9 million has been made available to FÁS for expenditure on the scheme this year to provide opportunities for an average of 11,000 people on the scheme each week.  However, the actual <Col N="473" /> number on the scheme at any particular time will vary depending on the number of projects in operation.</P>
      <P>The scheme is the principal manpower intervention aimed at the long term unemployed and it has been in operation since 1984.  It provides opportunities, albeit on a part-time basis, for long term unemployed people, to become involved for a year in a work related situation and so improve their prospects of obtaining employment when full time employment opportunities arise.  There were 12,556 on the scheme at the end of April 1992 of whom about 54 per cent are persons with adult and child dependants.  The scheme represents a successful collaboration between local communities and the State in that local groups sponsoring projects must come up with proposals for projects which generally involve improvements to local amenities. In addition, local communities come up with a certain element of funding for the projects.  A wide variety of projects is undertaken under the scheme and all Deputies will be aware of the benefits to local communities and local unemployed people brought about through the scheme.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties which has arisen over the years is that some voluntary groups providing services on a continuing basis at local level have come to rely on schemes such as the social employment scheme for assistance in providing their services and as such the schemes are in danger of becoming project driven. Employment schemes were not intended to provide assistance on an ongoing basis for projects.  Rather the intention was that projects would be of a finite nature which would allow flexibility in providing opportunities for long term unemployed people where such opportunities were needed having regard to the level of unemployment in different parts of the country, and available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by some promotors of projects in having projects renewed.  This <Col N="474" /> arises because intake to the scheme must be managed by FÁS so as to ensure that expenditure is kept within the available resources.  A mid year review of expenditure on the SES has indicated that there will be some savings on employment scheme expenditure due to a slight change in the profile of participants.  I am pleased to advise the House that I have authorised FÁS to utilise these savings to fund additional SES and Teamwork activity between now and the year's end. This should overcome some of the difficulties being experienced by sponsors whose SES projects have or are about to expire.  However, I would again emphasise that continued support for particular projects cannot be guaranteed.  FÁS must have the flexibility to manage the scheme having regard to the needs of the long term unemployed throughout the country and the available Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the scheme is no longer eligible for European Social Fund aid, but I am pursuing the matter with EC officials to see if an agreement can be reached on the restoration of ESF aid.</P>
    <P>I would refer Deputies to the Community Employment Development Programme which is being introduced in the 12 pilot areas established under the area based strategy for long term unemployment and which will replace the SES in these areas.  Under the new programme a training element will be provided for participants who will also retain their secondary social welfare benefits. EC aid in the form of a global grant is being sought by the Taoiseach's office for the various measures including the Community Employment Development Programme announced by the Taoiseach at the end of April to operate in the 12 pilot areas under the area based strategy. This may act as a test case with the Commission in my efforts to have ESF aid restored for the SES generally.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Director General of FÁS this week that an urgent review is underway of projects whose <Col N="475" /> renewal had been deferred.  FÁS hope to be in a position to clarify the position with sponsors within two weeks.  In fairness, however, I must say that it is unlikely that all projects seeking renewal will be authorised for immediate start.  Some prioritising and staggering of such renewals is inevitable.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to specialist clinics to augment routine general medical services.  I am not aware of any administrative problems between my Department and the Department of Health holding up the development of such clinics.  The only problems are practical <Col N="382" /> ones relating to the availability of accommodation and appropriate specialist personnel, their rate of remuneration, etc.  The Director of Prison Medical Services is actively pursuing the matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasis that, in the meantime, any prisoners requiring specialist medical services are brought to outside hospitals to receive them.</P>

      <P>In line with the recommendations contained in the Report of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths, August 1991, a system of recording the circumstances relating to cases of attempted suicide and selfmutilation was introduced.  Following all such incidents details are furnished by local prison management to the Director of Prison Medical Services on a form designed specially for this purpose.  A copy of the form is retained on the prisoner's medical record for local reference.</P>
      <P>The data recorded is comprehensive, giving full details of the location of the incident, the method used, the medical treatment given, the explanation given by the prisoner and comment by prison management.  Background information which includes the prisoner's medical and psychiatric history, reference to previous attempts at self-injury and sentence details is also provided.</P>

This process will be assisted by the completion, later this year, of a new unit in Mountjoy Prison to cater for the special needs of persons suffering from communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 22, 23, 32 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>To date my Department has paid a total of £1,199,722 in fees and expenses, including VAT but excluding deduction of retention tax, in respect of the investigation ordered by the High Court under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, into the affairs of Siúicre Éireann cpt.  It is estimated that a further £51,000 in fees and expenses will arise in connection with the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with section 13 (1) of the Act an application was made to the High Court for the reimbursement to my Department of the costs of the investigation which, as required by the Act, it had paid in the first instance.  Section 13 (1) of the Companies Act, 1990, allows for reimbursement in full to the State of expenses incurred in such investigations and it is clearly desirable that the taxpayer should be relieved of the burden of such costs and expenses to the greatest extent possible.  Before the High Court proceedings took place the possibility of Greencore meeting part of the expenses of the investigation was discussed between counsel for the parties. However, when counsel for the State sought to pursue the matter more definitely, no offer to pay any part of the expenses was forthcoming.  In its judgment delivered on 1 May 1992 the High Court refused the application.  It should be noted that the High Court in its judgment accepted the general principle that the State should be reimbursed the costs and expenses but felt that it did not <Col N="385" /> apply in the particular circumstances of this case.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the Attorney General an appeal against this decision has been lodged with the Supreme Court.  In the event of the appeal to the Supreme Court being rejected it is further open to me, under section 13 (2) of the Act, to seek reimbursement of the costs of the investigation from any person or persons who are either convicted on indictment on a prosecution taken as a result of the investigation or ordered to pay damages in civil proceedings taken on foot of the investigation.  I can assure the House that all possible legal avenues will be explored with a view to removing the costs of the investigation from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that under the 1990 Companies Act I have no function in the appointment of the inspectors: my Department's involvement relates solely to the payment in the first instance of the fees and expenses incurred in connection with an investigation ordered by the High Court under section 8.  In the present case, the inspectors were appointed on 16 September 1991 by the High Court on the application of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  My Department issued a letter on 17 October 1991 to the secretary to the inspectors which set out, <i>inter alia</i>, the level of fees payable to each of the inspectors.  I have no information, other than what was suggested in recent media reports, about any arrangements which may have been made by any of the persons concerned on foot of that letter.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the documentation amassed by the inspectors in the course of their investigation the position is that the High Court on 3 March 1992 ordered that copies of the documentation could be given to, among others, the Director of Public Prosecutions and that the originals be retained by my Department.  This has been done.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the information available relates to the number of persons charged with offences under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977-1984 and the number of seizures in the Cork East and Cork West Garda Divisions and the country as a whole in each of the years 1986 to 1990.  This information is set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  As can be seen from these figures drug charges and seizures in the Cork East and West Divisions for 1990 represent approximately 18 per cent of the total corresponding figures for the whole country.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any convincing arguments for the establishment of a Drugs Enforcement Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drug law enforcement efforts in this country are co-ordinated by the Garda National Drugs Unit which was set up in 1990 and which is located in Garda Headquarters.  There is excellent cooperation between the Garda and Customs authorities which has resulted in many successful joint Garda and Customs operations.  The services of the Air Corps and Naval Service can, and are, <Col N="389" /> provided as an aid to Garda and Customs authorities as required.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have assured me that these inter-agency liaison arrangements are a practical and effective way of dealing with the drug problems in this country.</P>
    <P>I am of course concerned that there should be maximum co-ordination of drug enforcement effort particularly in relation to the open border situation which will exist from 1 January next.  I can assure the House that the necessary arrangements are being made to ensure that the agencies involved can operate the most effective and co-ordinated programme of enforcement to meet the demands which will be presented in the new open borders situation.</P>

    <P>The Law Reform Commission was requested by the Attorney General to formulate proposals for reform of the law <Col N="392" /> in this area.

      <P>I am aware of the views published in the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> regarding the appointment and training of judges.</P>
      <P>Judicial appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Government and I have no plans to review the method of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to preparation and training, <Col N="393" /> it must be emphasised that our system of appointment to all levels of the judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in trained and experienced legal practitioners.  The formal qualification required for appointment as judge of the District Court is not less than ten years' practice as a barrister or solicitor; ten years' practice as a barrister is required for appointment as a judge of the Circuit Court; and 12 years' practice as a barrister is the requirement for appointment as a judge of the Supreme and High Courts.  To become a barrister or solicitor in the first place requires successful completion of a course of studies laid down by qualifying authorities.  It is considered, therefore, that judges would on their appointment have a wide knowledge of the law, its application and court procedures.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that statutory meetings of the judges of the District Court are held up to twice annually under the provisions of section 36 (3) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the discharge of business of that court including such matters as &ldquo;the avoidance of undue divergences in the exercise by the Judges of the jurisdiction of that Court and the general level of fines and other penalties&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The article referred to by the Deputy acknowledges that the Children Act, 1908, was widely regarded as a most enlightened piece of legislation and that any shortcomings in the juvenile justice system are not attributable to the legislation. Nonetheless, the 1908 Act, despite having stood the test of time fairly well, is now well over 80 years old and the time has come to replace it with a modern Act that will be more relevant to the end rather than the beginning of the century.  I am, therefore, giving priority in my Department to the preparation of a new Juvenile Justice Bill which will replace the 1908 Act.</P>
      <P>With regard to the role of the Garda Síochána in the Juvenile Justice system, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question by Deputy Allen on 24 March, 1992, Dáil Debates Volume 417, columns 1174 to 1176, in which the wide ranging activities of the Garda in relation to the prevention of crime and dealing with young people were detailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to juveniles in custody, my Department is responsible for the provision and management of detention centres for males aged 16 or over, and females aged 17 or over.  The males are accommodated mainly in the new institution at Wheatfield or in St. Patrick's Institution.  The females, who are few in number, are accommodated in the Women's Prison at Mountjoy.  Wheatfield is one of the most advanced institutions in Europe and contains modern <Col N="395" /> facilities for work training and education. The Women's Prison at Mountjoy is at present in a refurbished wing of St. Patrick's Institution.  In has in-cell sanitation.</P>
    <P>Young offenders aged 15 to 16 in the case of males, and 15 to 17 in the case of females may be sent to prison by the courts in the special circumstances provided for in sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act, 1908 &mdash; i.e. when they are certified as being of so unruly or depraved a character as to be unsuitable for detention in a special school.  These committals are few, and when they occur the boys are kept in Wheatfield and the girls in separate accommodation in the Women's Prison.</P>
    <P>Young offenders between the ages of 12 and 17 may be committed to special schools which are the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  I understand that the former Scoil Ard Mhuire premises in Lusk have been refurbished to provide an additional 36 places for boys and eight places for girls and that 14 additional places for boys and four additional places for girls were brought into operation in September 1991.  A further eight places for boys and a further four places for girls were brought on stream in recent weeks.  I understand that the remaining places will be operational in the next two months or so.</P>
    <P>Probation and welfare officers are assigned to all prisons and places of detention where juvenile offenders are accommodated.  Their work with these young offenders includes counselling them on alternative life styles in which their needs can be met without resort to crime.  Hand-in-hand with counselling goes the task of overcoming particular practical problems relating to finance, accommodation, unemployment, alcohol or drug dependence, physical and mental disabilities, ill health, etc.  While in prison juveniles have access to education, work training, medical, psychological and related services.</P>
    <P>Juveniles in trouble with the law and those leaving prison have community facilities available to them.  Grants are <Col N="396" /> paid to groups working with or assisting the Probation and Welfare Service. These, mostly voluntary, groups receive almost 100 per cent funding from my Department and provide workshop facilities, hostels, day centres and rehabilitation programmes for young offenders. The financial assistance to these bodies for this year at £1.943 million represents an increase of 19 per cent over the funding provided in 1991.</P>
    <P>This wide range of facilities throughout the country gives juveniles in trouble with the law new opportunities to turn away from a life of crime and drug abuse and thereby avoid a prison sentence.</P>
    <P>There is a wide range of alternatives to custody in operation in this country including fines, probation, compensation orders, deferment of sentence, suspended sentence and Community Service Orders.  The use of supervised alternative sanctions has been growing steadily in recent years to the point where there are at present about 3,200 offenders serving community-based sanctions under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service.  That is about one-and-a-half times the number of persons who are in custody.  There are over 700 offenders on Community Service Orders.  The number of such orders made by the courts has increased from 698 in 1985 to 1,349 at 30 November 1991.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the area of juvenile justice and dealing with young offenders is a complex one.  My Department and the other agencies involved have invested considerable time and resources in dealing with the problems of young offenders.  I wish to assure the Deputy that it is my intention to maintain this level of investment having due regard to the many competing demands that there are on public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to say that I welcome the publication of the Legal Aid Board's report, which covers the years 1987 to 1989.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the continuing and pressing need to contain public expenditure, significant improvements have been made in recent years in the Civil Legal Aid service.  Since this Government took office in 1989 the board's annual grant-in-aid has been increased substantially in each of the subsequent years.  Vacancies for solicitors and administrative staff have been filled and additional staff have been recruited. Three new law centres were opened recently at Castlebar, Letterkenny and Dundalk, and another two centres will be opened this year in the greater Dublin area, in Clondalkin and Finglas.  This will bring to 16 the number of full time centres operating around the country.</P>
      <P>During 1991, the income qualification limits for services under the scheme were raised from £5,500 disposable income per annum to £6,200, with a wide range of allowances increased to make more people eligible.  The threshold below which legal services are made available for the minimum contribution of £19 was increased to £4,400 disposable income per annum from the previous figure of £3,500.  This was the first revision of means test limits since 1986 and its purpose was to restore eligibility levels under the scheme in real terms to those which applied when it was first introduced.</P>
      <P>In March 1991 a ministerial policy directive was issued to the board under the provisions of the scheme to enable legal assistance to be provided to complainants in legal proceedings in respect of cases of rape or aggravated sexual assault.  Extra staff were made available for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to have legislation to place the scheme of civil legal aid and <Col N="398" /> advice on a statutory basis ready as soon as possible having regard to the numerous other important and urgent items of legislation that are being proposed as part of my legislative programme for the next two years.  However, the non-statutory nature of the scheme is not and never has been an impediment to its operation and development.  This is evidenced by the fact that the scheme was expanded substantially since its inception and that important features of the scheme have been altered without undue formality to meet client needs which were not anticipated at the beginning but were subsequently recognised as matters that should be provided for within the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the view that the scheme will require further development so that the awaiting period, which applies in some cases, can be shortened but, because of the need for careful management of public expenditure particularly at this time, this is something that will have to be done on a phased basis in line with what we can afford to pay.  The arrangements which the board has put in place, in accordance with the provisions of the scheme, to deal with cases of emergency continue to operate effectively.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of additional resources to the Legal Aid Board the position is that notwithstanding the very difficult budgetary position the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board has been increased again this year, for the third successive year.</P>

    <P>The long term public interest is best served when prisons are used only as a last resort and when a range of effective alternatives, including Community Service Orders, are fully employed.  At the present time there are over 3,200 offenders serving community-based sanctions under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service.  That is about one-and-a-half times the number of persons who are in custody.  Of these, over 700 persons are on Community Service Orders.  Community Service Orders made by the courts numbered 1,390 in 1991.  This represents 147,863 hours of <Col N="400" /> work undertaken in the community that might otherwise have been left undone.</P>
    <P>My Department are constantly reviewing the scope for extending the use of Community Service Orders and at the present time are considering in particular, the feasibility of extending them to fine defaulters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal that, in the absence of any special circumstances giving rise to delays, applications currently being lodged with the tribunal are likely to be determined by a single member within a year of date of lodgement, that the waiting period, at present, for an appeal is 24 <Col N="406" /> months and that awards of compensation currently being paid were accepted 11 months ago.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the tribunal that, while longer delays occurred in the case of some applications lodged in the past due to the large volume of applications made in the period 1980 to 1986, such delays are not of the order suggested by the Deputy except where factors outside the control of the tribunal are involved:</P>
      <P>Such factors are: failure or delay on the part of the applicants or their legal representatives to provide the tribunal with the necessary evidence to support the claims or to agree dates for hearing of appeals; the need for the tribunal to await the resolution of associated criminal and/or civil actions; and the complexity of the injuries sustained giving rise to prolonged delays in the preparation and submission of final medical reports.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals in regard to legislation to amend the existing scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.</P>
      <P>The matter of additional funding for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is kept under constant review in my Department.  As in the case of all public services, funding for criminal injuries compensation has to be allocated on the basis of requirement, competing demands for other services and for the limited financial resources available and the overall budgetary situation. However, I would remind the Deputy that, in the years 1988 to 1991, in addition to the provisions made in the Annual Estimates, extra funding amounting to £8.96 million has been provided for the payment of compensation by means of Supplementary Estimates or by way of savings elsewhere in the Vote.</P>
      <P>In all, a total of almost £16 million has been provided by the Exchequer in that four year period for the payment of awards of compensation by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.</P>

      <P>Maynooth Garda sub-District forms part of the Naas Garda District.  Naas itself is the Divisional Headquarters for Carlow/ Kildare.  The Garda authorities inform me that an extra garda was assigned to Maynooth in April of this year, bringing the current strength there to one sergeant and six gardaí.  A Garda patrol car was allocated to Maynooth in 1989.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the resources available are adequate to deal with the policing needs of Maynooth and have no plans at present to further increase the force's manpower there. However, they are keeping the situation under continuing review.</P>
      <P>Investigation into the alleged rape and unauthorised taking of an unmarked Garda car are continuing.  One youth was detained in connection with the alleged rape and a file on the matter is being prepared for the law officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic problem with the Land Registry in recent years has been its incapacity to cope fully with the growing volume of business being addressed to it.  This has resulted in lengthening delays in dealing with cases and the accumulation of arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> The main factors contributing to this development have been reduced levels of staffing and a need for greater investment in new technology.  These factors arose because, as part of the public service, the Registry has been subject to the various embargoes on staffing and cutbacks in public expenditure which operated since the early eighties.  At the same time as the staffing levels were reducing in the Registry, the volume of business being addressed to it was increasing significantly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the proposal, approved in principle by Government, to re-constitute the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds as a semi-State body.  The purpose of this change is to free the registries from the constraints in the areas of staffing and funding which, of necessity, apply under the Civil Service structure and to give them a commercial orientation that will enable them to provide a fast, efficient and up-to-date service to the public.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to announce the appointment of an interim board for the registries in the near future.  The interim board will operate on a non-statutory basis and its principal role will be to advise and assist in the various steps which need to be taken in readiness for the reconstitution of the registries.  I have, in the meanwhile, made arrangements for the preparation of legislation to formally vest the registries in a semi-State board.</P>
    <P>Attainment of an enhanced level of service to the public is, of course, dependent on adequate resources being provided to the registries.  In this regard I am pleased to say that substantial additional finance has been provided for them in the current year's Estimates.  The additional funds are earmarked primarily for implementation of an approved programme of computerisation and for the recruitment of extra staff to tackle the problem of arrears.</P>
    <P>Late in 1990 management consultants were engaged to produce a strategic plan to link the organisational structure and technology infrastructure to the business goals and objectives of the registries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The consultants' recommendations for a phased five year information systems plan was accepted and implementation of the plan is already uderway.  Arising from previously implemented technology programmes at the registries, the folios in the Dublin area have been computerised, leading to a considerable improvement in the speed of response to applications for copy folios and copy file plans.</P>
    <P>Folios created in the Western Region are being put on computer as dealings are processed and a programme of computerising Registry of Deeds Abstracts of Memorials, commenced in 1990, is progressing satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The fall in staff numbers at the registries through the eighties, which as already mentioned was due to embargoes, has been arrested and staffing levels have been increased each year since 1989.  As a result of this and of adjustments in the management of resources, the services provided by the registries are already improving.  I am informed by the Registrar that in the case of dealings, the main business of the Land Registry, arrears of uncompleted dealings have been reduced by 7 per cent over the last two years and that a further improvement of the situation with regard to arrears and delays can be expected during the course of this year.</P>

      <P>The delays adverted to in the 1990 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General were the result of a special set of circumstances which arose in the period 1 July to 9 October 1990 when the court <Col N="410" /> in Chancery Street was closed so that urgent repairs to the building could be carried out &mdash; the report contains a detailed explanation of the circumstances. Measures have been taken designed to ensure that a similar situation will not arise again.</P>
      <P>The relatively low summons service rate in parking offence cases is due to a variety of factors, among them the fact that a proportion of such offenders take steps to evade service.  It was for the purpose of tackling this problem that provision was made in the Courts Act, 1991, for the service of summonses by recorded delivery.  The new arrangements will be implemented as soon as possible and I am confident that they will significantly improve the summons service rate.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide on the number of members assigned to juvenile liaison officer duties.  At present there are 82 juvenile liaison officers in the Garda Síochána who are assigned to 34 major centres of population including Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Kilkenny, Waterford and other provincial areas.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of juvenile liaison officers is sufficient to meet the demands placed on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year saw the implementation of the first reforms of the Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme since its inception in 1963.  There is now a National Juvenile Office at Garda DMA Headquarters, Harcourt Square which co-ordinates and monitors the operation of the scheme throughout the country.  Other new developments to make the scheme more effective in helping young people who become involved in crime include: a <Col N="411" /> new and greater emphasis on the use of a caution rather than prosecution of young offenders, tailoring of Garda supervision to meet the individual needs of each juvenile, improved and extended training of juvenile liaison officers and rostering of juvenile liaison officers for night and weekend working to ensure better contact with parents and young people involved in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I believe these new measures will greatly enhance the operation of the juvenile liaison officer scheme.</P>

      <P>Candidates for apprenticeships in the Army and Air Corps Apprentice Schools who are considered suitable for an apprenticeship by an interview board are called for a medical examination as part of the selection process.  This procedure is designed to ensure that no undue delay occurs in having apprentices commence their training in the apprentice schools by the appointed date.  Up to 1990 the practice was that successful applicants did not undergo a medical examination until first reporting for enlistment.  However, due to the fact that a significant number of candidates either failed the medical examination or failed to take up the offer of appointment, the process of filling all available vacancies was usually not competed until two to three months after the commencement of training.  This resulted in a disruption in the training programme and was unsatisfactory both for the <Col N="412" /> apprentices and the staff of the apprentice schools.  The conditions governing the apprenticeship competitions which are issued to all applicants state that: Following interview a number of candidates may be required to undergo a medical examination at a designated military post.  This medical examination is part of the selection process and does not imply that a candidate has qualified for an apprenticeship.</P>
      <P>The cost of the medical examinations is borne by my Department.</P>

The following is the relevant extract from the National Development Plan in relation to Dublin.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Sub-Regional Plans.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Introduction</i>
      </P>
      <P>The following material presents a short summary description of the socio-economic position in each of the seven sub-regions used for consultation and the objectives and strategies identified for each.  A breakdown of the planned expenditure over the period 1989-1993 in each of the sub-regions is also presented. The sub-regions are shown on the map on page 87.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SUB-REGION 1: DUBLIN CITY AND COUNTY</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> 1.  Socio-economic analysis</P>
    <P>1.1 <i>Overview</i></P>
    <P>The Dublin City and County sub-region is located on the east coast of Ireland at the western periphery of the European Community.  It comprises the County Borough of Dublin, Dublin County and the Municipal Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  It is centred on the City of Dublin, the nation's capital and centre of administration, commerce, industry and transport.</P>
    <P>Embracing approximately 920 sq. km, the Dublin area is the most densely populated sub-region in the State with a population of 1,021,449 in 1986, 29 per cent of the total population of the State.</P>
    <P>The Dublin area is richly endowed with scenic and recreational amenities &mdash; the Dublin Mountains, the County Dublin coastline and Dublin Bay, the river Liffey, two canals and the Phoenix Park, which is the most extensive urban park in any city within the European Communities.</P>
    <P>1.2 <i>Population</i></P>
    <P>Dublin's population expanded from 718,300 in 1961 to 1,021,449 in 1986, an increase of 42 per cent.  The increase was rapid between 1966 and 1981 but slower since then.  The main growth occurred in Dublin County, particularly in the new suburbs to the South-West, West and North-West of the city.  The population of Dublin city declined significantly, particularly in the Inner City.</P>
    <P>Dublin had a lower proportion of its population in the 0-14 and 65 plus age groups in 1986 compared with the State as a whole and a higher proportion in the 15-44 age group.</P>
    <P>1.3 <i>Employment trends</i></P>
    <P>Employment patterns in the Dublin area differ markedly from the rest of the country. Agriculture accounts for less than 1 per cent of employment in the Dublin area, compared with 21 per cent of the rest of the country.  Almost 74 per cent of those working in the Dublin area are <Col N="414" /> engaged in service industries compared with 50 per cent in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The most striking features of the trend in employment in recent years is the decline in industrial employment in Dublin.  Between 1981 and 1987 industrial employment fell in Dublin by 29,000 or 26 per cent.  Employment in services in Dublin over the same period remained static.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is significantly higher than the national average in certain areas of Dublin, such as the North and South inner cities and in some suburban local authority housing estates.</P>
    <P>In particular, the combined effects of the growth of the population in the Western suburbs and the relative youth of this population mean that job needs are now and will continue to be proportionately greater there.</P>
    <P>The scale of the labour supply problem in Dublin is such that there will have to be a substantial improvement in employment performance to cater for the growth in the labour force and those currently unemployed.</P>
    <P>1.4 <i>Strength and weaknesses</i></P>
    <P>1.4.1 <i>Strengths</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;A strong urban structure containing the national capital and largest city in Ireland.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A youthful labour force, with a versatile range of potential skills supported by extensive educational facilities and a fully integrated structure for the delivery of manpower services.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A growing number of modern and progressive industrial and commercial establishments, dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises and a fully serviced and immediately available development land bank of some 900 ha.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An expanding range of commercial, financial and industrial services, including the international financial services centre.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Dublin is a European capital city with a wealth of historic buildings and areas <Col N="415" /> which are rich in cultural and literary traditions and associations.  The Inner City contains significant areas of heritage that represent different phases of Irish cultural history.  It also has major recreational and tourism attractions in its natural environment and leisure facilities.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Dublin Port which is strategically located on the central sea corridor between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Dublin International Airport which is the premier airport in Ireland and handles 70 per cent of the country's international air traffic.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Dublin city is located at the hub of Ireland's road network.  It is also the hub of Ireland's public transport system (bus/rail) linking the capital city to all parts of the country and via the Irish Sea central corridor to Britain.</P>
    <P>1.4.2 <i>Weaknesses</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;The scale of economic decline in the Dublin area, particularly in the Inner City which is in urgent need of physical revitalisation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Major growth of suburban areas especially to the west of Dublin City which has not been matched by the supply of high order facilities and services. These areas have serious multiple economic and social problems and a low level of participation in post-compulsory education, with participation in third-level education and training, in particular, far below the national average.</P>
    <P>&mdash;High levels of unemployment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Need to regenerate the manufacturing base within the area, including the Inner City, where indigenous industry was formerly located.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Shortage of investment in physical infrastructure including roads, public transport, sanitary services, waste disposal, recreation and tourism facilities.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Poor intra-urban levels of accessibility, both between the city centre and the <Col N="416" /> outer suburbs, and also between the outer suburbs themselves.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Lack of port access for ro-ro traffic is contributing to excessive use of the city quays in the city centre by heavy traffic, which contributes to problems of congestion and a deteriorating physical environment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Need to upgrade environmental conditions in the Dublin Bay area and to improve air quality in Dublin.</P>
    <P>2. <i>Objectives and strategies</i></P>
    <P>2.1 The overall development objective is to promote the economic and social development of the Dublin area in a balanced way, so as to increase economic growth, increase employment levels and reduce the gap with average EC living standards while protecting and improving the environment.  The competitiveness of the area must be improved and the productive capacity expanded.</P>
    <P>2.2 <i>Industry and services</i></P>
    <P>Industrial and services development will be a key feature of the development strategy, building on the existing strengths, promoting new enterprises and regenerating areas affected by industrial decline.  Specific measures will be taken to promote the marketing and technological capability of industry.  Particular attention will be given to the food, engineering, electronics and clothing industries.  The Western suburbs will be specially targeted for development.</P>
    <P>2.3 <i>Tourism</i></P>
    <P>Dublin has considerable potential for increased tourism.  This will be developed with particular regard to the natural, cultural and heritage attractions of the area.</P>
    <P>The strategy will be to unify many of the existing attractions into historic and cultural trails and to concentrate further new development along those trails, with the dual effect of developing tourism and aiding inner-city renewal.  The development of weather-independent facilities and other tourism products, including <Col N="417" /> water-based facilities, will also be promoted.</P>
    <P>2.4 <i>Agriculture</i></P>
    <P>Particular attention will be given to the horticulture industry.  The over-riding objective is the development of a long term commercially viable industry capable of competing successfully on both domestic and international markets.  An Bord Glas will play a lead role in developing the marketing function.</P>
    <P>2.5 <i>Forestry</i></P>
    <P>A forestry programme will be pursued in the sub-region.  This will be reflected in increased afforestation and maintenance of the present forest estate with a view to providing increased employment, raw material for industry and improved recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>2.6 <i>Infrastructure and environment</i></P>
    <P>A good infrastructure is vital to the sustained and balanced economic development of the sub-region.  The objectives and strategy for infrastructure can be broken down into three separate but obviously related segments as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  To improve road, bus and rail, telecommunications and postal links within the sub-region and between it and other sub-regions.  This objective will be achieved by</P>
    <P>&mdash;improvement of the national roads in the Dublin area and of the non-national roads which contribute to economic development</P>
    <P>&mdash;provision of a peripheral ring road to link main national routes and facilitate long distance traffic</P>
    <P>&mdash;provision of a port access route, which will keep heavy traffic from the Centre City</P>
    <P>&mdash;improvements in the existing network <Col N="418" /> of public transport services, including the provision of diesel rail commuter services</P>
    <P>&mdash;improvement in the internal telecommunications network</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of modern mail centres and the introduction of automated mail processing systems.</P>
    <P>(b)  To improve the port, shipping, airport and international telecommunications infrastructure so as to enhance the Dublin area as one of Ireland's main gateways to the rest of Europe.  This objective will be achieved by</P>
    <P>&mdash;continued development of Dublin Port and Airport, including their development as bases for intensive air and sea freight shuttle services to Britain and Continental Europe</P>
    <P>&mdash;further development of international telecommunication linkages.</P>
    <P>(c)  To improve other essential facets of the area's economic infrastructure. This objective will be achieved by</P>
    <P>&mdash;improvement in the structure and competitiveness of the energy supply</P>
    <P>&mdash;providing adequate sewage systems and water supplies of EC quality standard for industrial, agricultural, tourism and domestic purposes</P>
    <P>&mdash;providing adequate sewage treatment and waste disposal facilities to enhance the tourism and overall development potential of the area and to protect and enhance the environment</P>
    <P>&mdash;achieving the reductions required in smoke levels to conform to both national and EC standards</P>
    <P>&mdash;upgrading the physical environment and the fabric of the Inner City.</P>
    <P>2.7 <i>Education, skills and training</i></P>
    <P>The level of intellectual and skill <Col N="419" /> attainment is important for the development of the Dublin area.  The necessary education and training infrastructure &mdash; physical and non-physical &mdash; will be provided. Areas of deprivation will be specially targeted and unsatisfactory <Col N="420" /> facilities will be upgraded and rationalised. Effective linkages will be forged between the education/training system and business, industry and tourism to support innovation and entrepreneurship.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the bus stop in question was recently removed by Dublin Bus with their consent following the receipt of numerous and incessant complaints about its location and the behaviour of people waiting at it.  The source of these complaints were local residents and businesses. The Garda are at present endeavouring with Dublin Bus executives to identify a suitable location for the bus stop agreeable to all parties concerned including both residents and law abiding passengers.  The hardship and inconvenience caused to senior citizens who availed of this bus stop is regretted but it must be understood that incidents at the location of the stop itself caused distress and injury to the property of elderly residents.</P>

      <P>The Advisory Group on Prison Deaths considered that, of the suicides which occur in prisons a disproportionate number take place while prisoners are on remand or in the early stages of their sentences and they recommended that a Committal Assessment Centre be established in Dublin.  At any given time the number of offenders in custody on remand is about 150 and the Advisory Group acknowledged that their recommendation was a long term proposal since its implementation would involve &ldquo;either major expenditure or major reorganisation of the present prison system&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I announced recently I am having a major policy document on prisons prepared, a document which will up-date the aims and objectives of the prison system, determine priorities which need to be addressed and set out the strategy to achieve them.  The question of providing an assessment centre may be expected to be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>Tuition fees are a standard feature of the funding of higher education in this country.  Accordingly, each institution receives a fee in respect of each student, either directly from the student or indirectly through one of the student support schemes.  This requirement applies to all students including those participating in the ERASMUS Programme.</P>
      <P>The EC-funded ERASMUS Programme encourages students in third level institutions to pursue their studies in another member state for up to one year.  While participating in the programme, students receive a grant towards travel and maintenance costs.  Irish students who avail of the programme pay tuition fees to their home institutions but incur no tuition fees to their host institutions in the EC member state.  Thus Irish &ldquo;ERASMUS&rdquo; students are being treated in the same way as all other Irish students in so far as the payment of fees is concerned.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the programme which is in place to provide support for children who are daily found in the streets busking or begging for money at times when they should be at school; and if they are to have any long term opportunities open to them.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports from the health boards indicate that the problem of children begging on the streets is most prevalent in the Dublin city centre area and mainly involves children from the travelling community.  I am very concerned about this problem and I am asking the health board for an urgent report on the steps that they are taking to deal with it in the context of the new statutory powers and duties which are being given to health boards under the Child Care Act, 1991.  I shall communicate with the Deputy as soon as I receive this report.  The Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with the Department of Education, support a school and pre-school for 75 traveller children at St. Columbas Day Care Centre, Strand Street, Dublin 1.  The school is linked to Exchange House, Essex Street, Dublin 2, which is operated by the Dublin Committee for Travelling People.  Children are collected each day and brought to the school and meals, health care and other back-up services are provided at Exchange House. The Eastern Health Board provides grant-aid towards these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The involvement of traveller children in begging is being addressed by an <i>ad hoc</i> committee representative of Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Health Board, the Garda, Dublin County Council, Dublin Committee for Travellers, Exchange House and Focus Point.  This committee has identified the small number of families who are mainly involved and there is good inter-agency co-operation in trying to tackle it.  While the law allows for prosecution of parents in such instances there is a reluctance to take this course of action but the parents <Col N="430" /> have been warned that these activities are illegal.</P>
    <P>I understand from my colleague the Minister for Education that the operation of the School Attendance Acts is at present being reviewed as part of the preparatory work for new legislation in education.</P>

In certain circumstances where a premises is vacant it is also possible to claim a refund of rates paid.  The relevant local authority will be able to advise in any particular case.</P>

      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3780/87 provides for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community. Each year a financial allocation is made to each member state under this scheme and the beef is made available strictly in line with this allocation.</P>
      <P>Each year in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare the specific beneficiaries are identified.  To date the beneficiaries have been: recipients of long-term unemployment assistance, excluding smallholders; recipients of pre-retirement allowance; recipients of long-term supplementary welfare allowance; FÁS trainees who were in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance immediately prior to doing their FÁS courses.</P>
      <P>This free beef scheme is not made available to statutory authorities of any kind.  Distribution of the beef is carried out by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
      <P>Commission Regulation 2848/89 provides for the sale of intervention beef to non-profit-making welfare institutions and bodies.  This sale of this beef is carried out at prices fixed in advance.  Institutions wishing to participate in the scheme must apply to be entered on the official list and must give an undertaking to use the beef as provided for in the regulation.  Beef is sold to health boards for hospitals under their aegis which are listed.  Beef is also sold to hospitals not under the aegis of health boards but such hospitals must be approved by these boards.</P>

      <P>The employment incentive scheme is designed to encourage the recruitment by employers of persons who are long term unemployed, early school leavers and other disadvantaged persons.  The eligibility conditions for the scheme reflect this focus and are as follows:</P>
      <P>Persons eligible for recruitment under the scheme must have been unemployed in the period immediately preceding recruitment and must&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  be on the Live Register for the 52 weeks immediately preceding recruitment, or</P>
      <P>(2)  be eighteen years of age or under, unemployed and on the FÁS YOUTHREACH register, or</P>
      <P>(3)  be a disadvantaged person.  This category includes disabled persons who are certified as such by the National Rehabilitation Board or by a rehabilitation centre, travellers and discharged prisoners.  The requirement of having to be unemployed for a specific period will be waived in respect of such persons.</P>
      <P>Employers eligible to participate&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  must be registered as employers with the Inspector of Taxes for taxation purposes and</P>
      <P>(2)  must not have received other employment grants from the State within the previous 12 months.</P>
      <P>In addition any job assisted under any recurring grant from public moneys will not be eligible for assistance under the Employment Incentive Scheme.</P>
      <P>The onus is on the employer to comply with all the conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the scheme in 1992 is projected at £3.36 million of which £1.108 million has been made available by the Exchequer with the balance coming from the European Social Fund.  This level of expenditure will provide 1,380 approximately man years of activity.</P>
