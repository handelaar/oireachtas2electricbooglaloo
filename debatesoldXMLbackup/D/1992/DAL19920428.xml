    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoisech The Taoisech">
      <NameTxt>The Taoisech</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my meeting with the president of <Col N="1538" /> the Law Reform Commission on 8 April last I conveyed to him the concern of the Government at the content of statements attributed to him which had received widespread publicity.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon did not dispute the accuracy of the reports of his remarks.  He informed me that, as president of the Law Reform Commission, he regarded himself as justified in making the statements and that he was unable to offer me any assurance that he would not do so again in the future if he considered it was necessary. On 9 April the Government considered the situation and in view of what had transpired decided that they had no alternative but to terminate Mr. Justice O'Hanlon's appointment as president of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not at present consider it necessary to introduce guidelines regarding public comment for holders of the office of president of the Commission; it had not proved necessary to do so in the past and there is nothing to show in the recent experience that any such &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; would have produced a different result.</P>
    <P>As regards membership of what the Deputy describes as secretive religious organisations, I do not consider it necessary to introduce guidelines and I do not propose to do so.  Different religious beliefs are represented on the Commission and this has been the case since their foundation.  I am aware of no grounds for supposing that the quality of the recommendations made by the Commission to the Government has suffered because of that.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to introduce legislation to amend the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, as there is already provision in section 3 (8) of the Act to deal with the issue raised by Deputy De Rossa in the final part of his question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Taoiseach may not consider it necessary to introduce guidelines for the office of the presidency of the Law Reform Commission, may I take it from what he said that it is now clear that the holders of high office such as the presidency of the Law Reform Commission should not make public pronouncements <Col N="1539" /> on matters of public policy, particularly controversial issues, and that it is more appropriate to the dignity, standing and independence of such high offices that those who hold them should refrain from interventions in public debates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will realise, members of the Judiciary are independent by virtue of the Constitution and it would therefore be inappropriate for the Government or, indeed, the House to draw up rules or guidelines on the conduct or execution of their functions. The functions of the Law Reform Commission are stated very clearly in the Act, that they undertake reports as referred to them by the Attorney General at the request of the Taoiseach.  Those reports are put before the Government and are either accepted or rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked whether the Taoiseach intended to introduce guidelines on the appointment of persons to the Commission having regard to membership of secretive religious organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are secret political organisations, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the former president of the Law Reform Commission admitted that he was a member of Opus Dei, whose constitution, article 189 &mdash; according to media reports, indicates that in order to achieve their objectives they must live in concealment, does the Taoiseach consider that the Government should appoint people from that organisation to positions on bodies dealing with law reform?  Will the Taoiseach agree that when the Government are appointing people to bodies such as the Law Reform Commission it is necessary to ensure that those people are not obliged to act other than in accordance with the terms of the body to which they are being appointed? In relation to the Taoiseach's reference to Article 3.8, in which he implied that <Col N="1540" /> the Government have the power to dismiss a member of the Commission or the president of the Commission, I should like to point out that Article gives no such power.  The terms of appointment are established at the time of appointment under Article 3.8 and matters arising thereafter do not impinge on the Government's power.</P>

      <P>The question is overlong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to determine how many questions were intended.  The Government do not regard the provision of guidelines as necessary. In relation to the latter part of the Deputy's question, I regard changes to the legislation as unnecessary because when a future appointment is made conditions can be attached to that appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that the criteria in relation to political comment by chairpersons of State bodies will be applied uniformly and fairly to all State bodies and that the same criteria will be applied in examining the comments made by the chairman of Bord na Gaeilge as were applied to those <Col N="1541" /> made by the former president of the Law Reform Commission?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your advice on this matter.  However, I will ask a simple question which even you, a Cheann Comhairle, who shows such care in these matters, could not regard as an extension.  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that the criteria in regard to political comment applied in this case will be applied uniformly?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that if a senior member of the Civil Service or of the Defence Forces had made in writing the kind of statements which were made by the person to whom this question refers it would have been considered a very serious matter, possibly warranting dismissal?  In view of the clear separation between the Oireachtas on the one hand and the Judiciary on the other, do the Government intend raising this matter with the Chief Justice to ensure that that division &mdash; which has been there since the foundation of the State &mdash; remains a clear division and is not breached by someone whose personal religious beliefs impel him to so do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Chief Justice and/or the President of the High Court together to draw up particular guidelines in relation to opinions expressed by a member of the Judiciary. The other part of Deputy Quinn's question <Col N="1542" /> is hypothetical and I do not propose to respond to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that all those involved in the Law Reform Commission should be treated equally? Does he regard it as acceptable that a permanent employee of the commission remains in position despite expressing views identical to those expressed by the President of the commission and despite calling for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the referendum of the Maastricht Treaty?  Is it the Taoiseach's view that Mr. Justice O'Hanlon's public expression of views was unacceptable? If so, why is it acceptable for Mr. Binchy, who is employed by the commission, to express the same views?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline the terms and conditions under which the current members of the commission hold office and if such terms and conditions include a requirement that they are not members of any secretive religious organisations?  Will he also indicate whether, in the appointment of a future president of the commission, he intends to publish the terms and conditions of the appointment and if it will include the provision to which I referred?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>At yesterday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland confirmed that, in order to allow a further opportunity for political talks to take place on the basis announced by the then Secretary of State in the House of Commons on 26 March 1991, there will be no further meeting of the conference before the week beginning 27 July 1992. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the principles and terms of 26 March 1991 statement.  The two Governments expressed the strong hope that, with the co-operation of all involved, this further opportunity for talks will achieve a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands.</P>
      <P>The Government warmly welcome the resumption of political dialogue.  We are fully supportive of this process and we stand ready to adopt an open and constructive approach at all times.  This dialogue represents an historic opportunity to lay firm foundations upon which a durable and just peace can be built.  It is potentially of great importance to all the people on this island and we share the common interest in bringing the process forward to full fruition.  With the political process now offering a new way forward, I appeal to those who advocate or perpetrate violence to abandon it in favour of dialogue.  The pursuit of political objectives through violence can never succeed because such means contravene totally the wishes of the vast majority of men and women on this island.  It must surely be clear to all, that 22 years of violence has brought nothing but sorrow and suffering and has not furthered any political objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the possibility of a further meeting with the British Prime Minister, <Col N="1545" /> the Deputy will be aware of the agreement that the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister should meet twice yearly to discuss matters of mutual interest.  This agreement remains in place.  The first of these meetings took place on 26 February 1992 and, as I stated in the House on 3 March 1992, the British Prime Minister and I agreed to remain in touch and to continue the understanding about meetings at least twice yearly.  A date for our next meeting will, in accordance with normal practice, be announced close to the time of the meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in expressing on behalf of the Fine Gael Party our earnest hope that these talks will be successful.  I also very strongly endorse what the Taoiseach said about the absolute futility of violence in a matter of this kind.  I hope that people will listen.  Having said that, I should like to ask the Taoiseach what precise purpose he thought would be served by his decision to explicitly state that the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, would be placed on the agenda for these discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in the House before that it reflected an even-handed, fair and equitable approach to the discussions because if one is seen to come from one side of the divide success cannot be contemplated.  There is a complex community problem in the area and I have always believed that it should be approached on a fair and even-handed basis.  In other words, at the conference table everything should be laid before us, including Articles 2 and 3, the legislation which established the partition of Ireland and the constitutional position of Northern Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK Government, namely the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, has been rendered politically irrelevant by the declaration made by the British Government in the Anglo-Irish <Col N="1546" /> Agreement in regard to support for unity by consent, if consent occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must go back to the basic Act which set up partition.  The constitutional position should be on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 6, will the Taoiseach agree that his indication that Ireland might gain £6 billion on the endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty is contingent on the Delors II package being endorsed by the Council of Ministers?  Will he also agree that the British Prime Minister, the British Government &mdash; and indeed other Governments &mdash; to date have indicated opposition to the Delors II package?  Will the Taoiseach, therefore, agree that he should seek a meeting before the Maastricht referendum is decided here, with the British Prime Minister to ask him to agree to the Delors II package in view of the fact that it is the minimum required for the establishment of the commitments made in the Maastricht Treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being a little facetious if he thinks that any individual member state will commit themselves in advance to saying what they will approve in relation to the Delors II package.  I am sure he is well aware that it is a question of negotiations at the table.  I already had discussions during my first meeting with the British Prime Minister, before the general election in Britain, in relation to the Delors II package and the questions that will arise at the Lisbon Summit.  It was an act of confidence on his part that we had that type of discussion.  Before the negotiations on the Structural Funds in 1989 many people expressed the view that up to £3 billion would not be gained by Ireland, but that was not the case in the end.  I led those negotiations and I have the same confidence with regard to the next set of negotiations.  The Deputy knows this is a matter of conciliation, consensus and compromise.  We are satisfied that we will be well looked after in relation to Structural and Cohesion Funds and that <Col N="1547" /> the sum to be gained will be about £6 billion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be an earnest of his seriousness in this matter in pursuit of Irish national interests if he were to seek a meeting with the British Prime Minister with regard to EC funds, before the Lisbon Summit and before the Maastricht referendum is decided here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House can be confident that we will do everything possible with regard to maximising the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are bound up with the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the break in the intergovernmental conferences which have been agreed by both the British and Irish Governments and in supporting all the efforts in relation to this dialogue, has the Taoiseach given any consideration to a method whereby Members of this House or party leaders and spokespersons will be kept briefed on the discussions that are taking place, because it will now obviously be three months at least before we will have the opportunity to discuss this matter?  Has the Taoiseach considered a method of briefing for party leaders on the progress of the talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the Deputy's suggestion, but he can be assured that there will be an opportunity in this House to discuss these matters. We have a debate coming up on the legislation for the referendum on Maastricht and I have no doubt that opportunity will be used.  I will certainly bear the Deputy's suggestion in mind as the talks progress.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which establishes the constitutional position of Northern Ireland in the UK, can we take it that the placing of this matter on the agenda by the Irish Government indicates a wish by them to alter in some <Col N="1548" /> way the constitutional status of Northern Ireland within the UK?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on the Treaty on European Union, published last Thursday and circulated to Deputies, sets out the origins and purpose of Protocol No. 17.</P>
      <P>It would just not make sense to have two separate questions on the ballot paper on 18 June, one dealing with the Protocol and the other with the rest of the Treaty.  The Treaty was negotiated as a package.  It has either to be ratified in its entirety, or not at all.  Signatory states just cannot adopt an <i>á la carte</i> approach, picking and choosing what sections of a Treaty they will or will not ratify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such an approach would, indeed, amount to a renegotiation requiring the convening of another Intergovernmental <Col N="1561" /> Conference.  As I said here on 7 April, the EC General Affairs Council, for these very reasons, was unable to agree to an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Protocol.  Deletion of the Protocol would also have involved an Intergovernmental Conference to which the same fundamental objection applies.  As other member states made very clear, they did not want the Pandora's box of an Intergovernmental Conference at this stage for any purpose, with the pressures it would bring for other amendments by other states.</P>
    <P>All this is apart from the fact that amendment or deletion of the Protocol would not solve all the problems for us arising from the Supreme Court judgments.  The bar on travel in Irish law implicit in those judgments would still remain.</P>
    <P>As indicated, a separate question on the Protocol is not feasible.  It is also unnecessary because, since the Council meeting on 6 April, the Government have been successful in securing the agreement of our partners to the Solemn Declaration, the text of which is set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Under the declaration, Ireland is a party both to the legal interpretation of the Protocol given by all the High Contracting Parties to the Treaty and to the separate political declaration.  This declaration sets out the favorable disposition of Ireland and all the other High Contracting Parties to amendment of the Protocol, after the entry into force of the Treaty, so as to extend its application to any amendment of Article 40.3.3º, so long as the amendment does not conflict with freedom to travel or to obtain or make available in Ireland, subject to conditions which may be laid down by Irish legislation, information relating to services lawfully available in member states.</P>
    <P>The Declaration will be formally adopted by all member states at the informal General Affairs Council in Portugal on 1-2 May.  It will be part of the documents to be sent by all member states to their legislatures as part of the ratification process of the Treaty.  It will be included among the Treaty documents which will <Col N="1562" /> be officially publicised by the Community along with the Treaty following ratification.</P>
    <P>On its interpretation, we must take it that member states do not lightly set their hands to Solemn Declarations to be included formally with the Treaty documentation. They mean what they say.</P>
    <P>In addition, Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on Law and Treaty states that in interpreting treaties there shall be taken into account, together with any context, any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions.  The Solemn Declaration is undoubtedly such a subsequent agreement.</P>
    <P>The referendum on the Treaty on European Union is being held before that on issues raised by the Supreme Court judgments, first, because of the massive importance for Ireland of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty.  We must have a full voice in the decisions affecting the future of Europe &mdash; the industry, agriculture, economy and international relationships of Ireland &mdash; and, most immediately, in the Council decisions on the Delors II proposals on future financing of the Community.</P>
    <P>Next, there would be no advantage in holding a referendum on travel, information and perhaps other issues first, even if we were in a position to do so. This is because the Protocol relates only to Article 40.3.3º, as it stood on 7 February, when the Treaty was signed.  The protection of the Protocol would not extend to any changes we might make now in Article 40.3.3º, and it is clear that our partners will agree to a change in the Protocol only when the ratification process of the Union Treaty is complete in their countries: that will be on or after 1 January, 1993.  As the Solemn Declaration says, they will then be favourably disposed to extend the protection afforded by the Protocol to future amendments of Article 40.3.3º.  We must deal with the situation now as we know it and not base policy on hypothesis or guesswork.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have just said, it <Col N="1563" /> should be clear that from the standpoint of the right to life of the unborn, a referendum on the abortion issues now, before that on the Maastricht Treaty, would be a futile exercise, and haste could, as we know, produce totally the wrong result.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that it was not the Community that brought about this situation: it arises from our Constitution, our law, and our court judgments; and ratification of the Treaty, even with an unamended Protocol, will in no way prevent or inhibit our Legislature and people from further amending our Constitution in this area, if we so wish.</P>
    <P>I can understand the concerns of those who are apprehensive about the rights to travel and information.  These doubts do not stem from the Maastricht Treaty.  The Protocol, even in its present form, does not take away rights to travel and information under European law, which, of course, is applicable to Ireland.  All EC member states have, in the Solemn Declaration, confirmed that this is the proper legal interpretation which the Protocol will have when the Treaty to which it is annexed comes into force.  While recourse to the European Court of Justice would very probably vindicate the rights in any particular case, it is through action in Ireland in regard to our Constitution and public policy that the availability of these rights can best be generally guaranteed.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper, a referendum will be held in November next to deal with the travel and information issues which arise and with any other questions which, on completion of the Government's consideration of the issues raised by the Supreme Court decisions, emerge as necessary and feasible to deal with by constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, as I said last Thursday, the Attorney General has informed me that once there is a positive vote in the referendum on 18 June, no further State injunctions will be sought by the law officers &mdash; in discharge of the Attorney General's independent and non-governmental <Col N="1564" /> duties under the Constitution or otherwise &mdash; which would interfere with the right to travel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The original action by the Attorney General was in pursuance of his understanding at the time of public policy as expressed in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and it was proper that the matter should have been interpreted by the courts.  Once the people have endorsed a Treaty, to which is annexed Protocol No. 17 and with which is associated the Solemn Declaration, to which, of course, Ireland is a party; it will then be demonstrably clear that public policy as expressed by the people in the referendum does not contemplate interference, consequent on Article 40.3.3º, with rights to travel.  The people are supreme in constitutional matters and once they have expressed their view by voting yes, no further state injunctions will be sought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident that the Maastricht Treaty will be ratified this year by all 12 member states.  There is, of course, no precedent for a member state failing to ratify a treaty negotiated at Community level.  What would happen in the event of non-ratification by one or more member states must, therefore, be a matter of speculation.  The formal position is that the Treaty, to be binding in its present form on the 12 contracting parties, could not enter into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political reality is different.  With the enormous political investment that has been made by all member states, the high probability is&mdash;as, for example, was the case with the European Monetary System in 1979 and also with the Agreement on Social Policy concluded at Maastricht &mdash; that the ratifying member states would go ahead and conclude among <Col N="1565" /> themselves a treaty or agreement which would be exactly the same as the Maastricht Treaty except for the number of participants and any technical changes related to that, leaving a non-ratifying member state in a lower tier as a second-class member.</P>
    <P>Even this scenario may be unduly optimistic, since the Maastricht Treaty so extensively amends and supersedes the existing Community treaties across so many chapters as to make it very questionable whether a European Community could or would be continued in existence, parallel to but separate from European union in order solely to cater for non-ratifying countries.  The point is that outside the union framework, we would have no say in the union, as it develops, and we would have to accept what the other member states thought fit to give us &mdash; a most peculiar and untenable position in which to find ourselves, as a State which has always been a committed Community member, when so many other states now outside it, are queuing up to join.  Can we really think of voting ourselves out on issues which have nothing to do with Maastricht, when so many countries are so anxious to get in?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  First, the option of deletion or amendment of the Protocol is not open to us.  As I have made abundantly clear on a number of occasions, the member states have steadfastly set their face against any amendment of the Treaty or the Protocol, withdrawal of the Protocol or anything in relation to it.  Withdrawal of the Protocol would mean the setting up of another intergovernmental conference and that option is not open.  Therefore let us not go further down that <i>cul de sac</i>.  In relation to the second part of the question, all 12 member states will be signatories to the Solemn Declaration, and member states do not give this type of declaration lightly.  They mean what they say.  Only after the Treaty is ratified by all 12 member states will we be allowed come forward with a change in the Protocol&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 12, does the Taoiseach agree that the Solemn Declaration binds the Irish Government to introduce a constitutional amendment to guarantee travel and information rights and if so, when will that be done?  Second, may I ask the Taoiseach in respect of his statement that there will be no further State injunctions in regard to the right to travel, what is the position in regard to private civil injunctions that might be taken prior to or subsequent to the vote? Third, in regard to Question No. 14, would the Taoiseach not agree that the danger is not so much that Europe might go ahead without us but that Europe might not go ahead at all with European union for 300 million Europeans if the three million people here turn down the Treaty?  There might be a reversion in Europe to a Europe of nation states which caused so much war and bloodshed on this Continent for the last 200 years up to the foundation of the European Community.</P>

      <P>First, in relation to the latter part of the Deputy's question, I agree that there is a heavy responsibility <Col N="1569" /> on us as a nation to ensure the progress of Europe to closer integration.  As I have said clearly in my reply, should we decide to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum it is a matter for the other member states to go ahead with the Treaty with only 11 contracting parties instead of 12.  It is open to them to do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Please let me answer the question.  It is open to them to do that and they will decide what they can do.  It is not in the interests of Ireland or of Europe to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Maastricht on 18 June, and I fully agree with Deputy Bruton in relation to that.  The second part of the question relates to the Solemn Declaration and its basis.  We will be signatories to the Solemn Declaration which fully sets out the clear intentions of the Government in this regard.  To copperfasten what I have said today and last Thursday, there will be a referendum in November that will involve the right to travel and to information, to be regulated by legislation to be passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas, and whatever other issues may require to be dealt with in a constitutional or legislative manner or a combination of both.  Deputy Bruton was quite right when he said some time ago that time is needed for consideration of this matter.  He said &mdash; and I use his own words to Shane Kenny on a radio programme &mdash; he would not rule out two, three or four months in this regard.  It is quite unreasonable to expect the Government to come up with an answer to this complex matter in such a short time. There is no advantage for anybody in doing that.  I have made the position clear in relation to travel after a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will have been passed on 18 June.  I should also like to make clear the converse position which would be the result of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in relation to travel after 18 November next&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23, 34, 37, 38, 56, 65, 72, 84, 85, 319 and 322 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the Commission's proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and of Ireland's approach in the negotiations have already been outlined in this House on a number of occasions. In addition, an up-to-date report on the current state of the negotiations was given to the House on 4 March last.  Since that date, the proposals together with the amendments proposed by the Presidency have been considered further at meetings of high level Community officials, at bilateral meetings between member states and the Presidency/Commission and at the Council of Ministers on 30/31 March.  At the Council which starts today the Presidency will outline the conclusions it has drawn from this series of meetings.  While it is not expected that agreement will be reached at this Council, it is hoped that progress can be made with a view to agreement being reached in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Commission's proposals, in outline or in detailed form, have been before the Council since February 1991 substantive differences remain to be reconciled before agreement can be reached.  At the same time, all Ministers in the Council accept that retention of the current Common Agricultural Policy mechanisms is not a viable option for a number of reasons including the facts that: despite substantial increases in expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy in recent years, farm incomes have not been maintained; expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy is approaching the ceiling for agricultural expenditure; if current mechanisms are retained prices will have to be reduced on an on-going basis but there would not be compensation; Community stocks of a number of important products are at unsustainably high levels; and there is a need for a better distribution of Common Agricultural Policy support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> A number of adjustments have been made to the Common Agricultural Policy, particularly over the past ten years but none of these has provided lasting solutions to these problems. Therefore, it is clear that only a more fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will secure its future and provide a framework to support the agriculture and food sector.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined to this House the unacceptable aspects of the Commission's proposals and my objectives in the negotiations.  While the Presidency has proposed a number of significant changes to the Commission's proposals, they still do not go far enough to meet our essential requirements.  I will continue to seek the necessary changes and will take whatever action is necessary to secure an outcome to the negotiations which safeguards the future of our farming and agricultural-related industries.</P>
    <P>The reform proposals have not been discussed at the European Council to date.  However, the negotiations have to be seen in the context of commitments given by the Council of Ministers and the Commission to take into account the particularly difficult situation of certain categories of producers and certain regions.  Under the Treaty provisions, the Council is also obliged to take into account the objectives of social and economic cohesion in implementing all the common policies including the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Commissioner has given a definitive commitment to the Council that the compensatory payments will have the same status as current market support arrangements and that adequate Community funding will be provided to meet the costs involved.</P>
    <P>A number of studies have been undertaken by bodies and individuals on the impact of the Commission's initial proposals. These indicate, <i>inter alia,</i> that the farming sector would suffer income losses in overall terms, that large scale intensive producers would be most affected and that there would be some consumer gains.  However, as the Commission's proposals have already been modified and <Col N="1579" /> as they will have to be further changed before they are accepted by the Council the full implications of Common Agricultural Policy reform can be definitively assessed only when the negotiations have been concluded.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that the implications of not reforming the Common Agricultural Policy outweigh any effects such a reform might have.  The alternative to reform is to continue the present system which would result in continuous reductions in output and/or in prices to producers without compensation.  This would adversely affect producer viability, agricultural output and, as a result, employment and the overall economy.</P>
    <P>While we would have preferred if the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT negotiations were concluded in parallel, it is now unlikely that the Uruguay Round can be concluded in the near future.  In the circumstances, I believe that Common Agricultural Policy reform should proceed in order to provide a degree of certainty for farmers.  In that situation, however, there must be a clear and explicit understanding that a later GATT agreement will not undermine Common Agricultural Policy reform. This requires <i>inter alia</i> the safeguarding of compensatory arrangements under a reformed Common Agricultural Policy and the maintenance of Community preference. As regards the latter, the proposals put forward by the Director General of the GATT for the conclusion of the Uruguay Round would require the Community <i>inter alia</i> to provide substantially increased import facilities for a range of products.</P>
    <P>The Community has rejected these proposals and the Commission is currently conducting bilateral and multilateral negotiations in an effort to secure the necessary improvements.  At the same time, it has to be recalled that one of the main objectives of the Uruguay Round is to increase trade flows and some increases in imports cannot be ruled out. However, the Community is seeking to ensure that any such increase will be within very strict parameters and that <Col N="1580" /> access opportunities will become available elsewhere for Community and Irish products.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised a specific question and with your permission Sir, I will address it now.  May I assure the Deputy and indeed every Member of the House that the Government together with the Minister for Agriculture and Food will do everything possible to ensure the most satisfactory outcome for the agricultural industry and Irish farmers in the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations. We have already indicated a <Col N="1581" /> number of the positive steps we are taking.  We will pursue the negotiation until we are satisfied that the interests of the nation and Irish agriculture are best served.  If the Deputy wants me to outline the steps we are taking, I will be pleased to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Save us from that.  Will the Minister explain why additional imports of beef and milk are allowed into the Community thus causing a crisis, as already the Community is over-supplied in those products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of these commodities into the Community results from the last round of the GATT negotiations when special provision was made to allow a certain level of imports into the Community.  We are taking every possible step open to us in the GATT negotiations at present to ensure that the Community market is protected for Community producers.  We have very strong views in this country on the protection of the European market for producers from Ireland and other member states.  The Deputy can take it from me that everything that can be done by the Minister for Agriculture and Food will be done. Everything is being done to ensure that community preference is given to member states over outside countries. Deputy Deasy knows full well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread hardship suffered by farmers who made genuine errors in completing the application form for headage payments? The Department imposed heavy penalties on them, although in many <Col N="1582" /> cases the applicants brought the error to the notice of the Department.  Would the Minister agree that a simplified form might help to overcome these problems? The Taoiseach said at the Ard-Fheis that he would specifically address this problem which raised farmers' hopes, but as yet nobody knows what steps have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>

      <P>However in certain cases of irregularities, grants cannot be paid. We are, however, prepared to re-examine the unsuccessful applications to see if it is possible to pay grants to these applicants.  We realise the importance of these grant payments to agriculture. However let me say the number of grant payments made under all headings are at a more advanced stage than they were at this time last year.  A great deal of progress has been made in a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken steps to streamline the system.  We have put in place a simplified application form and we have taken steps to assist farmers in completing the application forms; indeed we have ensured that mistakes will be identified at the local district veterinary office and that farmers will then be assisted to complete the application forms.  Let me say to Deputy Ferris that everything that can be done is being done.  In the cases where grants have not been paid we will ensure that <Col N="1583" /> the applications will be re-examined to see if it is possible to pay the headage grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is already aware that An Post is in serious financial difficulty. The company have suffered losses each year since 1989.  Its accumulated losses to end 1991 amounted to £13.8 million.  The company is projecting a loss of £8.5 million for 1992.  Its annual overtime bill is running at £21 million.</P>
      <P>My predecessor arranged for the drawing up of a Government/Irish Congress of Trade Unions formula for the necessary management/union negotiations.  At a later date and in accordance with that formula he arranged for the negotiations to be held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, with a view to drawing up proposals to achieve breakeven in 1992.  The commission devoted considerable time and effort to this exercise and, in addition, set up an independent tribunal to make recommendations of a priority nature on An Post's recovery proposals.  Between 22 October 1991 and 31 March 1992, 25 meetings took place.  I regret that, despite all these initiatives and efforts, it has not been possible for management and unions to reach agreement on any significant measure to reverse the loss-making trend in An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A formula drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission last October, following an industrial dispute in An Post, made provision for deferment of the first phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> from 1 November 1991 to 1 February 1992, subject to the ability of the company to make the payment. As the company's financial fortunes had not improved in the meantime An Post could not make the payment on 1 February.  However, the company have <Col N="1585" /> reviewed their position in the light of their worsening financial problems and the concern of postal staff about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> payment.  An Post decided to proceed with their priority proposals with effect from 27 April and to make the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> payment, with full retrospection, to their staff on 15 May 1992. The proposals include the employment of 250 temporary and part-time staff to reduce overtime levels in the Dublin area and maintain the quality of the mail's service as the leave season commences.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the unions are resisting the implementation of these recovery measures.  Such action will aggravate an already difficult financial situation in An Post and delay the implementation of urgently-needed recovery measures.</P>
    <P>The development of modern telecommunications services and courier services is providing keen competition for An Post.  The signals from the European Commission are that it will propose liberalisation measures in a Green Paper on Postal Services in the Community. Against that background there is a clear need for change in central sorting arrangements in the postal service.</P>
    <P>The postal service plays a major part in the economic and social life of the community and also provides very important agency services particularly in disbursement of social welfare payments and in attracting funds for the national savings services.  In 1979 a protracted industrial dispute in the postal service caused untold hardship to the staff as well as to customers.  In addition, the economy suffered serious damage.  I am sure that nobody wants a recurrence of that unfortunate dispute.  The community cannot afford a disruption of postal services at this stage.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the unions involved to consider the gravity of An Post's financial position and to co-operate with the company in their difficult task of rectifying the situation.  Postal charges were increased in 1990 and 1991 to generate much-needed additional revenue for An <Col N="1586" /> Post but the increases were not sufficient to resolve the company's financial problems. Further general price increases at this stage could not be justified.  The question of an Exchequer subsidy to meet An Post's day-to-day operating costs is not being contemplated.  Cost-cutting measures in An Post cannot be avoided if the future of the company and their employees is to be secured.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about not only the disruption in mail services now taking place but also the damaging effect that such disruption is likely to have on our international reputation.  An Post are keeping in close contact with the Department of Social Welfare regarding the arrangements for the disbursement of social welfare benefits.  I am sure that nobody would wish to hold pensioners and other social welfare beneficiaries up to ransom.  I am keeping in close touch with the whole situation.  I can assure the House that every possible effort will be made to ensure that, as far as is possible, the commercial, industrial and social needs of the State will not be neglected as regards postal services.</P>
    <P>In my view the appropriate way to settle this dispute is to use fully the industrial relations machinery, including the available adjudication procedures, and both sides should accept and implement the outcome of these procedures.  A long dispute would seriously damage An Post and inevitably result in greater job losses. I appeal to the parties to avoid that appalling prospect.</P>

      <P>May I register my disappointment that the Minister failed to answer the question as to what steps she intends to take to avert disruption of the postal service.  Why is the Minister so blatantly one-sided in relation to this dispute because her strictures were directed in one direction, that of the trade union involved, forgetting that it was management who broke off discussions on 27 March last?  What practical and positive steps does the Minister intend to take to avoid disruption?  Is her lack of urgency similar to that of her predecessor who, on 7 February 1991, said this crisis could <Col N="1587" /> not be allowed to continue and then did nothing to prevent it escalating?</P>

Will the Minister assure the House that she will take positive steps by calling on the management of An Post to cease taking unilateral action and insist that the parties return to the Labour Relations Commission to iron out whatever differences remain?  In relation to maintaining close contact with the Department of Social Welfare can the Minister give an assurance that those persons who heretofore received their benefit by post will receive it by some other means this week?  Is the Minister aware that those who have been receiving their payments by post are being told they will not be delivered by An Post or collected?</P>

      <P>I too am utterly appalled at the general tone of the Minister's reply given that she implied that the workers are holding social welfare recipients to ransom.  Is the Minister aware that in a letter dated 26 February the Labour Relations Commission stated that negotiations should be brought to finality as soon as possible and, if necessary, matters should be put to a ballot?  Given that management withdrew from those negotiations, is the Minister aware that a ballot is now in train and that we are awaiting developments?  Would the Minister not agree that management are totally out of order in taking such unilateral action which is not in keeping with proper industrial relations that are so important in this sector?  Will the Minister accept that this country needs a postal strike like it needs a hole in the head?  The Minister should use her position to try to bring both parties together.  She should ask management to withdraw the suspensions and get down to resolving this dispute.  As we saw in the bank dispute, it must be resolved by negotiation.</P>

      <P>What is involved in this dispute is a reduction of excessive overtime by taking on temporary and part-time workers to perform the work.  In the light of the current unemployment figures, I find it difficult to understand how anybody could object to An Post's proposals.</P>

We all accept that excessive overtime is incorrect and is a scandal.  It damages the company, and I would go so far as to say that it damages the workers involved and should have been eliminated.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most concerned about this matter.  The situation is still developing and is, of course, quite volatile. However, I am glad to say that the vast majority of social welfare recipients should receive their payment in the normal way this week.  For instance, pensioners and most other persons paid at post offices should not be affected in any way by the disruption of postal services.</P>
      <P>The position of claimants paid by cheque, however, requires special attention. An Post have advised my Department that people who live outside of Dublin will receive their payment as usual through the post this week. However, as there will be no postal deliveries in the Dublin area, my Department are making special arrangements for claimants in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The people who are affected are those claimants who live in the Dublin area and who are recipients of any of the following payments: disability benefit, injury benefit, maternity benefit and death grants. The Dublin area for this purpose includes all of Dublin city and most of Dublin county except Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> To enable these clients to get paid, a special cheque collection centre is being opened in Oisin House, Pearse Street, tomorrow.  This centre will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day for as long as the postal disruption lasts.</P>
    <P>Any person who lives in the affected areas and who is due to be paid may call to the special centre on their normal day of payment and collect their cheque.  If they cannot call themselves, they can send someone to collect their cheque for them.</P>
    <P>An advertisement about the opening of the special cheque collection centre will appear in the national newspapers tomorrow morning.  Social welfare clients generally are also being advised through the media not to post any forms, pension books, medical certificates or other documents to my Department's offices in Dublin until further notice.  Instead, they should hand them into any local office of my Department.  Clients living in Dublin may hand their documents in at the nearest social welfare services local office or at the public offices in Oisín House, Pearse Street, Gandon House, Amiens Street, or Phibsboro Tower.  Special arrangements are also being made to ensure that unemployment assistance recipients who are paid by cheque are paid this week.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that I regret very sincerely any inconvenience caused to any of my Department's clients because of the postal disruption.  If this disruption continues for long the problems will inevitably get worse.  For this reason, I hope for everyone's sake that the difficulties in An Post which have led to this disruption are resolved very quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give me some further information?  This week many people will be concerned about cheques that have been posted and that may not arrive at their destination.  Will the Minister consider setting up a free phone service so that the public can contact an official to find out the position?  Is the Minister happy with the arrangements that have been made for Dublin <Col N="1592" /> as I understand only one office will be dealing with Dublin?  Will there be overcrowding? Will people have to wait for long periods to collect their cheques? Will the Minister have another look at that?</P>

That is not to say that if the dispute escalates there will not be difficulties but I am satisfied the Department will be able to alleviate any hardship on social welfare recipients.</P>

I ask the Minister to revise his indifferent attitude and recognise the difficulties facing those people.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1992: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill provides a statutory basis for the taxation measures which I announced in the budget on 29 January. It also contains the legislative basis for provisions which were foreshadowed in the budget, notably in order to prepare for the EC Internal Market, and for other tax policy measures which the Government now consider necessary.  Overall, the Bill marks a further significant step in the Government's strategy of tax reform, as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and our revised Programme for Government. Before turning to the main provisions of the Bill, I would like to outline briefly the strategy underlying the budget and review the economic prospects for the year ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central objective in the budget was to support the fight against unemployment by a combination of soundly based public finances which are essential to sustainable economic growth and structural reforms aimed at ensuring that we get the best possible employment return from that growth.  There can be no doubt that the overall policy on the public finances pursued over the past few <Col N="1777" /> years has been the correct one.  The reduction of our dependence on borrowing, the control of public spending and the easing of the tax burden which this made possible have restored confidence and strength to the economy.  We have, at the same time, achieved major progress in reforming income taxation and improving the equity of the system generally, while also restructuring indirect taxation in preparation for the advent of the Internal Market next year. It is no coincidence that we have to date been able to weather the current difficulties in the international economy with much less damage than we suffered during similar circumstances in the past.</P>
    <P>The 1992 target for the Exchequer borrowing requirement &mdash; EBR of 2.4 per cent of GNP is very substantially below the unsustainable Exchequer deficits of earlier years; indeed, one has to go back more than 40 years to find deficits that represent a lower proportion of GNP. We are now in the position that, even if growth should dip somewhat, the debt ratio will continue to decline.  This is also important in the EC context.  The convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty put a firm obligation on member states to meet challenging budgetary guidelines.  I am happy to say that we now satisfy these criteria and the Government are determined to maintain that position.</P>
    <P>The overhang of debt must be reduced as rapidly as possible so that we can free more of our national resources for other needs.  It is a sobering fact that almost one-tenth of GNP or more than a quarter of total tax revenue must be allocated annually to meet debt servicing costs before the Government can address those spending and taxation priorities which are in the interests of economic development, employment creation and social equity.  We have reduced the burden of debt and debt service costs; the debt/GNP ratio has already fallen from 131 per cent at end of 1988 to 107 per cent last year.  The ratio will fall again this year, and we are determined to ensure that it continues to do so in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>You will recall, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="1778" /> that the Government moved decisively last year to correct a potentially serious slippage on the 1991 budget targets. I can assure the House that we are equally committed to maintaining that discipline this year and will not be found wanting should the need arise.  Over the year to date, however, the indications are that the budget arithmetic is unfolding reasonably in line with expectations. There is some upward pressure on spending, and this is being carefully monitored, but tax revenue is holding firm, even when account is taken of a number of favourable timing factors which combined to boost the first quarter yield by a margin of some 9 per cent over the first three months of 1991.  Keeping the public finances on the right track is central to providing the right climate for the creation of sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>Despite the economic slowdown, Ireland's economic performance last year had many positive features.  GDP growth at about 2 per cent was very creditable in the context of world growth of only about 1 per cent and outright recession in some of our trading partners.  Compare our performance, for example, with the UK, where the volume of GDP fell by 2.5 per cent: our industrial exports rose by over 6.5 per cent, although our export markets expanded by only about 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The year 1991 saw a further general improvement in real incomes, but weaker confidence internationally and continuing high real interest rates saw much of this translated into higher savings rather than spending.  Thus, there was only a modest rise in consumer spending and investment fell in real terms following the very strong growth of the previous two years.</P>
    <P>But despite all the difficulties we faced, employment in larger industrial establishments in the first three quarters of 1991 was up by over 1,000 on average compared with the corresponding period in 1990.  While employment in construction fell, employment in banking, insurance and building societies in the same period was well above its 1990 level. Taking a wider view of employment, and taking into account the indications from <Col N="1779" /> the various tax returns, the picture which emerges is of a significant increase in average non-agricultural employment last year compared with 1990.</P>
    <P>Information on the way in which the economy is performing so far this year is still scarce but there are some hopeful signs.  Exports turned in another strong performance in January, as did industrial output, and the seasonally adjusted trade surplus was one of the best on record. Consumer spending and building investment indicators for recent months show some tentative signs of a modest improvement.  While we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent about inflation &mdash; which rose to 3.7 per cent in the year to February, it is some consolation to note that we remain below EC levels on this score, and that wholesale price increases have been somewhat more modest over this period, at 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Tax returns and employment levy receipts for the first quarter point to employment holding up reasonably well. PAYE receipts for the first quarter were almost 10 per cent ahead of the first quarter of 1991; training and employment levy receipts up to early April were some 11 per cent ahead of the same period last year.  Both figures suggest that the continuing rise in unemployment reflects a growing labour force rather than falling employment.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, the international economic outlook for 1992 remains uncertain.  Last December both the OECD and the EC Commission forecast a slow and modest international recovery, with growth picking up to 2 per cent or more from about 1 per cent last year.  Developments so far this year in the major economies, the US, Germany, the UK and Japan, suggest that the international economic recovery may be slower and more modest than earlier envisaged.</P>
    <P>However, while international economic predictions made at the turn of the year may now be a little optimistic, I think we can still look forward to an improvement in our export markets as <Col N="1780" /> the year goes on.  The UK Treasury now forecast a 4 per cent rise in the volume of UK imports this year compared with a decline of 3 per cent in 1991.  Our agricultural exports should also benefit from better market conditions in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>At home nominal after tax incomes, after allowing for the important mainstream income tax reliefs in the budget, should rise by about 67 per cent. Assuming broadly unchanged savings behaviour, consumer spending should show a modest improvement with growth of around 2 per cent in real terms.  The prospect of an international economic recovery combined with a useful increase in the volume of public capital spending suggest some growth too in investment.</P>
    <P>On budget day I predicted that GDP growth was likely to be around 2.25 per cent this year and GNP growth about 2 per cent.  I see little reason to change this assessment now.  There seems to be a general consensus among private sector economic analysts that the forecasts underpinning the budget were soundly based and that GDP growth in 1992 will be in the region of 2.25 to 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Although total economic growth this year may be only a little better than last year, its composition should be more balanced as between domestic demand and exports.  For that reason, it should also be more employment intensive.  However, with unemployment in the UK likely to go on rising for the foreseeable future and only modest growth on the continent and in the US, job opportunities abroad will be scarce.  Given the projected rise in our labour force, average unemployment here is likely to rise significantly again this year.</P>
    <P>The social welfare spending figures in the budget were based on an average unemployment forecast of about 272,000.  Unfortunately, the average seasonally adjusted live register figure for the first quarter is already about 272,000. It now seems likely that, taking account of the trend in net migration and the extra numbers of school and college leavers who may enter the labour force later this year, the average number on the live register <Col N="1781" /> this year may be in the region of 280,000. The extra social welfare cost to the Exchequer will be of the order of £25 million this year.</P>
    <P>The message from this brief review of economic developments and prospects is clear.  The Government's overall economic strategy is working.  The country's commitment to responsible economic and budgetary policies &mdash; to moderation and improving competitiveness &mdash; is working.  In this period of international slowdown, we are growing faster than our competitors generally, we are increasing our share of world markets and we are further consolidating our national finances. Sound fundamentals stood us well in hard times.  Equally, they can be the springboard for more rapid growth as conditions improve.</P>
    <P>However, there is no denying that a daunting employment task lies before us &mdash; to earn the extra jobs we need; soundly based jobs; jobs which flow from producing more goods and services which can sell in the marketplace at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government in the budget took a number of steps to combat rising unemployment. The reductions in direct taxes will improve incentives, the rewards for enterprise and effort on a broad front. We have agreed with the EC on the provision of substantial funds for a new employment subsidy scheme and for in-company training.  I warmly welcome the fact that these schemes are receiving the full support of the Federated Institute of Employers and other employer organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I strongly urge all employers to participate as fully as possible in these schemes.</P>
    <P>The area partnerships, envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to combat long term unemployment through training, education and enterprise development are now in place in 12 pilot areas.  The public agencies concerned have made the necessary arrangements; the estimated cost to the Exchequer is £60 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>A committee of Ministers, assisted by a working party of officials and private <Col N="1782" /> sector individuals, are examining the recommendations of the Industrial Policy Review Group and the Task Force on Employment.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, there is only so much that any Government can do.  They can make a key contribution by ensuring that their broad policy stance is conducive to employment growth.  We have done so.  They should ensure that, in its detail, Government policy minimises any disincentive effects on private effort and enterprise.  We are doing so, not least through the substantial tax reforms in this and recent budgets.  They should provide leadership on growth-oriented policies. Again, we have done so, but in the final analysis our progress will be determined by how well the private sector uses the opportunity so created.  In the past, they have shown that, given the right conditions, they can create a significant number of new jobs.  For example, between April 1987 and April 1991, net non-agricultural employment in the private sector rose by over 70,000.</P>
    <P>The key to greater employment creation in the private sector is stronger investment and expansion.  In today's conditions, maintaining competitiveness is not enough.  It must be improved.  The recent easing in cost increases in the UK shows we have no cause for complacency. The days of easy competitiveness gains in the UK market are over.</P>
    <P>In these conditions, the pay provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its spirit must be strictly adhered to.  Pay increases under the local bargaining clause can be contemplated only on the basis provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, in particular the need to take full account of competitiveness aspects.  Neither is there room for the attitude that margins can be increased as economic activity strengthens if we are to generate the extra jobs we need.  Higher profits, like higher earnings, are desirable, but both must be earned through increased output if sustainable jobs growth is to ensue.</P>
    <P>All aspects of public expenditure, including expenditure on public service <Col N="1783" /> pay which accounts for more than half of non-capital supply services expenditure, will have to be critically examined to ensure that the significant resources devoted to our public services are used as efficiently and effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the time has come to take a critical look at the influences affecting the costs of public service pay and to examine ways in which the system of pay determination can be made more transparent so that, the budgetary situation facing the Government can be given more weight when rates of pay are being determined.  The necessity for flexibility and organisational change, long accepted in the traded sector of the economy, will also have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Discussions on these important issues have already commenced with some public service unions.  I hope the outcome to these discussions will be to achieve agreement on a new system which better reflects the realities of the competitive pressures which we face in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>In relation to ongoing measures to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the public service, negotiations on the manner in which the local bargaining clause 3 of the current pay agreement will apply in the public service have also commenced.  Clause 3 provides for negotiations between employers and trade unions designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness, with any increase limited to a maximum of 3 per cent of basic pay costs.  However, the emphasis in the negotiations in the public service has to be on measures to improve efficiency and effectiveness to offset any movements in pay.  This approach is essential to ensure that the significant level of resources already required to finance our public services is used to maximum efficiency.</P>
    <P>While I would not wish to pre-empt the outcome of such discussions, I hope that it will ultimately lead to improvements in the quality of our public services which can be provided, in the future, on a more cost-effective basis.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the individual taxes as set out in the Bill.  Income tax is in many ways the most important of all the <Col N="1784" /> taxes.  It yields most revenue to the Exchequer, it exerts a significant influence on the labour market and it is paid direct by more people than any other tax.  This importance is reflected in the amount of attention the tax has received from commentators and advisory bodies over the years.  The Commission on Taxation devoted a very substantial portion of their work to it; so did the National Economic and Social Council, in both &ldquo;A Strategy for Development&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo;.  The OECD, the EC and the IMF have all commented on it.  Most recently, the Industrial Policy Review Group pronounced on it in very strong terms.</P>
    <P>These groups have shown a remarkable consistency in their advice to Governments over the years as to what should be done with our income tax system.  It needs thorough reform, they have said, and the reform should broaden the base of income liable to the tax and reduce the tax rates applying to liable income.  The purpose of this approach is to establish as comprehensive as possible a definition of income for tax purposes, for equity, simplicity and consistency reasons; to reduce as far as possible economic distortions caused by differential treatment of different forms of income; and to ensure that the lowest possible tax rates apply to income, consistent with equity and the need to generate the revenue necessary to meet expenditure.</P>
    <P>A great deal of progress has already been made along this path of base broadening and rate reduction.  Since 1987, despite the difficulties in the public finances, major strides have been made in the income tax area.  These strides were made in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, as well as under the Programme for Government.  More recently, the process of tax reform received renewed impetus with the conclusion of the Review of the Programme for Government, which promised a radical overhaul of the entire tax code, involving a systematic curtailment of tax exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary <Col N="1785" /> tax rates on a phased basis in order to help fund tax rate reduction.</P>
    <P>The 1992 budget will be seen as a milestone on this journey of tax reform.  As well as increasing the general and age exemption limits for the low paid and reducing to 48 per cent the marginal relief rate which applies where income does not greatly exceed those limits, the budget further extended the standard band by £775 for a single person and £1,550 for a married couple; further reduced the standard rate to 27 per cent; and further reduced the top rate to 48 per cent so that we now have just a two-rate system, with rates of 27 per cent and 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>This major package of income tax reliefs, along with the usual renewal of the PRSI allowance, is provided for in the first few sections of the Bill.  It will cost an estimated £168 million in 1991 and £280 million in a full year, and will reduce the marginal tax rate facing over 700,000 taxpayers.  It will improve incentives for enterprise and effort and leave taxpayers with more of the fruits of their own labours.  It is consistent with the objectives for income tax set out not only in the Programme for Government and the review of that programme, but also in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreed with the social partners. It should help to reduce for employers the cost of employing staff.  In this context I appeal to employers, who have long complained about the impact of taxation on the decision to employ staff, to look again and look hard at the improvements this income tax package has made.  Last but not least, these income tax measures mark a further and decisive step in a retreat long wished for by Irish taxpayers: a retreat by the Exchequer out of their pay packets.  It is a retreat with which I am very happy to be associated.</P>
    <P>The rest of Chapter I of the Bill deals mainly with what might be called the bad news; that the major package of income tax reliefs which I have just outlined has to be paid for, and that some of the funding is being found in the income tax system by restriction of special reliefs.  I make no apology for this: indeed, there is a fundamental point to be made here <Col N="1786" /> about tax policy, and with the permission of the House I would like to devote a little time to it.</P>
    <P>It was never expected and never intended by the advocates of tax reform that widening the tax base and reducing tax rates would produce a lower tax bill for everyone.  On the contrary; it was always inherent in this strategy that there would be trade-offs between improvements in the mainstream income tax regime and curtailment of reliefs which benefit limited groups or sectors.  This was common ground among the proponents of tax reform, and was explicitly stated by, for example, the Commission on Taxation.  As the Commission said in their first report:</P>
    <P>... tax reform is a collection of measures, each of which affects some individuals adversely and others favourably.  Those who will not benefit are those who are over favourably treated under the existing system.</P>
    <P>I emphasise this point, a Cheann Comhairle, because since the budget there have been some groups who, while praising the overall thrust of the budget, have gone on to urge that we should, nevertheless, retain the special relief which was of benefit to their particular sector.  It is of course understandable for individuals and groups to look at tax reform in this way, just as it is understandable that many individuals and groups are in favour of rigorous expenditure control for everyone else.  But while this attitude may be understandable, the Minister for Finance of the day must be on his guard against it, if he is to act in the overall interests of the Exchequer, that is, the general body of taxpayers.  I repeat: reform is reform, not a universal lowering of tax rates.</P>
    <P>In saying this, however, I must emphasise that the Government are not restricting reliefs simply to ensure that particular groups are made to suffer.  We recognise that individual reliefs can well have merit and in restricting or eliminating them we do not imply that all were worthless.  But restriction of reliefs is an essential part of tax reform both to generate funds for <Col N="1787" /> reducing tax rates and to ensure that as far as possible income, no matter in what form it may be received, is subject to tax. This process also helps to simplify the tax system for both taxpayers and Revenue alike and narrows the scope for tax avoidance, so making the system fairer; it will also reduce economic distortions, and should help to divert into more productive channels the very considerable brains at present deployed in the tax avoidance industry.  Despite the understandable preference on some people's part that we should have started with other people's reliefs, I believe there is widespread support for the broad thrust of our policy in this regard.  I have described this approach in some detail, a Cheann Comhairle, because it informs and underpins the curtailment of reliefs contained in the remaining sections of Chapter I.  It is against that background that these measures must be viewed.</P>
    <P>I will now go on to deal with the measures individually.  Section 4 abolishes the remaining income tax relief on life assurance premiums.  As Members will recall, the relief has been progressively reduced each year since 1989: its abolition this year will yield some £5 million in 1992.  I announced in my budget statement that the rate of tax charged on refunds of pension contributions was being increased from 10 per cent to 25 per cent with effect from budget day.  The increase was intended to recoup, in some measure, the tax relief already given when the contributions were made.  Section 6 of the Bill confirms the increase but provides, however, that it will not apply where an application for a refund was made before budget day.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 are concerned with the withholding tax scheme introduced in 1987 for the deduction of tax by accountable persons &mdash; i.e. Government Departments, local authorities and the main non-commercial State bodies &mdash; when making payments for professional services. As announced in the budget, the Bill extends the current list to include the commercial State bodies and a number of other non-commercial State bodies. <Col N="1788" /> The new list of accountable persons is set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 abolishes the concessionary tax treatment available in respect of share options granted under approved share option schemes.  Under such schemes, while share options had to be at market price at date of issue of the options, there was no charge to income tax on the recipient: he was liable to capital gains tax only, a charge which arose on his eventual sale of the shares and was mitigated by the indexation provisions in the tax and the small gains exemption.  In the case of manufacturing and Shannon companies, there was a further aspect, in that rate of capital gains tax was determined, not by the date of acquisition of the shares, but by the date of grant of the options, a significant extra concession.  The generosity of the tax treatment of options under approved share option schemes may be measured by the fact that, since their introduction in 1986, over 200 approved schemes were set up, and options were granted over shares worth well over £200 million at date of grant.</P>
    <P>Section 12 ends this concessionary regime, in respect of options granted on or after budget day, 29 January 1992.  The recipient of such options henceforth will be liable to income tax on the difference between the option price and the market value of the shares on the date on which he acquires them: the income tax charge will arise on that date.  This treatment is in line with the recommendation of the Commission on Taxation.  Of course a recipient will be subject to capital gains tax in the normal way on the difference between the market values of the shares when he acquires them and sells them.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the income tax relief available on interest on loans to acquire shares in a quoted company.  The section abolishes the relief in respect of such loans applied on or after budget day, or, if later, the date on which the company becomes quoted and phases out the relief in respect of loans applied before such date.  The phasing out will begin on specified dates: 6 April 1992, where the loan was applied on or before 5 April 1989; 6 April 1993, where the <Col N="1789" /> loan was applied in the 1989-90 tax year and 6 April 1994, where the loan was applied on or after 6 April 1990.  This will ensure that taxpayers whose loans were taken out more recently have a respite before phasing out begins: those with older loans will already have benefited from a significant period with full interest relief.  If later than the relevant one of these specified dates, the phasing out will begin on 6 April of the second-next tax year after the company becomes quoted. The phasing out will mean that relief will be given only on 70 per cent of the relevant interest in the first tax year of phasing out, and on 40 per cent in the second.  No relief will be available in the third and subsequent years.  Section 14 also introduces a general anti-avoidance provision into the relief on interest on loans for purchase of shares in respect of loans applied on or after 24 April 1992. This will ensure that relief is confined to interest on loans applied for bona fide commercial purposes and not as part of an arrangement the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is the avoidance of tax.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 14 is clear. Quoted companies have access to the Stock Market for capital and should not need the assistance provided by this relief in raising it.  In addition, quoted shares in general are valuable, tradeable assets. It is difficult to justify to ordinary taxpayers why they should provide a subsidy for their acquisition.  This is especially so when, as the House is aware, interest relief for most people is confined to mortgage interest and is significantly restricted even for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I promised in my Budget Statement that enabling provisions to establish the tax charge on short term social welfare benefits would be contained in the Finance Bill.  Accordingly section 15 of the Bill provides for the treatment of disability benefit, including occupational injuries benefit and unemployment benefit, and associated pay-related benefit, as income for tax purposes.  The section provides that they will be treated as emoluments for the purpose of PAYE. The section also provides for the making <Col N="1790" /> of a commencement order or orders to bring taxation into effect.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my Budget Statement it was not possible, for operational reasons, to implement taxation of disability benefit from 6 April 1992.  The operational requirements for taxing this benefit are still being examined.  I would, however, like to indicate the lines on which consideration is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Taxation of disability benefit presents substantial practical problems because of the potential interaction between employers, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners and large numbers of benefit claimants.  My aim is to keep this interaction to a minimum so as to avoid imposing excessive administrative burdens on those involved.</P>
    <P>The essence of the solution being considered at present by my Department, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners would involve potential claimants' tax-free allowance amounts being notified by Revenue to the Department of Social Welfare.  The weekly rate of tax-free allowance would be used by that Department when making disability benefit payments, with any excess of the payment over the tax-free allowance being subjected by that Department to tax in the normal way at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.  Where the tax-free allowance exceeded the benefit payment, the intention would be that the excess would be available to the employer for use against any occupational sick pay payments to the employee.  The net effect would be that claimants would have their benefit taken into account in determining their income for tax purposes, and as appropriate, tax would be charged accordingly.</P>
    <P>Taxation under this system, and indeed taxation of longer-term disability benefit and disability benefit paid to claimants without an employer, cannot be introduced until 1993.  However, it may be possible to introduce some limited form of taxation of disability benefit for those in employment later this year, by having employers reduce the tax-free allowance of benefit claimants in employment by <Col N="1791" /> the amount of the disability benefit being paid to them by the Department of Social Welfare.  The net effect of this would be to curtail availability of tax refunds to employees who are claiming disability benefit, thus meeting a core objective of introducing taxation of disability benefit. However, much work remains to be done both in this area and in regard to the longer-term arrangements for taxation, and I am not yet in a position to announce an implementation date.  The operational requirements for taxing unemployment benefit also continue to be examined.  It is still the Government's intention that taxation should begin in 1993.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise to the House that there will be no change in the present tax status of any of these benefits until the commencement date for taxation; I hope to be able to announce a date for this in the reasonably near future as far as disability benefit is concerned.  I would also emphasise that all that will be done will be to treat these benefits as income for tax purposes; the extent, if any, to which taxation will arise in a given case will depend on the amount of other income the recipient has in the same tax year.</P>
    <P>Chapter II of the Bill moves away from the purely income tax measures contained in Chapter I and deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. The first section of the chapter, section 16, provides for the recognition of foreign adoptions for the purposes of these taxes on the same basis as they are recognised for the purposes of general law under the Adoption Act, 1991.  Similar provisions elsewhere in the Bill have similar effect as regards stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax and residential property tax.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the reduction for 1992-93 and subsequent years of the limit on the annual value of shares an employee may receive from his employer under approved profit-sharing schemes. The limit is being reduced from £5,000 to £2,000.  In addition, to cater for the situation where an employee received less than £2,000 worth of shares in the <Col N="1792" /> 1991-92 tax year, he will be able to receive an additional allocation in 1992-93 so as to make up the deficit.  The additional allocation will be deemed to have been made on 5 April 1992, that is, in the 1991-92 tax year.</P>
    <P>In reducing the annual value per employee of profit-sharing scheme shares from £5,000 to £2,000, rather than eliminating the relief entirely as proposed in the budget, I have been conscious of the arguments put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Irish Profit-Sharing Association among others, that profit-sharing schemes can bring benefits in terms of improving industrial relations and enhancing employee motivation.  The £2,000 figure will still provide a generous incentive for the introduction and maintenance of such schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 18 closes a loophole in tax law which enables payments by employers to employees under restrictive covenants to escape with less than a full charge to tax.  Restrictive covenants are covenants between an employer and an employee under which the employee, arising out of his employment, gives an undertaking to his employer which restricts his conduct or activities, and in return receives a payment from his employer.  In keeping with the commitment in the Review of the Programme for Government for a radical overhaul of the tax code involving systematic curtailment of exemptions, tax shelters etc., and in order to prevent increasing exploitation of this loophole, section 18 provides that all payments made on or after 24 April 1992, that is, the date of publication of the Bill, will be chargeable to tax as part of the employee's remuneration and will be subject to the operation of PAYE.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with the exemption from tax of patent income, and dividends paid out of patent income, in the hands of individuals, As the House will be aware, since 1973, income derived from patent royalties has been exempt from tax provided the principal work in devising the patented invention was carried out in the <Col N="1793" /> State.  Since 1975, a company in receipt of tax-exempt income from patent royalties may issue tax-free dividends in respect of the relevant income.  Again in line with the Review of the Programme for Government commitment for radical overhaul of the tax code, and to prevent increasing exploitation by individuals of the patent exemption in substitution for exemptions and reliefs affected by the budget measures, the Government have decided to phase out the exemption in so far as it applies to individuals.  Accordingly, one-third of income from patent royalties and dividends paid out of such royalties will be taxable in the period from 24 April 1992 to 5 April 1993, and two-thirds in the 1993-94 tax year, subject to the condition as regards dividends that where the annual amount in any of these years exceeds 125 per cent of the average amount received over the last four years, the excess will be taxable in full.  The full amount of income and dividends will be taxable in 1994-95.  I would emphasise that taxation will apply to individuals; the exemption is being retained for companies. I would also emphasise that section 35 of the Bill, which I will be describing shortly, provides for the reduction to nil of the formal legal liability for Irish tax of non-resident shareholders, so that non-resident shareholders, whether individual or corporate, will not be affected by the phasing-out of the patent income exemption.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains two provisions relating to company cars.  Section 8 will increase the cash equivalent used for taxing the benefit-in-kind enjoyed by a person who has available for private use a car supplied by his or her employer. The additional yield from the increase in the BIK on company cars will be partially offset by the cost to the Exchequer of the increases from £7,000 to £10,000, provided for in section 21, in the threshold for capital allowances and for allowable running expenses in respect of cars used for business purposes.</P>
    <P>The old BIK rates, that is, 20 per cent of the original market value where all the costs were met by the employer but falling to 12½ per cent where the car only <Col N="1794" /> is provided, were very lenient when compared with the cost of private ownership. When this sliding scale was introduced in 1982, it was intended that these rates would be doubled to 40 per cent and 25 per cent for 1983-84 and subsequent years but this increase never took place.  The increase in the BIK rate to 30 per cent, announced in the budget, is seen as being fair and reasonable having regard to the annual cost for individuals of providing a car at their own expense and the benefit derived from private use of an employer-provided car.</P>
    <P>Equally the Government consider that the curtailment of tapering relief announced in the budget is justified. Tapering relief is available to employees with high business mileage and reduces the BIK charge by varying amounts linked to the business miles driven.  This tapering relief will in future only come into reckoning when business mileage exceeds 15,000 miles; at present the figure is 10,000 miles.  Furthermore, I announced in the budget that tapering relief will not permit the BIK charge to be reduced below a minimum 25 per cent of the basic amount irrespective of the level of business mileage.</P>
    <P>While satisfied that the BIK increases announced in the budget are fully justified compared with the cost of private motoring, I have decided to make certain changes which will reduce the impact of the increases on employees, such as company representatives and commercial travellers, who drive very high business mileage.  The Bill provides for the phasing-in over five years of the minimum 25 per cent charge allowable under tapering relief.  This concession will mean that the minimum charge will be 5 per cent in 1992-93, 10 per cent in 1993-94, increasing by equal amounts to 25 per cent in 1996-97.  The new tapering relief tables are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 20 will introduce a further easement in the stock relief clawback regime for farmers in certain circumstances. It will give them a further year, in addition to the existing two years, in which to restock after depopulation <Col N="1795" /> of herds because of disease eradication measures.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is a technical measure which closes a loophole in relation to the double rent allowance incentive in the urban renewal designated areas.  The intention had always been that the allowance would only apply in the case of leases granted on either new or refurbished commercial or industrial buildings in the designated areas.  The existing legislation, however, permitted double rent allowance to be given to new lessees of an existing industrial building in those areas, irrespective of whether any refurbishment expenditure was incurred on the building.  This section provides, therefore, that qualifying capital expenditure on refurbishment of an existing industrial building will have to be incurred before the double rent allowance can apply.</P>
    <P>I indicated on the publication of the Bill that I intended to bring forward Committee Stage amendments to provide for final and definitive extensions to the current time-scales applying respectively to the Custom House Docks area and to the designated areas generally.  In the case of the Custom House Docks area, the final extension will be for four years, up until 25 January 1997, and for the other designated areas, the final extension will be for one year, up until 31 May 1994.  Fuller details on these measures will be given on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 31 gives effect to the limited four month extension to the section 23 relief for rented residential accommodation which I announced in the budget.  Apart from the designated areas, section 23 relief ended on 31 March last, but for construction projects which had foundations fully laid before Budget Day, an additional four months, up until 31 July, 1992 is being allowed for expenditure to qualify for the section 23 relief. This measure is intended to allow an orderly run-off to section 23 projects.</P>
    <P>I announced in the budget that the exemption from corporation tax on certain trading profits of agricultural and <Col N="1796" /> fishery co-ops was being terminated from 1 April of this year, and section 45 gives effect to this.  The section also contains a number of measures which will ease the transition from exempt to fully taxable status, and which are being introduced to meet concerns expressed in particular by service and liquid milk co-ops.  In summary, the provisions will allow relevant trading profits which are attributable to the pre-April 1992 period in a co-op's accounting year to be exempt, will phase-in the transition from exemption to the standard 40 per cent tax rate by taxing only one-third of affected profits in 1992, and two-thirds in 1993, and will provide that unused trading losses incurred prior to 1 April 1992 may be used for offset against profits arising after that date.  In section 44, trading profits arising to a co-op from supply of milk to another co-op for processing, where the processing co-op is wholly or mainly engaged in dairy processing, will be deemed eligible for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  In addition, section 44 contains a provision which maintains the relative tax position which Bord Bainne had prior to the termination of the co-ops exemption. Profits which Bord Bainne made on distribution of processed products purchased from supplier co-ops were exempt because Bord Bainne is itself a co-op; such profits will now be taxed at 10 per cent, as would be the case if the products were sold by the processing co-op's.</P>
    <P>Section 13 withdraws the partial income tax exemption for the dividends received by individual shareholders in companies which benefit from the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  This relief was being increasingly used in an unintended way by close companies to pay the director-shareholders of these companies partially taxed dividends instead of fully taxable remuneration.</P>
    <P>Section 23 ringfences the losses and capital allowances arising from trades carried on by limited partnerships.  This means that these losses and allowances can in future be offset only against the profits from the partnership trade and not, as up to now, against the other income of the limited partners.  A similar <Col N="1797" /> restriction is being introduced under section 24 for the capital allowances on holiday cottages.  The reason behind these two changes is that schemes were being devised to use these allowances and losses for tax shelter purposes for offsetting against the other taxable income of the investors in these schemes. With the closing off of other tax loopholes, there would be adverse effects for the Exchequer if such schemes were to become widely used.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the new wear and tear capital allowances regime for plant and machinery which was announced in the budget.  The new wear and tear tax depreciation rates are 15 per cent per annum on a straight line basis for the first six years for all plant and machinery, with the remaining 10 per cent being written off in year seven. These rates will apply to both new and second-hand plant and machinery acquired on or after 1 April.  This new capital allowances regime represents a major simplification and improvement on the old system which had three rates and which applied on a reducing balance basis.  It also strikes a reasonable balance between the objectives of encouraging investment and promoting job creation.</P>
    <P>Section 32 implements the budget measure abolishing the tax exemption for dividends distributed out of profits which were exempted from corporation tax under export sales relief or Shannon relief.  The full tax charge on these dividends is being gradually phased-in over the period from 29 January 1992 to 6 April 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 35 deals with the Irish tax liability on dividends distributed by Irish resident companies to their foreign shareholders.  A <i>de facto</i> exemption has existed for many years in regard to this liability, and the formal legal liability is now being reduced to nil to conform with this.  The change is being made in order to assist Irish companies to obtain equity finance from abroad and to remove uncertainty on the part of foreign manufacturing and financial companies which set up operations here.</P>
    <P>Sections 37 and 38 implement the <Col N="1798" /> changes which were announced on 20 December last restricting domestic sourced section 84 loans.  The main change involved is that no new section 84 loans are allowed on and from that date except in the case of loans to projects specified on two lists of approved manufacturing projects which were provided for in previous Finance Acts.  These changes are in line with the recommendation in the Culliton report on this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 39 removes a tax anomaly in the case of banks and general insurance companies which operate in the State on a branch basis.  As announced in the budget, these branches will no longer be entitled to avail of the tax exemption available to non-residents in respect of their profits from Government securities. Their entitlement to loss relief arising as a result of this exemption is also being restricted.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides for a phasing-in over three years of a tax charge on the gains accruing to building societies on the disposal of Government securities.  This change will mean that the societies will in future be charged to tax in the same way as banks on such disposals.</P>
    <P>Section 41 implements the two changes announced in the budget relating to the taxation of life assurance companies.  The first change is concerned with the expenses incurred by a life assurance company in acquiring new business. These expenses will in future have to be spread over a seven year period instead of being fully offset in year one.  This change is being phased in as announced in the budget, but in order to allow the companies more time to make the necessary administrative adjustments, the commencement date is now being put back to 1 April 1992.  The second change is the introduction of a new annual charge on the life companies' unrealised gains on their holdings in unit trusts or other tax exempt investment vehicles.  Since this is a charge on unrealised capital gains, the gains and losses involved are being spread over seven years, and indexation relief will apply to the losses as well as the gains.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 and 180 implement the new <Col N="1799" /> arrangements relating to the bank levy which were announced in the budget. Section 180 continues the bank levy for the years 1992 to 1994 at its 1991 level of £36 million.  Section 42 provides that where a bank increases its corporation tax liability for the relevant tax year by a sufficiently high amount so that it exceeds a specified threshold, all or part of its annual bank levy payment will be off-setable against its excess corporation tax over that threshold.  The specified threshold will be the higher of the bank's advance corporation tax payment for that year or a level of corporation tax arrived at by indexing the bank's average corporation tax liability for 1989-90 and 1990-91 by the change in its profits since 1990-91.  These new tax arrangements will be reviewed in three years time in the light of developments over the period.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides that a company's trading losses and other deductions arising from an activity chargeable at the 10 per cent corporation tax rate will no longer be allowed for offset against the profits of that company chargeable at 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 52 introduces a new incentive for companies to send in their tax returns on time.  The section debars a company, which fails to meet the prescribed tax return deadline, from claiming certain reliefs in a particular way in respect of the accounting period in question.</P>
    <P>Section 53 gives tax relief on corporate donations to the Enterprise Trust Limited, a measure announced in the budget. The trust has been set up by the representative employer bodies as their response to assist the area based initiatives for combating unemployment outlined in Chapter VII of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Section 54 extends until 1999 the existing corporation tax exemption for certain of the profits of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta. The reason for this extension is to enable the company to use these tax exempt profits to service and to reduce its accumulated debts which are State guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The relief from corporation tax for <Col N="1800" /> investment in films, commonly known as section 35, is due to expire on 9 July 1992. As an exceptional measure, this relief is being extended up until 31 March 1995, and this is provided for in section 55 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Chapter VI of the Bill sets out the definitive tax regime which is to apply to oil and gas activities in Ireland's offshore areas, other than the Marathon acreage, and which is designed to improve Ireland's competitive position in attracting oil and gas exploration.  In broad summary, it incorporates provisions included in the 1985 Petroleum Taxation Bill, which was never enacted, updated to reflect subsequent policy decisions.  A particular feature is the provision for a special incentive rate of corporation tax of 25 per cent, which will apply to income arising under petroleum production leases granted by the Minister for Energy before certain specified dates.  These dates reflect the respective relative degrees of difficulty of gaining access to, and developing, commercial discoveries in the offshore areas, as indicated by the duration of exploration licences granted in respect of such waters &mdash; longer licences being granted for exploration of more difficult waters.</P>
    <P>The chapter provides in section 70 for the various definitions and, in section 71 for the ring-fencing of certain petroleum activities.  The 25 per cent rate of corporation tax, already referred to is set out in section 72, Sections 73 and 74 apply ring-fence provisions for relief for losses and capital allowances, and for group relief purposes, with the exception of allowing losses incurred in an onshore mining trade to be set off against offshore petroleum profits.  The treatment of chargeable gains and allowable losses in relation to petroleum related assets is covered in section 75, while section 76 restricts interest expense and charges on income as deductions from petroleum profits.  Section 77 ring-fences the set-off of advance corporation tax (ACT) on distributions made between associated companies, in order to prevent the unintended offsets against petroleum profits.</P>
    <P>Sections 78 to 80 deal with the treatment <Col N="1801" /> of the various allowances for expenditure incurred on production and development and on exploration, both abortive and successful.  Section 81 provides for an allowance on abandonment expenditure and reflects the growing consciousness for the need to protect the marine environment.  Section 82 provides for the valuation at market value of petroleum which, for example, is being sold by a production company to an associated refining company.  Finally, section 83 relaxes the capital gains tax charge which would otherwise arise in cases where disposals and acquisitions under approved changes in licence interests occur before the production stage of petroleum activities.</P>
    <P>Sections 59 to 69 in Chapter V of the Bill are concerned with the implementation of an EC Directive on mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and share exchanges between companies in different member states.  These provisions deal primarily with cross-border transfers of assets.  The reason for this is that cross-border share exchanges are already permitted under Irish tax law and the necessary EC or Irish company law does not yet exist to allow cross-border mergers and divisions to take place.  However, a general provision is being introduced giving the Revenue Commissioners power to grant the appropriate reliefs under the directive in the period between the enactment of the EC company law provisions on mergers and divisions and the subsequent enactment of these reliefs in a future Finance Bill.  The main relief granted under Part V is the deferral of capital gains tax where a company resident in one EC member state transfers some or all of their trading assets to a company resident in another member state.  Since such assets can include development land, a similar tax deferral is also being introduced in the case of a transfer of development land between Irish companies in an amalgamation or reconstruction situation.</P>
    <P>In my budget speech, I promised to bring forward measures in the Finance Bill to deal with the tax issues which arise as a result of capital liberalisation.  These <Col N="1802" /> measures are contained in sections 22 and 209 of the Bill.  Once capital liberalisation is completed, Irish residents will be allowed to open and maintain deposit and current accounts with financial institutions in other EC member states.  This freedom will apply to both individuals and companies.</P>
    <P>Radical changes in the taxation of deposit interest are therefore necessary to avoid possible detrimental effects on domestic financial markets and on interest rates from capital outflows.  The changes are also designed to preserve revenues from interest income to the fullest extent possible, but by maintaining taxation at a realistic level and by introducing a number of reporting requirements to safeguard against the use of foreign accounts for tax evasion purposes. The package of measures in the Bill will allow Irish financial institutions to offer savings accounts to Irish residents which should be broadly competitive with accounts abroad.</P>
    <P>The main points of the changes provided for in the Bill are as follows:</P>
    <P>Companies and pension funds will be allowed maintain accounts which are free of DIRT.  To ensure that this concession is confined to bona fide tax paying companies, there is a requirement that a company on opening a DIRT free account will have to give their corporation tax number to the financial institution concerned. This tax number will have to be certified as correct by the company's auditor.  The financial institutions will be required to send a report to the Revenue Commissioners giving details of their DIRT free accounts including the name, address and tax number of each company holding an account, together with a statement of interest paid on each account. These accounts will be available to companies from the date exchange controls are lifted.</P>
    <P>For individuals, the financial institutions will be allowed to offer special savings accounts and the interest on these accounts will be subject to tax at 10 per cent.  No further tax will be payable on this interest.  There are a number of conditions attaching to these accounts.  As <Col N="1803" /> the accounts are savings accounts, there can be no withdrawals in the first three months of operation of the accounts and all withdrawals must be at one month's notice.  The maximum balance allowed in the accounts is £50,000 and the financial institutions will not be allowed to offer fixed interest rates on these accounts for more than two years at a time.  Only one account per person over 18 will be allowed.  Married couples will be allowed to opt for either two single accounts or two joint accounts.  Like the DIRT-free accounts for companies and pension funds, these special savings accounts will be available from the date exchange controls are lifted.</P>
    <P>Of course, individuals will continue to maintain other accounts which will remain liable to DIRT at the standard rate of tax.  From the tax year 1993-94, the DIRT charged on interest income on these accounts will represent the taxpayer's final liability to income tax on that interest.</P>
    <P>From 1 June any Irish resident opening a foreign account will be obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners of the existence of the account within three months of the opening of the account.  Failure to do so will result in a surcharge of 10 per cent of the taxpayer's liability to tax for the year in which the account was opened, irrespective of the tax loss on the account.</P>
    <P>Any institutions or financial agents which act as intermediaries in the opening of foreign accounts for Irish residents will be required to make a report to the Revenue Commissioners giving the name, address and tax reference number of each resident on whose behalf they have opened an account.</P>
    <P>Similar reporting requirements will apply to those acting as agents for Irish residents investing in foreign collective investment undertakings.</P>
    <P>Sections 56 and 57 provide for the reforms of capital gains tax announced in the budget.  The single rate of capital gains tax at 40 per cent is confirmed, as is the halving of the annual small gains exemption.  This exemption now stands <Col N="1804" /> at £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple.  Section 58 is an anti-avoidance section.  At present capital gains tax relief is allowed when a trader transfers business assets into a company.  This section will confine this relief to cases where the transfer is carried out for bona fide commercial purposes. Sections 203 and 204 extend the tax base for discretionary trust tax.  At present, the tax is not charged to trusts where any of the principal beneficiaries are under 25 years of age.  This provision will lower that age limit to 21 years.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in Part IV for the stamp duty changes announced in the budget.  Section 183 introduces the new £2 charge on ATM cards.  To ensure that this charge is applied in an equitable fashion, two exceptions to its application are provided for.  The first is an exemption for cards which are never used for ATM purposes, the second is an exemption for cards held on deposit accounts where the average daily balance is less than £10 over the charging period.  The Bill also confirms the Stamp Duty (Variation) Order which came into effect on 1 November last.  This order exempts many instruments used in the financial service industry from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with Customs and Excise.  Apart from confirming the various budget rate changes, provision is made for implementing the other initiatives which were announced, with a few modifications.  The Bill also provides for the transposition into national law of the EC Council directive adopted last February for control and movement of excisable goods in the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>Sections 84 to 97 provide a framework for the levying of excise duty on beer on the finished product instead of at the &ldquo;worts&rdquo; (pre-fermentation) stage as at present.  The new system will come into operation on a date to be specified.  The draft EC directive on the new internal market structures for the taxation of beer and alcoholic drinks generally envisages, of course, a 1 January 1993 start.  The actual rate of duty to be applied will be determined in the light of budgetary <Col N="1805" /> circumstances and Single Market constraints then prevailing.</P>
    <P>Sections 98 to 114 set out the revised legal arrangements that must apply to the control and movement of excisable goods between member states from 1 January next.  They will replace the existing border controls on the intra-EC movement of tobacco products, mineral oils and alcoholic beverages.  In the case of commercial transactions, excise duty will continue to be payable to the member state in which the goods are consumed and at the rates charged by that State. Personal purchases of alcohol and tobacco products in other member states will not be liable to any further tax when brought into the State in which the goods are to be consumed.  As in the case of the VAT area, this legislation, including the various requirements and procedures to be followed by the different operators involved, is being introduced at the first opportunity so as to give maximum time to trade interests to familiarise themselves with the new regime.  The Revenue Commissioners have already had discussions with interested parties and these contacts will continue in the run-up to the implementation date.</P>
    <P>Turning to more domestic matters, sections 115 to 124 detail the arrangements for charging an annual excise duty of £100 on amusement machines.  The duty will apply to, for instance, video-based games, skills machines and certain kinds of poker machines which do not return cash winnings or redeemable credits.  It will not apply to the likes of kiddie rides, juke boxes nor to pool tables.  In response to the representations made about the need to take account of the seasonal nature of this business in certain locations I have provided for a concessionary high season rate of £60 which will apply for the six-month period up to 15 September in each year.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in this part of the Bill confirm the following changes announced in the budget: the abolition of the duties on televisions and video players from budget night and on table waters from 1 November 1992; the restructuring of the duty on motor <Col N="1806" /> vehicles involving the reduction of duty on most cars, the elimination of the duty on a wide range of commercial vehicles and the increase in the duty on vans derived from cars and jeeps; the reduction in the duties on petrol, effective from 1 May 1992, and on non-automotive liquid petroleum gas, from 1 July next; and the increases in annual road tax, cigarettes and other tobacco products and cider and perry.</P>
    <P>The present licence fee arrangement for public houses, whereby each premises irrespective of size or location, pays the same annual charge of £100, is, in itself, inequitable and any increase in the flat rate would accentuate that aspect.  That is why, in my Budget Statement, I announced that I intended to replace the current charge for publicans and hotel liquor licences with one based on the rateable valuation of the individual premises concerned.  I saw this initiative as introducing a desirable element of progressivity into the charging arrangements.  However, following representations and contacts with the trade I am prepared to modify the proposal, while still retaining the progressive element.  I now propose to relate the duty chargeable for spirits retailers on licences for pubs and hotels to their turnover. Section 135 provides for the basic provisions for the duty.  However, because of the short period in which the modified approach had to be developed, it may be necessary to bring forward certain refinements on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The licence charge, which will apply equally to public houses and to the bar turnover of hotels, is set at £200 where turnover is less than £150,000 annually; on the best information available to me, up to three-quarters of premises could be liable at this minimum rate.  A sliding scale of increased charges will then apply subject to a maximum of £3,000 for those premises with turnover of more than £1,000,000 a year.  Where publicans carry on other separate businesses in their premises, in conjunction with the pub business, the turnover of the non-pub business will be excluded from the basis of the charge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> While I am legislating for a turnoverbased system rather than the rateable value approach, which was my original intention, I have no hesitation in saying that if I should find that the turnover basis for the charge proves unsatisfactory, for whatever reason, I will revert to the rateable valuation proposals.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the detailed provisions for the new system, I sought to ensure that, as far as possible, all holders of liquor licences would be treated fairly and equitably, having regard to the different nature, conditions and scope of the various types of licences involved. Hence, the rates of duty on other categories of liquor licences are also being increased substantially.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made for the duties on other excise licences, e.g. on bookmakers, gaming, exemption orders, etc. to be increased.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a number of technical tidying-up measures.</P>
    <P>In the budget I announced that the Finance Bill would contain provisions to enable the Minister to extend tax clearance to licences such as those for pubs, dance halls, employment agencies, bookmakers and so on.  It was decided to concentrate initially on liquor licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  Pubs, off licences, supermarkets, hotels and restaurants licensed for the sale of spirits, wines, beers, etc. will have to have a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners when they seek to renew their licences later this year.</P>
    <P>Section 136 amends the Finance Act, 1910, to require applicants for liquor licences to produce a tax clearance certificate. Section 221 defines what tax clearance means and to whom it shall apply.  Under the Bill individuals, companies or partnerships seeking or renewing a licence will have to meet all their obligations in respect of income tax, VAT, corporation tax, PAYE-PRSI and capital gains tax as a condition of getting their licences.  The Bill also provides for an appeal against refusal of a tax clearance certificate.  In the event of an appeal against the refusal of a tax clearance certificate, <Col N="1808" /> the Bill provides that if a licence is already in existence that licence will continue in force and in the case of a new application a temporary licence will issue pending the final determination of the appeal.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this Part of the Bill, I would point out that the Bill as published does not include the legislative provisions relating to the replacement registration charge to apply to motor vehicles when the existing excise duty is abolished as a result of EC Single Market requirements. These measures will, however, be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the registration tax will be the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners so as to protect the large Exchequer revenue involved &mdash; VAT as well as excise.  That office will have total responsibility for the registration of vehicles, as well as for the assessment, collection and control of the new tax.  It will be collected, in the main, through dealers under Revenue control, and will be administered and controlled through the network of Revenue offices around the country.  This will ensure a local service to dealers and members of the public, as well as helping to absorb a sizeable number of surplus customs and excise staff in the various locations.</P>
    <P>The role of the Garda in relation to the enforcement of road tax will be supplemented by an enhanced resource of Revenue officials as part of Revenue's enforcement of the new registration tax. Of course, road tax itself, both initial and renewals, will continue to be administered by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill gives effect to changes in VAT law.  On this occasion, in addition to confirming the main changes announced in my budget day speech, I am providing for the transposition into national law of the EC Council directive which sets out the new rules for the levying, collection and control of VAT with effect from 1 January 1993, when border controls disappear.  So as to ensure that revenue collection is safeguarded in this new situation, the Bill will also include provisions to enhance Revenue's control and enforcement powers.  Essentially, the <Col N="1809" /> proposed measures mirror those currently applying to intra-Community trade under customs law but which will no longer be applicable to such trade after the turn of the year.  I am also using the opportunity offered by this fundamental revision of VAT law to provide for a number of general tidying-up measures.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms the rate changes announced on budget day.  A range of goods and services at the 12.5 per cent rate are being increased to 16 per cent, in line with decisions taken at EC level, and the farmers' flat-rate addition, along with the associated livestock rate, are increased from 2.3 to 2.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the interests of both equity and base-broadening, I announced my intention in the budget to apply VAT to bottled waters, frozen desserts and corn or maize-based snack foods, all of which are currently zero rated; similar action was signalled in regard to commercial sporting and leisure facilities and agricultural services supplied by farmers, both of which are currently exempt from the tax. Provisions to implement these measures are included in the Bill, but with some modifications to my original plans.</P>
    <P>In response to representations from the soft drinks industry, I am synchronising the dates for the imposition of VAT on bottled waters and for the full abolition of excise duty on soft drinks generally. The effective date for both measures will now be 1 November.  The taxation of frozen desserts and corn and maize-based snack foods will go ahead on 1 July as originally intended, as will the taxation of commercial sports and leisure facilities.  In regard to this latter activity, however, I am now proposing application of the 12.5 per cent rate instead of standard-rating to put it on a par with entertainment services generally. I must emphasise again that non-commercial bodies providing sports and leisure facilities will not be affected by this change.</P>
    <P>In regard to agricultural services supplied by farmers, the Government have decided that, because of the vital role that artificial insemination services play in the development of the national herd, <Col N="1810" /> taxation should not apply in this area. Moreover, to streamline the application of VAT in the general agricultural sector, it is proposed to reduce the rate on technical assistance services and farm relief services, variously at 16 and 21 per cent, to the 12.5 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>Moving on to the other measures in the Bill, Deputies will see that very many sections of the existing VAT Acts are being amended.  This is to cater for the post-1992 situation in which border controls disappear and where movements of tradeable goods between member states will not be monitored for tax purposes at point of entry to the State.  The basic principle underlying the new transitional system is that, as at present, VAT on intra-Community sales will be payable in the member state where the goods are consumed.  This taxation at destination system will apply at least until the end of 1996 when a changeover is envisaged to a regime based on payment of tax in the country of purchase &mdash; this is the so-called origin scheme.  The detailed operational rules underpinning the transitional destination-based regime have been set down in an EC Council Directive. The earliest possible opportunity is being taken to legislate for these changes, so as to enable businesses to acquaint themselves with the revised procedures and requirements as far as possible in advance of the system becoming operational.</P>
    <P>As far as traders involved in cross-border trade are concerned, the essential feature of the new regime will be the disappearance of formalities at borders, such as the lodging of official documentation and the physical checking of goods; in future, compliance will be based essentially on ex-post accounting supported by traders' records.  While the general rule for intra-Community trade will be that VAT will be due in the country of consumption, private individuals will be able to buy for personal purposes most goods tax-paid in the member state of their choice.  However, special rules will ensure that it is the country of consumption who collect the tax on sales of new vehicles and mail-order sales.  Full <Col N="1811" /> details of how these arrangements will work are provided for in the Bill.  As is usual when such momentous changes will be prone to occur in taxation systems, the Revenue Commissioners will be disseminating detailed information through leaflets and seminars so that taxpayers are fully informed as to their changed responsibilities in good time for the changeover.</P>
    <P>Central to the Single Market concept is the dismantling at frontiers of customs controls for tax purposes.  This will inevitably lead to a diminution in Revenue's capability to ensure the security of VAT, unless alternative means of policing the movement of intra-Community goods are placed at their disposal.  It is incumbent on the Minister for Finance, on the Government and on the Houses of the Oireachtas to provide the ways and means for the Revenue authorities to safeguard the collection of taxes so that the public finances may be maintained in sound order.  To meet my responsibilities in this regard I am proposing that, in addition to a general extension of Revenue powers to which I will refer separately, enhanced powers will be granted to VAT officials for the purposes of combatting the new forms of fraud that will be prone to occur as a result of the abolition of frontier controls.  As I said, what is basically involved is the transfer of customs powers currently exercised at the frontier to authorised VAT staff in limited specified circumstances.  The powers in question are those of search and arrest, as well as the right to seize goods.</P>
    <P>New reporting requirements will also be introduced.  Furthermore, where persons with a history of VAT evasion or fraud are concerned, Revenue will be given the right to demand financial security as a guarantee against future compliant behaviour.  I cannot stress sufficiently strongly that no legitimate trader has anything to fear from the implementation of these additional anti-fraud measures.  Indeed, I would be failing in my duty to all law-abiding taxpayers if I did not move instantly to replace those controls which otherwise <Col N="1812" /> will be lost to Revenue as a result of internal market obligations with other effective means of ensuring tax compliance.</P>
    <P>Removal of border control checks will also entail abolition of VAT at point of entry for intra-Community trade: as I said at budget time, this will give rise to an Exchequer cash flow loss of some £200 million.  While good progress has been made in indentifying how this potential shortfall in the public finances can be made good, processing the sheer volume of other VAT items in the Bill has meant that final decisions on precise replacement measures for the VAT collected at point of entry have had to be held over. I can tell the House, however, that the ongoing examination is concentrating on ways of advancing VAT liabilities generally. My aim would be to have full details of the new provisions ready for inclusion in a further Bill later this year.</P>
    <P>With the increasing need to audit the returns of taxpayers within self assessment, it has become clear that the existing Revenue powers to examine trading records and other documents with a bearing on tax liability are inadequate.  The provisions in Part VII dealing with the inspection by authorised officers of various records, address this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Sections 205 to 207 relate to the obligation by third parties to make certain returns of information to inspectors of taxes and the inspector's rights to audit this information.  Section 210 deals with record-keeping for tax purposes and extends the meaning of records to include documents relating to sources of income and linking documents prepared in the course of making of business accounts.</P>
    <P>Section 211 extends the powers of authorised officers to enter premises to inspect documents and records.  It permits officers to search premises for records where these are not produced. It provides that an officer may enter a private residence only at the invitation of the occupant or on foot of a warrant issued by the District Court.  Sections 212 and 214 contain provisions for the supervision of the PAYE system and the construction industry tax scheme broadly <Col N="1813" /> similar to those contained in section 211. The Bill also provides for the extension of the construction tax scheme to forestry and meat processing operations.  Section 215 provides that Revenue officers, in carrying out their powers of inspection under sections 211, 212 and 214, may be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána who is given the power of arrest in the event of obstruction.</P>
    <P>Section 218 empowers an inspector to require the submission of a statement of affairs, assets and liabilities, where no return of income is filed or he is dissatisfied with the return submitted.</P>
    <P>Section 220 extends the Revenue Commissioners' powers to attach amounts owed by a third party to a taxpayer who has defaulted in paying tax.</P>
    <P>Sections 223 and 224 provide for a further development of the self assessment system in that PAYE directors and their spouses will now be obliged to make returns of income without being served with notices to do so.  Also these returns may be subject to an audit by an inspector of taxes and to the imposition of the 10 per cent surcharge for late filing.</P>
    <P>Sections 225 and 226 provide that details of paper-for-paper transactions must in future be supplied in tax returns. Section 227 increases penalties under the Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>Finally, regarding the extension of Revenue powers, I would stress that these powers are necessary to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners can tackle tax evasion effectively, and that they are, in any event, circumscribed in the legislation. Moreover, the board of the Revenue Commissioners have emphasised that the officers concerned will receive appropriate training and guidance in the use of these powers, particularly as regards entry to, and searches of, premises, and that the use of the powers will be closely monitored by the board.  I would emphasise that the compliant taxpayer has no grounds for concern; on the contrary, it is in the interest of the general body of taxpayers that the authorities should be able to ensure that those who fail to pay taxes properly due can be detected and successfully prosecuted, <Col N="1814" /> and that avoidance practices can be addressed promptly.</P>
    <P>The Bill as usual contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, some of which I have already mentioned.  Section 228 contains the usual provision relating to the Capital Services Redemption Account.  Section 229 provides that, in the eventuality of the Dáil being dissolved after the Second Stage of the Finance Bill is passed by the Dáil but before the Bill is enacted, any period when the Dáil is dissolved will be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the statutory deadlines governing enactment of the Bill.  Section 230 provides for the payment direct from the Central Fund of any remittance falling due under the terms of the 1959 Agreement between the State and Marathon Petroleum.</P>

      <P>Before concluding I would like to draw attention to the Government's plans for further legislative provision in the fiscal area during 1992. A second Finance Bill, to be introduced in the autumn, will complete the programme of fiscal legislation required by the internal market, covering those areas where the relevant EC Directives have still to be adopted; this will also provide for the domestic measures needed to offset the adverse cash-flow implications for the Exchequer in 1993 of the ending of VAT at point of entry on goods sourced in other EC member-states.  Finally, this second Finance Bill will contain the legislative provisions for a new fringe benefits tax as announced in the budget, as a means of ensuring the effective taxation of such forms of remuneration and of broadening the tax-base, and which is to come into operation from 6 April 1993.</P>
      <P>In this opening address I have outlined for Deputies the Government's approach to general economic issues as well as detailing the more significant elements of this Bill.  I look forward to the opportunity at the end of Second Stage and on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail the individual sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Finance Bill repeats and reinforces the errors of the budget.  It fails to address the enormous problems facing the country, in particular the problem of unemployment.  It also fails to take advantage of the opportunities of the new Europe on whose edge the country is now poised.</P>
      <P>The Bill is anti-work and anti-enterprise. It discourages risk taking and rewards fence-sitting and playing safe.  It marks the first increase in the EBR since 1986 and it moves fiscal policy further away from the medium-term target of a balanced budget in 1993 and the longer-term target of reducing the national debt to 60 per cent of GNP by 1997.  It is the product of a Government in conflict and has all the hallmarks of a bad compromise between the ideological posturing of the Progressive Democrats and the expediency of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Of all the missed budgetary opportunities in recent years, this is the greatest. Never before has the country required greater vision in the application of fiscal policy to solve the country's problems.  Never before has there been such a failure.</P>
      <P>One of the most interesting aspects of the Finance Bill is the disparity, indeed the contradiction, between the contents of the Bill and the rhetoric with which the Bill and the budget have been presented.  To put it quite simply, neither the budget nor the Finance Bill do what their advocates claim they do.  The matter belies the words right through the Bill and one needs an insight into the conflicts between the parties in Government at the Cabinet table to understand how this came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Government, renegotiated between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats last autumn, gave a solemn commitment to reduce the marginal rates of tax to 25 per cent and 44 per cent.  This was to be done in a revenue neutral manner.  Whatever was given on the swings would be taken away on the roundabouts and the document was quite <Col N="1816" /> precise in identifying the particular Peter who would be robbed to pay Paul.  Tax breaks, tax avoidance schemes and tax reliefs were to be abolished to fund the reductions in income tax, according to the agreed programme.  The Minister has again today stated that that, in effect, was the taxation intention.  Government spokesmen, and particularly Progressive Democrats spokesmen, said that almost limitless funds were available for PAYE income tax reductions if reliefs and breaks were abolished.  One Progressive Democrat Deputy claimed that sums amounting to about £1.5 billion were available and the Government spin-doctors placed juicy items in the media suggesting that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners were amazed at the possible yield that was pointed out to them when they ran certain Progressive Democrats programmes through their computer.  Yet on budget day, when the Minister for Finance announced the reduction of the top rate of tax to 48 per cent and the standard rate to 27 per cent at a cost of £168 million he could only find £37 million of that from the abolition of reliefs, breaks and tax avoidance measures; and £15 million of that £37 million came from the changes in the taxation of company cars.</P>
    <P>What happened is quite simple.  The only reliefs whose abolition would provide the Government with the large sums of money they required to fund their tax package was the abolition of mortgage interest relief and VHI relief.  The Progressive Democrats sought their abolition and Fianna Fáil resisted.  The theory of Progressive Democrats tax policy was admitted by the Government but the wherewithal to fund it was refused.  Progressive Democrat ideology crashed into Fianna Fáil expediency and the debris is all over the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The political fallout from this political explosion has very serious consequences. First, a very large number of tax breaks have been abolished for a very small yield without any real examination of the benefits of these tax breaks.  The reasoning of the Progressive Democrats is that all <Col N="1817" /> tax breaks are wrong and so must be abolished.  This is an absolutely ludicrous position.  The use of tax reliefs and tax breaks to encourage certain desirable kinds of social and economic behaviour is a feature of the tax code of every developed country, and to adopt a purist approach which claims that all tax claims are wrong as an instrument of social and economic policy is plain daft, and the daftness is illustrated time and again in this Finance Bill.  Measures are abolished which were introduced in the tax code in the first instance to encourage enterprise, investment and job creation through risk taking while those in sheltered employment are rewarded.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures taken will have a most adverse effect on enterprise and on the work ethic, and at the end of the day the yield is small, because if we omit the measure on the taxation of company cars, the total yield from the abolition of all these reliefs that the Minister recites like a menu is £20 million.</P>
    <P>Because the Government failed to find the yield to fund the tax cuts in the way they said they would and said that they had done, they had to look elsewhere for revenue.  They got it in two places.  They increased borrowing and VAT receipts. Both of these measures run absolutely counter to the commitments made to our EC partners and are totally inconsisent with the obligations the Government intend undertaking under the Treaty of Maastricht.  It is not generally realised that as a result of the Taoiseach's last budget and the first budget of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, the real EBR has been doubled in the last two years.  This has been done at a time when the Government are committed to a balanced budget in 1993 and when they are urging the electorate to undertake the far more onerous target of reducing the debt as a percentage of Gross National Product to 60 per cent by 1997.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill and the budget it underpins are not consistent with the achievement of these targets.  They are not consistent with European economic and monetary union.  They are not consistent with the Government advocacy of <Col N="1818" /> a yes vote on the referendum on 18 June next and they are certainly not consistent with prudent domestic fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>This strategy might be acceptable if the increase in EBR was merely a once off blip in a declining graph but, on the Minister's own admission, next year will be a particularly tight fiscal year.  The full year effect of the Government's increased expenditure programme must be paid for.  For example, the £168 million which the income tax package cost in nine months this year will cost £260 million in a full year, on the Government's own figures.  The public service pay which the Government deferred to next year must be paid.  The loss of revenue due to the abolition of VAT at the point of entry must be made good.  The loss of revenue for the changes announced in the DIRT in this Finance Bill must be made good and the Government must fulfil their medium term target of a balanced budget.</P>
    <P>I think this is mission impossible.  I suspect that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance know this quite well; that it is their fullest intention to cut and run to the country at the first available opportunity in the autumn in the hope that if they win the election they can inflict a programme of austerity on this country without fear of the electorate but if on the other hand they lose, as has been the tradition of the Minister's party, they will leave the unpalatable tasks to other people.</P>
    <P>The third adverse effect of the Government's failure to fund their income tax reductions by the abolition of tax breaks and reliefs, as they said they would, is that they have raided VAT receipts to do so. The Government have a stated commitment and obligation to our European Community partners to simplify the VAT code and to introduce two rates of VAT &mdash; a higher standard rate and a lower rate for a small number of goods and services.</P>
    <P>Some progress towards these ends was made in recent budgets but this progress was cancelled out in the last budget and in this Finance Bill.  The 12.5 per cent rate of VAT is being increased to 16 per <Col N="1819" /> cent and the proceeds are not to be used, as everybody expected, to reduce the 21 per cent rate but to fund the Progressive Democrats income tax package which they could not fund, as they said they would, by abolishing tax breaks and reliefs and dealing with tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>Rather than simplifying the VAT code by having two rates &mdash; which is what the Government are committed to doing &mdash; we will have six VAT rates; the 2.7 per cent rate at which farmers will receive a rebate, the zero rate which applies in respect of 44 per cent of public consumption, the 10 per cent rate, the 12,5 per cent rate, the 16 per cent rate and the 21 per cent rate.  If we are to believe the Government, this is progress towards tax harmonisation, two VAT rates and a simpler VAT code.</P>
    <P>I was amused by one aspect of the Minister's speech.  He said that the zero rating for corn-based and maize-based snacks is to be abolished &mdash; Deputy Foxe will appreciate this as he was a member of the trade before he became a Member of this House.  Is this the Minister who will go down in history as the man who taxed peanuts?  That is what he seems to have in mind in abolishing the zero rating for corn-based products.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The most tragic effect of the behaviour of the Government is that there is not one single job creation measure in the budget, while several sections of this Finance Bill are going to cost us jobs.  Enterprise and risk taking are discouraged while sedentary or low-risk activity is encouraged.  The changes in VAT and taxation on holiday cottages will have an adverse effect on the tourism industry.  Co-op tax, tax on company cars, capital gains tax relief and the increase in the cost of a pub licence, which will result in some pubs being closed, will cost us jobs.  Yet, I cannot identify one single proposal anywhere in the Finance Bill which is specifically geared towards creating a single job anywhere in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> Nothing illustrates the Government's attitude to enterprise and risk taking and to investment in job creation better than the changes announced in the deposit interest retention tax in the Finance Bill. Persons who put their savings into certain deposit accounts will pay income tax at the rate of 10 per cent on unearned income up to approximately £5,000 for a single person or £10,000 for a married couple.  If a married couple have £100,000 either here or abroad and put it into one of the Minister's new special deposit accounts they will pay tax at the rate of 10 per cent and this will fulfil their total tax liability on unearned income because, as the Minister stated in his speech again today, there will be no requirement to make any return on that income to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>If a person is working they will be taxed at the rate of 27 per cent or 48 per cent but if a person has unearned income or money on deposit they will pay at the rate of 10 per cent.  If a person has savings and wants to invest them, first they will accept the risk in making the investment in the free market economy and if they make a profit they will be taxed at the marginal rate, which will be either 27 per cent or, more likely, 48 per cent.  Yet, if a person sits at home and leaves the money in one of the Minister's special deposit accounts they will pay at the rate of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The banks are picking up this ball already.  I am aware that certain banking people are already saying that they will introduce special deposit schemes under which they will give a person 10 per cent net straight up and meet the tax liability themselves.  Is this consistent with a society where there is record unemployment and where investment is necessary to create jobs with the rewards being geared towards sedentary and low-risk activity?  All the savings will not be put into the Minister's new deposit accounts as the money will have to be left on deposit for three months in the first instance and a month's notice will be required before it can be withdrawn but in relation to normal deposit accounts with the banks and building societies <Col N="1821" /> deposit interest retention tax will be deducted at the standard rate of income tax, 27 per cent.  Again, this will meet the full liability and there will be no requirement to make a return to the Revenue commissioners on the interest earned on such deposit accounts.</P>
    <P>I should make the point that this is the wrong balance in a system where unearned income will be taxed at the rate of 10 per cent or 27 per cent depending on where a person puts it and earned income will be taxed at 27 per cent or 48 per cent.  I know what the Minister is trying to do; he is trying to protect the revenue yield but in protecting the revenue yield he will distort the savings market in the country to such a degree that he will slow down the rate of activity.</P>
    <P>The advantage now rests with the &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; sector of society who have money rather than with the risk takers, the enterprise people and all those who were held up as role models as recently as last week by the Minister for Education who expects every teacher in the country to be a promoter of the enterprise culture and entrepreneurship, even with four year olds.</P>
    <P>This measure does not make sense.  It is anti-jobs, anti-enterprise and anti-risk taking.  It will reinforce attitudes and certain sedentary activities and will not create any jobs.  I do not think anything could be framed in a manner which is more likely to discourage risk taking and enterprise than this measure which outlines the way DIRT will be dealt with in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a similar discouragement for small investors in the equity market and the balance of advantage has been swung by the Minister in favour of deposit accounts and against investment in equities. Everyone will not set up their own business and working people have a day's work to do but some people who have money to spare might buy a few shares in the banks or manufacturing industry in any of our publicly quoted companies. This small injection of capital by numerous small savers could be the investment which creates jobs but what does the Minister do?  He has decided to halve the <Col N="1822" /> relief on capital gains which small savers could avail of.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, small savers cannot get into the gilt market at present as there is no real gilt market for small savers.  Neither is there any market for the small saver at present in Government paper as it is monopolised by the big players.  This is an item which has been raised time and again.  Therefore it will not be invested in Government paper or in the gilt market while it is unlikely that it will be put into self-generating new risk enterprises; rather it will be put into the Minister's new deposit accounts.  The Revenue Commissioners and the people responsible in the Department of Finance will be happy that the yield from DIRT will be saved but where is the enterprise, risk taking, investment and job creation as we move inexorably towards a figure of 300,000 unemployed?  This measure will have to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister one question at this stage which he may answer on Thursday.  Is it also the intention, at 10 per cent or at 27 per cent, apart from the fact that there will be no further tax liability for the person with money on deposit, that the Revenue Commissioners will not look behind the money at any future stage and, because it will not, be notifiable, that no attempt will be made to see whether this money was taxed previously?</P>
    <P>We are talking about the Minister organising a scheme because he is faced with removing exchange controls.  He has to bring down the rate of DIRT so he is trying to broaden the base by allowing shifty people, who did not pay their taxes, to bring their money back and to put it into deposit accounts here.  It is a question of getting the hot money back to this country where it will attract a guaranteed 10 per cent interest rate.  It is that kind of hot money, chance-my-arm culture, which has left this country in the State it is and it is being encouraged by one of the few officers of Government specifically mentioned in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not see a single job creation measure in the Finance Bill.  It is difficult to see how 15 persons in Cabinet, all of <Col N="1823" /> whom no doubt agree that unemployment is the greatest problem facing the country, can have sat idly by while this blueprint for joblessness passed before them.  The Progressive Democrats, of course, will claim that the tax reform proposals, which systematically reduce the marginal rate of tax, even though most taxpayers continue to pay the same &mdash; or extra &mdash; taxation, will put people back to work.  We have been preached at by the Progressive Democrats inside and outside this House for many years on the connection between the marginal rate of tax and job creation. They have elevated the reduction of the marginal rate of tax and the idea of the tax wedge to a kind of new Jerusalem status.  As in other matters, they have totally over-sold their case, their claims at this stage are downright dishonest.  Could someone on the Government side &mdash; preferably a Progressive Democrat Minister &mdash; answer the following simple question? If there is such a close connection between the marginal rate of tax and job creation why, when over the last few years the standard rate of income tax was reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the higher rate brought down to 48 per cent, was it accompanied by the highest level of unemployment since the State was founded in 1922?  I thought the theory was that if you brought the marginal rates down jobs will be created in parallel.  Now that the rate has been reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent where are the jobs?  Could somebody also explain how a further reduction in marginal rates of tax, from 27 per cent to 25 per cent and from 48 per cent to 44 per cent, will suddenly press the magic trigger of job creation?  When the large adjustment of a reduction from 35 per cent to 27 per cent did not work, how will the small adjustment from 27 per cent to 25 per cent suddenly create a boost in job creation?  It is time to admit that they based their high-falut in theory on very slim evidence.  It has now been put to the practical test and there is really no connection between the marginal rate of tax and job creation.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In fairness, they do not believe them.  They think that policy is a load of nonsense but, for political reasons, they were not prepared to stand up and be counted in regard to the issue.  They went along with the charade.  I am not stretching the argument so far as to say that because the standard rate of tax was reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent it caused job losses.  However, it did not prevent job losses nor did it create extra jobs.  The whole question of job creation is far more complex than the simplistic theories of tax reform advocated inside and outside this House, particularly by the Progressive Democrats, in the most strident, hectoring fashion.  They have been totally ineffective in terms of delivery.  It is about time the Progressive Democrats admitted that their tax policy is ineffective, it is a big propaganda lie.  It is not capable of creating the major, dramatic, economic change which its proponents claim.</P>
      <P>When the Finance Bill was published I was amused by some of the Minister's PR people who covered him in a very resolute cloak because he insisted on implementing some of his dafter budgetary proposals, &ldquo;Bertie is not for turning&rdquo; kind of thing.  I have always believed that if one is mistaken it is not a particular virtue to insist that you will not change your mind.  If one is wrong in January surely there is no great merit in repeating the mistake in April and looking for praise for it?  There was merit in the cases put forward by many of the lobby groups on this occasion, particularly by sales representatives, publicans, members of co-operatives and small investors and the Minister should have listened to them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They were marginal changes.  In fairness, the Minister listened and improved the situation in relation to share options, which <Col N="1825" /> is welcome.  I now want to turn to specific items in the Bill, I should like to refer to the income tax sections first.  It is quite clear that I do not believe in the Progressive Democrats approach and the Fianna Fáil part of the Government should not allow it to continue.</P>
      <P>It is not the rate at which one pays tax which is the problem, it is the amount paid as a proportion of one's total income.  The point at which one starts to pay income tax and the point at which one pays the higher rate are also important. People pay tax at 27 per cent plus full PRSI on too low an income, at a point where they should not be paying tax of any kind.  The first thing is to take more people out of the tax net and any resources available should be directed towards this end.  If that proves too expensive I advise the Minister to take a leaf out of Norman Lamont's book and do what we proposed in one of our policy documents before the local elections. The Minister should implement an introductory tax rate to help the lower paid. Mr. Lamont brought in an introductory rate of 20 per cent; if we had an introductory rate of 15 per cent, even on £500 or £1,000 of taxable income, it would cost less than trying to expand the reliefs to take people out of the tax net.  If we had such a rate it would mean that the people would pay 15 per cent, not 34.5 per cent. The next biggest problem is the jump from 27 per cent to 48 per cent; people on quite modest incomes &mdash; especially single people &mdash; are forced into paying tax at the rate of 48 per cent on very low incomes.  Any resources available should be applied to widening the standard rate, indeed 80 per cent to 85 per cent of taxpayers should pay income tax at the standard rate or less if we have a new introductory rate.  Only 15 per cent should pay tax at a higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it matters very much whether the higher rate is 44 per cent, 55 per cent or more, provided it applies only to a small percentage of taxpayers.  That should be the approach instead of this ideologically driven course which the former Member of this House &mdash; now the chairman of the Progressive Democrats <Col N="1826" />&mdash; espouses by saying week after week that we must get the rate down to 40 per cent and then to 25 per cent.  He seems to think it is like Moses striking the rock for the fourth time, that water will flow; it will not.  It will not make a blind bit of difference to the economy or to job creation.  It will also make very little difference to the amount of tax which people pay because if you bring down the marginal rates, refuse to index the allowances and bands and abolish relief it means it is all swings and roundabouts. You are giving the appearance of reform when there is none.</P>
    <P>It is now coming to the point where the ordinary taxpayer does not believe any commitment about tax reform.  They hear good news in the last days of January but when they receive their tax free allowances from the Revenue Commissioners in April they find they are usually paying more.  Frequently, they pay more because the level has gone up and because, having benefited from non-payment of PRSI for the final two months of the year, PRSI payments are recommenced in April.</P>
    <P>The concept of tax reform is now falling into disrepute.  Relief should first be given to those who are least capable of paying the tax.  The Government should try to take more of those people out of the tax net.  If resources are limited, an introductory rate of somewhere between 10 per cent and 20 per cent could be introduced as a matter of principle on a small tranche of income, even if the level is set at only £500.  Once the scheme is established, either the Minister, or his successor, could expand it; once it exists it would move.  It would make sense for the Minister to introduce this concept in his second Finance Bill in the autumn and after achieving a level of 25 per cent or 27 per cent, for example, the scope of the initiative could be widened until it applied to about 80 per cent of taxpayers. After that was done, most people &mdash; including myself &mdash; would not be bothered if the top rate was pitched at 50 per cent.  There is nothing sacrosanct about pulling the top rate down to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1827" /> I know it is now fashionable to say that tax reliefs are bad and should be abolished and that people should have more discretion over their spending power.  The idea is to give people money and allow them to spend it in whatever way they like.  Apparently, that is good tax policy.  People like me who advocate tax allowances and reliefs are considered old-fashioned and not in tune with the modern world.  I believe it is good tax policy to encourage people to buy their own homes, to insure themselves, and their families, against illness and to make provision for their spouses and their orphans if they die.</P>
    <P>I do see what it does for society to abolish tax relief on life assurance premiums, mortage interest or VHI in order to distribute the proceeds to taxpayers in general.  That transfer is easy to follow: in general terms, it is a transfer from the prudent to the imprudent.  Often there is a transfer from householders to non-householders and from married people to single people.  We have all sown our wild oats in our twenties &mdash; and some people are still sowing them &mdash; but we must recognise that the discretionary income of young people goes into entertainment, foreign holidays, drink, cigarettes and records.  The common element of those expenses is that they are not good for the balance of trade &mdash; money goes out of the country.  It is grand to have the theory that money should be given to the punters so that they may make their own consumption choices but that is bad social and economic policy. I would prefer to encourage people to provide houses for themselves, health insurance cover for them and their families and assistance for their spouses and children in the event of their death, a provision that was abolished in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept the argument that people on a marginal rate of 48 per cent should not get back £48 out of every £100 while those on a marginal rate of 27 per cent get back only £27 out of every £100.  There is no reason that taxpayers on a low marginal rate should receive benefit worth £27 for every £100 spent on <Col N="1828" /> VHI while those on a high marginal tax rate receive benefit worth £48 for every £100 spent on such cover.  It is necessary to adjust that anomaly and make the position fairer.  However, the principle of allowances is part of the portfolio of tax policy in every modern developed state. One can argue about which allowances should be retained but I cannot accept the principle that by definition allowances are wrong and we should give the people the money to spend as they wish.</P>
    <P>The same argument holds in terms of regional policy.  Different fiscal stances feature in the portfolio of regional policy in any modern state.  That has been the case here.  Higher incentives were given along the west cost compared to those given on the east coast.  That also can be good policy.  Special concessions &mdash; some of which are being taken away by the Bill &mdash; were given to Shannon Airport for specific economic effect.  Some are being provided for developments in the centre of Dublin in the Financial Services Centre, along the quays, and in the Temple Bar area.  Those incentives are being provided to get a specific economic effect from a special tax relief.  We could argue about the merits and demerits of the incentives but, as a matter of principle, the incentives are an instrument of fiscal policy and economic and social development that no Minister for Finance should let out of his hand.  Tax reliefs and incentives should be evaluated on their merits.  The general attitude that any relief is bad and means that someone is on the fiddle, even if he is only trying to provide a house and take out VHI cover for his wife and family, is wrong.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends the tax rate on pension contributions rebated on redundancy. The rate is being changed from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.  I do not agree with the provision but at least the Minister is providing for those who have made application before budget date.  Those people will now get the rebate at the 10 per cent rate.  I request the Minister to make a further adjustment: will he also concede the 10 per cent rate for those who were made redundant in the 1991 tax year but have not applied?  In that <Col N="1829" /> way, those who became redundant last January and had not applied for the rebate of pension contributions before the Minister made his unexpected announcement in the budget would get a rebate at a 10 per cent rate rather than at a 25 per cent rate.  I make that request without prejudice to other views I hold and shall express on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his initiative in relation to company cars.  I know there was a very strong lobby in that regard but I do not consider the Minister went far enough.  He should try to distinguish between those who use their cars as a tool of their trade and those who get a car from their employer merely as a perk. There is a great difference between an executive who drives to work in the city, leaves the car in free parking all day and does not use it for work purposes and someone who uses his car for work five days a week.  Many of my constituents would be catered for if account was taken of mileage, as many of them clock up high mileages driving around the country from Limerick.  However, basing the relief on mileage would not cater for Dublin-based people who might work in the city, spending half of their time in traffic and often parking their cars near the Ilac Centre and then walking.  Such workers who may have a mileage of only 9,000 or 10,000 miles a year use their cars as their office, their store and the place from which they work five days of the week.  Tapering relief on high mileage would not meet the needs of those people.  The only way to be fair is to make a distinction between those who get a car as a perk and those who use a car as a tool of their trade.  Such definition would not be beyond the capability of the very good civil servants in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section <Col N="1830" /> 13 abolishes the relief that enabled individual shareholders in companies to receive up to £9,000 in dividend income free of tax.  Many small family businesses were making use of this provision as a way of making ends meet.  I should like the Minister to reconsider his decision to abolish this relief.  I have had correspondence from a husband and wife team who say this provision will cost them near enough to £18,000.  In some circumstances this relief makes the difference between an organisation keeping going or having to close.  Again a principle is being followed that is grand in theory but proves in practice to be anti-jobs. As I understand it, we are trying to encourage as many people as possible to look after themselves, to get out of the labour market if at all possible, to become self-employed.  The scheme being abolished has worked.  I am sure the yield from that move will be tiny and I consider this amendment to be ill-judged.</P>
      <P>Section 17 amends the profit sharing scheme provisions by reducing the ceiling from £5,000 to £2,000.  That is a welcome move and I thank the Minister for his response.  I ask him to explain in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the reason for abolishing the tax breaks on patents in section 19.  This move is also anti-jobs and anti-enterprise.  The yield involved must be very low.  This provision will hammer creative people, such as the person who works from a garage at the back of his house and may come up with a new idea.  Abolishing the tax concession for such people was not a good move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 22 and the new provisions for DIRT, the Minister stated explicitly that there will be disclosure with regard to companies which avail of deposit accounts, but will there be disclosure for the ordinary deposit account saver?  Will it be automatic disclosure by the banks and building societies or discretionary disclosure where they will be obliged to answer questions when asked?  What is the connection between the Minister's proposal and a kind of amnesty for &ldquo;black capital&rdquo; which the <Col N="1831" /> Minister is trying to attract back into the country?</P>
    <P>Section 24 is a bad provision.  The tourist industry is one of the wheels on which our economy will have to turn.  There is probably more potential there for activity and job creation than in either farming or manufacturing industry.  Tourism has the advantage of being an industry which, in effect, brings its own regional policy. Often the most attractive parts of the country are the most deprived.  Tourists not only bring money to the country but they distribute it widely in their travels.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems in the tourism industry is that tourist accommodation has not been up to European standards. A great number of Irish people now avail of ferries and cross to England, France and Germany and they know the difference. People will no longer holiday here unless they get reasonable accommodation. They are not prepared to spend their holidays in accommodation which is significantly worse than they have at home.  To put it bluntly, people want to wash themselves every morning while on holidays, and a swim is not an adequate substitute.  Our accommodation, particularly in provincial towns, will have to be geared up to suit the tourist.  Apart from Killarney, there is hardly a town which has brought accommodation up to standard.  Bedroom accommodation is not of a sufficiently high standard to attract and satisfy European families which are coming here in increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>The BES scheme was abolished for the tourism industry last year.  This year the last remaining incentive providing a tax break to enable accommodation to fit into the more scenic parts of Ireland is being abolished.  That is anti-jobs, a mistake, a foolish provision.  Like many other parts of the Finance Bill, it shows a sort of begrudgery.  That attitude is prevalent throughout the Finance Bill and it is more obvious in this Finance Bill than it has been in other Finance Bills. The yield from this provision is very small.  It is ridiculous to say that one can write off the capital cost of holiday <Col N="1832" /> accommodation against the rental income generated by that accommodation, when we all know that the tourist season here is only about nine weeks.  Effectively there is no write-off, and the attraction was that it could be written off against the investors other income.</P>
    <P>We all know of young professional people, accountants and doctors who, in partnership, bought 14 or 15 holiday cottages because they were able to write off capital costs against income tax on their salaries.  That is no longer possible and, with the abolition of the BES last year and the fact that Structural Funds cannot be used to upgrade tourist accommodation here, that is a bad blow to the tourism industry.  It is not a very good idea.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 32, investors in Shannon based companies have enjoyed a distribution of dividends, tax free for many years, and have made a lot of money from it.  Mr. Tony Ryan is one of the main beneficiaries from this, but the same gentleman is putting all that money into Shannon Aerospace at the moment and he is on the way to creating 1,500 jobs.  He says that if he could keep the business rolling, he could provide 10,000 jobs.  Why cut off the benefit at this point when this activity is not being used only as a tax break?  It is not as if there had been a loss to the Exchequer.  The Minister should at least phase this provision over a number of years.  That would meet some of the problems.  Some of that money is already earmarked for job creation in the Shannon region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The potential for damage is very serious indeed.  There is a set of proposals which could deliver 10,000 jobs in refurbishing aeroplanes and engines and in the fabrication of fuselages, the spraying of planes and so on.  The project is well under way.  The first trained people have already come out of FÁS courses and <Col N="1833" /> other people are training in Switzerland. I have no doubt that in three years time there will be 1,500 people involved in that activity and that the full potential is for 10,000 jobs.  This has come about to a large extent from the reinvestment of the money which has excited such envy in some quarters, money which was taken out by the distribution of tax free dividends and which was being reinvested by individuals because of their commitment to their country.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on section 37 and its effect on the package of incentives and commitments already made by the IDA, because section 84 funding is always part of IDA packages in attracting foreign industry, particularly North American industry?</P>
      <P>Many sections of the Bill are technical in nature and can be dealt with more fully on Committee Stage.  However, I would refer briefly to section 45 which refers to the abolition of tax exemption on co-ops. There are publicly quoted co-ops and we can read in the financial pages of the newspapers how much profit some of them have made &mdash; they seem to be doing very well &mdash; but there are other co-ops about which we do not hear who are making very small profits and which are there, in effect, for the benefit of their members, the small farmers and fishermen along the west coast.  I would suggest a different approach.</P>
      <P>At the moment co-ops are exempt from corporation tax.  In the first year, 75 per cent of the co-op activity should be exempt from tax; instead of a 100 per cent exemption there would be a 75 per cent exemption.  They would pay 40 per cent tax on a quarter of their activities, which is a 10 per cent tax.  A more satisfactory approach would be to introduce a phased system over a three year period to apply to the entire business.  At the moment some manufacturing activity will automatically attract a 10 per cent rate whereas other non-manufacturing activities attract a 40 per cent rate.  To go from zero to 10 per cent might be acceptable, but to go from zero to 40 per cent is a frightful jump.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take some of the dairy co-ops <Col N="1834" /> as an example.  We all know of the traditional reluctance of farmers to pay tax. At their board meetings, instead of allowing management to declare a profit which would be reinvested, they will take it out on the price of a gallon of milk; that is what will happen on the ground.  They will ask why they should give this tax to the Government, why not give an extra 2p on the gallon of milk?  They admit this will mean they will show lower profits and that there will be less for reinvestment.</P>
    <P>I note that in the Bill the Minister has made provision to meet some of the problems of An Bord Bainne.  He has endeavoured to meet another problem; bearing in mind peaks and valleys in the business, when a co-operative with a surplus of milk sells to another co-operative 25 miles down the road, that operation would be taxed at 40 per cent because it is a sale of milk; it is not a manufacturing activity.  I note that the Minister has pulled back on that and will impose a tax of 10 per cent.  I do not think the Minister's revision will work.  Frequently what happens is that a co-operative does not sell to a co-operative; they sell into the processing section of another co-operative which is usually incorporated as a company rather than as a co-operative. The Minister will have to change the definitions if his intention is to bring this into the 10 per cent bracket.  In practice, the Minister's definition does not catch such activity; these activities will still be taxed at 40 per cent even though it is the Minister's intention to exempt them.  Perhaps the Minister would examine that as well.</P>
    <P>If the Minister adopted the proposal I am suggesting, I predict there would not be a loss of revenue; I predict the yield would be 10 per cent across the board from all such activity and that would be much neater and easier, from an administrative point of view rather than endeavouring to identify which activities would be taxed at 10 per cent and which at 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the provisions of section 57.  I cannot understand why the tax relief on capital gains will be reduced from £2,000 to £1,000 in the <Col N="1835" /> case of an individual and from £4,000 to £2,000 in the case of a married couple.  I have been in the habit of buying a few shares, but I have not been sufficiently lucky to benefit from this type of relief consistently.  There is a decision in principle to be taken.  If the Minister is endeavouring to encourage people to invest in a small way, if he is endeavouring to go down the road to some kind of shareholders' democracy, then the only thing in it for many people is the possibility of a capital gain which would be tax free, and the Minister is having that.  When one considers that with what the Minister is doing on the deposit interest retention tax side, the combined effect will be to transfer the kind of discretionary savings of individuals into deposit accounts out of where there is a bit of play to generate economic activity. I would be interested to know the estimated yield because I predict it would be quite low.</P>
    <P>I have not yet come to terms with Chapter V which seems to be long and involved.  The petroleum taxation provisions of Chapter VI, to a large extent, appear to be a rerun of the 1985 amendment we produced when in Government but did not enact for one reason or another and will warrant scrutiny on Committee Stage.  I do not intend dealing with them now.</P>
    <P>The duties on beer seem to be of no practical relevance, rather they appear to be a vehicle being prepared for the future because the Minister has not been able to nominate the rate of excise duty which will apply to beer.  This appears to be the new formula for its application.</P>
    <P>It would appear the Minister has moved significantly on the pub licence provision which is helpful.  I hope he will not experience a problem with its application because it is difficult to measure turnover.  I have one question to pose here: the Minister spoke of activities other than the sale of drink being exempt. Does that include food?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have said what I wanted to say about the sections dealing with VAT with this exception: I presume it is the intention to introduce more wide ranging VAT provisions in the autumn in the second Finance Bill in that there will be a major loss of revenue when VAT at point of entry is abolished.  Will it amount to something of the order of £200 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposal abroad &mdash; I would like to know what weight it has in departmental thinking &mdash; that in the autumn the Minister intends to introduce a scheme whereby he would recoup a full month's VAT by moving to monthly rather than bi-monthly collection.  That rumoured proposal is causing much anxiety among people dependent on cash flow.  The proposal would appear to be that one would pay two months' VAT today and, in a <Col N="1837" /> month's time, one would pay another month's VAT and continue to pay monthly thereafter.  The effect of that would be that the Exchequer would get one full month's VAT once off.  Will the Minister say whether that will happen because people would need advance notice of such a proposal, it would not want to be sprung on them in the autumn?</P>

      <P>With regard to the provisions of section 183, I do not understand the anxiety of the Department of Finance to go after cash and credit cards since the yield cannot be great, especially the £2 stamp duty on ATM cards at a time when, I understand, we are encouraging the banks to move towards technological services, ease of service and all the rest, without prejudice to the recent strike. This was introduced before when Commissioner MacSharry was Minister for Finance and there was a stand-off.  Those were the sterling days of the Tallaght strategy when we had more influence over policy than we do now because there was the threat of bringing down the Government.  The proposal was dropped at that stage.  I wonder was there someone in the Department of Finance awaiting a second chance under a majority Government.  I do not think the imposition stands on its merits.  The idea that it would not apply to any deposit account which had a positive balance, on a daily average, not exceeding £10 seems ludicrous.  It begs the question: who in the name of God could use a cash card if the daily average balance in the account never exceeded £10?</P>

      <P>In respect of Part V the revised residential property tax is not a proposal in respect of which we would want to salute the flag.  It would appear to be the introduction of a seriously based property tax, now being pulled down to the level at which one wonders whether any house in Dublin will be exempt henceforth.  I predict there would be very few; anyway, the whole south side of the city would be pulled into the net.  I know there is an income ceiling of £27,500 and the commitment that the income limit will be index-linked in future years would appear to be less than strong.  Any of us who have examined these matters would be forced to come to the conclusion that if a Government wanted to introduce a property tax this is the most convenient vehicle because the law exists already. All one has to do is change the ceilings both in respect of the market value of the property and the annual income.  There is a big pull-down on it this year.  I presume the exemption for children still applies; there is no variation in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the anti-avoidance measures in Part VII.  I have not gone through them in detail but welcome them generally.  On previous occasions I opposed anti-avoidance proposals when the fears I expressed transpired not to <Col N="1839" /> have been well founded because the Revenue Commissioners did not do the extravagant things various professionals predicted they would.  I predict the only way self-assessment will work is if the Revenue Commissioners have the most rigorous powers to collect; to put it bluntly, it will be the terror of the Revenue only that will render many taxpayers compliant.  I predict self-assessment will have to be like the Inland Revenue in the United States where, if a person sees one of their inspectors on the street, he crosses to the other side, his knees shaking and, where if they knock on your door, you are on the fringe of an emotional breakdown.  It would be only by rigorous powers of collection that we will be able to get a large number of Irish taxpayers to comply with the requirements of a self-assessment taxation system.  Without having gone through them in detail, I am now at the stage where I would welcome any kind of anti-avoidance provision.  I no longer hold with many of the professional arguments that it would be an invasion of privacy to recover documents, etc. but if that is necessary it has to take place.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for being so patient. I have spoken at some length but this is a very long and complicated Bill. I ask the Minister at some stage to outline to us how it is intended to deal with the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech is very interesting as it is really in three sections.  The first section is a factual review of the economy at present both internationally and nationally.  It concludes that in comparison with our neighbouring economies in the rest of the European Community, if we take the main indicators, excluding employment, by and large we are in a relatively well-placed position.  I do not think I would necessarily disagree with the estimates for economic growth contained in the Minister's speech.  However, a programme on one of the British television channels last night tended to revise downwards some of the estimates for growth for the EC, the United States and the UK.  Obviously the person who wrote this speech must have been close to the sources which led to the conclusions reached in yesterday evenings analysis. By and large the first part of the Minister's speech effectively says that in comparison with other economies we are doing relatively well.  Having regard to the fact that the United Kingdom economy shrunk in terms of growth last year while our economy grew by approximately 2 per cent we are in a relatively good position on the broad economic front with one exception, that is, employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second part of his speech under <Col N="1841" /> the heading &ldquo;Employment&rdquo; the Minister states:</P>
    <P>But there is no denying that a daunting employment task lies before us &mdash; to earn the extra jobs we need; soundly based jobs; jobs which flow from producing more goods and services which can sell in the market place at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government in the budget have taken a number of steps to combat rising unemployment.  First, the reductions in direct taxes will improve incentives, the rewards for enterprise and effort on a broad front.  Second, we have agreed with the EC on the provision of substantial funds for a new employment subsidy scheme and for in-company training.  I warmly welcome the fact that these schemes are receiving the full support of the FIE and other employer organisations and the ICTU.  I strongly urge all employers to participate as fully as possible in these schemes.</P>
    <P>Third, the area partnerships, envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to combat long term unemployment through training, education and enterprise development are now in place in 12 pilot areas.  The public agencies concerned have made the necessary arrangements; the estimated cost to the Exchequer is £60 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>Fourth, a committee of Ministers assisted by a working party of officials and private sector individuals are examining the recommendations of the Industrial Policy Review Group and the Task Force on Employment.</P>
    <P>But in the final analysis, there is only so much that any Government can do.</P>
    <P>There is a kind of absolute underpinning assertion in this.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>They can make a key contribution by ensuring that their broad policy stand is conducive to employment growth.  We have done so.  They should ensure that, in its detail, Government policy minimises any disincentive effects on private effort and enterprise.  We are <Col N="1842" /> doing so, not least through the substantial tax reforms in this and recent budgets.  They should provide leadership on growth-oriented policies. Again, we have done so.  But in the final analysis our progress will be determined by how well the private sector use the opportunity so created.</P>
    <P>I would love to think that the person who wrote that section of the Minister's speech had spoken to the person who wrote the rest of his speech or worked with the people who produced the Finance Bill.  I am paraphrasing in many respects some of the sentiments expressed earlier by Deputy Noonan because in broad measure I agree with his preliminary intellectual conclusion and analysis of the budget and its consequential Finance Bill.  This is not an enterprise Finance Bill: it may be a cautious revenue protection and revenue gathering series of taxation measures.  In view of the liberalisation of capital markets in 1993 there may be some legitimate reason for taking such an approach in some areas.  As we move more towards a self-assessment taxation system it is also necessary to give extra powers to the Revenue Commissioners.  There is a broad political culture out there, reinforced I have to say by the extraordinary revelations of the various tribunals and scandals which emerged during the past six months, which makes it absolutely essential for the Revenue Commissioners to have such powers, particularly when officials appointed by the High Court simply cannot get access to documentation to which they are entitled.  Therefore, the culture in relation to those matters has changed.</P>
    <P>Strictly speaking this is not a Finance Bill; it is a taxation Bill.  It was certainly not produced by the Department of Finance. That Department should be renamed the Department of Revenue and Taxation.  The ethos of the treasury runs right through this Bill.  I have to say to the Minister &mdash; I will elaborate on this point tomorrow &mdash; that he should look at the part of his speech from which I quoted and, in particular, at the things he has <Col N="1843" /> claimed to have done.  The Minister has simply not done the things he said he has done.  The person who wrote that part of the Minister's speech did not read the rest of the Bill.  Without playing intellectual games, one cannot in all honesty square the assertions set out in that part of the Minister's speech with the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making it much safer for anyone with any amount of money to put it safely on deposit at 10 per cent <i>in toto</i>.  Other than winning the lottery, that is the best deal in town; it is absolutely copper-fastened and there is no risk whatsoever.  In addition, the Minister is saying that a person who does not get the full set of lottery numbers can match five by putting surplus income in at a maximum of 27 per cent <i>in toto</i> and that this is the enterprise culture which will create jobs.  Given the fall out from the bank's strike no new jobs will be created in the associated banks.  Therefore, no additional employment will be created in the banks in counting these additional deposits.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Minister has decided to protect revenue in the context of capital liberalisation in 1993.  I understand why the banking institutions by and large have broadly welcomed the measures announced in the Finance Bill. Notwithstanding the hysterical denunciations of it by the Minister and his party when they were in Opposition, I understand the legitimate and understandable concerns anyone in the Minister's position must have to protect sources of revenue, particularly such an efficient source of revenue which the DIRT tax actually was.  However, the results of similar liberalisation measures introduced in Britain by the then Chancellor for the Exchequer, Mr. Geoffrey Howe, are an indication as to the likely outflow of funds here.  Maybe the Minister has been over cautious.</P>

      <P>I want to make some relevant comments to illustrate why the Bill was necessary. Under existing law &mdash; the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and amending Acts of 1958 and 1961 &mdash; around 3,000 people per annum are committed involuntarily to psychiatric institutions.  These people are detained on the application of a relative and the certification of one or two doctors.  They are detained under what are referred to as reception orders.  These are not reception orders in the judicial sense but medical authorisations for the detention of persons.  There are two types of order, a reception order and a temporary reception order, and two types of person to whom they apply, chargeable and private patients under the 1945 Act. Chargeable patients are those whose treatments are paid for out of public funds, while private patients pay for their own treatments.  A temporary reception order lasts for up to six months and the reception order lasts for more than six months.  The vast majority of people detained under these orders would be seriously ill, mentally disturbed and-or violent.  I know many families dealing with such cases who suffer great stress and upset, often over a long period and in many instances with poor support or financial help.  I acknowledge the difficulties suffered by these people and their families and I commend all those working in our psychiatric institutions who do so with great dedication and care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation which is under scrutiny relates to another group of people, those against whom detention orders are made but who are inappropriately held.  In examining the 1945 Act, it is evident that <Col N="1845" /> its provisions have been abused by causing people to be committed who were not insane, violent or dangerous.  The motivation of the relative who committed them was at last questionable.  Many of these people are committed to resolve a domestic dispute.  In the cases with which I have been involved the provisions of the Act were misguidedly used as a solution to marital breakdown problems.</P>
    <P>Some people will recall the Adjournment Debate last June during which I highlighted the situation of a young mother from County Dublin who had been forcibly removed from her home on a summer afternoon and detained in St. Patrick's Hospital.  A week previously she had obtained a protection order against her husband.  Her marriage was most unstable and unhappy and she was under great stress.  Her need was for a legal separation and the possibility of making a life separate from her husband. Her need was not for a detention order which removed her to a mental hospital.</P>
    <P>My experience of such cases goes back well before June last year.  In 1975 I was contacted by two women, one a mother of seven from Galway and the other a mother of 12 from Dublin, with whose cases I became very familiar.  They were both in marriages which were violent and damaging but at that time there was no acceptance that a woman could leave, even in a very bad marriage situation. This was prior to the enactment of the family law Acts by the Coalition Government in the seventies.  One possible relief for many women was when their husbands deserted to England.  This was very common in the seventies and was called divorce Irish-style.  The only other relief these women got was when their husbands died and they became widows. While unhappy marriages were not as uncommon as now &mdash; or at least we were not aware of them &mdash; the hardship for the wife and mother living in a dead marriage was considerable and unrelenting.  In that context I was personally involved with a number of cases, but specifically with the two I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>After a first committal by their husbands, <Col N="1846" /> the women endured what was in effect a revolving door syndrome, living in fear of being recommitted if they did not behave themselves.  There were many in the seventies for whom the first battered wives home in Harcourt Street which opened in 1974 became a refuge from this type of home life and it represented their chance to make a new life with their children.  The women I met through that refuge all recounted the same story.  The signing doctors did not know them.  They may have been neighbouring doctors and may have known the women vaguely but not as patients.  They were very often the husband's GP.  The doctors did not examine the women, most of whom had the awful experience of having the committal completed with the help of an ambulance and the Garda. Once inside the pshychiatric institution they were refused access to a telephone or permission to have visitors.</P>
    <P>Many of those women afterwards lost custody of their children and they lived lives of isolation, feeling outcast because of their experience.  When they tried to get an explanation from the hospital about their committal or to get copies of the documentation involved they came up against resilient opposition in every case.  They were told they had no rights under the 1945 Act to such information.</P>
    <P>Until the case of last June was brought to my attention it was my belief that amending legislation was in place which had introduced necessary safeguards against inappropriate or wrongful committal. I was most surprised to discover that this was not the case and that the 1945 Act, which had caused such difficulties to women in the seventies, was still the statute involved.  I discovered that the 1981 Mental Services Act included the necessary reforms to prevent abuse but that it was never brought into force.  The time for debate counted for nothing.  I will return to that legislation later.</P>
    <P>The cases I have referred to and the numerous other cases about which I have been contacted by individuals, psychiatric workers and relatives, show an urgent need for reform.  It is the function <Col N="1847" /> of law to provide clear guidance to those working in the psychiatric services and to provide firm safeguards against malpractice to users of the services.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  People with mental health problems are regrettably the poor relatives of the health services. Mental health has a low priority in terms of budgetary or monetary planning. There is a great need for broad-based reform which would concentrate on reducing overcrowding in our institutions, developing community facilities and changing the nature of our psychiatric institutions, many of which date back 200 years, from the isolationism of the past to greater integration for mentally ill people and their carers in the communities in which they live.  I hope this debate focuses on those factors as well as on the provisions of the Bill. These guidelines are well documented in the 1984 Department of Health report, <i>Planning For The Future.</i></P>
    <P>I repeat that much too little has been done to implement the recommendations of the 1984 report, and successive Ministers for Health must stand indicted.  I am concentrating here on an area which I feel is urgent and for which there is public concern.  There has been unease over the years about abuse and the possibility of abuse in the 1945 Act.  Incidents have been well documented in recent weeks by the media and by RTE.  The need for urgent change has been identified.  I appeal to all sides of the House to support my proposals and allow long overdue changes to be put in place.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1961, where they deal with reception orders. In section 3 there is a misprint on line 14 in that the word &ldquo;Part&rdquo; should be substituted by &ldquo;Sections&rdquo; to read &ldquo;Sections 14, 15 and 16 of the Principal Act&rdquo;.  This section aims to end the practice in the 1945 Act under which chargeable or public patients are treated differently from private patients.  There is no reason for safeguards to be different as between sectors.  The fundamental freedom of the individual is in question <Col N="1848" /> in both instances and the basic principle demands equal and maximum safeguards for all, regardless of means.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the establishment of mental health review boards, with one board in each health board area.  These boards would consist of three persons, a barrister or solicitor, a medical practitioner and a lay person, all to be appointed by the Minister for Health.  Section 5 deals with the work of the review board and how applications are made.  Where an application for a review comes from a detainee, his or her parent, spouse or offspring or from the Minister for Health or the President of the High Court, the review cannot be refused under this section.  However, it shall be at the discretion of the board to grant or refuse the review if made by some other person.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the outcome of the examination by the board and the decisions at which they may arrive. Section 7 involves a review of a person who has been conditionally discharged. Section 8 puts an onus on the board to seek a report from the medical officer in charge of each psychiatric centre for each person who has been in detention for a period of two years and make recommendations that he or she shall not be discharged or be discharged conditionally or transferred to care accommodation more suitable to his or her condition. Section 9 provides that the medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre shall, in making the order, give that person a copy of the order and all documents relating to his or her detention.  It also deals with providing documents on request after the person is discharged.</P>
    <P>Section 10 repeals sections 259 and 260 of the Principal Act, 1945.  Section 259 imposes a time bar on proceedings which may not be instituted after six months from the end of detention.  This is quite an extraordinary limiting factor.  It contrasts with normal periods of limitation for seeking civil actions, which for false imprisonment is six years and for actions for personal injuries, three years.  Section 260 provides that civil proceedings cannot be taken under the 1945 Act <Col N="1849" /> except with leave of the High Court, and that leave shall not be granted unless the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the person against whom such proceedings are being brought acted in bad faith or without reasonable care.</P>
    <P>As outlined, I am sure nobody could disagree with the thrust of this Bill or deny that it deals with basic safeguards and protection of civil liberty.  I am dealing with the Minister for Health who is as informed and, I feel certain, as concerned about what is happening as I am.  I confidently hope that this Bill will not suffer the same fate as the 1981 Act either by being rejected in total or being cast and left in deep freeze to await indefinitely the necessary ministerial directions to put it into force.  I want this House to deal with the reality of our mental health problems, acknowledging that the people concerned are not able to articulate their needs in many cases and depend heavily on legislators to upgrade legislation, safeguard their rights and improve their conditions.</P>
    <P>This Bill cannot be answered with vague promises.  I am not convinced that we need White or Green Papers in order to take the action that I have outlined as necessary.  I would suggest to the Minister that the day is long gone when painting the railings of our psychiatric institutions can substitute for real fundamental changes in our services and in our law.  I am particularly asking that the Minister, in his response, give an honest appraisal of the aborted 1981 Act in view of the fact that there is such a degree of public confusion and disbelief about that Act. There is no precedent for what happened with that legislation.  What were the reasons it was never put into force?  Are there sections that could be activated now through ministerial order?  What was the outcome of the review of the legislation in the Department since 1981, as referred to in &ldquo;Planning For The Future?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am aware that the medical profession opposed some of the provisions in that legislation.  Doctors have told me that their fears and views have to be reasonably considered.  One area of concern to <Col N="1850" /> them is the need for speedy action in times of crisis, when a mentally ill person is being disruptive and violent.  They say it would be a very difficult procedure to demand in the legislation that two GPs sign the certification after examination. This would be particularly difficult in the case of a crisis at night, at weekends or, as was stressed in the original debate in the 1981 Act, in a rural area.  I do not believe that these are insurmountable problems.  I accept that there is a difficulty in this regard and I suggest that an amendment be introduced on Committee Stage along the lines proposed by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties in their report of the Mental Health Bill, 1981, which states:</P>
    <P>The Bill should provide crises intervention facilities to be made available by each Health Board.  These might take the form of a team on stand-by in cases of emergency and include at least a Doctor and a Nurse suitably qualified. In such circumstances, two accredited members of a crises intervention team should be empowered to sign a recommendation for a reception under Section 19 in lieu of two G.P.s provided they were satisfied that a crisis genuinely existed.</P>
    <P>I believe that a satisfactory provision could be put in place recognising the reality of these cases which, as I said earlier, represent the majority of the numbers at present detained annually.  I am aware that this problem was encountered in amending legislation in the UK and elsewhere.  They have resolved the problem satisfactorily and perhaps we should look at that before putting legislation in place.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981.  Many of the provisions of this amending legislation undoubtedly would have contributed to the rights of detained persons, most notably in requiring the written recommendation of two registered general practitioners for a reception order and dropping the distinction between public and private patients in this regard.  Under the 1945 Act, which came into force in <Col N="1851" /> 1947, the procedure that applies to public patients is different from that applying to private patients.  This is unacceptable to public opinion and it was recommended that it be dropped in the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>The 1981 Act also requires that a general practitioner who makes a recommendation is required to inform the person to whom it relates of his intention. The Act required the medical officer in charge of the psychiatric centre to give the person detained a copy of the reception order together with the recommendation for reception and a copy of any extension order.  The Act also requires the medical officer to give the person a statement of his rights and entitlements under the Act.  He is further obliged to provide persons detained with the necessary facilities for writing, delivering and posting letters.  We would all agree I am sure, that these measures should be a fundamental right of any patient detained.  The Act also proposed the abolition of the time limit on the institution of court proceedings, as I propose in my amending Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>While the 1981 Act was an improved measure to protect essential civil liberties, it has to be acknowledged that it did not provide the complete answer for legislative reform, as one would have expected from the first major reforming legislation on mental health in 35 years. For instance, it failed to define mental disorder, it did not lay down the criteria for what should be considered an examination and alternatives to committal were not discussed.</P>
    <P>In their comments and proposals on the Health Mental Services Bill, 1981, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties said in October 1980:</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short document of some 20 pages, reflecting the narrowness of its scope, especially in comparison with the existing legislation which is a 130 page publication and which will be repealed by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties feel that major safeguards and protection <Col N="1852" /> need to be included in law and, therefore, subject to full open debate, rather than subject to ministerial regulations or local practice.  They said:</P>
    <P>Moreover law can do more than rationalise accepted practise, (sic) progressive legislation can act to stimulate progressive developments in the Mental Health Services.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with two related areas.  I am seriously concerned that no reports of the inspector of mental hospitals have been published since 1979. The Minister will be aware that we have debated this already in this House.  I now see how this is related to the 1981 Act. Interestingly enough, that Act dropped the requirement in sections 247 and 248 of the 1945 Act that the Minister and the Oireachtas would receive an annual report on all mental institutions, including the Central Mental Hospital and private mental hospitals and on the care of patients in all those institutions.  The anomaly we now have is that no reports have been issued by the inspector since 1982, which dealt with the years up to 1979.  It seems that the inspector of mental hospitals is operating under the provisions of the 1981 Act, which did not come into force and is ignoring entirely his obligations under the 1945 Act where this is his statutory duty.  This is an extraordinary situation and I am sure the Minister must agree that it must be resolved right away.</P>
    <P>I question how mental health services can function properly without the statistics, the facts and figures, contained in these reports.  Indeed, I read the last one published in 1982 and found it informative and reassuring.  However, I would have to question what access people have to statistics if they cannot put their hands on an up-to-date report which one would expect in this important area.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill will give effect to Ireland's duties under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Article 5 (1) of the convention provides that:</P>
    <P>Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.  Nobody shall be <Col N="1853" /> deprived of his liberties save in the following cases and in accordance with procedures prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>Article 5 (1) (e) states two broad conditions for depriving a person of liberty on mental health grounds and the detention must be in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law and must be a lawful detention of a person of unsound mind.  The European Court of Human Rights held in the Wintwerp case, 1979, that any measure depriving a person of his liberty should issue and be executed by an appropriate authority and should not be arbitrary; paragraph 37 requires that the domestic law procedure be fair and proper and that it be complied with. We are not doing this under the 1945 Act and, therefore, we are in contravention of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Article 5 (4) of the convention provides:</P>
    <P>Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by a detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.</P>
    <P>It, therefore, seems appropriate in the interest of carrying out our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights that Irish legislators should entertain and enact the proposls to establish mental health review boards, as is proposed in my Bill.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Private Members' Bill will be watched very carefully tonight, tomorrow night and next week by a number of groups and interested parties.  Indeed, the Minister's response tonight is very much anticipated.  We in Fine Gael are committed to this Bill and we sincerely hope it will be accepted and will be given effect in legislation, but there is broad consensus among those who are equally concerned.  Among the groups who support the measures in the Bill is Women's Aid, which operate refuges in and outside Dublin.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in June 1991 Ms. <Col N="1854" /> McDermott commented on the reality for some women who come to her refuge:</P>
    <P>Ms. McDermott said that the use of threats of committal by husbands against their wives was a large problem so far as Women's Aid was concerned. The threat was usually coupled with a warning that if the women were committed, they would lose their children.</P>
    <P>The use of the threat seemed to be more common among middle class than among working class people, she said.</P>
    <P>The threat of committal was one of the ways in which some men kept control over their wives.  &ldquo;Fear is the greatest weapon of all.&rdquo;  These wives often found themselves trapped, she said.</P>
    <P>In some cases, the man would do things &mdash; like hiding the woman's shoes &mdash; to make her gradually doubt her own sanity.  In other cases, years of stress, beatings and threats would lead the woman to seek medication and this in itself would become another piece of evidence that she was mentally ill.</P>
    <P>Ms McDermott said she supported proposals for change.  In a press release Ms. McDermott said Women's Aid is an organisation that provides support and accommodation for women who have been physically, mentally and sexually abused in their homes and they welcomed the Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill 1992.  The press release states:</P>
    <P>Over the last 18 years we have dealt with a number of women who have suffered under the 1945 Mental Health Act.  It is our experience that women who have sought barring orders against violent husbands have often found themselves committed to a psychiatric institution against their will.</P>
    <P>We believe the 1945 Act as it stands is open to abuse, particularly in relation to the most vulnerable people in our society.</P>
    <P>Therefore we urge all political parties to support the Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill, 1992, proposed by Fine Gael to ensure that proper legislation <Col N="1855" /> is enacted to amend the law which patently does not afford protection to this country's citizens.  This Act must be amended to ensure that it cannot be used as a threat to women who attempt to protect themselves from violent husbands in the invoking of current legislation in the family law area.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note a common thread running through the reports of people who are the victims of that legislation. Other groups and people have supported it.  In a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, psychiatrist Professor Anthony Clare was in no doubt whatever about the need for reform of the 1945 Act.  He talked about the need for transition from the custodial form of treatment which has been traditional in this country to the therapeutic which is now accepted in modern medicine to be the correct approach.  He said his medical colleagues had no cause to fear change.</P>
    <P>In a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 January 1992 the administrator of the Schizophrenia Association of Ireland said:</P>
    <P>Involuntary commital is traumatic for both the patient and family and unfortunately in some cases it is necessary. However, it need not be the only way.  Ideally one should aim for voluntary admission as it is not hard to understand that treatment received voluntarily is much more likely to be effective.  More attention might be paid to ways of exploring helpful routes to voluntary admission.  For instance, our experience is that self help groups can help people to acknowledge the need for psychiatric care.</P>
    <P>Following discharge the level of care available varies throughout the country. Today the family is usually the backbone of community care.</P>
    <P>The administrator of the Schizophrenia Association of Ireland went on to give details of the support services they would like.  Even though they are a group who would have first-hand experience of the <Col N="1856" /> need for crisis detention, they accept there is need for reform and that involuntary committal should not be the first line of action.</P>
    <P>In the past year a separate organisation has been formed, called Wrongfully Institutionalised People, who are campaigning for change and support for this measure.  They know they cannot do anything to redress the injustices that have been perpetrated against them over the years but they are determined that this practice ceases and that other people will not be victimised in the same way as they were.  I would like to quote another psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Corry, who feels very strongly about this Act.  In a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 March 1990 he said:</P>
    <P>Why doctors co-operate with this process is more than just a matter for their own conscience.  It places them in an untenable position, as in essence, whether they like it or not, they fulfil a powerful political role in society which overrides their medical one.  It raises three fundamental questions which cannot be fudged, namely: how is it possible to treat someone against their will?  How can an atmosphere of trust develop between the doctor and his client when there is power on one side and fear on the other?  How is it possible to expect human beings who are psychologically distressed to seek out help when they are afraid they might &ldquo;get locked up&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Forced confinement and forced administration of treatment, often hazardous and of dubious efficacy, gives psychiatry unbelievable powers that surely make it the most powerful body in the land.  It is difficult to imagine that a professional body has such discretionary authority.  Notwithstanding the fact that &ldquo;judgements&rdquo; are based on variable and subjective criteria.</P>
    <P>He continues in that vein and has written to <i>The Irish Times</i> on other occasions.</P>
    <P>I hope I have illustrated the case deserving of action.  This legislation was not prepared in any cavalier way.  This is an area in which I have a very strong and <Col N="1857" /> keen interest and I believe there is a definite need for this debate and for action.  The issues we have to attempt to resolve are to bring equity and fairness into our application of this law, to bring in safeguards and to aim to prevent abuse.  I accept that while aiming to prevent abuse, there will possibly be a margin in which there will be some abuse, but the least, we should have is proper accountabilty and proper redress for those who feel they have been wronged.</P>
    <P>I am calling for a new emphasis on improvements in the psychiatric services and for an enlightened approach to the treatment of mentally ill people.  Above all we need to debate this matter at every level, taking all interests into account. Finally, there is an overwhelming need for a single piece of mental health legislation and a comprehensive consumer-friendly, reader-friendly patients rights guide which should be readily available to all those involved, whether as providers or consumers, in the psychiatric service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to congratulate Deputy Nuala Fennell on her initiative in bringing forward this Bill.  I am aware of her genuine concern in this area, her determination to rectify the serious anomalies in existing legislation and to protect the rights of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the objectives of the Bill as proposed.  As a general practitioner and a Deputy I have been concerned for many years now with the quality of our mental health services and the legislative framework for the delivery of these services.  I have been giving this matter some very careful consideration since assuming office just over ten weeks ago and I am satisfied that the pace of developments in the service needs to be accelerated.  Also, the law in this area needs to be up-dated to keep pace with and facilitate the service developments and to conform to modern concepts in relation to the rights of the individual and, of course, the protection of these rights.  For too long now the patients in our psychiatric hospitals have <Col N="1858" /> had to endure sub-standard conditions and they did not enjoy the benefits of the improvements generally in the health services.  For too long it had been assumed that there was no hope and no future for our long-stay patients and that their lot was only more of the grinding boredom, humiliation and sometimes even neglect in our old Victorian custodial style mental institutions.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, however, there has been considerable change in the past decade or so and the numbers in psychiatric hospitals continue to fall.  For example, in 1984 there were 11,613 persons in public psychiatric hospitals while the figure for 1990, six years later, was 7,817 &mdash; a reduction of 33 per cent.  This reduction in the numbers in our psychiatric hospitals has been accompanied by a considerable expansion of community-based facilities.  Again, for example, the number of day hospitals increased from 32 in 1984 to 97 in 1990.  The increase in the number of hostels over this period was from 121 to 292.</P>
    <P>So far as the legislative base is concerned a comprehensive Mental Health Act had been introduced in 1945 and while it was an enlightened piece of legislation in its day, it dated rapidly.  It is now out of keeping with the latest concepts of service delivery and with our obligations under international conventions and agreements.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that I have now submitted to Government a draft Green Paper on the mental health services which deals with both service issues and the legal framework.  The Government's intention to publish this document was announced publicly by me on 15 April.  I have decided on this course of action for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>First, in my view there is a strong link between the quality of the service, the manner of its delivery and the legal framework.  The service and the law are a &ldquo;chicken and egg&rdquo; situation and I am anxious that they be considered as part of an overall approach rather than as two separate or distinct issues.</P>
    <P>Second, while within the medical profession there is fairly general agreement <Col N="1859" /> on the type of service to which we should aspire, some reservations have been expressed on certain aspects of the proposals for service delivery.  Consequently, I am anxious that there should be the fullest possible discussion of our approaches to service delivery so that we may decide on the best option and then proceed with confidence to put the new style service in place.</P>
    <P>Third, in the area of legislation I know there is a fair degree of agreement in principle that the rights of the individual must receive better protection and that there should be stronger safeguards to ensure this.  However, when we get down to specific issues such as the duration of detention orders, rights of appeal etc., there can be considerable debate as to the most appropriate approach.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have been aware for sometime that there has been some public disquiet particularly in the area of involuntary detention.  I am anxious therefore to ensure that everybody is given an opportunity to put forward their point of view so that I can take all shades of opinion into account when bringing forward specific proposals.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I feel the best approach at this stage is the publication of the discussion document.  I know that some people feel that the matter is so urgent that we should push for a faster solution but I think the sheer complexity of the issues dictate otherwise.  I am conscious of the fact that a Mental Health Act was passed in 1981 but never brought into force.  I do not propose to go into detail on the reasons for this here tonight but I am fairly sure that if the process of discussion and consultation which I am now proposing had taken place in 1981 we would not subsequently have had such difficulty with that Act.  I am also convinced that a focused discussion and structured debate on the key issues will of themselves stimulate a greater interest in the development of our mental health services and make all concerned more aware of patients' rights and the need to protect them.  I hope the debate will inform present and future patients as to <Col N="1860" /> their rights and make them more confident in asserting them.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset I have considerable sympathy with the objectives of the Bill before us.  However, I feel it is far too narrow in its focus and does not really address the issues which Deputy Fennell claims it does.  I would be fairly happy with its general approach to the protection of the rights of patients who are long term patients or who are in a position to initiate action on their own behalf or to have someone do it for them. I would have some difficulty with the details of the provisions.  For example, I think it falls down badly on the question of the admission of patients.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the vast majority of patients &mdash; about 90 per cent &mdash; receive treatment for psychiatric conditions on a voluntary basis and it is my firm belief that such patients should be able to obtain treatment without any legal formalities in the same way as patients suffering from physical conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell has mentioned the fact that husbands can have their wives committed to psychiatric hospitals on the flimsiest of excuses.  She was quite rightly very concerned a few months ago at allegations that a wife was committed by her husband to a private psychiatric hospital. I believe there is a need for an automatic review at a very early stage of all nonvoluntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals.  Again the manner in which this review should be undertaken needs to be considered very carefully.</P>
    <P>One of the problems I always had with the 1945 Act is its scope and imprecision on the grounds on which a person could be committed.  I am quite satisfied that any new legislation in this area will have to define much more clearly the grounds on which a person can be committed and the medical personnel involved will then have to be much more specific as to the reasons for a detention.  This would be one of the most effective safeguards for individuals.</P>
    <P>In general then I can say that I have no difficulty with the objectives of the Bill but I have considerable reservations <Col N="1861" /> on the details and the narrow approach to mental health legislation it indicates. For those reasons the Government will be opposing the Bill on Second Stage.  I want to make it absolutely clear, however, that our objections are not based on any negative attitude to the issues themselves but rather on our firm belief that they need to be considered in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.  This we are proceeding to do as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The 1945 Act provides for the apointment of an inspector of mental hospitals.  One of the inspector's principal tasks is to visit each mental hospital every year and to make a report to the Minister of the conditions in the hospital and the services provided.  This provision was not included in the 1981 Act and for a variety of reasons inspections were not made for a number of years in the eighties.  These inspections were resumed on a formal and comprehensive basis in 1988 and one of the first documents I studied on arriving in the Department of Health was the report of the inspections for 1988 and 1989.  I have to say, and I regret that I have to say this, I was quite frankly appalled at some of what I read in these reports.</P>
    <P>Some of the conditions described by the inspector were extremely disquieting and should have no place in a modern day health service.  What was even more disturbing was the fact that in so many instances the level of service provided fell so far short of the standards one would reasonably expect to see in place.</P>
    <P>I accept that the excuse for some of this was due to resourcing difficulties but the standards of accommodation and quality of service varied so greatly that much of it cannot be blamed simply on lack of resources.  By contrast many of the services described are of a relatively high order and are a credit to the dedication and commitment of the staff involved at all levels.  It was this which made the services which fell so far short of what might reasonably be expected all the more telling and inexcusable.</P>
    <P>I have now written on a formal basis to each health board and asked for a <Col N="1862" /> report on an urgent basis on the steps they have taken to remedy the defects outlined by the inspector.  I have also written and asked for an immediate review of all the fire precautions in every mental hospital.  I appreciate that the reports for 1990 and 1991 which are not yet finalised show considerable improvements and I will have it as an urgent priority that services in all areas are improved to acceptable standards.  I should say also that I have asked for a record of all deaths and a report on injuries to mental patients as a result of accidents in each mental hospital in each of the past five years.</P>
    <P>I am arranging at present to have the reports for 1988 and 1989 presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas and the President of the High Court in accordance with the 1945 Act.  The publication of this report should also provide considerable material for a wide ranging debate on our psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The conditions and services described in the reports made me acutely aware that more than technical legislative changes are needed &mdash; necessary though this may be &mdash; to provide patients with the care and treatment which is their right. It is for this reason that I intend in the Green Paper to deal with both service developments and legislative requirements.</P>
    <P>Services for persons with a mental illness have traditionally been provided in large Victorian style buildings which were largely isolated from the community and from the rest of the health services. In 1981 a study group was established to review the services and to provide a policy framework for the future development of the service.  This group reported in 1984 with the now well known document &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.  The report recommended that the hospitalised and isolated service should be replaced by a service which was to be based in the community to provide in a comprehensive way for the needs of those with a mental illness and which was integrated with the health services generally.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to say that much has been done in many areas to <Col N="1863" /> transform the service as recommended in &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; and, indeed, many of the radical recommendations in that report have proved eminently feasible in practice.  However, the pace of change and development has been uneven across the country and much still needs to be done.  In addition, some of the report's recommendations have proved less easy to implement in practice and the twin tasks of developing a community oriented service while at the same time having to maintain much of the old hospital system have proved less than easy.</P>
    <P>Eight years on from the publication of &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; I think it is necessary for us to take stock of the situation, to evaluate what has been achieved and to consider how we move forward from here.  The Green Paper will address these issues and facilitate a discussion on the way forward.</P>
    <P>As the Green Paper has not yet been fully considered by the Government I cannot say precisely what it will contain but in relation to service provision and development I can say that it will deal with a wide range of issues including the extent to which the recommendations generally of <i>Planning for the Future</i> have been met; the specific service requirements of different categories of patients, such as child and adolescent psychiatry, persons with a mental handicap in the psychiatric hospitals, alcohol related problems, severly disturbed patients, mentally disordered offenders and the elderly mentally infirm.  In addition, it will deal with issues, such as the promotion of positive mental health &mdash; something to which I attach the highest priority &mdash; and the personnel implications of a changing service.</P>
    <P>It would be my wish and ambition that the service for persons with a mental illness would be of a very high standard, would of itself strive to maintain and improve these standards in line with advances in medical science and techniques and would reduce significantly the need for legislation to regulate it.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the question <Col N="1864" /> of mental health legislation itself.  I have already pointed out that I believe there is little, if any, need for any specific legislative procedures for the vast majority of persons with a mental disorder and who seek treatment on a voluntary basis.  They should be treated in the same way as any person seeking treatment for a physical ailment.</P>
    <P>However, as matters stand at present there is, unfortunately, a need to detain some persons for treatment on an involuntary basis and it is necessary to have effective legal provisions to ensure that the rights and dignity of such persons are fully protected.  At the same time, however, we have to ensure that the legislation does not present a barrier to any person receiving adequate care and treatment or that the administrative and legal framework is not unduly unwieldy or cumbersome.</P>
    <P>The evidence available to us suggests that we have a relatively high level of involuntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals by comparison to other developed health services so it would seem that there is plenty of scope for us to reduce considerably our numbers of 3,000 or so per year.  Many of these patients should be capable of being treated on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned some of the matters which I feel need to be addressed to provide proper legal safeguards against unnecessary admission.  I will be putting forward ideas for discussion on these issues and many others in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I am also extremely conscious of our obligations under international conventions and agreements such as those of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.  The introduction of new legislation will give us the opportunity to ensure that our laws are fully in accord with our obligations in this regard.  The issues which I will be considering in the Green Paper will also include: the criteria for involuntary admission which I have already mentioned; the procedures for involuntary admission which are of crucial importance and at the very heart of what Deputy Fennell is seeking to <Col N="1865" /> achieve in this Bill; the duration of detention orders and conditions for their extension; procedures and arrangements for the review of admission and detention orders; arrangements in relation to offenders who are suffering from a mental disorder; the possibilities of having legal provisions for care and supervision outside of the hospital setting; arrangements for the protection of the rights of mentally disordered persons &mdash; these would include matters such as access to information and records, representation and legal aid, codes of practice and any other sensible and practicable arrangements which may be thought necessary or desirable; and considerable revisions will also need to be made to the law in relation to the administration and delivery of the service in the light of the developments which have taken place over the past few years.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined here demonstrates my intention and that of the Government to undertake the most comprehensive review of our psychiatric services and we wish to ensure that all interested parties and individuals are given the fullest opportunity to contribute to this review.  I will give ample time for the due consideration of the many issues involved but I warn that I am very anxious to make rapid progress on this matter and want to be in a position to bring forward definite proposals at the earliest possible date.  Consequently, I will be expecting all interested parties to address themselves urgently to the various issues that need to be considered.</P>
    <P>After 47 years it is only to be expected that the law on mental treatment would need to be updated.  After 47 years it is only to be expected that the scale and scope of this revision would need to be wide ranging and radical.  That is what I, as Minister for Health, and this Government are determined to do.  I know that the task is not going to be easy and that the many conflicting views as to the correct approach will have to be teased out and reconciled to the greatest possible extent.  I can fully appreciate these views and can understand the bona fides of the persons putting them forward but I will <Col N="1866" /> be asking everyone involved to try as far as possible to see the issues from the point of view of the patients.  If we can succeed in doing this I am confident that at the end of the day we will have a more effective, caring and acceptable mental health service which will be of benefit not only to the patients who are our primary concern but also to all who work in providing the service and to our society as a whole.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that this major overall approach is needed and for this reason I have difficulties with the limited approach being adopted in this Bill.  I sympathise with what it is trying to do but its scope is far too narrow.  It is for this reason that the Government are opposing the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell asked about the 1981 Act and I should like to make two points in regard to it.  Seven different Ministers have held this office since that Act was passed.  Deputy Woods, Deputies Barry Desmond and Eileen Desmond, Deputy John Boland, Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy O'Rourke and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There were five different administrations in the same period. There were certain technical defects in the Bill as passed which would have caused difficulties if it had been implemented.  We have a choice of amending the 1981 Act to remedy these defects or to introduce a new Bill.  The main reason for our decision to prepare new legislation is because the provisions of the 1981 Act are now inadequate in the light of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example may help to explain the shortcomings of the 1981 Act.  It provided only for a review of the detention orders on application from a patient or relative.  Under the European Convention we are obliged to have a review of every detention order, irrespective of whether the detained person applies. Deputy Fennell's Bill, which repeats the review provisions of the 1981 Act, would <Col N="1867" /> not meet our obligations under the European Convention.  The issue of review will be discussed in great detail in the Green Paper.  Several developments have also outstripped the framework of the 1981 Act and make it inadequate to deal with the challenge of a community based psychiatric service, as proposed in the document, <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>
    <P>A major advantage of this debate at this time is that it gives me a fortuitous and unexpected opportunity to hear the views of Deputies on this important issue. I will be following the debate very closely and will be very receptive to any constructive or innovative ideas which emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Moynihan, who is an expert of 37 years' standing in the care of psychiatric patients as he was a psychiatric nurse before he entered the hallowed walls of Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann.  It would be of benefit to the Minister in particular to hear the views of somebody like Deputy Moynihan who worked at the coalface, so to speak, of the delivery of mental health services to the disadvantaged people in the community suffering from mental illness and in need of compassionate care and attention. I am heartened by the Minister's response to the debate on this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the introduction of this Bill by Deputy Fennell.  However, it is merely tinkering with the whole area of mental health care which requires urgent overhaul and redefinition, as the Minister has been saying over the last 30 minutes or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that the area of mental health care and treatment has been neglected by consecutive Governments and Ministers of all parties, with the possible exception of the programme announced in the document issued by <Col N="1868" /> former Deputy Barry Desmond when he was Minister for Health.  When he proposed that document for discussion it led to controversy because there was a certain rationalisation involved in the whole programme in planning for the future, a rationalisation which, as the Minister admitted, has taken place in the tremendous reduction of patients who, up to then, had been confined &mdash; and were expected to be confined &mdash; in mental institutions.  With proper treatment, care and support these patients would be healthier and happier in the community.  Of course, irrespective of our commitments, there has never been sufficient involvement at Government level to ensure that sufficient funds are available.  Community based care is expensive although it is the proper way forward in the treatment of people's mental health.</P>
    <P>Members who have been involved in the health services and on health boards were privileged to visit these Victorian institutions and see the changes, the lowering of the walls, the opening of the gates and the integration of the inmates in the community, even on a daily basis, and returning to the institution at night for care and attention.  It must have benefited these people to go back to the community from which they had come initially and to meet people regularly. Welcome changes have taken place but, as the Minister said, there are still some extraordinarily difficult and intolerable situations which are unacceptable.  I know &mdash; and this will be confirmed by professionals like Deputy Moynihan &mdash; that in spite of the best care, attention and dedication, this level of nursing care is the most difficult of all because an appreciation by the patient is not normally forthcoming.  A relationship which is contrary to a normal working relationship can build up between a patient and nurse or between the patient and the resident medical officer.  There can be a love/hate relationship or an aggressiveness and a lack of control, through no fault of the patient, in regard to mental care and institutions which at times makes it impossible to keep the standard of hygiene and cleanliness at the level <Col N="1869" /> we would like.  However, that does not remove the obligation from us to ensure that the best service is available to this category of patient.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party congratulate Deputy Fennell for her work in this area.  She has shown commitment and concern and has identified here and in the media specific cases which should not happen in any society if we have any regard for ourselves or the freedom and rights of other people.  We maintain that the provisions of the Bill as outlined by Deputy Fennell really only scratch the surface.  I realise, as a Member who published a Private Members' Bill, the difficulties faced by Members of the Opposition who try to have a Bill accepted by the Government. Part of this democratic process is to trigger action from the Government.  At least the Minister has tonight indicated that action in this area is on the way.  The Labour Party say that provision is being made for a very minimum review of what urgently requires review.  We were encouraged by the Minister's positive response to the Bill earlier this month at the annual general meeting of the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  The Minister than appeared to be aware, as he has confirmed tonight, that legislation covering mental treatment is outdated and urgently requires detailed and comprehensive review.  The Minister stated that he was proposing within the Department to make changes and was in the process of preparing a Green Paper.  We welcome the Minister's statement tonight that proposals in relation to mental treatment are at present before Cabinet.  As a party, we sincerely hope that the Green Paper will be published with the Government's approval, as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a specific date for publication of the Green Paper, if at all possible before the end of this debate. The Labour Party know that there are other demands on the Government's time, on the Attorney General's time and on the time of everybody else, but we ask that a date be put on the publication of the Green Paper because the 1945 Mental Treatment Act is completely inadequate for today's needs and requirements.  A <Col N="1870" /> degree of urgency is therefore attached to the presentation of the Green Paper. It is imperative that the Minister give a time limit for the publication so that a full discussion between all interested parties throughout the country may take place. I know that an excellent, heartwarming debate would be forthcoming from all in the Oireachtas, from the agencies, from the health boards and from the professionals involved in the area of mental health care.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been involved with any of those people know of their commitment.  They welcomed the process initiated in the publication of <i>Planning for the Future</i> and they have been implementing that process within the resources available to them.  Those resources are limited and often mental health has to compete for resources with other more demanding and more glamourous health services such as acute hospital services.  We cannot allow other needs to interfere with this priority service.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party realise the need to provide for greater safeguards against inappropiate detention in psychiatric hospitals the specific point with which Deputy Fennell is concerned.  We all share the Deputy's concern.  Between 1980 and 1990 there were almost 33,000 involuntary admissions to mental institutions. Of that number 28,000 were released within six months of admission. Immediately a major question is raised &mdash; 28,000 out of 33,000 were very quickly assessed as being fit for reintroduction into the community.  About 2,500 people are committed involuntarily to psychiatric hospitals each year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is about 3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, 11 per cent of all admissions are involuntary committals. That is according to the Minister's own statistics.  Unfortunately, the statistics on involuntary admissions do not provide the additional and very important information that would indicate whether they were first-time patient <Col N="1871" /> admissions.  That is information that we would all require, information that I am quite sure Deputy Fennell requires.  The Labour Party maintain that for first-time admissions institutions should be required, by law if necessary, to carry out an immediate interim assessment of the patient to ensure that an injustice has not been carried out.  I hope that that provision will be contained in the Green Paper.  Such an assessment would have to be immediate &mdash; it could not be carried out the day after admission or two or three days after admission.</P>
      <P>My party want to ensure that the professional consultation be available immediately on a one to one basis between the patient and a psychiatrist. It should be carried out in the privacy, seclusion and comfort of a room that is user-friendly and it should not be carried out in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána, ambulance staff or in other intimidating circumstances.  Any new legislation should contain that provision. We would hope that any concerns expressed by a patient during such consultation could be professionally and properly investigated by the authorities to ensure that no injustice has been done to the patient.</P>
      <P>We must also ensure that all patients be given the fullest information on their rights and have access to outside contact, to telephones and to any agency they might wish to be in touch with.  Deputy Fennell made this point adequately.</P>
      <P>The present position is inadequate. The people involved are not criminals but they are treated as if they are.  Those people are, at most, patients in need of care, and, at least, people who should never have been taken to an institution and the only reason that they were is the devious interest of another party in the community, whether or not that party be a spouse.  We should not tolerate a position that would allow for such wrongful admissions to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing procedure as laid down in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, allows for the detention of a person as a temporary patient in a psychiatric institution <Col N="1872" /> for up to six months on the application of a relative.  It is easy to understand what might happen.  It is not so long ago that geriatric hospitals were used for the detention of single mothers.  Unmarried mothers were committed to institutions designed for another purpose.  It was a mere graduation from the era of the workhouse.  Unmarried mothers were confined at the institutions, they had their babies at those institutions, the babies were later adopted but the mothers had to stay and scrub the floors at the hospitals unless their relatives requested that they be allowed out.  Such requests were never made in the case of many of those women.  That is the society that we often call Christian.  It is a society that often likes to sweep problems under the carpet, the same society that has left in psychiatric hospitals thousands of mentally handicapped people who should never have been committed to such hospitals in the first place.  It happened merely because parents or relatives considered that psychiatric hospitals were the appropriate places to hide mentally handicapped people.  There was no assessment procedure, relatives could commit people to an institution and they stayed there until someone asked for them to be released.  Thank God we have moved away from those days and there is now some kind of assessment procedure. The Labour Party ask that that assessment procedure be amended to ensure that people receive humane treatment and are given humane attention.</P>
    <P>Under current legislation a person can be deprived by their family of their basic freedom on the basis of the signature of a GP.  As Deputy Fennell explained, the patient may not have been even seen by the GP or perhaps received only a cursory examination by the GP.  After a cursory examination, an examination not defined in legislation, a doctor may sign a certificate authorising the committal of a person to a psychiatric institution.  The application requires the signature of one GP only &mdash; two signatures are required if a private patient is involved, which practice in itself is discriminatory &mdash;<Col N="1873" /> before presentation to the chief medical officer of the institution.</P>
    <P>Reforming legislation was passed by the Oireachtas in 1981 but, for the reasons outlined by the Minister, has not come into effect.  The Labour Party are disappointed and upset that that has been the case.  Even though the legislation may have had defects, it was an improvement on previous legislation and attempted to remedy some of the problems.  I accept the Minister's statement that problems were identified.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of Deputy Fennell's Bill provides that each admission requires the approval of two doctors.  However, the Bill still does not clarify the examination procedure that would be required for involuntary admission.  I believe that that weakness stems back to the 1945 legislation, which did not even define mental illness.  One of the principal features of the Minister's Green Paper will be to seek a definition of mental illness.  I look forward to that.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes the establishment of a three member review board appointed by the Minister in each health board area.  These reviews boards would comprise a solicitor, a doctor and a lay person; they would have the power to review a case and, if appropriate, discharge any patient who had been wrongfully detained in a psychiatric hospital for two years.  This board will have to call witnesses and consider relevant papers and reports and their decision may be appealed to the High Court.  This is the procedure laid down in the Bill.  The Labour Party believe that this body could play a very important role in ensuring that wrongful involuntary admissions will not continue in future.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Fennell for raising this issue in the Dáil Chamber and I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply indicating his knowledge and sincerity with regard to psychiatric treatment.  All those who have been associated with psychiatric hospitals down through the years are conversant with the point being made by Deputy Fennell &mdash; that some people in mental institutions feel that they are being held unjustly.  The complexity of mental illness is such that it requires intensive assessment.  Deputy Fennell's proposal to establish a mental illness review body in each health board area would provide a safety valve and would be a consolation to people who feel they are being unjustly held.  They would know that society in general was disposed towards doing justice to them.</P>
      <P>From my long experience with psychiatric hospitals I know that people have been admitted to hospitals as a result of marriage breakdown, family breakdown, a drop in property values, etc., and have become institutionalised after a number of years.  The nature of mental illness requires immense investigation to justify holding a person but the establishment of these mental treatment review bodies will give patients an avenue of appeal. The fact that a person could appeal would demonstrate that we are conscious of patient rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> The Minister gave a very interesting resumé of his intentions and I subscribe to them totally.  He said that in 1984 there were 11,600 patients in psychiatric hospitals and that that number has been reduced to 7,800.  When the mental treatment Act was introduced there were 19,000 or 20,000 institutionalised patients in psychiatric hospitals.  The practice then was to continue to build new accommodation and new structures to contain these people.  Shortly after the 1945 Act, fortunately, therapeutic treatment was introduced and health boards and hospital management committees decided that the time had come for change.  They discontinued building and looked for the latest in the therapeutic and rehabilitative fields.</P>
    <P>The number of psychiatric patients who are institutionalised now is a small proportion of those who were institutionalised 40 or 50 years ago.  However, much remains to be done in terms of education, and in terms of involving relatives and the wider community.  I can recall a time when not 10 per cent of psychiatric patients were ever visited by relatives.  Were it not for women's groups and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who visited them once a week relatives would not have been convinced that these were human beings capable of conversing, of being entertained, and that they were not dangerous.  As a result of initiating visits to the psychiatric hospitals many patients were subsequently rehabilitated and were able to go back into the community.</P>
    <P>However, there is still a small proportion of people who are involuntarily committed to psychiatric hospitals who feel that they are being wrongfully detained. The Minister must concentrate on this area.  I strongly urge him to take on board the proposal made by Deputy Fennell so that each health board area would have an appeals structure for psychiatric patients.  The people on the appeals board should be of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>Only those who have dealt extensively with mental illness are fully aware of its <Col N="1876" /> complexities.  Investigation of an alleged case of wrongful detention requires deep and careful thought.  The setting up of such boards may not satisfy all the people involved but it will at least demonstrate that the State has the interests of psychiatric patients at heart.  That is the kernal of Deputy Fennell's case, one of concern to those associated with hospitals since their foundation.  This concern will continue until such time as a structure is established to ensure that those people will have some redress if they have been unjustly detained and will be given an honest, appropriate decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lowry gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the proposals of Comhairle na nOspidéal to the Mid-Western Health Board regarding consultancy appointments to Nenagh General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my views on the recent decision of Comhairle na nOspidéal to make unsuitable consultancy appointments to Nenagh General Hospital, an appalling and devastating decision which will undermine and downgrade the status of that hospital.  The proposed arrangements are unrealistic, impractical and unworkable. I predict that, if this decision is implemented the profile and character of the hospital will change dramatically with serious consequences for the level of medical and surgical services available in Nenagh for the people of north Tipperary. In taking that decision Comhairle na nOspidéal ignored the advice of the consultants and medical staff of the hospital and acted contrary to the unanimous wish of the Mid-Western Health Board executive and members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Health to intervene and inform Comhairle na nOspidéal that their decision is unacceptable <Col N="1877" /> and incompatible with health board policy to maintain Nenagh General Hospital as an acute hospital.  If there is the political will this decision can be rescinded.  Indeed such change is demanded by the people of north Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has requested the appointment of a consultant physician with an interest in respiratory medicine in view of the impending, regrettable retirement of the current physician at the hospital, Dr. Brian Lemass.  Instead Comhairle an nOspidéal ignored the board's recommendation and decided to appoint a consultant physician with an interest in geriatric medicine.  They also ignored the recommendations of the board in regard to a second appointment, that of a consultant surgeon with an interest in vascular medicine &mdash; with a full-time commitment to Nenagh General Hospital.  Rather the commitment of the new appointee who will replace the eminent surgeon, Mr. John Hickey, will be divided between Nenagh General Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>The effect of these decisions will be twofold, the first representing a blatant departure from stated policy, which was that Nenagh General Hospital would retain its status as an acute hospital with attendant relevant services.  Second, this decision can only be interpreted as constituting the thin edge of the wedge, ultimately bringing the viability of the hospital into question.  There is no doubt that Nenagh and North Tipperary generally are once again being blatantly trampled on, with facilities representing the people's entitlement being stripped down and-or dismantled almost on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to the decision of Comhairle na nOspidéal to appoint a consultant physician with an interest in geriatric medicine, let me point out that there are no geriatric beds at present in the hospital.  I am aware of the proposals with regard to the dispersal of geriatric beds throughout the county, with the possibility of new geriatric units being built at <Col N="1878" /> Thurles and Nenagh.  However, in the case of the unit at Nenagh, it is much more likely that such geriatric beds will be provided at the expense of the existing medical and surgical beds.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a geriatrician at Nenagh will not be welcome if done at the expense of the medical and surgical services so well provided in Nenagh to date.  Indeed I must emphasise that the demand for such services does not show any sign of declining.  This begs the question why there should be any diminution or dilution of the services available.  The appointment of a geriatrician rather than the requested specialist in respiratory medicine is an indication of the thinking motivating the members of Comhairle na nOspidéal, indicating clearly that they perceive Nenagh General Hospital as having a limited future with attendant limited services, totally unacceptable to me and to the people of North Tipperary I represent.  We demand to be taken out of the health care limbo to which we are being rapidly consigned and without any consideration.</P>
    <P>Ironically Comhairle na nOspidéal may be one of the most ill-named statutory bodies in the country, &ldquo;comhairle&rdquo; being the Irish word for &ldquo;advice&rdquo; or &ldquo;counsel&rdquo;.  Surely that has a hollow ring in this instance where the element of advice is totally absent and there is, instead, dictatorship of a kind which should have no hand, act or part in the administration of a service for the sick and injured in our society.</P>
    <P>The personnel of the Mid-Western Health Board are the people at the front line of this service, those with the firsthand knowledge of what is required on a regional, local basis.  In this instance they have made two specific recommendations which Comhairle na nOspidéal have chosen to ignore.  Public reaction to this decision in Tipperary is one of very real anger born out of the manner in which the decision was taken and its serious consequences for the future viability of the hospital.  It is time to stop buffeting the health care system.  The people of my constituency have endured terrible uncertainty <i>vis-à-vis</i> the health services <Col N="1879" /> available to them.  Most important of all, it is time to examine seriously the strains and stresses to which hospitals and their personnel are subjected, particularly in view of shortages of personnel and equipment.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Health to intervene with Comhairle na nOspidéal, advising them that their actions and decision are unacceptable.  I appeal to him to exercise his ministerial responsibility, instructing Comhairle na nOspidéal to rescind their decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to clarify the position regarding Nenagh General Hospital which was brought to my attention two weeks ago by Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.  At the outset I should say that Comhairle na nOspidéal were established under the Health Act, 1970, their main statutory function being to regulate the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff having regard to current trends and requirements of the health services as a whole and of individual hospitals.  Among their statutory functions is that of advising the Minister for Health on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services.</P>
      <P>In October 1989 the Mid-Western Health Board requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to review consultant manpower requirements for the mid-west region in the light of a large number of consultant vacancies, both current and pending, in the region at that time. Comhairle na nOspidéal established a committee to undertake a wide ranging review of those consultant services whose report was completed in July 1991.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that in 1988 the Mid-Western Health Board carried out a review of their hospital services which concluded that Limerick Regional Hospital should be the flagship hospital of the boards acute hospital sector, the other acute hospitals in the region performing a complementary, supplementary role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary recommendation of the <Col N="1880" /> report of Comhairle na nOspidéal on consultant manpower in the mid-western region was that formal structures should be established which would mould the consultant manpower into larger groupings so that they could plan and organise themselves into multi-disciplinary teams, delivering the most effective services to patients in the region.  It envisaged that the Mid-Western Health Board would provide a wide range of specialist services, with the exception of a relatively small number of specialties of a national dimension &mdash; such as cardiac surgery, neurosurgery and organ transplantation. Accordingly, consultants would deliver services on a sessional basis to the different hospitals.  I must add that this is not exceptional but rather is the way hospital services are delivered in many areas at consultant level at present.</P>
    <P>The Comhairle na nOspidéal report recommended that Nenagh General Hospital continue as an acute medical and surgical centre and that its medical department be strengthened by the appointment of a consultant physician in geriatric medicine.  This was in recognition of an increasing geriatric dimension to the medical workload, a phenomenon being experienced not only in the mid-western region but also in other health board areas.  The consultant appointments due to be made in Nenagh must therefore be seen in the context of the comprehensive report produced by Comhairle na nOspidéal after detailed and careful consideration.</P>
    <P>At present Nenagh General Hospital has two general surgeons and two general physicians.  Vacancies have arisen, owing to retirements, in respect of one of the general surgery posts and also in respect of one of the general physician posts.  I understand that Comhairle na nOspidéal have recently approved a proposal from the Mid-Western Health Board that the special interest of the replacement surgical post should be in vascular surgery, on the basis that the appointee would have a commitment of eight sessions per week in Nenagh General Hospital and three sessions in Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> As I have already mentioned, the Comhairle Manpower Review report indicated a need to provide consultant expertise in geriatrics in Nenagh General Hospital.  I understand that at their meeting of 20 March 1992, Comhairle na nOspidéal approved the creation of a consultant physician in geriatric medicine post in place of the general physician post, the present holder of which is retiring. The question of the special interests to be attached to posts such as those in Nenagh General Hospital is one for the Mid-Western Health Board and Comhairle na nOspidéal in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It should be noted &mdash; this is important &mdash;that 48 per cent of all patients admitted to Nenagh General Hospital are aged 65 or over and they account for 67 per cent of all bed days at the hospital.  All of the beds at the hospital are acute beds.  The establishment of a geriatric assessment unit in Nenagh Hospital for North Tipperary is currently the subject of discussions between the Mid-Western Health Board and my Department.  The coming on stream of a geriatric assessment unit will, therefore, increase the number of acute beds in the hospital.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress that the appointment of a consultant physician in geriatric medicine does not mean that Nenagh Hospital will be downgraded or become a geriatric hospital.  On the contrary, the provision of an acute geriatric service means that there will be a higher patient throughput &mdash; in other words, patients will not be inappropriately placed and better use will be made of the beds.  The appointment of a consultant physician in geriatric medicine will mean that once elderly patients are assessed they can be placed in more appropriate accommodation, if this is required.  This course of action is recommended in <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; a Policy for the Elderly,</i> in which it is recommended that every general hospital should have assessment and rehabilitation beds for the elderly.</P>
    <P>I understand the concerns of the Deputies from the area about this issue &mdash; Deputy Michael O'Kennedy has spoken to me at length about it.  I will look again at the issue and discuss it with <Col N="1882" /> Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Mid-Western Health Board to see if the hospital meets the needs of the area.  I promise to do this at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tralee Hospital Blood Sampling Facilities.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment. I have been advised that, for some time, there have been very considerable delays in the processing of the blood samples submitted to Tralee General Hospital.  I have been advised also that due to staff cutbacks in the laboratory many blood samples are not being processed and samples are being stored in fridges until such time as staff are available to deal with them.  This is a source of much annoyance and worry for numerous patients.  They constantly harass their GPs to find out what is causing the delay in the processing of a simple blood test.</P>
      <P>Blood sampling is very important to people who, for example, have to undergo the thyroid function test.  These tests are very important to people who are on medication for an under or over active thyroid gland.  They need very careful monitoring in the form of regular blood tests to ensure that their thyroxine levels are adequate to enable them to function normally in their every day lives. What will happen to these people if these samples are not processed within a reasonable time?</P>
      <P>It is not acceptable that patients should have to wait for three months to have their blood samples processed.  This is an indictment not only of the Southern Health Board but also of the Department of Health.  I call on the Minister here tonight to rectify this serious problem so that a large number of people in the Tralee General Hospital area can have their fears allayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blood tests are a very important factor in the medical treatment of patients. Having given a blood sample, naturally patients expect their GPs to receive the result of that test within a reasonable <Col N="1883" /> time.  When that does not happen it creates doubts in the minds of patients as to whether GPs are telling the truth when they say they do not have the results. While the processing of blood samples may appear to be a simple laboratory test it is a very important test for the substantial number of people who are dependent on the services of Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to investigate this matter and to ensure that blood samples are processed at this hospital within a reasonable time so that no anxiety is caused to patients.  These patients generally have enough concern anyway without having to cope with delays in the processing of their blood samples.  I appeal to the Minister to rectify this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Moynihan has said is correct. I raised the matter with the Southern Health Board who are responsible for the provision and organisation of services at Tralee General Hospital.  The board indicated that delays arose in the issuing of results of thyroid function tests to general practitioners during the period when the staff in the biochemistry laboratory were on annual leave.  I should say that there has been an increase in the number of thyroid function tests requested at Tralee General Hospital over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The position since the end of March 1992 is that thyroid function tests submitted to the hospital are reported on in one week.  The backlog which had arisen prior to this is being dealt with and the board hope to have it cleared by early May.  The board are not aware of any other delays in the processing of blood samples at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four staff in the biochemistry laboratory in Tralee General Hospital. The Southern Health Board are not aware of any delays in the processing of blood samples except in the case of thyroid function tests.  About 200 thyroid function tests are analysed at Tralee General Hospital each week.  Many samples <Col N="1884" /> are sent in by GPs.  A backlog arose at the end of the year due to the taking of annual leave by staff.  The total workload of the biochemistry department has increased from 37,000 tests in 1987 to 51,000 tests in 1991.  Thyroid function tests account for approximately 20 per cent of the total workload in the biochemistry laboratory in the hospital.  The board decided that all tests submitted since 21 March should be dealt with immediately.  The results of these tests are issued in a week.  The backlog of approximately 700 tests which arose during February and March is being dealt with and the board hope to clear this backlog by 7 May 1992.</P>

      <P>Bunratty village in County Clare is world famous.  It is a most important tourist attraction and employs 674 people.  It attracts approximately 320,000 visitors annually.  There is a heritage blend there which is unique in the mid-west. I am sure the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle have been entertained in Bunratty Castle and in Durty Nelly's. These are very famous places.  The Shannon Shamrock Hotel is another famous amenity and there is another well known hostelry nearby.  This small village is well endowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The by-pass is being completed.  The proposal was first taken on board by the then Minister for the Environment, Mr. Boland, because of the growth of traffic and the number of serious accidents which had occurred.  Clare County Council pursued the matter with the Department of the Environment.  There were difficulties in reaching agreement with land owners but the people in Bunratty <Col N="1885" /> village had no objection and encouraged the county council and the Department of the Environment to go ahead with the proposal.  It is now near completion.  The last contract was signed recently by Clare County Council.  It is hoped that two lanes of the by-pass will be operational during the summer, probably in August.</P>
    <P>Business people in the area, who include those running fashion, crystal and fine arts outlets, depend to a certain extent &mdash; sometimes to the extent of 50 per cent &mdash; on passing trade.  They thought they would be allowed to put up their own signs after the by-pass was completed.  Having formed a Bunratty Village Association, together with Shannon Heritage, they sought professional advice from a company with European links and a French headquarters.  That company is Municipal Equipment of Galway.  They drew up proposals for two 20-feet pictorial signs at either end of the by-pass and a series of other signs which would conform with the requirements of any environmental impact assessment. They were disappointed when the Department of the Environment told them they could not advertise.  They said that tourism signs might be erected but not pictorial signs.</P>
    <P>This development has been funded to a large extent by European funds and the norm in France, Germany and Belgium is that pictorial signs are put up on motorways depicting various chateaux.  Bunratty Castle is a chateau of European dimensions.  Every year 120,000 people visit the folk park.  The people in Bunratty have spent enormous sums and there is a possibility of 300 job losses if things go bad when the by-pass is opened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Carey for sharing his time on this very important issue.  The fundamental problem is that jobs are at risk if the proposed signposting does not go ahead.  I would ask the Minister to review the matter in this light because up to 300 jobs could be lost.  At present 674 people are employed in Bunratty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bunratty Traders' Association are environmentally conscious and very <Col N="1886" /> proud of their heritage.  They have a reasonable case in suggesting that the signs they propose to erect are similar to signs used across Europe.  Given that this year we hope to move a step closer in terms of European union, it is important to conform with the signs systems used across the Continent.  There is a substantial amount of passing trade and it is important that potential customers are not deterred from calling into Bunratty.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look at the proposals which have been sent to his Department.  In view of the special circumstances and the unique position of Bunratty, I would ask him to reconsider the proposals and to fall into line with what was agreed between Clare County Council and the traders in Bunratty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies raising this important issue which, of course, has application on a somewhat wider scale than Bunratty.</P>
      <P>I should say, however, at the outset that my Department did not have any formal proposals from Clare County Council and therefore did not, as the Deputy's question suggests, reject any council proposals.  What in fact happened was that the Bunratty Traders Association were understandably concerned about the fact that the new road by-passes the castle and complex and they developed signposting proposals they would like to see put in place.  The Traders Association proposals were discussed at a meeting between my Department and Clare County Council on 12 March and a scheme of signposting was agreed at that meeting.</P>
      <P>I have to say that my primary concerns in this matter are two-fold.  Foremost is the question of road safety &mdash; put simply, there should not be a proliferation of road signs and road signs should not be a distraction to motorists.  Secondly, tourist signs should conform to internationally consistent standards if they are to achieve their primary objective of attracting tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department that signposting, in particular signposting on <Col N="1887" /> national routes, should be tightly controlled in the interests of road safety and to protect the traffic carrying capacity of such routes.  The proposals made to Clare County Council by the Bunratty Traders Association were not in conformity with this policy.</P>
    <P>In addition, the tourist attraction signs which the association wished to have erected were also not in conformity with guidelines issued by my Department in September 1988.  These guidelines were prepared by a working party comprising representatives of Board Fáilte, the County and City Managers Association and the Department of the Environment, with input from various other bodies.  The guidelines recommended a new system of signs for tourist accommodation generally which is consistent with tourist signposting trends in mainland Europe and the United Kingdom involving a standard colour for tourist signs &mdash; white on a brown background.  The new signs are used to indicate tourist attractions such as places of historic interest and basic tourist facilities, including accommodation. The standard symbols indicate a wide range of facilities, from castles and public gardens to parking areas and craft centres.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that the best way of attracting people to Bunratty is to provide tourists with signs which they can easily recognise.  This was the purpose of the working party.</P>
    <P>The question of revoking a decision does not arise.  The signposting scheme agreed between the Department and the county council is based on an internationally recognised system which indicates the nature and presence of particular tourist facilities.  It also takes account of the need to avoid unnecessary distractions which can create traffic safety hazards on high speed roads such as this.</P>
    <P>While I can appreciate that the traders in Bunratty may have some anxieties about possible effects of the new by-pass on visitor numbers, the international reputation of Bunratty as a unique tourist venue is so well established as to make such fears groundless.  The series of signs <Col N="1888" /> which have been agreed with my Department and Clare County Council are more than adequate to provide the necessary signposting for Bunratty and its attractions.</P>

My objective on this occasion is to highlight the concern of the parents who are considering sending children to that school in September. As the Minister is aware, the Convent of Mercy made a decision to terminate studies in that school in 1995. At this stage the parents need to know what will be the role for that school beyond 1995.  I understand the Minister asked inspectors to visit the school to assess the building.  The local action committee spent a large sum of money on investigations by top architects in Limerick. They made an appropriate submission to the Minister and reported that it made good financial sense to retain the building.  Will the Minister give the parents the assurance they need in planning for the education of their children?</P>

      <P>The Stella Maris school at Foynes is a voluntary secondary school under the management of the Sisters of Mercy.  As the Deputy stated, the Mercy Order have taken a decision to withdraw from management at the end of the 1995 academic year. However, the Order have indicated that they will take in pupils into first year this coming September.  This school shares a catchment area with three other post primary schools located in three separate centres &mdash; Askeaton, Shanagolden and Pallaskenry.  The total enrolment for the four schools is 867, including 75 boarders. In the Department's view it is clear that <Col N="1889" /> in the long term four schools will not be required in the catchment area and accordingly, the possibilities for rationalisation of post primary facilities must be examined.</P>
      <P>A proposal has been submitted to the Department by the Parents' Action Committee, Foynes, aimed at ensuring the continuance of the school beyond 1995. However, an examination of the existing accommodation in the Stella Maris school by the professional staff of the Department concluded that considerable expenditure would be required if the buildings in question were to continue to cater properly for post primary pupils. The full implications of this examination are now being considered within the Department.</P>

      <P>The parents in the Castleknock area heard with disbelief the recent announcement by the Department that Castleknock will not receive a post primary school.  The enrolment crisis was to be met by providing new schools at Hartstown and Dunboyne.  The campaign for a non-fee paying school goes back to 1985 when a site was purchased in Beechpark Avenue.  Since then commitments have been given on this matter and promises broken.  Is it any wonder that parents are disillusioned?</P>
      <P>In that parish alone 257 students leave primary school each year and the figure is expected to rise to over 300 by 1995. There has been a big increase in the number of new houses in the area.  The Minister is hiding behind the recent Bannon report.  If the report did not recommend a school surely it stated where these children are to be placed in future years.  The parents have a right to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A letter from Coolmine community school stated that the board had not received any communication from the Department in relation to the Bannon report.  Furthermore, the board do not wish the student population to further increase.  The same is the position with Castleknock College who have not received a communication from the <Col N="1890" /> Department.  The position is totally unacceptable. On behalf of the parents of Castleknock I call on the Minister to release the Bannon report the general public.  I also ask him to meet the action committee for the area who had been in consultation with his predecessor.  I ask him to agree in principle to this much needed post primary school and to give the people what is required in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two post primary schools in Castleknock at present, Castleknock College for boys and St. Joseph's Convent, Mount Sackville for girls, both of which are fee-paying schools.  Pupils from the Castleknock primary schools also attend in large numbers the following post primary schools in the area: St. Dominic's secondary school, Navan Road for girls, St. Declan's CBS, Navan Road for boys and Coolmine community school.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that outside consultants were recently commissioned to assist the Department in a study to determine the need and provision for post-primary school places in the Castleknock-Hartstown-Dunboyne areas. As the work of the consultants was confidential to the Department it would not be appropriate to publish their report. The findings of the study indicate that there is an immediate need for a new post-primary school in Hartstown to be followed by a new school in Dunboyne. The findings also indicate that the needs of the Castleknock pupils can continue to be met by the post-primary schools which currently cater for the majority of them.</P>

      <P>Pat Murphy of Sandville, Castleisland, County Kerry, is acknowledged as one of Ireland's top race walkers.  He has produced a number of world class performances over the past two years.  In April 1991 he won the World Cup trial in Clonmel in a time of one hour 24 minutes 19 seconds, the fastest time for a 20 kilometre road walk race in Ireland.  In March this year he walked the fourth fastest time in the <Col N="1891" /> world for 5,000 metres.  In Hungary on 4 April he knocked 15 minutes of the Irish record for 50 kilometres.  Pat is 19 seconds off the qualifying time for the Olympic Games in Barcelona and he has until 10 July to make up this time.  It is likely that he will have to travel to Europe for at least two races to reach the qualifying time, and he will have to do this largely at his own expense.</P>
      <P>This man works as a plumber for a livelihood.  However, as he now trains twice daily he is not able to work on a regular basis, resulting in considerble loss of income.  In 1991 Pat was allocated a grant of £1,000 to assist him in his preparations for Barcelona.  This enabled him to train in a warmer climate which improved considerable his level of performance. It was expected that Pat would receive a further grant of £2,000 this year to help him continue with his preparations for Barcelona.  However, much to the dismay of the NACAI he was not included among those athletes who received special grant aid as recently announced by the Minister.  This is most disappointing and very unfair.  Pat has great potential to be a world class race walker.  He missed the qualifying time for the world championships in Tokyo by a few seconds.  Due to his dedication and commitment he deserves every support to help him reach the Olympic qualifying time.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider giving grant aid to this man as this is a very deserving case.</P>

Each national governing body of sport is invited each year to submit applications of their more talented members.</P>
      <P>An application was submitted by the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) on behalf of Mr. Patrick Murphy, a walker.

The committee did not recommend him for funding as it was felt that his level of performance was not of sufficient standard to warrant such funding. He narrowly missed qualification for last year's world championship in Tokyo and so far has not achieved a qualifying standard for the Olympics in Barcelona. The committee were not convinced that he would achieve the standard and that even if he did he would more than likely benefit from the special Government provision of £250,000, announced in the budget, to the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that substantial progress has been made in regard to the Irish Genealogical Project.</P>
      <P>Representatives of my Department and of the Central Secretariat in Northern Ireland have undertaken extensive discussions with the principal interest groups involved in the Project, namely the Irish Family History Foundation, the Association of Professional Genealogists and the Association of Ulster Genealogists and Record Agents and agreement has now been reached for the participation of these parties on the board of a company, which is being set up to manage the project.  Other participants on the board will include representatives from Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Shannon Development, and representatives from the training authorities, and local authorities, both north and south together with representatives from my Department and the Central Secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the company will be to create jobs and employment opportunities in the tourism and travel sectors. The mechanism for achieving the goal is the provision of a 32 county family history research source, based on locally created and locally controlled computer data bases which can be used as a strong <Col N="1596" /> tourism marketing tool to encourage additional visitors to the country to trace their ancestors.  There will be consequent down stream spin off benefits to hotels, guest houses, restaurants etc.</P>
    <P>To date the International Fund for Ireland has allocated £1.5 million to the Project towards the provision of computer equipment for the genealogical centres and expenditure to date is £1.2 million approximately.  European Regional Development Funds for improvements to the respective buildings and for non computer equipment is being allocated by Bord Fáilte under the Operational Programme for Tourism.  To date £904,000 has been committed to the centres. They may, in addition, independently seek funding, as appropriate, from State Agencies such as FAS or from private sponsorship.</P>
    <P>The future planned activity in 1992 will include ongoing computerisation of genealogical records and the provision of as full a service as possible to visitors.</P>
    <P>An interim research service is in operation at present, as part of the programme for the Homecoming Festival planned for September, 1992.  The focus of the Festival is to attract additional tourists to Ireland and to extend the tourist season.  The activities of the Festival will have a strong genealogical orientation.</P>
    <P>The Irish Genealogical Project is being co-ordinated by four Project Managers, whose expenses are being funded by Bord Fáilte, Shannon Development, FÁS and the Northern Ireland Training Authority.  In addition co-ordination is being provided by three officials in my Department on a part-time basis in conjunction with officials from the Central Secretariat in Northern Ireland.  The matter of the staffing will be reviewed in the context of the setting up of a company to manage the project.</P>
    <P>The genealogical centres employ a substantial number of trainees provided by FÁS and ACE, and have a small core staff, which it is expected will be increased as the services develop.</P>
    <P>Each of the 32 counties are eligible to <Col N="1597" /> receive funding provided that an appropriate centre is agreed.  In the case of some counties, it has been agreed that they co-operate by having one centre for two counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 24, 43, 44, 47, 62 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>There have been contacts between my Department and the EC Commission in relation to the operation of the 1991 special beef premium scheme under EC Regulation No. 714/89.  These contacts and the acceptance of the recommendations in the interim report of the departmental task force set up to deal with problems of headage and premia payments delays have resulted in a satisfactory solution to problems of simple accidental error in particular.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to 1991 headage and premia payments is that by the end of April 1992 some 386,000 payments worth £287 million will have been made to our farmers.  About 5 per cent of June 1991 special beef applicants and some 6 per cent of the suckler cow premium claimants are still outstanding. About all the 1991 sheep premium payments have been made.  While some of the outstanding claims will be cleared shortly it will not be possible to make payments in all cases.  These figures would certainly not support a view that enormous amounts of EC money are being lost to Irish farmers through non-compliance with grant scheme regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware however that the way in which the terms and conditions of the various schemes are set out can create difficulties for some farmers.  We are therefore, introducing simpler and clearer application forms and setting out the terms and conditions for all headage and premia schemes in a more easily understood way.  In addition farmers will in future be provided with help sheets to assist them in accurately completing their <Col N="1599" /> applicants; an information campaign is being launched at the most local level possible during the next month to give further assistance to farmers in this regard; procedures for processing applications are being simplified and streamlined so as to make all payments earlier. I am confident that as a result of these various initiatives all 1992 schemes applicants entitled to headage and premia grants will receive them.  Implementation of these arrangements will also ensure much earlier payment of grants and I expect that as much as £45 million of 1992 grants which would not normally be paid until 1993 will now be paid before the end of the year.</P>

    <P>Since 1987 three persons were convicted <Col N="1600" /> in respect of offences relating to clenbuterol and 30 persons for hormone offences; one person was convicted in respect of both hormones and clenbuterol.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved the preparation of a Bill to amend the Animal Remedies Act, 1956.  The Bill is presently being drafted by the Parliamentary Draftsman in consultation with officers of my Department.  The purpose of this amendment is to considerably strengthen the powers of the Minister to control all aspects of the manufacture, availability and use of veterinary medicines. Severe penalties for breaches will be provided including increasing the fines available for summary offences and the introduction of a provision for a term of imprisonment for such offences.  The major provision of the Bill will be the introduction of indictable offences under the Act for which maximum penalties of £50,000 fine and or 10 years imprisonment will be available.  This should meet with demands for stricter penalties which will deter even the most hardened offender.</P>

      <P>As promised under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I have convened a group consisting of representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the farm and agricultural organisations who were signatories to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to draw up a report which would form the basis for a development programme for the agriculture and <Col N="1601" /> food sector.  The group commenced work some months ago.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Culliton report also recommended that a development plan for the food industry should be drawn up by an expert group. To avoid the duplication of having two groups working on the same issue, and following consultation with the Task Force appointed to oversee the implementation of the Culliton report, I am setting up a single group, which would include farmers, manufacturers, retailers and the state sector to produce a plan for the food industry.</P>
      <P>Once these reports are available to me, I will adopt a strategy to guide the development of the agricultural and food sectors in future years taking into account all the changing circumstances with which will arise, including the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy reform and GATT negotiations and the availability of EC funds for development purposes.</P>

      <P>The quality and purity of Irish food products will be two of the key advantages which the Irish food industry will have to promote if it is to succeed in the tougher and more competitive markets that now exist.  We already have a number of quality marks which have been successful in promoting Irish products in home and export markets.  These include those awarded under the CBF beef and pigmeat quality assurance schemes and the Q-Mark established by the Irish Quality Association.  There is also the internationally recognised ISO 9000 award which has been earned by many of our food companies.</P>
      <P>The use of these symbols is backed up by rules and inspection systems which aim at guaranteeing the quality of the product to the consumer.  These symbols are, therefore useful marketing assets which have gained acceptance over time and which I believe should continue in operation.  At this stage I am not considering the further introduction of a single symbol to cover all Irish products. I am, however, encouraging all Irish food manufacturing firms to become members of established and appropriate quality guarantee schemes.</P>

      <P>My Department are concerned with the need to promote the greater mobility of land to increase agricultural efficiency.</P>
      <P>Following the Government commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a new development programme is being negotiated for the agriculture and food sector.  In the formulation of this programme account will be taken of the need to promote structural change in farming including the promotion of transfers of family farms to young farmers.  The implications of changes in the Social Welfare code will be one of the elements to be considered in this exercise.</P>

      <P>For a variety of reasons the marketing area of the Irish beef processing sector needs to be strengthened.  Involvement of more firms with experience in marketing and with the financial strength necessary to develop markets would help significantly in this regard.  The larger co-ops, while their core business is in dairying, have expanded into other areas including meat processing.  They have developed substantial commercial markets abroad for their existing products and have put in place distribution networks to service those markets.  Because of this and because of their financial strength, they are well placed to sell other food products, including beef.</P>
      <P>Prior to the sale of the assets of UMP, I encouraged the larger co-ops to bid for these assets, for the reasons which I have just outlined.  I believe that, as a result of the acquisition of the assets by Avonmore and Dairygold, the prospects for employment at the former UMP plants in the longer term is now more secure than ever because of the declared objective of the two new owners to develop the business and because of their financial and marketing ability to achieve that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development by Irish food companies of the scale and the marketing capacity needed to acquire increasing market share abroad has been the policy of my Department for many years.  This policy has been implemented mainly through the deployment of State and <Col N="1608" /> FEOGA grants in a manner which encourages such development.</P>

      <P>Any consideration of production and imports of vegetables must take account of the following: (1) there are no restrictions on imports from other member states of the European Community; (2) the seasonality factor, especially in respect of fresh vegetables, means that economic production in this country is not possible for certain periods of the year; (3) the variability of yields, particularly for potatoes, due to climatic conditions makes it impossible to achieve an exact match of production and demand on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years the value of imports of vegetables has increased by about 30 per cent in current prices.  This represents practically no increase in real terms.  Over the same period the value of exports increased by over 240 per cent. Considerable State and EC resources have been invested in the industry under the Operational Programme for Rural Development, the FEOGA Marketing and Processing scheme and the Farm Improvement Programme.  In addition An Bord Glas and Teagasc are actively involved in providing advisory, research and promotion services for the sector.</P>

    <P>Outside of areas where specific Ministerial control is provided for in the relevant legislation, responsibility for the supervision of State bodies under the aegis of my Department rests primarily with their boards.  I do not propose to alter this situation at this time.  However, a report on the principles which govern the relationship between Departments of State and the State bodies under their aegis has recently been considered by Government.  Guidelines based on the recommendations of this report have been drawn up by the Department of Finance.  I have provided the Chairman of each of the State bodies under the control of my Department with a copy of these guidelines and have asked that they implement them.  In addition my Department is currently reviewing its own procedures to ensure that these fulfil the <Col N="1611" /> requirements of the guidelines and in the light of this review, will take whatever measures are necessary to effect compliance with them.</P>
    <P>Prior to the issuing of these guidelines, Teagasc, An Bord Glas and CBF had codes of conduct in place but these may have to be revised in the light of the new guidelines.  I am arranging to have copies of each of the codes sent to the Deputies as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The question of additional payments does not arise until the data from the recent field survey of 40,000 farms are processed, the results considered by the appeal panel and recommendations made to me prior to the initiation of detailed procedure with the EC Commission. This involves a formal submission by the Government to the EC Commission, detailed discussion and consultation between both parties followed by Commission approval and if necessary, ratification by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that once the submission is ratified there is no question of any undue delay in making payments. In this regard, the recent extension and reclassification proposals were finally ratified in September 1991 and payments were made to farmers in the areas affected under the 1991 headage scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>EC legislation, which provided for the banning of all mercury based agricultural pesticides on environmental and human health grounds, was originally adopted in 1979.  In 1989 the EC Commission pressed for the ending of derogations for the use of mercury compounds.  The industry in Ireland was satisfied that adequate alternatives were available and that a further derogation of two years was the most that could be justified to carry out final tests on new products.  The use of mercury based pesticides as a dressing for cereal seeds was banned from July 1991.</P>
      <P>The alternative products used in the 1991-92 cereal crops failed in a minority of cases to prevent adequately the development of fungal disease and some crops have been adversely affected.  Disease control was however, effected in the vast bulk of cereal crops and it is anticipated that any remaining problems can be solved with the aid of the information obtained this year.  The combination of available pesticides and adjustments in farm husbandry and crop treatment can guard against a recurrence of the problems encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory controls on pesticides, operated by my Department under EC legislation, do not extend to testing for the efficacy of pesticides.  Current legislation is directed at the classification, packaging and labelling of pesticides in order to ensure that the use of products do not constitute a danger to human life or to the environment and that the resultant <Col N="1618" /> food products do not contain pesticide residues dangerous to the health of the consumer.  However, my Department does co-operate with agro-chemical firms in carrying out tests and trials on the efficacy of particular pesticides treatments.</P>
    <P>From July 1993 EC legislation will come into effect with extended control on pesticides including a provision relating to the efficacy question.  Implementation of this legislation in due course is already being considered in my Department.</P>

      <P>As already announced, 16 Irish groups have been approved for funding under the Leader programme, which is the EC's own initiative on rural development.  Some £35 million in public funding is being provided &mdash; £21 million EC and £14 million Irish &mdash; between now and the end of 1993.  The groups will be expected to raise a similar amount in matching funds, making a total investment of £70 million over the life of the programme.</P>

    <P>The essence of Leader is that while the groups are being provided with global grants, the decisions on the investments to be undertaken rest entirely with the groups themselves.  Investment in the following activities may be funded: technical support for rural development such as surveys and assessments, vocational training and assistance for recruitment, rural tourism, small firms, crafts and local services, development and marketing of local agricultural, forestry and fishery products and other activities which contribute <Col N="1619" /> to the development of the groups' areas.</P>

      <P>Section 26 of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, recognises the Irish Coursing Club as being the controlling authority for the breeding of greyhounds and provides that the constitution of the Club shall be as set forth in the Schedule to the Act.  The Schedule provides that an object of the Club shall be the promotion of the breeding of thoroughbred greyhounds (including maintenance of the Irish Greyhound Stud Book).  These provisions reflect the position that obtained when the legislation was enacted.  The legislation is, however, now being comprehensively reviewed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> Membership of a coursing club by owners of thoroughbred greyhounds is considered by the Irish Coursing Club to be necessary for the proper control and management of the stud book.  Since registration fees relate to the keeping of the stud book there are no grounds on which they could be paid directly to Bord na gCon.</P>

      <P>I am unclear as to the purpose of the Deputy's question but, taken literally, it would require, in so far as my Department is concerned, a listing <Col N="1632" /> of a large volume of companies with which the Department might have contact from time to time in the course of the administration of its business.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The recently published ESRI study on the &ldquo;Role of the Structural Funds&rdquo; concludes that the employment effects of the increased funding available under the CSF build up over time.  Initially there is an increase in 1989 and 1990 of around 8,000.  This rises to 19,000 by the year 1993.  The improvement in the productive potential of the economy after that date adds another 12,000 by the year 2000 taking the gain in total employment to 31,000, a rise of around 2.6 per cent.  It should be noted that these gains relate to the increase in EC assistance negotiated in 1989 as compared to the level of aid available prior to then.  The total impact of the structural funds is therefore greater.  The ESRI study does not give a breakdown of the sectoral composition of the employment increase.</P>
      <P>The total commitment to Ireland under the Structural Funds for the period 1989 to 1993 will exceed £3 billion.  These Community funds are having a significant impact in strengthening the basic capacity of the Irish economy.  It is estimated that the increase in Community support negotiated in 1989 has boosted annual growth by approximately ¼ per cent to ½ per cent. It has also resulted in higher employment than would otherwise have been possible and it was a key factor in the net increase of 39,000 non-agricultural jobs in the two years to April, 1991 &mdash; the latest date for which figures are available.</P>
      <P>Table 1 below sets out details by sector of the changes in net employment in the period mid-April 1989 to mid-April 1991.</P>

      <P>In accordance with paragraph 2.7 of the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1989-1993 (CSF) seven Sub-regional Review Committees have been set up to monitor the implementation of the CSF in the sub-regions.  These committees are regularly provided with progress reports and financial statements on current and planned implementation of operational measures in, or significantly affecting, the sub-region concerned.</P>
      <P>Detailed financial tables entitled &ldquo;Breakdown of Structural Spending All Sub-regions&rdquo; are circulated to the sub-regional review committees twice a year and copies are placed in the Dáil Library. These show progress in implementing the CSF, broken down by operational programme and action, in actual terms for past years and on a forecast basis for future years.  The most recent edition of these tables was issued to the committees in February, 1992 and was placed in the Dáil Library on 26 February, 1992 for the information of the Members of the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach's statement referred to by the Deputy is based on the tables on pages 6 and 7 of this document which shows the percentage share and <i>per capita</i> expenditure by sub-region cumulatively for the period 1989-1993.</P>

      <P>In the context of the renewal of the bank levy in the 1991 budget, my predecessor announced that a special working group of officials of my Department and representatives of the banks would be set up to examine corporation tax applying to banks and the role of the levy.  I indicated in this year's budget that the working group had investigated the matter, and that as a result of its examination, new arrangements in relation to banks' taxation would be introduced in this year's Finance Bill.  Those are now set out in sections 42 and 180 of the Bill as initiated. It would not be appropriate to publish the working group's examination of its remit.  There will, of course, be an opportunity to debate the new arrangements in the upcoming Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>As announced on Friday, 24 April last in the press release for the Finance Bill, 1992, it is intended to bring forward on Committee Stage of that Bill an amendment to provide for a final and definitive time extension to the existing deadline of the end of May 1993 which applies to the designated areas generally.  While it would not be appropriate to anticipate the details of the extension at this time, an extension <i>per se</i> will ease time pressures on the commencement of development in order to meet the current deadline.</P>
      <P>Policy in regard to urban archaeology is as outlined in the Urban Archaeology Guidelines document published in 1989 by the National Monuments Advisory Council.  The principles propounded in these guidelines included the use of construction techniques enabling archaeological remains to be preserved <i>in situ</i> for future examination.  The present development at Christchurch Place is proceeding in accordance with this principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the National Monuments <Col N="1647" /> (Amendment) Act, 1987, provides for the establishment of an Historic Monuments Council in place of the National Monuments Advisory Council which was governed by earlier legislation.  The question of bringing this section into operation and that of establishing an Historic Monuments Council are being considered in conjunction with the matter of establishing the National Heritage Council on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of a funding policy for archaeological excavation, a special programme entitled the Discovery Programme was initiated in 1991 to work towards a coherent and comprehensive picture of human life on this island from earliest times.  The budget of £500,000 provided in the current year for this purpose is a major addition to the funds already being provided for archaeological research and for excavations at national monuments.  There is a limit to the extent that the State can provide finance and where archaeological excavation is required for development purposes the policy is that the developer should bear the cost.</P>
    <P>The possibility of international co-operation regarding archaeological excavation is being borne in mind but it is unlikely that funding from abroad will be available in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>The area known as the Bend of the Boyne or Bru na Boinne, which includes the major monuments of Knowth, Dowth and Newgrange together with many other related monuments, is a megalithic cemetery of international significance and has been identified as being worthy of a special programme of conservation and presentation.  This programme envisages the protection of the monuments in their environmental setting while creating suitable conditions for the public to see and appreciate them.  This will involve increased protection for the monuments, improved access for visitors, additional <Col N="1649" /> staffing, provision of interpretative and other facilities.  It is not possible to give an overall estimate of cost for these various activities which will be spread over a number of years.  Significant progress has already been made, with the opening of Knowth to the public last year and it is hoped that work will commence on the construction of a visitor centre within the next few months.</P>
      <P>Extensive consultation has taken place with local residents and the relevant local authority, Meath County Council, has been represented on an <i>ad hoc</i> steering committee since 1986.  In addition, the county council was formally consulted on the planning aspects of the proposals and gave its approval.</P>

      <P>All possible benefits including the relief of flooding of commercial and domestic property are taken into account in assessing the economic viability of arterial drainage schemes.</P>
      <P>The Nanny River catchment is included (at No. 14) on the priority list of minor catchments to be considered for inclusion in the arterial drainage programme. To date works have been undertaken on five schemes and deferred on economic grounds in four other cases of higher priority on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning of all arterial drainage schemes was suspended in 1983 by Government decision.  A subsequent Government decision (in 1986) authorised the resumption of planning on four <Col N="1650" /> schemes &mdash; the Suir, the Owenmore, the Mulkear and the Dunkellin.</P>

      <P>The total number of submissions received on the environmental impact statement was 520.  Of these, 349 were in favour of the project proceeding at the proposed location.</P>
      <P>A total of 171 were opposed to the project.  Many of these had gone first to institutions such as the European Commission and were received after the deadline for receipt of submissions had passed.  It is clear that a large proportion of the submissions opposing the project were made as a direct result of a letter circulated by the English organisation &ldquo;Plantlife&rdquo;, which asked members to write opposing the project on specific points mentioned by them.  I have, nevertheless, taken these submissions into account as valid even though they did not meet the requirements of the statutory notice.  There may be a few more of this type of submission transmitted to other agencies, but at this stage there is little scope for including these as valid submissions.</P>
      <P>Although the vast majority of submissions in favour of the project are from individuals and organisations in the local community the important issue in assessing the EIS and response is to answer the criticisms and concerns raised in those submissions opposing the development.</P>

      <Col N="1651" /> This information will be made available to Clare County Council to assist them in their balanced appraisal of this development before any final decision is made on whether or not to proceed with a visitor centre for the national park.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy to keep an operational refinery capacity in Ireland as a security of supply measure.  Whitegate is operated in a limited mode in fulfilment of this objective, and for this reason, and not being an upgraded facility, there is a diseconomy associated with its operations. The diseconomy, contrasted against Rotterdam prices plus freight, varies from time to time, but a general idea of the scale can be got from the report of the Fair Trade Commission on the Supply and Distribution of Motor Fuels, which estimated that, over the four year period examined, the diseconomy was 0.54 pence per litre, or 0.145 pence per litre if the 90 day strategic storage (towards which its stocks are allowed to be reckoned) and other costs were included.</P>

      <P>The threat to the Community salmon market from low priced imports remains serious and persistent in view of the disorder that continues to affect the Norwegian salmon farming sector.</P>
      <P>It was against this background that I pressed the Commission last February to renew the minimum import price measures for salmon entering the Community market which were first introduced in November 1991.  These measures have given Irish salmon producers some protection against the threat of market collapse posed by Norwegian imports at below cost prices.  I am glad to report that the Commission has renewed the safeguard measures for a further three month period, up to the end of May.  I have stressed to the Commission that the minimum import price system must be stringently monitored and enforced if it is to be effective in its aim of safeguarding Community producers. In the meantime we are continuing, together with the Irish industry, to be at the forefront of efforts to ensure that all necessary action is taken to ensure that the market is restored to balance and that a sustained recovery from the rock bottom prices of recent times is achieved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>I have received representations on behalf of local residents about the assignment of community gardaí to the estates in question.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a community garda will be appointed to these estates within the coming fortnight as a replacement for a member who was recently assigned to other duties.  The question of assigning additional community gardaí to the estates concerned is being kept under review in the light of overall manpower commitments at Clondalkin station.</P>

      <P>At present there are 28 sessional supervisors employed in the Dublin area. They are employed on a part-time basis for, on average, 18 hours per week and are remunerated on an hourly basis.</P>
      <P>Their duties include assisting probation and welfare officers in ensuring that offenders on community service orders carry out the work involved in a satisfactory manner and giving skilled guidance to offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sessional supervisors are, on engagement, given instruction as to the nature of the work and the safety precautions necessary.  Procedures in the case of an accident are emphasised.  My Department's <Col N="1658" /> Probation and Welfare Service is currently introducing a basic training scheme for sessional supervisors as part of the overall strategy to meet the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>

      <P>It is my policy and that of the Garda authorities to have the maximum possible number of gardaí available for operational duties, including foot patrols.  A number of specific policy measures have been taken to this end such as: recruitment of 1,000 trainee gardaí since 1989 and the holding of the further recruitment competition now in progress to take in an additional 1,000 trainees over the next few years; temporary extension of retirement age from 57 to 60 for members of the garda, sergeant and inspector ranks due to retire in the period November, 1989 to 31 December, 1992; recruitment of 180 civilian staff over the past two years and a further 140 civilians this year to release trained gardaí for outdoor operational duties; and, a reduction in record keeping and streamlining of Garda clerical procedures as part of the community policing scheme to make more time available for outdoor patrol duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deployment of Garda foot patrols, particularly in areas such as busy shopping areas, is an important contribution to crime prevention and detection.  It is important, however, that foot patrolling be seen as only one of a number of related Garda measures to safeguard the community against crime.  Other measures such as mobile patrolling, neighbourhood and community policing, neighbourhood watch, community alert and the deployment of gardaí on operational duties in plain-clothes all combine <Col N="1659" /> to provide a comprehensive Garda response to crime.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>when a comprehensive dental education scheme for primary schools to counteract the damage to young children's teeth, caused by consumption of sweets and soft drinks, will be brought forward.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>All health boards provide a school dental service for children attending national school.  A number of health boards are changing or have already changed from a demand based service to a planned systematic service.  Under the planned systematic service the need for dental treatment in national school children is identified through school screening and treatment is offered, based not on demand, but on need.  Changes in the patterns of disease and the emergence of new technology mean that greater improvements in oral health can be achieved by targeting the service at specific age groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the changeover has fully taken place children will be examined on an incremental basis in school classes and provided with comprehensive dental education, <Col N="1685" /> preventive (fissure sealing) and treatment services as necessary.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that, in this way, children for whom a service was previously rarely, if ever, demanded &mdash; often those in lower socio-economic groups and those in greatest need of dental care &mdash; will be screened, advised of the services available, educated in dental hygiene and referred for care as necessary.  This is a welcome development in the Children's Dental Service as it seeks to provide the optimum service to those in need.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dental Education Programmes</i>
    </P>
    <P>In addition to the health board school dental services my Department, through its Health Promotion Unit, is engaged in a wide range of preventive strategies which aim to address the problem of dental damage caused by the consumption of sweets and soft drinks during childhood.</P>
    <P>Ideally, dental health education programmes should form part of a comprehensive health education programme. An example of this approach is the &ldquo;Bí folláin&rdquo; programme piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board region during 1991 and 1992 which will become ready for wider dissemination in June 1992.</P>
    <P>The Irish Dental Health Foundation (IDHF) whose administration costs are funded by my Department runs programmes throughout the year in primary schools, targeting five-year-olds, seven to eight-year-olds and nine to 12-year-olds with an approach relevant to each age group.</P>
    <P>Examples of specific IDHF pilot projects currently being funded or supported by my Department include</P>
    <P>(a)  Co-ordination of National Schools Dental Health Education Programmes.</P>
    <P>The 30 principal dental health officers who manage dental services have nominated a member of their staff to act as liaison/co-ordinator with the IDHF, with responsibility for dissemination of dental education materials to all schools.  A one day workshop to initiate this approach will take place in September.  All co-ordinators will be supplied with a reference <Col N="1686" /><i>Co-ordinator's Guide</i> which will be jointly developed by the Health Promotion Unit and the IDHF.</P>
    <P>(b)  Mighty Mouth &mdash; A programme for disadvantaged children.</P>
    <P>This involves 1,000 five-year-old children in designated disadvantaged areas of Dublin.  The programme aims to test dental awareness education materials which have been specially designed for use with children from these areas.  It will be implemented in the above areas using the framework of the school/home/ community liaison co-ordinators national programme.</P>
    <P>(c)  Kilkenny Health Project.</P>
    <P>As part of this project which looked at the role of nutrition in the prevention of heart disease a local dental co-ordinator worked with schools highlighting the need to reduce consumption of sugar based foods, in the fight against tooth decay and general ill-health.</P>
    <P>(d)  Pearly White &mdash; Dick Gumshoe</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit and Dental Services of my Department, in association with the Irish Cancer Society, IDHF and dental officers in the health boards are in the process of developing materials for use in primary level schools, which will complement any programmes already being developed.  This programme addresses the problems caused by smoking, not just to teeth but to general health, while simultaneously reinforcing the &ldquo;cut down on sweets&rdquo; message.  It will be launched in mid 1992 in all first level schools.</P>
    <P>The above initiatives outline the range of activities being conducted to address dental education at primary school level. During 1992 a framework which will oversee the development, dissemination and evaluation of dental health programmes and other school materials will be established by a working group representing the community dental services, the Health Promotion Unit and the IDHF.  This, together with wider implementation of school-based programmes currently operating on a pilot <Col N="1687" /> basis (following evaluation of same) will help counteract the damage to childrens' teeth and to general health caused by the over-consumption of sugar based sweets and soft drinks.</P>

      <P>At present there are almost 2,600 people with a mental handicap included in the European Social Fund assisted operational programme for the vocational training of people with disabilities.  The programme which provides assistance of almost £25 million per annum at current prices for 4,500 trainees runs until the end of 1993.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the assistance available under the current programme will continue, and indeed possibly increase under the post 1993 Structural Funds for Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to the improvement of training programmes and job opportunities for people with disabilities, my Department, in conjunction with the National Rehabilitation Board, have taken a number of initiatives in this regard recently.  These include the development of accreditation and certification standards, the establishment of a national advisory committee on the training and employment of people with disabilities representative of the training agencies, the relevant Government Departments and the social partners, and the introduction of an employment subsidy scheme.</P>

Assessment of needs and decisions on allocation of suitable home helps to persons referred to the service are made by the local home help organiser.  Each organiser has been asked to prioritise cases referred to her within the overall budget available for her organisation. This year the Eastern Health Board has allocated £65,000 to the St. Laurence O'Toole organisation.  This allocation compares with £52,000 in 1991 and represents an increase of 25 per cent on last year.  The organisation has full discretion in assigning home helps within their budget.</P>

      <P>(a)  I am aware that some elements of the health service have been experiencing from time to time cash flow difficulties which has resulted in longer than normal trading terms being applied in some health boards.</P>
      <P>I am equally aware however that where these difficulties have existed, health boards have recognised the particular needs of the smaller suppliers who are generally locally based.</P>
      <P>However, it is the responsibility of each agency to manage its cash and credit with its operational needs and within approved expenditure levels.  The timing of payments to suppliers of goods and services is a matter for local management to decide.</P>
      <P>(b)  I do not accept that many firms are refusing to tender for supply contracts as suggested.  Obviously when boards are in a position to negotiate cash discounts they obtain supplies on a more competitive basis.  This is not to say, however, that when no such discounts are availed of inferior goods are purchased.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the working capital requirements of the health services to see what improvements can be made by the Department and its agencies, including health boards, in the management of the cash available.</P>
      <P>In any event I am very conscious of the need for suppliers to the service to be paid as quickly as possible both from the point of view of viability in regard to small firms and the necessity for the service to achieve greater value for money in purchasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no undue delay on the part of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in its discussions with private hospitals on new contractual arrangements. VHI hospital agreements expired on 31 December 1991 and the board was fully prepared to effect new agreements in advance of 1 January 1992.  It must be appreciated that these discussions addressed many complex issues including costs, complexity of services and new technology and, in most cases, hospitals asked for more time.  The board agreed to this request, continued to pay accounts at current rates and undertook to backdate agreements to 1 January.</P>
      <P>Individual agreements had to be reached and have now been concluded with the vast majority of private hospitals.  I am satisfied that the negotiations did not affect the viability of hospitals and that the information requested by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was necessary before reaching agreement.  It will be understood that the board as an insurance underwriter must be in a position to satisfy itself as to the reasonableness of cost presented to it and ensure that VHI remains affordable to its 1.2 million insured.</P>
      <P>The agreements provide for VHI reimbursement to hospitals for their legitimate costs, plus an overall marginal 3 per cent of turnover to allow for some development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current agreements also provide for additional payment where case mix intensity increases, as this generates higher costs to hospitals.  In addition, if a <Col N="1694" /> hospital achieves the agreed level of patient throughput, without any diminution in case mix intensity, for less than the agreed budget, the saving can be retained, up to a limit of 5 per cent of budget.</P>

      <P>The stay safe programme is a child abuse prevention programme.  The programme was designed for use in primary schools and covers all forms of abuse including bullying.  Its aim is to prevent child abuse by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are then taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced through discussion with their parents.  This approach increases community awareness and makes children less vulnerable to abuse of all kinds.</P>

The response of parents, teachers and children themselves to the programme has been very positive and the question of extending it to schools in the other health board areas is under active consideration at present in both Departments.</P>

      <P>Statistics on the distribution of medical cards are collated by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures available from the board reflect the position as on 31 December, 1991.</P>
      <P>The four counties with the highest percentage of population covered by medical cards are: Donegal, 53.39 per cent; Mayo, 52.50 per cent; Longford, 50.03 per cent; Roscommon, 47.89 per cent.</P>
      <P>The four counties with the lowest percentage of population covered by medical cards are: Limerick, 33.16 per cent; Cork, 31.87 per cent; Dublin, 28.49 per cent; Kildare, 27.11 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analysis of these figures on the basis of information on regional and county average income levels would not serve to validate the uniformity of means-testing practice by health boards since income is not the sole criterion of eligibility for a medical card.  A medical card is awarded to any person who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the health board, is unable to arrange necessary general practitioner services without undue hardship.  Income guidelines are used to assist in determining eligibility but a person whose income exceeds these will still be awarded a medical card if this <Col N="1698" /> is warranted due to medical circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, desirable that the assessment procedures should be uniform and consistent in all areas and the chief executive officers have established a review group to this end.</P>

      <P>The Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, provides for the fluoridation of public piped water supplies to reduce the incidence of dental caries. Fluoridation is achieved through the addition of hydrofluosilic acid to water supplies.  The regulations specify limits of between 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million as satisfactory.  Using these criteria the percentage of satisfactory results for 1990 and 1991 were 60 per cent and 79.6 per cent respectively.  However when what are termed marginal results are taken into account (i.e. 0.7 &mdash; 0.8 parts per million and 1.0 &mdash; 1.1 parts per million &mdash; which are acceptable by dentists internationally) the results were significantly improved to 89.1 per cent and 90.7 per cent respectively.</P>
      <P>There are no health consequences of these results.  In fact these results compare with the national average and it has been shown that there is a major decline in the prevalance of caries in school children since the introduction of the fluoridation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist health boards in extending and upgrading fluoridation schemes my Department have made a special capital grant allocation of £200,000 per annum available over the past few years.  A similar <Col N="1699" /> sum is being provided in the current year.</P>
    <P>In County Meath since November 1991 water fluoridation has been under review by the principal dental officer, the principal environmental health officer in conjunction with officers of the county council.  Meetings between the relevant county council and health board staff are planned for the next few weeks the purpose of which is to develop a five year plan to improve the effectiveness of the existing schemes.  My Department will of course provide, where possible, assistance to improve the situation within the current financial constraints and the competing priorities for funds.</P>
    <P>My Department made a special capital allocation to the North Eastern Health Board in January 1992 to allow them deal with the most urgent fluoridation problems in the Meath area.</P>

      <P>A working party made a report to my Department in 1967 on the child health services and this report forms the basis for the services presently in operation in this country.  A summary of the recommendations is set out in the table to the reply.</P>
      <P>All the child health schemes are constantly kept under review in my Department and in the health boards where they are administered.  Consideration is at present being given to the necessity at this time to establish another working party to review child health services.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Summary of Recommendations</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  All children should have a scheduled medical examination when they reach the ages of 6 months, one year and two years.  (Par. 3.5).</P>
      <P>2.  In urban areas with a population of 5,000 or more persons, the scheduled medical examinations for pre-school children should be carried out in clinics by doctors on the CMO's staff; in smaller towns where Child Welfare Clinics are now operating, the clinics could be retained if the CMO desires it.  (Par. 3.6).</P>
      <P>3.  In rural areas and towns without clinics, the scheduled medical examinations for pre-school children should be undertaken by general practitioners who have made agreements with the health authority.  (Par. 3.8).</P>
      <P>4.  The school should continue to be used as the basic centre for school health examinations.  (Par. 3.13).</P>
      <P>5.  ACMOs should continue to carry out school medical examinations.  The question of allowing general practitioners to participate in this work could be reconsidered if an acute problem in recruiting ACMOs arises in the future.  (Par. 3.14).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.  The aim of three routine medical examinations during a child's national school career should be replaced by the following system:&mdash; a comprehensive medical inspection of all children between the 6th and 7th birthdays; routine annual screening by the district nurse for vision, posture, cleanliness; audiometric testing of special groups; a <Col N="1702" /> selective medical examination of nine-year-old children (a proportion would be selected for examination); the examination in any year of a child referred by the parent, teacher, or district nurse; some children would also be due for reexaminations. (Par. 3.18).</P>
    <P>7.  The School Medical Officer would visit schools at least once a year.  (Par. 3.18).</P>
    <P>8.  In small schools (e.g. under 30 pupils) it may be more practicable to examine all the children in the school every two years.  (Par. 3.19).</P>
    <P>9.  Doctors providing services under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Service (which extends to 6 weeks after birth) should be required to undertake a scheduled medical examination of the infant at the age of 4-6 weeks, using an appropriate record card.  (Par. 3.23).</P>
    <P>10.  The maintenance by the CMO of a register of all pre-school children would be a valuable aid to the efficient running of a child welfare service.  (Par. 4.4).</P>
    <P>11.  An appointment system for mothers due to bring their infants to clinics for a scheduled medical examination would be extremely desirable.  (Par. 4.10).</P>
    <P>12.  The nurse should control access to the doctor in a Child Welfare Clinic, deal with mothers who come specially to consult her and organise associated health education activities.  (Par. 4.11).</P>
    <P>13.  Where the Child Welfare Service is provided by the general practitioner, the child's Record Card should be retained by the CMO after the final periodic examinations at the age of two years and should subsequently be associated with the School Health Service.  (Par. 4.18).</P>
    <P>14.  In clinic towns, the general practitioners providing the Maternity and Infant Welfare Service (up to six weeks of age) should make available to the CMO certain medical records in time for the six months examination of the infant in the clinic.  (Par. 4.20).</P>
    <P>15.  Everyone directly concerned with the health of the school child &mdash; parent, teacher, doctor, nurse &mdash; should work <Col N="1703" /> together as a school health team.  (Par. 5.2).</P>
    <P>16.  The initial consent sought from parents before an examination of their child under the School Health Service should cover all examinations by doctors and nurses in the school during subsequent years.  The parents could withdraw the consent at any time.  (Par. 5.3).</P>
    <P>17.  A special questionnaire should be completed by the parent of each child being examined under the School Health Service (Par. 5.8); a parallel aim would be to secure the maximum attendance of parents at the examinations.  (Par. 5.9).</P>
    <P>18.  If the School Medical Officer finds a condition in a child which adversely affects the child's educational capacity, he should inform the teacher so that allowance would be made for the child in the classroom.  (Par. 5.11).</P>
    <P>19.  The needs of school medical examinations should be taken into account in the design of new national schools.  (Par. 5.12).</P>
    <P>20.  Information on the teacher's role in the School Health Service should be systematically given in Teachers' Training Colleges and to serving teachers (Par. 5.13).</P>
    <P>21.  We estimate that about 90 doctors would need to be employed by health authorities for the Child Welfare and School Health Services, on the assumption that two-thirds of their working time was devoted to these services (Par. 6.5). At present 76 doctors are engaged in the Child Health Services but there are great variations in the proportion of time which they can devote to the services.</P>
    <P>22.  The DCH should be substituted for the DPH as an essential qualification for post of the ACMO.  A special inservice course for new entrants to the ACMO grade should be organised and would comprise social and developmental paediatrics and certain public health material covered by the present DPH.  (Par. 6.8).</P>
    <P>23.  Existing ACMOs should be given refresher courses of 4-6 weeks duration, covering clinical paediatrics, developmental paediatrics, mental handicap <Col N="1704" /> and its assessment, and child health services. (Par. 6.9).</P>
    <P>24.  Women doctors with the DCH who are married should be permitted to provide Child Welfare and School Health Services on the basis of a temporary appointment.  (Par. 6.10).</P>
    <P>25.  The proportion of the ACMO's effective working time which is available for the Child Welfare and School Health Services should be about two-thirds and should not be reducible at will as soon as other pressures arise.  (Par. 6.11).</P>
    <P>26.  There should be more flexibility in setting the official working hours for ACMOs so that they can make the best use of the relatively short school day. (Par. 6.12).</P>
    <P>27.  The co-operation of the medical profession should be sought in order to increase awareness of developmental paediatrics among general practitioners participating in the proposed Child Welfare Service.  (Par. 6.13).</P>
    <P>28.  One public health nurse in the CMO's office should be assigned to each ACMO to assist him in his visits to national schools.  (Par. 6.15).</P>
    <P>29.  Additional paediatric clinics should be provided up to the level where there is one monthly clinic to every 7,000 children aged 0-14 years.  Children should be seen within a month or so of referral. (Par. 7.5).</P>
    <P>30.  ENT clinics are urgently required in areas lacking a clinic service at present, or which have excessive waiting lists. (Par. 7.11).</P>
    <P>31.  School Medical Officers should not refer children direct to hospital for tonsillectomy except where the reasons are compelling.  Cases appropriate to the general practitioner should be referred to him rather than to the ENT clinic (Par. 7.12).</P>
    <P>32.  The capitation system of payment to ophthalmic surgeons who hold clinics for health authorities should not be extended to areas where sessional arrangements (i.e. fixed remuneration per session) now operate.  Whenever a particular ophthalmic surgeon ceases to hold a clinic, the sessional method of payment should be retained or introduced <Col N="1705" /> in any new arrangements (Par. 7.19).</P>
    <P>33.  The development of speech therapy facilities should be vigorously pursued (Par. 7.20).</P>
    <P>34.  The role of the district nurse, as the link between the homes in her district and the health services, should be specifically recognised in the mental illness and mental handicap services (Par. 7.27).</P>
    <P>35.  All necessary steps should be taken promptly to improve the out-patient specialist services where they are deficient and they should be maintained in a high state of efficiency (Par. 7.28).</P>
    <P>36.  In general, entitlement to free treatment under the Child Welfare and School Health Services should depend on the parents opting for the services and the child participating satisfactorily in the various examinations offered.  Subject to option and participation, the present entitlements for free treatment under the Child Welfare and School Health Services should be modified as follows: the 10/- daily hospital charge (public ward) for both pre-school and national school children in the middle income group should be waived irrespective of when, where or by whom the defect was discovered; certain long term defects should be scheduled and children of any income group automatically entitled to free out-patient and institutional treatment for them irrespective of whether they had opted for the Child Health Services; higher income group children should, for the first time, be entitled to free specialist out-patient treatment for any defect noted at a child welfare examination, and should retain their entitlement to free out-patient specialist services under the School Health Service; the present eligibility of higher income group children in national school to free short term hospital treatment should be removed and reliance placed on Voluntary Health Insurance; children of all income groups should be entitled to free treatment and appliances for dental, ophthalmic and hearing defects irrespective of where or by whom the defect was discovered.  The White Paper on the Health Services <Col N="1706" /> envisages the abolition of out-patient specialist charges for the middle income group (Par. 7.36).</P>
    <P>37.  Entitlement to free treatment (apart from treatment for specified long term defects) under the Child Welfare and School Health Services should depend on the parents opting for participation in these services, and on the child coming forward to a reasonable extent for the various examinations offered (Par. 7.37).</P>
    <P>38.  Health education should be the subject of a special study (Par. 8.3).</P>
    <P>39.  Positive steps should be taken to persuade mothers of the benefits for their children of the Child Welfare and School Health Services (Par. 8.4).</P>
    <P>40.  The various schemes aimed at improving the nutritional standards of mothers or children should be viewed in an integrated manner and the need for them assessed in the context of current circumstances.  In particular the School Meals Service should be re-appraised (Par. 8.6).</P>
    <P>41.  The three services concerned with children &mdash; the Maternity and Infant Welfare Service, the Child Welfare Service and the School Health Service &mdash; should be regarded as forming a continuous whole, tracking the developmental progress, and supervising the health of the child.  These three services should be renamed the Child Health Services (Par. 8.7).</P>
    <P>42.  Every effort should be made to push back the screening processes to earlier stages.  In particular, more effort should be devoted to health screening at birth and in the neo-natal period.  (Par. 8.8).</P>
    <P>43.  The Department of Health should administer the Child Health Services in an active manner (Par. 8.9).  It should collect reliable statistics as an aid to evaluation and administration of the services (Par. 8.11).</P>
    <P>44.  There is a case for a selective examination of post-primary day pupils at the ages 14-15 years; an extended School Health Service could also followup, where necessary, pupils under medical observation from national schools <Col N="1707" /> (Par. 8.14).  The School Health Service should not be extended to post-primary groups until the service in national schools is working satisfactorily (Par. 8.15).</P>
    <P>45.  The treatment facilities under the service envisaged for national schools should not be extended to post-primary schools.  The proposal in the White Paper on the Health Services to extend the dental, ophthalmic and aural services to the middle income group would meet the main needs of post-primary pupils (Par. 8.16).</P>
    <P>46.  If possible, facilities granted to post-primary pupils should be granted also to their contemporaries who have dropped out of the educational system (Par. 8.17).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207, 208, 211 and 212 together.  It is not possible at this time to outline the amount it is proposed to spend in the future on the child health services.  The resources currently devoted to running the child health services, including the community paediatric development services, must compete on an ongoing basis with other worthy projects for which my Department has responsibility and while I would like to spend more on the child health services it is my duty to spend the finite resources available to me in the best way that I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed information requested by <Col N="1709" /> the Deputy in relation to the number of children who availed of the health services in various settings, by whom they were examined and the length of the waiting lists is not readily available.  I will request the chief executive officers of each of the health boards to ascertain this information in respect of their own area and to convey this information directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Statistical information on immunisation is published by my Department in its annual report on health statistics and I will arrange to have copies of the relevant statistics made available to the Deputy in the near future.</P>
      <P>The preferred level of uptake for all immunisation is 100 per cent as any level of coverage which falls short of this may allow diseases to be transmitted in the community.  The level of cover reported to the Department suggests that the level of immunisation is considerably lower than this and I would encourage members of the public to improve their take up of the services available.</P>

      <P>Subject to compliance with general guidelines issued by my Department, the administration of the local improvement schemes, including the selection of eligible projects for funding, is entirely a matter for the local authority.  In the case of drainage works, the guidelines provide that eligible projects should relate to minor streams forming the immediate outfalls for field drains.</P>

The fee for third party appeals is still considerably less than the fee for appeals by applicants for planning permission for commercial development and represents only a small proportion of the cost of processing an appeal.  Moreover the Bill, while ensuring that final planning decisions are made within a reasonable period, has been carefully drafted to make certain that it adopts an <Col N="1721" /> even-handed approach in relation to all interests in planning matters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 236 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989, the first full year following the introduction of a tax differential in favour of unleaded petrol, its use grew from a negligible base to 7 per cent of all petrol <Col N="1722" /> sales.  By 1990, unleaded petrol accounted for 19.4 per cent of all petrol sales, in 1991 for 25.7 per cent, and at end-March, 1992 for some 30 per cent of all petrol sold.  I am satisfied that this progress compares creditably with that of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>Vehicle registration particulars do not differentiate between leaded and unleaded petrol use.  It is estimated, however, that approximately 50 per cent of the national petrol engined fleet is now capable of running on unleaded.  Virtually all new cars now have this capacity. The effect of regulations shortly to be made will be that, from the beginning of 1993, all new petrol engined vehicles will have to be capable of running on unleaded petrol.</P>

      <P>The policy principles applying in relation to environmental damage generally are that preventive action should be taken, that damage where it occurs should if possible be rectified at source, and that the polluter should pay.  Irish legislation and practice in regard to hazardous waste is based substantially on these principles. Practical measures in a particular case would be for the responsible local authority to develop, having regard to the extensive powers available for the protection of public health and the environment.</P>

However, the following table gives the latest information available on the number of dwellings per 1,000 population in each EC country.  While this suggests a comparatively high rate of utilisation of housing space in Ireland, factors such as our larger than average house and household size must also be taken into account.

      <P>I commend the worthwhile activities being carried out by this organisation which, since 1988, has received a grant each year from the subhead for North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation of the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I regret that it was necessary to reduce the grant provided in 1992 below the level of previous years. This was due to the fact that, because of the budgetary situation, the Government were obliged to reduce the overall allocation to the subhead in question.</P>
      <P>As I have previously emphasised, the reduction in this year's allocation to the subhead in no sense implies diminished appreciation, on my own part or that of the Government, of the importance and value of the work being done by the various organisations assisted.  I have also said that I hope that the budgetary circumstances next year may be such as to permit a higher allocation to be made to the subhead in question.</P>

The Community will continue, as necessary, to raise human rights concerns with the Indian authorities and to encourage India towards greater openness and access for international organisations, such as Amnesty International. The report has also been the subject of discussions between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Indian authorities.</P>

      <P>The Iranian authorities agreed last November to reopen their market for Irish beef and this was confirmed at the first meeting of the joint commission between Ireland and Iran in March. Commercial negotiations are underway but have not reached agreement on price.</P>
      <P>Following a visit by an Algerian veterinary delegation in January that market is now open to Irish beef, and sales are expected later this year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime exports of beef to other important markets such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia are proceeding steadily.</P>
      <P>As regards livestock the most important potential market is Libya.  I would hope that the recent shipment of beef to that country will be followed by agreement on the resumption of the cattle trade.</P>

      <P>The categories of people who received the free beef were: recipients of long term unemployment assistance (excluding smallholders), recipients of pre-retirement allowance, recipients of long term supplementary welfare allowance and FÁS trainees who were in receipt of long term unemployment assistance immediately prior to commencing the course.</P>
      <P>The financial allocation for the free beef scheme is determined by the EC. The quantity of beef available for distribution is therefore limited by this allocation. Every effort is made to give a reasonable quantity of beef to the largest number of recipients who are considered to be in the greatest need.  My Department consults the Department of Social Welfare before the categories of beneficiaries are decided upon.  I regret that the financial constraints do not allow the scheme to be extended.</P>

      <P>Because of the relationship between Paramyxovirus in pigeons and Newcastle disease in poultry, my Department requires that racing pigeon flocks be vaccinated.  The vaccination of poultry is prohibited in this country and the importation of vaccine is, therefore, controlled to ensure that unauthorised use does not occur.  In the circumstances, I do not consider that a change in the rules regarding the use of vaccine in pigeons is justified.</P>

    <P>Employment in agriculture, forestry and fishing fell by 12,000 between 1990 and 1991.  This follows a reported increase in two of the previous years and a reported decrease in the other two.  These figures are from the Labour Force Survey which is based on a self classification of activity. Thus a proportion of the reported 12,000 drop could still be engaged in agriculture but may be classifying themselves as having another activity as a principal occupation.</P>
    <P>There is a long term trend towards reduced numbers engaged full time in primary <Col N="1757" /> agriculture.  However, there is also a trend of increased numbers of farmers engaging in part time farming.  This trend of a greater diversification in the income sources of farm and rural households is likely to continue.  Greater emphasis on rural development programmes in the future is likely to consolidate this trend.</P>
    <P>There has been relatively stable employment in the food processing industry in recent years.  Current efforts to increase the value added in the food industry are aimed at sustaining and, if possible, increasing employment in the food processing industry.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare by health boards, a supplement may be paid to eligible applicants in respect of the costs of private rented accommodation in excess of £3.50 per week.</P>
      <P>Payment of rent supplements under this scheme ensures that persons on social welfare incomes, who rely on the private rented sector for their accommodation, have access to accommodation which is appropriate to their needs.  The Department of Social Welfare has advised health boards that the rent payable in such cases should be reasonable for the size and type of accommodation in the particular area sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice, community welfare officers <Col N="1759" /> visit the accommodation to ensure that the rent payable corresponds with the going rate for such dwellings and represents fair value for money.  Health boards may refuse to pay a supplement if they consider the accommodation to be below a reasonable standard, for instance, if it lacks basic sanitary facilities.</P>
    <P>A review of the guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation is currently being finalised in the Department of Social Welfare and the question raised by the Deputy will be examined in that context.  In addition, the matter will be discussed with the health boards with a view to eliminating any misuse of the scheme by unscrupulous landlords.</P>
    <P>Legislation obliges landlords to register a house, which is sublet in more than two lettings, with the local authority which will inspect the accommodation for the purpose of assessing its suitability for letting.  The competent authority in this case is Dublin Corporation and I am arranging for the question as to suitability for letting of the accommodation in question to be raised with the Corporation.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that no rent supplements are currently being paid in respect of the premises.</P>

      <P>The person concerned went to live with his brother and claimed unemployment assistance on 30 October 1991.  His means on investigation exceeded the maximum limit for receipt of a qualification certificate and he was consequently not entitled to assistance.</P>

At present a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have a minimum of 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year to qualify for benefit.  In future, subject to certain exceptions to be specified in regulations, at least 13 of the 39 contributions will have to be paid rather than credited.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in County Wexford has been refused an old age non-contributory pension on the grounds that her means exceed the prescribed limit, despite the fact that of the £385 fortnightly income to her household, £280 goes to maintain her husband in a nursing home and £70 per fortnight is payable in rent for her accommodation, leaving the applicant with £35 per fortnight to provide all the necessities of life; if he has satisfied himself that this refusal is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It was decided on 6 April 1992 that the person concerned does not qualify for old age non-contributory pension as her means exceed the statutory limit of £58.00 per week.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of the expenses which this person incurs in renting accommodation and in support for her husband.  However, there is no provision in social welfare legislation to offset such expenses against means in deciding entitlement to pension.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned is encountering difficulties with living expenses, she should contact her local health board which may be in a position to assist her.</P>

      <Col N="1764" /> The Deputy may wish to note that, as the person concerned is over 66 years of age, she is entitled to a free travel pass. A free travel application form issued to her recently.</P>

      <P>Credited contributions are awarded to an insured person for any week of proved unemployment.  A person normally proves unemployment by signing the unemployed register at the appointed time and thereby declaring that she/he is unemployed and available for work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 1965 when he ceased to claim and ceased to sign the register of unemployed.  He next made contact with the local office of the Department on 23 December 1991 and has been in receipt of unemployment assistance since that date.  As he did not sign the unemployed register between 1965 and 1991, he is not entitled to credited contributions during that period.</P>
