      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where divorce is concerned in this country there seems to be two laws applicable: one for the rich and one for the rest.  May I ask the Taoiseach if the comments which are attributed to him in today's edition of the <i>London Independent</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to legislation which has been promised outside of this House.  Can the Taoiseach tell us whether there will be a divorce referendum in 1993 as stated in <i>The Independent</i> and whether there will be a White Paper on the issue before the end of this year?  Can we take that as being in order?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy, I want to reiterate the Government's programme in relation to that matter.  I made it clear on numerous occasions in this House &mdash; and I have not changed the agenda one iota &mdash; that legislation on home ownership will be taken first, that we expect the White Paper on Marital Breakdown to be available later this year and that after the national debate a referendum will take place.  I put no time limit on the holding of a referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government are committed to encouraging all our youth to benefit to the maximum from the opportunities that are open to <Col N="1647" /> them in our schools and colleges.  We are proud of our success in this regard.  Out of a population of some 3.5 million, there are almost one million participants in full time education.  This represents the highest proportion in education among the OECD group of countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland, along with other countries in the European Community, has been undergoing rapid change due to scientific and technological progress, advances in telecommunications and international competitive trading in goods and services. Indeed the rapid rate of advance made in science and technology in all areas is bringing about a complete transformation in the conditions of modern life and affects every individual in society.  We live in an age of continuing generation of new knowledge and of scientific discoveries.  The discoveries of yesterday are closely followed by innovations which have significant impact on industry, business and education.</P>
      <P>During the last decade we have witnessed many significant changes and developments in the Irish education system and our society in general, the pace of change has transformed in many ways the living patterns and expectations that society had at the beginning of the eighties.  The rapid pace of contemporary change due to advancement of scientific knowledge and technological progress during the nineties will provide us with a greater and more complex range of challenges and opportunities.</P>
      <P>Pervasive technological developments will continue to have a dominant impact and will influence greatly economic growth and social progress.  Educators and trainers will need to constantly question and define relevant knowledge, skills and competencies and make appropriate changes in the curricula of the various programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Maastricht Treaty, with its political, economic and educational dimensions, it is imperative that our young people be given the appropriate knowledge, skills and information values in our schools and colleges.  They must develop their critical analytical <Col N="1648" /> capacities and be encouraged to participate fully in a world of rapidly evolving interdependence which has major environmental, social and health problems to tackle and resolve.</P>
    <P>The education system in Ireland must ensure by a process of continuing review, reform and curriculum innovation that individuals during their period of compulsory schooling are equipped not only with basic knowledge and competencies but are also equipped with learning skills to enable them to update themselves and acquire new knowledge and skills during their adult life.</P>
    <P>While Irish people can be proud of their education system which has served this country so well, no education system can remain static.  If it is to continue to deliver relevant programmes, it must be dynamic, adaptive and responsive to changing educational needs and to changes in the world it serves.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Education, which will be published in the near future, will put forward a radical new vision for our education system.  It will be a comprehensive document and will invite all concerned interests to engage in a major national debate with a view to establishing a framework within which educational developments will take place into the next century.</P>
    <P>Many individual changes are envisaged in the Green Paper &mdash; changes in the curriculum area, changes in how we manage the considerable national resources devoted to education, changes in how we train teachers, changes in how we approach education at second level and so on.  I sincerely hope, however, that this debate will not just be about picking and choosing from a menu of detailed proposals.  We need a coherent philosophy to underpin our education system, not a rag-bag of miscellaneous changes.  The Green Paper puts forward such a philosophy and I hope that the ensuing debate will produce a consensus.</P>
    <P>The central aims of the Green Paper, which I believe should be the cornerstone of our approach, will be: (1) to establish greater equity in education, particularly <Col N="1649" /> for those who are disadvantaged socially and economically; (2) to broaden Irish education so as to equip students more effectively for life, for work in an enterprise culture and for citizenship of Europe; (3) to make the best use of education resources by radically devolving administration, introducing the best management practice and strengthening policy making; (4) to train and develop teachers so as to equip them for a constantly-changing environment; (5) to create a system of effective quality assurance; (6) to ensure greater openness and accountability throughout the system and maximise parent involement and choice.</P>
    <P>These are the six national aims that I am suggesting we adopt.  Detailed proposals that will be in the Green Paper are geared towards them.  Finding out whether we all agree on them will be the objective in the debate.  Only after we have reached a clear view of what we are trying to achieve will it make any sense to discuss the detail of how we are going to achieve it.</P>
    <P>The total gross provision for the four Education Votes is nearly £1,600 million, which includes almost £174 million as appropriations in aid.  The comparable gross outturn figure in 1991 is £1,484 million approximately.  The amount being provided in 1992 represents an increase of over £114 million or 7.7 per cent over the 1991 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>This £1,600 million is a very substantial outlay on education.  It is the highest ever provided by the State and at 6.4 per cent of GNP is one of the highest in the EC. This provision will help me to continue the vital work of promoting and implementing various educational reform measures and strategies which will ensure that the programmes provided in our schools and colleges are not only of relevance to the immediate needs of pupils today but also will prepare them for living in the world beyond the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The net provision by the State for all Non-Capital Supply Services for 1992 is approximately £6,855 million and of this amount some £1,343 million is being allocated <Col N="1650" /> to fund services in the education sector.  This amount represents almost 20 per cent of Exchequer current expenditure on the supply services.  Such a significant provision for the education sector is a clear and unequivocal indication by this Government of their commitment to maintain and develop the nature and quality of the Irish education system.</P>
    <P>The education process is of its very nature a labour intensive one, and this is reflected in the Estimates.  The provision for pay and pensions is £1,254 million approximately, which represents 83 per cent of the gross non-capital provision. The overall provision also includes over £81 million for capital expenditure, an increase of nearly £13 million or 18 per cent on the 1991 outturn.</P>
    <P>The 1992 allocation provides an additional £2.735 million for improvements in the pupil/teacher ratio at primary and post-primary levels.  At primary level, teaching posts which would otherwise decline in number by 300 in the 1992/93 school year, due to falling rolls, will be retained at existing numbers.  This will improve the pupil/teacher ratio to 25.2/1.  At post primary level the ratio will be improved to 19.25 for appointment purposes in the 1992/93 school year.  This will involve an increase of 143 in the number of existing posts.</P>
    <P>A phased programme, starting in 1992/93, will be introduced to provide for the recognition of vice principals and guidance teachers on an ex-quota basis as outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progess</i>.  This will mean that from September next 87 vice principals will be recognised as ex-quota, thereby giving rise to a similar number of new teaching posts, and 62 schools will benefit directly from an increase in the number of approved guidance teacher posts.</P>
    <P>An extra £500,000 is being provided for the introduction in the 1992/93 school year on a phased basis of a programme to expand the provision for caretaking and clerical services to all national schools with 100 pupils upwards and to second level schools with 200 pupils upwards.  The phasing of the programme <Col N="1651" /> will be on the basis of school size, starting with the larger schools.</P>
    <P>The 1992 provision for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is being increased by 31 per cent to £425,000.  This very significant increase will enable the council to proceed with their tasks in relation to the primary and post primary curricula.  Given the wide range of ability levels and aptitudes of students who now proceed to post compulsory education, it is necessary to ensure that provision at this level is relevant and suited to the needs of those students.  In their work the NCCA will take into account the curriculum needs and requirements of all pupils and will give particular consideration to the needs of underachievers and low achievers.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to have been able to provide for a significant increase in the provision for publications in Irish.  The 1992 provision of £771,000 represents an increase of £248,000, or 47 per cent on the 1991 outturn.  This provision will enable An Gúm to provide Irish language text books for a range of Junior and Senior Certificate subjects for which there are no suitable texts available at the moment.  This in turn will greatly facilitate all-Irish schools in their efforts to foster and promote the use of Irish.</P>
    <P>A policy priority in the education area is the raising of the quality of basic schooling for all our children.  In the past many young people, especially those from disadvantaged areas, left school ill equipped and poorly prepared to play their part in modern society.  The Department of Education and I are fully committed to addressing social equity issues relating to education and are implementing and developing many strategies in this area.  Indeed, as I have already stated, it is one of the six central aims of the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>Resources are being, and will continue to be, targeted and initiatives developed which give special attention to the needs of the disadvantaged in our society, with the specific intent to promote their personal development.  The provision for disadvantage was increased under the <i>Programme <Col N="1652" /> for Economic and Social Progress</i> by £1 million in 1991.  The 1992 allocation provides a further increase of £250,000 to assist in various areas of disadvantage at all levels of the education system.  These funds are additional to those being provided in other ways, including the £1.5 million ongoing provision for the primary area and the special funding arrangements for supplying extra teachers in schools in disadvantaged areas at post primary level.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to be able to make provision for the further expansion of the vocational training opportunities scheme in 1992.  The establishment of a further 25 groups in September next will increase the total number of places provided on the programme by 500 to 1,560. VTOS provides second chance education and training to long term unemployed trainees over 21 years of age.  A training allowance is paid in lieu of social welfare entitlements and trainees receive free books and travel and meal allowances. The programme has been expanded with support from the European Social Fund from a pilot project for three groups in 1989 to a planned total of 78 groups by the end of 1992.</P>
    <P>The growth in the number of places provided under the vocational training opportunities scheme will be accompanied by a continuation of the scheme introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare whereby long term unemployed adults may avail of third level education while continuing their social welfare entitlements.  A similar scheme operates to facilitate re-entry to education/training at second level.  In order to ensure that there are no financial barrier to participation on these schemes, a special fund has been included for the first time in this year's Estimates to cover the cost of books, travel and meal allowances, registration fees etc. for long term unemployed trainees availing of education/training across a range of programmes outside the VTOS.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Estimates include £503,000 for the running costs of the National Council for Vocational Awards (NCVA).  The council was launched on <Col N="1653" /> an <i>ad hoc</i> basis on 29 October 1991 to initiate a comprehensive system of certification for students on vocational training programmes outside the third level sector.  The objectives are to ensure that: trainees receive certification which is performance based; certification issued will have a national status which will have credibility in the labour market; courses conform to objective and common standards within an overall framework which sets out clearly the relationships between the various levels of qualification; course provision is relevant to labour market needs in terms both of the content and of the numbers of trainees in the different disciplines.</P>
    <P>It is intended that all vocational training programmes will be developed and structured on a modular basis.  National arrangements are being planned which will enhance the opportunities for young people to develop their vocational skills in a coherent and effective way.  The Green Paper will contain proposals for future developments and initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the capital building programme in the 1992 Estimates is, as stated earlier, some £81 million, which represents an increase of nearly 19 per cent on the 1991 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>The national school capital allocation of £14 million will be used to fund a number of major school building projects and on school buildings, mainly in rural areas, which are in poor condition and in need of improvements, extensions or replacement.</P>
    <P>A capital allocation of £2.5 million is being provided in 1992 to allow for further development of special facilities for young offenders.  It includes £2.2 million towards the costs of a new development at Finglas.  The remaining £300,000 is required to meet the ongoing maintenance and development costs of the existing facilities for young offenders.</P>
    <P>The provision of £17.225 million for second level capital will be used to maintain the ongoing building programme, which has the following priority areas: areas where there is local agreement on rationalisation of existing resources and <Col N="1654" /> schools which are sole providers in their respective areas in need of accommodation.</P>
    <P>The provision for third level capital projects in 1992 is nearly £42 million, an increase of £18.7 million or 81 per cent on the 1991 outturn.  Some £33 million of this allocation will be provided to enhance the capability of the third level education sector to support industry in bridging the technological gap that exists between Ireland and the more advanced regions of the European Community. This expenditure will attract support from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education will continue in their implementation of a series of measures in key areas where serious deficiencies in equipment and accommodation have been identified in universities, regional technical colleges and colleges of technology.</P>
    <P>The 1992 allocation for the Higher Education Authority sector includes provision for major building projects at Dublin City University, University College, Galway, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and University College, Cork.  It also includes £3 million for the creation of an additional 3,600 places in the universities in line with a Government undertaking to provide £15 million over a five-year period from 1990 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In the vocational education committee sector the 1992 allocation includes provision for the completion of phase 1 of Tallaght RTC which will assist in making third level education more accessible in an area noted for its low participation. Provision is also being made for phase 1 of a new college at Bishop Street, a major extension to the College of Catering, Cathal Brugha Street and new facilities and upgrading of laboratories in a number of RTCs.</P>
    <P>In the third level education area there have been very significant developments in recent years.  Over the last decade enrolments in this sector have dramatically increased by over 66 per cent with a consequential substantially <Col N="1655" /> increased output of well qualified graduates. At present there are some 75,000 students enrolled in higher education programmes and this corresponds to a transfer rate of almost 40 per cent for the relevant age cohort.  This transfer rate is projected to increase still further as a result of the Government policy to encourage those who have the aptitudes and talents to pursue third level education programmes.  Indeed total enrolment is projected to increase to 100,000 students approximately by the end of the nineties.  Recent initiatives have also resulted in a greater degree of harmonisation and co-ordination in the entry procedures to third level colleges generally through the joint CAO/CAS system.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the education system makes an important contribution to economic, social and cultural development. This is particularly so as regards the higher education sector.  The achievement of economic and social advancement is dependent to a high degree on the availability of a pool of highly qualified personnel who possess the requisite technical and managerial knowledge, skills and competencies.</P>
    <P>Of course the availability of suitable, skilled personnel is in itself totally dependent on the efficiency and effectiveness of the education and training system.  The Government are committed to expanding the third level sector to meet increasing demand for places and to increase the competitive advantage which this country has by virtue of having a highly skilled, intelligent and flexible workforce.</P>
    <P>The gross third level non-capital allocation in the 1992 Estimates is £309 million which corresponds to an increase of over 7 per cent on the 1991 provisional outturn of £288 million.</P>
    <P>It is firmly intended to follow through on the Government's commitment to provide about 9,000 third level places over the next few years.  In fact, considerable progress has been made already towards meeting this target.  The arrangements initiated by the Government with the universities under the 1990 budget, <Col N="1656" /> whereby the universities will provide no fewer than an extra 3,600 undergraduate places over a three to four year period, is currently running above the annual target of 1,200 additional places.</P>
    <P>As a result of the transfer of students to Carysfort College the UCD authorities have been able to make available an additional 1,200 undergraduate places at the Belfield campus.  Carysfort itself will have a capacity of 1,500 places when fully operational.</P>
    <P>A programme for the utilisation of spare capacity in the colleges of education is well under way.  The amalgamation of Thomond College with the University of Limerick will provide an extra 600 places and the agreed institutional linkages between that University and Mary Immaculate College will provide a futher 600 undergraduate places. This agreement with Mary Immaculate College will result in the sharing of staff and resources between the two institutions. All programmes will be accredited and all awards will be made by the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>In this context too discussions are ongoing between the authorities of Dublin City University and St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, regarding similar institutional linkages between their two institutions and I look forward to a fruitful outcome.</P>
    <P>The provision of the new RTC in Tallaght will provide 1,200 places and a new building to be provided at the University of Limerick with private sector financial participation will provide a further 1,000 places.  Additional places, with the total numbers not yet fully determined, will also arise under the overall programme supported by EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The 1992 provision for higher education grants is over £32 million, an increase of 8 per cent, to provide for the increase in student numbers eligible for grant aid arising from the increased provision of third level places.</P>
    <P>A range of major improvements in the higher education grants and related student support schemes will take effect in the autumn.  The principal improvements <Col N="1657" /> being introduced for new entrants to third level this year are: (a) The income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education; (b) Income eligibility will be assessed on current income rather than as heretofore, on the income in the year in which the student sat the leaving certificate; (c) Mature students who secure a place in a third level institution will automatically be considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant; (d) Mature students may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes (and, if married, their spouses' incomes) rather than on their parents' income which has been the case up to now; (e) Lone parent's welfare payments under the lone parent's allowance scheme will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility; and (f) Income limits and maintenance grants will be index-linked in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education also has initiated a full review of all aspects of third-level student support schemes with the overall aim of ensuring equity within and between the different schemes.  The review includes examining the income eligibility limits generally and the income assessment criteria and procedures with a view to: removing any outstanding barriers which may militate against students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and addressing, to the extent that it is practicable and affordable, the particular financial pressures on students from the lower to middle-income families.  The review is now well advanced and the Minister expects to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly with a view to introducing major changes in student support schemes.</P>
    <P>The 1992 provision for educational services is a clear indication of the importance that this Government place on the role of the education sector in our society.  I commend these Estimates to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few weeks I repeatedly asked the office of the Government Chief Whip for a copy of <Col N="1658" /> the Estimate for Education but we were not apprised of the amount involved until the Minister for Finance read out the figure.  This is not good enough; it is part of a constantly recurring practice.  Last Wednesday, as we were about to enter the House to debate Committee Stage of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, we were presented with 40 Government amendments which butchered vocational education committees, virtually banished them from the RTCs and materially changed the Bill.  The Department of Education should get their act together in this regard.</P>
      <P>The recent cuts in education run counter to what should be a new, forward phase in education as we embark into post-Maastricht Europe.  Instead of constructing and entering a new development stage the Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, has implemented a series of very damaging and illogical selective cuts.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the fact that the Government programme over three to four years envisaged 3,600 additional places in higher education and outlined the targets to be reached for successive years.  How can he square that with the decision announced three weeks ago to reduce to 500 the number of people entering the five education departments in the various universities? I am totally opposed to this proposal which from next September will affect students who wish to pursue the higher diploma in education, which is an essential qualification for a secondary teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we accept there is an oversupply of teachers at present at second level I contend that if somebody does a B.A., B.Comm, B.Sc or B.Ag.Sc. and wishes to pursue a teaching career, irrespective of the job opportunities available, that person has a right to receive a year's training and obtain the higher diploma in order to qualify them.  They should be trained and allowed ply their wares either in the United Kingdom where it is recognised, in another European Community country where; by and large, it has received recognition, or, indeed, in the United States where, <Col N="1659" /> again, it is looked upon as a recognised teaching qualification.  We should at least qualify these people as teachers and give them the opportunity and the necessary academic passport to seek employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Instead of using a Bachelor of Arts degree as a launching pad to some other career or some other course of study the Minister has to accept that essentially it is a teaching qualification.  Teachers of English, Irish, French, German, Spanish, Mathematics, History, Geography &mdash; the range of general subjects &mdash; must have a B.A. degree.  It is most unfair, unreasonable and discriminatory, without any warning, to cut the option for hundreds of people who are now sitting their final degree examinations of entering the five educational Departments next year to pursue the higher diploma.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the decision is based on economic considerations and has not been thought through.  I ask the Minister to tell us how the select 500 are to be chosen or called.  Will they, for example, be called on the basis of the merits of their degree?  Will a person with a first class honours degree take precedence over somebody with a second class honours degree or will a person with an honours degree take precedence over somebody with a general or pass degree? Will interviews be held to determine and decide who has an aptitude for teaching? Will there be a certain ratio for each faculty with a certain percentage of places being held for persons with Arts degrees, Commerce degrees, Science and Agricultural Science degrees?  This is impractical, unfair and unworkable and the Minister should reverse the throttle immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that he is providing a substantial amount of money for higher education grants but it was announced recently that university fees are going to be increased by between 9 per cent and 15 per cent. Again, this is a step in the wrong direction because what we should be talking about is providing greater access to education and encouraging more people to follow <Col N="1660" /> through from second level to third level and trying to reduce the burden on the hard pressed middle income PAYE family who cannot support a son or daughter in college because of the cost involved.  Each year that passes third level education is going further and further beyond the reach and range of the average family.  Alternatively, if a middle income family decide to make the supreme sacrifice and borrow heavily to send a son or daughter, or indeed a few simultaneously, to third level education they will have to put their entire life on hold and make major sacrifices not alone during the period the son or daughter is in college but for many years afterwards when they have to repay the mortgage or loan.</P>
    <P>When one takes this fee increase in conjunction with the Minister's persistence, in that he is going ahead to means test European Social Fund grants from September, it would seem there is a definite anti-PAYE bias in the approach of the Minister for Education.  I would go so far as to say that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, seems to have little or no feel for this portfolio.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday week I attended a meeting at a venue less than 300 yards from here convened by the National Parents Council and attended by representatives of SIPTU, IMPACT, the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICA, the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland.  We had the collective voice of people representing middle income families and education all speaking in concert about the extremely serious consequences for middle income families if European Social Fund grants are means tested, as envisaged, from next September.</P>
    <P>The position is that European Social Fund grants are enjoyed by 27,000 students in the nine regional technical colleges and the six Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.  They represent the only hope the vast majority of middle income families have of gaining access to third level education.  Since they were introduced in the early eighties by the former Minister for Education, Gemma <Col N="1661" /> Hussey, they have brought about a huge influx of top quality students into these colleges.  They have energised the colleges and the regions in which they are located.  The children of many middle income PAYE families who were debarred from qualifying for university grants because of the ridiculously restrictive higher education grants scheme operated by the local authorities were able to pursue certificate, diploma and degree courses in these colleges.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now proposing to introduce the same inequitable higher education grants scheme code and regulations to the European Social Fund grants scheme.  In other words, he is introducing all the warts, flaws, and anti-middle income features of the higher education grants scheme into the European Social Fund grants scheme.  He is not, as he protests, levelling the playing field; he is making it more uneven and unplayable for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand, given that 90 per cent of the funds for this grants scheme come from Europe, why the Minister should go down this road.  I also fail to understand, given that there will be a new tranche of Structural Funds in one year's time and that the Minister claims to be optimistic that there will be a substantial increase, why he should persist in means-testing these grants from next September, a mere 12 months before the additional funds are due to come on-stream. In the context of the recognition that the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges are the catalysts for growth within the various regions why does the Minister willingly and knowingly pursue a deliberate policy of damaging the colleges because that is exactly what will happen?</P>
    <P>If we remove the main funding element, European Social Fund grants, from the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges they will inevitably suffer, as we will be removing one of their cornerstones. Based on projections and surveys carried out by expert bodies and the colleges, 70 per cent of the 27,000 students attending these colleges will lose their grant or <Col N="1662" /> some part thereof.  When one considers that it has been estimated that a regional technical college in a region is worth approximately £7 million per annum to the local economy one can appreciate the devastation that will be caused if one cuts across the existing funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, promised a review by an interdepartmental body consisting of officials from the Departments of Education, Finance, Health, and Social Welfare. The Minister of State alluded to it in his address to the House today but we have not heard the results to date. When I tabled a motion in the House on 18 and 19 February I received an assurance from the present Minister that a review would be carried out and that we would be given the results within a short time.  However, we have still not been appraised of the results of that review.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental review is not required in this case.  The Culliton report clearly said that vocational and technological education must get special emphasis while it is recommended in the Maastricht Treaty that vocational and technical education should form a key element in the economic resurgence of a united Europe and from the point of view of eliminating regional disparities.</P>
    <P>We must discriminate positively in favour of technological education. Therefore, what is needed is an expert, objective, independent, comprehensive analysis of the entire area of higher education, a thorough, comprehensive appraisal of the existing higher education grants scheme operated by local authorities and a similar analysis, on a one-to-one basis, of the merits of the European Social Fund grants.  I contend that only an agency outside Government Departments is in a position to properly assess the pros and cons of the different schemes, to examine the entire higher education grants scene, its funding arrangements in their totality, and prepare the type of definitive documents and recommendations required.  I suggest therefore that the entire matter be referred to the National Economic and <Col N="1663" /> Social Council or to the ESRI.  In the meantime, in view of the fact that the matter is being objectively analysed, I suggest that the meanstesting of the ESF grants be put on hold.</P>
    <P>Education and training represent the greatest single instrument for social cohesion and economic development in post-Maastricht Europe.  I was disappointed that the Minister in his introductory remarks did not sketch out an educational vision of the challenges and opportunities as we face, hopefully, into post-Maastricht Europe.  Education is not only the social cement to keep the developed European mosaic together but is the greatest single energiser of a thriving European Community, a Community proud of its corporate European identity.  Maastricht is about people and the creation of a people's Europe.  Just as we accept that education is the key to unlocking an individual's potential and personality, likewise on the national and international scene within Europe education is the greatest single instrument for developing our greatest resource, human capital, so essential to the development of Community policies.</P>
    <P>Education, therefore in all its facets, is elementary and vital to the future of Europe, and should have a distinctive European brand mark.  That is the reason it is vital that, apart from normal educational systems, strategies and qualifications, there should be an extra European dimension and input at every level.  Above all, education is vital in assisting us, subconsciously or unconsciously, to think European.  I and my party believe that in order for the Community to grow in strength and confidence, with its unity and identity enhanced, we must be prepared to invest more in education since that is the most cost-effective and efficient way of solving collective Community problems by unleashing the Community's vast resources.</P>
    <P>While the single, consolidated European market opens up great opportunities for the Community, in particular for Ireland, in terms of access to a huge <Col N="1664" /> market, on the other hand it offers considerable challenges, in particular to education. For example, the modern European workforce will have to learn and relearn continuously.  Over 50 per cent of the population will change occupation during their lifetimes.  A large majority will have to pursue multiple careers.  Qualifications will become obsolete under pressure from new, rapidly-changing technology and new communication and information techniques. There will be no such thing as any one course or apprenticeship equipping somebody for a lifetime single career. Training and retraining at intervals of ten years will become the norm, which is a good thing.  There will be little place in the new Europe for the unqualified or underqualified person.  Special emphasis must be placed on eliminating the under-representation of certain social class in the workforce and on the elimination of discrimination in employment and, indeed, in education.  It is very important that we perceive the poverty trap on a national and international basis, as being a &ldquo;skilled trap&rdquo; rather than a poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party welcome the sections in the Treaty on European Union dealing with education, training and culture.  Indeed, we would commend the Government on having insisted on those insertions.  While it is fine to have aspirations, definitive programmes of action must be introduced.  That is why I would envisage that any future Government &mdash; and certainly Fine Gael in Government &mdash; must ensure that we introduce a European language in all primary schools without exception.  Second, we must ensure that all post primary schools offer at least two Community languages, that we move away from the rigid adherence to French only.  Third, we must assist foreign language teachers to spend a significant part of their teacher training period in the country of origin of the language they propose teaching. Fourth, we must make the necessary resources available for the most modern, effective methodology in language teaching, including audio-visual, audio-lingual <Col N="1665" /> equipment and language laboratories. We deserve and demand the best.  We must also render it possible for serving teachers to undertake regular refresher courses in the country whose language they currently teach.  That does not happen at present except in very rare instances.  In addition, we must place special emphasis on classroom technique and on examinations in language as a vehicle of oral communication, the spoken before the written.  Here, the example of what we have done in regard to the Irish language speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael see student mobility as a major element in combating the Irish psychology of insularity and in neutralising our peripherality.  My party want to promote student mobility by means of the following: (1) endeavouring to ensure that all students, without exception, during the period of their compulsory education, should have the benefit of at least one visit to another member state; (2) promoting school twinning schemes from the point of view of human and cultural links.  Such exchanges which have taken place in the past, when towns have been interlinked, particularly on an inter-family basis, have had a tremendous influence from the point of view of having been culturally valuable and cost-effective; (3) the establishment of a special unit within the Department of Education to advise, promote and monitor such exchange programmes.</P>
    <P>If one recognises that education is the greatest single treatment for dismantling barriers, particularly those to understanding, then one must organise youth and promote student and youth mobility. I contend that voluntary work camps involving young people from within and without the Community should be actively encouraged and promoted.  I am very committed to projects involving young people, particularly those which involve them in community or social affairs, in the preservation or restoration of our heritage and or of buildings and artefacts of cultural interest.  Again, from the point of view of promoting youth leadership within Europe, such work camps offer an excellent opportunity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> I contend that higher education will be a growing requirement within the developing Europe.  I believe also that technical, vocational and higher education and training are priorities which have not been allocated the finance they deserve.  A good example of that has been the cutbacks effected in the ESF grants for higher education.  It is vital that an increasing percentage of young people participate in courses with strong technological orientation.  It is also vital that we recognise that research has shown conclusively that there is a strong correlation between vocational training at all levels of the education system and productivity, innovativeness and entrepreneurial vitality.  Our economy never needed those qualities more than at present.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the provision for education as sufficient.  Neither do I regard the Minister of State, acting in lieu of the Minister himself, as sufficient or appropriate in sketching out the vision required in Ireland's role in education within the new Europe.  I do not think that the recent moves in education have done anything other than irreparable damage to what has been a reasonably successful educational code to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a week within which there has been much debate on education in this House.  Indeed, it appears we will have the same level of debate on the subject next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I should like to refer to something that is of particular relevance to the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991, discussed at length this week, the Committee Stage of which will be concluded on Wednesday next.  It has been clearly established now &mdash; not through the Regional Technical Colleges Bill but rather by means of a letter recently circulated by the Department of Education &mdash; that the prospect of regional technical colleges developing into regional universities is being removed.  I perceive that as a very serious matter.  The whole question of inequality of access to education, based on socio-economic or geographical factors, must be readdressed urgently in <Col N="1667" /> another way since it is quite clear that the Department of Education are not alone determined to limit the degree provision in the case of regional technical colleges but are equally determined to divert students from the RTC sector in the direction of the universities.</P>
    <P>The completely indefensible decision to means test ESF maintenance grants in line with higher education grants is the vehicle for redirecting those marginal students who would opt for a place at a regional technical college if they were to receive ESF maintenance funding but who in the absence of that will opt more and more to go to university.  This trend will substantially augment the very large drain of resources from the regions to the university cities.  This is at total variance with the policy of subsidiarily which is such an important element of the Maastricht Treaty.  In general terms we have fought our case at Community level along the lines that we are a developing peripheral nation and therefore entitled to favourable consideration when Structural and Cohesion Funds are being dispensed. We have a valid and just case, but the principle of subsidiarity and discrimination in favour of less advantaged regions does not stop there.  The Government may make the case in Europe for the principal of subsidiarity but that principle must be applied throughout the whole country and, in the context of this debate it is particularly important in the education field.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that the provision of the full range of educational services within a region is of great benefit to industrial and commercial development.  The interface of third level institutions with industry across the wide area of research, development and consultancy is an essential dynamic for economic and educational development.  Under the terms of the new Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991, the scope for regional technical colleges to become involved in this work has been widened but the centralisation of authority in the Minister will ensure that the vast bulk of the best research and developmental projects and consultancy <Col N="1668" /> work will rest with the universities, which are located in Galway, Limerick, Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a fundamental and vital point.  Four of the five county boroughs in the country have a university. Waterford city, which I represent, is the fifth and we do not have a university.  We had a teacher training college up to 1938 and now have a regional technical college but this does not meet the educational requirements of the region. Galway is comparable in size and population with Waterford and we see the great impact the university has had on the development of Galway over the years. This reinforces the point I wish to make here.  We need to do something very serious to address this problem of the region.  I therfore make the point that urgent steps must be taken to establish a university in Waterford, the regional capital, to service the needs of the southeast region.  I ask the Minister if funds are available under either the Structural funds or the Cohesion Fund to further develop this project and if not what immediate steps the Department propose to take to see that such provision is made. I will return to this point when we have the opportunity to put questions to the Minister before his concluding speech.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a Green Paper on Education was to be published in September last.  Indeed if it had been published on time, I am sure that we would be almost at the White Paper stage now and a great deal closer to an education Act.  The Minister has provided us with a document <i>Introduction to the Green Paper</i>.  In essence it is aspirational, vague and does not go to the core of the issues that we are all very concerned about.  In particular I note that there is very little in this document on the Irish language and I hope this is not indicative of the place of Irish in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>We invest a great deal of our resources in the Irish language.  I am committed to the Irish language and believe the language should be reviewed and be used more widely.  Even though we put <Col N="1669" /> a great deal of our educational resources into the language and students reach a good standard at school, the environment outside the school is not conducive to the development or use of the Irish language. Our language has a very important role to play in our participation in European union.  Our language embodies our philosophical development, heritage and culture. In modern times we find ourselves identifying more and more with an Anglo-American culture instead of developing our own image as a separate, unique and special nation.</P>
    <P>I believe the Green Paper would promote a national debate on our language, and it is vital that we do so.  We must, first, ask ourselves whether we should revive the Irish language and continue to put our resources into it and, second, if so, why?  If this debate is conducted openly and honestly and not dominated by the various vested interests, people will come to appreciate the value of the language not alone for its role in our culture but as an element of our heritage and national self-image which will be reflected in our personal self-image. Many people have a knee-jerk reaction when questioned on the Irish language. They say we should revive the language but their commitment to the language does not go beyond that simple statement. Unless the people at large are committed in a real sense to the revival of the Irish language I believe the deteriorating position of Irish will continue.  Time is running out for us.  When we reach our conclusions we must implement a policy to achieve them.  I believe if the debate is carried out openly and honestly, people will see the value of our language and will be a lot more enthusiastic about it.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to means-test the maintenance portion of the ESF grant from September next is an extremely retrograde step.  If the means test were equitable and applied fairly, that would be one thing but what is happening is that our grossly inequitable system of means testing which applies to higher education grants will be applied now to ESF grants.  People other than those who are in the PAYE tax category <Col N="1670" /> do very well under the present means testing system.  I believe the time has long since passed for the Department to carry out a full and thorough review of all those parents whose children are eligible for higher education grants.  There should be a sectoral breakdown of the categories of parents whose children benefit from third level grants.  Too many self-employed families benefit from this grant scheme as against families in the PAYE sector.  I put it very strongly to the Minister that the Government have time to pull back from this ruinous and inequitable decision which will have a detrimental effect on the intake of students to regional colleges and which will prevent many students who otherwise could have availed of third-level education from doing so.  Many people will have to pay for this mistake.  The Government have time to reverse this decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an area of educational disadvantage, that is, children who enter the educational system not fully prepared for it due to environmental factors totally beyond their control. Some children who have not sufficiently developed in their homes are not ready to enter the formal education system.  It is absolutely essential, urgent and vital that the State provides a properly structured pre-school educational system with fully trained teachers in disadvantaged areas.  Some children who enter the formal education system do not have fully developed verbal and social skills.  I wish to make a very important point in relation to verbal skills.  Psychology has shown that the development of language skills is in decline from the age of five years onwards.  If the vital years before children enter the formal education system at the age of four years onwards are wasted or not fully utilised in terms of development, children will have to pay a very big price for the rest of their lives; the productive time lost will never be made up afterwards.  Resources released as a result of demographic trends over a period should be diverted towards the establishment of a proper pre-school system in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> I wish to refer to the broader agenda in the area of educational disadvantage. It is long past the time when at least one school welfare officer was appointed in each vocational education area.  These officers should have the task of identifying at an early stage children who are failing under the present educational system.  This can manifest itself in a number of ways, for example, difficult disciplinary problems which have a major effect on the efficiency and output of schools on the one hand and which contribute in a major way to stress and burn out in teachers on the other.</P>
    <P>The sooner educational problems are diagnosed in children the sooner something can be done about them.  The problems which give rise to educational disadvantage and unsocial conduct by children in our schools cannot be rectified by the schools on their own.  Some problems may be caused by parents who are not in control of their own lives.  Families in disadvantaged areas have to deal with many problems, for example, legal and illegal moneylenders, the payment of rents to local authorities, ESB bills and so on.  Parents who cannot cope and are under stess cannot make the necessary input into their children's development.</P>
    <P>School welfare officers would be able to co-ordinate the various statutory agencies in an area, for example, the health board, the Department of Social Welfare, the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, and liaise with the local voluntary agencies.  At present these agencies are working independently and their services are not properly co-ordinated.  As a result they are not achieving full value from the resources available.  Resources have to be targeted towards certain families and parents have to be guided on how to gain control of their lives and budget properly.  For example, they have to be taught the best joints of meat to buy and where they can get the best value for money.  This would ensure that proper food and nutrition is provided for children.  Some voluntary agencies provide marriage counselling services.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society <Col N="1672" /> try to help people not by throwing money at them but by trying to get them back on the track so that they can gain control of their lives.  If parents are in control of their lives they will have a bigger input into the development of their children.</P>
    <P>I raised the concept of the introduction of a European language in national schools with the Minister and the previous Minister on a number of occasions. A child's ability to absorb a new language is in decline from the age of five years onwards.  The European experience would seem to suggest that a language other than the mother tongue should be taught to children of ten years when the thought process has been set up in the native tongue and the new language can be absorbed without confusion.  This new language provision would not be of benefit only to students who go on to third-level education.  It would also be of benefit to many young people who take up manual jobs in, for example, Spain. Unfortunately, people are beginning to move further afield in order to get work. That is fine for people who want to travel and gain experience.  In order that all our citizens can avail of the opportunities which will exist in Europe the sooner a European language is introduced in national schools the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>My brief contribution to this debate will focus primarily on the link between education and employment and unemployment.  One could hardly overstate the crucial bearing which the educational system of a country has on its economic development and, consequently, on its ability to provide worthwhile employment for its citizens. Therefore, I welcome the real consensus which now exists throughout Irish society that neither education nor our unemployment problem can in future be discussed in isolation from each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to clarify how I see that interrelationship.  Tackling unemployment will involve a mixture of strategies, some of which will be long term. Parallel with these it will be necessary to identify ways in which there will be an immediate reduction of the numbers on <Col N="1673" /> the live register.  All of us here have first hand knowledge from contact with our constituents of how demoralising unemployment can be.  We realise it is not good enough to say to people that there will be a job some years from now.  That is why the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment, which I chair, are fully committed to seeing what more can be done to create a sense of real hope and, much more importantly, that real jobs for those who are unemployed or those seeking a job for the first time will be provided.</P>
    <P>The strategies for reducing unemployment will, of necessity, involve some relation to the education system.  If a person is to succeed in getting a job he or she must first be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to perform that job.  That is perhaps stating the obvious, but the right education and training systems are central to tackling unemployment and to job creation.  The education system must, therefore, equip our young people for their search for employment, knowing that their combination of knowledge and skills are usable and marketable in Ireland, Europe or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This emphasis on usable skills is a matter of debate and contention and, indeed, was highlighted in the Culliton report.  This is not an either/or situation. I do not see education as solely for the marketplace or solely for the pursuit of academic subjects.  Education should be concerned with both work and life.  The best form of education, especially at second level, is a flexible, integrated education where young people continue to aquire a good general education which is our essential preparation for life.  In addition, there should be a sharper focus on the provision of technical and vocational subjects and greater incentives to pursue them.</P>
    <P>A general education has merit in itself, but surveys of employers show that communications skills are a top criterion in selecting people for jobs.  That underlines the value of a general education, even in the job context alone.  It is important also, through the education system, <Col N="1674" /> to bring all students into contact with the world of work, through establishing relationships at local level between schools and firms.  This approach does not imply a narrow, rigid focus on technical and vocational skills but recognises the need for giving our young people a real understanding of the world of work and equipping them to participate confidently in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the expansion of third level places, the importance of industry links with third level and the importance of managerial skills.  For many years in UCD &mdash; I have first-hand knowledge of this because I have taught in their courses &mdash; the curricula for engineers and scientists, for example, have long since been broadened to include a wide range of business or management subjects &mdash; personnel, finance, marketing and so on &mdash; the idea being to better equip students for the posts they take on graduation.  That practice needs to be extended, particularly in our third level institutions.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the key importance of linking universities and regional technical colleges to industry.  Progress has also been made in this area.  The development of this partnership between third level institutions and industry is all the more urgent to better equip the graduates of our educational system who, by international standards, have reached a very high standard indeed.  In our case the knowledge and skills that students will get in a broader curriculum, together with industrial links, will better equip them to exploit our economic potential and to enhance our competitiveness, which is so important in a small, open economy like ours.</P>
    <P>I would turn again to second level education. If we are to refocus the objectives of second level education it must go hand in hand with a shift in the perception of different kinds of education in Irish society.  We must learn to have real respect and esteem, as have the Germans and Swiss, for technical and vocational skills, which are incorporated into their school curricula.  We must engender in those possessing these skills a sense of <Col N="1675" /> real pride in their abilities.  The changes in the education curricula I am talking about here would obviously take some time to produce tangible results, but they would make a valuable contribution to wealth and job creation, as is the case in Germany and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, our education and training system will need, as a matter or urgency, to provide meaningful and relevant courses for the unemployed, particularly for the long term unemployed. In this context the vocational teaching opportunities scheme, the VTOS, is very much a step in the right direction.  This scheme caters for adults of 21 years and older and provides second chance education for those who have been unemployed for at least a year.  In the present year 1,000 trainees are participating in this scheme.  The European Social Fund provides two-thirds of the cost of the training which covers topics such as enterprise training, which is so important at all levels in Ireland, general studies and new vocational and technological skills.  A training allowance takes the place of social welfare entitlements under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Recent official statistics show that 50 per cent of males on the live register have a primary level of education only.  I am glad to say that the position in respect of females is somewhat better.  The vocational teaching opportunities scheme, providing relevant second chance education and training, may well prove an important vehicle for improving the chances of the long term unemployed to enter or re-enter the workforce.  The expansion of that scheme needs careful attention.</P>
    <P>I have just mentioned the valuable support from the Social Fund for the VTOS, and this brings to mind the huge contribution to training made over many years by the EC through the Social Fund. In addition, the Social Fund supports several educational schemes, including diploma and degree courses at regional technical colleges and, latterly, at universities. Education and training, unlike the position 20 years ago when we joined <Col N="1676" /> the EC, are not firmly on the EC agenda. This country has greatly benefited from huge funds in the training area under the Social Fund.  In the context of the Treaty on European Union, which is on our minds at present, it is worthy of note that education is now firmly on the EC agenda.  In the Maastricht Treaty a whole section is devoted to education.  Since we are part of the European labour market it is interesting that the National Economic and Social Council have suggested that education generally should be grant-aided from Brussels.  This opens up a possibility that will require careful attention in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>In the course of this short contribution I have underlined the link between education and employment and unemployment. Given the scale of our unemployment problem, we have to be realistic in terms of what can be done. No quick fix will solve the problem; it will not be solved overnight, but by no means should we remain in a state of frozen inactivity, regarding the unemployment problem as insoluble.  Education and training make a valuable contribution to job creation.  Our task is to see what further contribution education and training can make towards alleviating the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the country is in a healthy financial position, with low inflation and expanding exports.  When there is a pick-up in the international economy, especially in the economies of the UK and the US, we will be very well placed to avail of tha economic recovery. There is evidence already that we are moving in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many positive aspects of our education system &mdash; good standards, and relatively high participation rates to end of post-primary. But these are achieved despite gross neglect and under-funding and there are many casualties of the system.  Our class sizes, the biggest in the EC mean that individual children's needs are not adequately met, the lack of funding forces parents into paying an education <Col N="1677" /> tax through cake sales, school walks and raffles, and there are clear class inequalities in the system.</P>
      <P>These Estimates are not good enough. Where is the extra capitation funding? Where is the plan to develop the education system?  Why is it that the great number of children in national schools have less than one-third of the <i>per capita</i> funding of those at third level where the level and structure of funding itself ensures that higher education is out of reach for many students of PAYE and unemployed parents?</P>
      <P>My constituency Dublin South-West, illustrates many of the urgent needs in education.  Dublin South-West is probably the youngest region, in terms of age profile, in the State.  Education is a central issue for parents and students in the area.  Education in Dublin South-West highlights especially the lack of planning in the Department of Education.  In Tallaght we will have a regional technical college which is clearly needed, and was built after a concerted local campaign.  It is essential that this be a truly regional college, that the local transfer rate to third level be raised, that degree status for the RTC be confirmed and phase two be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these matters has been addressed by the Minister despite questions from me in the House.  This issue of the college being a truly regional one is very important and I would like to hear the Minister address it.  Those of us who recall the early days of the regional colleges in Letterkenny, Sligo, Carlow and Waterford know that they were indeed truly regional colleges and made a significant contribution in their immediate catchment areas not only as regards investment in education but as regards the development of skills that are important for economic development.  How does that regional content apply in the case of Tallaght?  Many parents in Tallaght are concerned that under the existing clearing house system the regional technical college in Tallaght will become a college for students from the rest of the country or at least from the greater Dublin area and that participation <Col N="1678" /> levels from students within the Tallaght area embracing Tallaght, Clondalkin, Walkinstown and the Rathcoole region will not be significantly enhanced.  We are finding it very difficult to get any reply from the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>Hand-in-glove with the regional technical colleges opening this coming September, the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Coalition have means-tested the European Social Fund grants.  This will exclude from the regional technical colleges many students from PAYE families. The whole anti-PAYE bias is a blot on the grants system.</P>
    <P>Our primary schools in Dublin South-West are filled with talented young people, but the physical state of large schools without caretakers will soon deteriorate.  What a false economy, to deny caretakers to large schools like St. Thomas's Senior School in Jobstown and Social Maelruain Junior School in Old Bawn?  At second level, we have had a disgraceful breaking of promises to provide a local school for Kilnamanagh/ Kingswood.  The need for this school will not go away, and I ask the Minister to give a clear commitment on this and on phase two of Jobstown Community College.  There is also an urgent need for a post-primary all-Irish school in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister to the success of the Scoil lán-Ghaeilge in Clondalkin and Rathcoole.</P>
    <P>Tá níos mó ná seacht gcéad daltaí ag freastal ar bhun-scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge i dTamhlacht faoi láthair.  Mar is eol don Aire tá na tuismuitheoirí agus Coiste Gairmoideachais ar aon intinn faoin ghá atá ann iarbhunscoil lán-Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil.  Is fada anois atá an t-iarratas ón Choiste Gairmoideachais ag an Aire.</P>
    <P>Anois tá cáipéis shuntasach aige freisin ó Chumann Gaelach Thamhlachta.  Iarraim anois ar an Aire a chinntiú don Chumann Gaelach go gcuirfear iarbhunscoil ar fáil.</P>
    <P>One other gap between policy and practice needs to be highlighted.  In his Green Paper introduction, the Minister stressed the role of physical education in the &ldquo;health-promoting school&rdquo;.  Fine <Col N="1679" /> words, but there is a Community College &mdash; St. Mac Dara's in Willington &mdash; with 900 local students, where the Minister has refused to provide even a physical education hall.  I have raised this, and the lack of general purpose rooms in many primary schools, previously, and I promise the Minister I will return to it again and again.</P>
    <P>The issues I have raised here are very basic ones &mdash; second level places, a fair grants system, PE facilities, the maintenance of buildings.  They must be addressed.  A national education debate will be sterile unless these basic resource questions are dealt with in Dublin South-West and nationally in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would refer now to the new scheme to grant-aid mature students in third level education.  I welcome this initiative by the Department.  I regret that so far the Department have not been able to clarify whether this will apply to existing mature students.  A small number of mature students, mainly women in Maynooth College who attend my advice centres, have been campaigning for this facility for some time.  It is the opportunity of a lifetime for people to get a second chance to enjoy third level education.  Now that the Minister has decided to introduce this grants scheme it would be a small step to provide for those people who are struggling to attend third level education as mature students.  Will the Minister look again at whether or not provision could be made for them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I raise again this question of the decision to means test ESF grants.  This means-testing of grants for those attending universities has resulted in a disproportionately high number of students from farming, professional and self-employed backgrounds and a lower number of students from PAYE families. This as borne out in the Clancy report. The self-employed, farming and professional sectors can artificially deflate their incomes in a manner that is not open to those on PAYE tax.  The vocational sector has been an important source of third level places for those on middle to lower incomes.  If this means test is <Col N="1680" /> introduced it will mean a reduction in student numbers from the PAYE sector. The income thresholds for university grants, for example, have been disgracefully low.  A family of four on the average industrial wage, £13,500 per annum, does not qualify for a university grant.  If the same income limits are applied to the vocational sector the consequences will be very serious indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to congratulate the newly-appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, and wish him well. Though he is still a very young man, he has spent many years in this House and brings to his new portfolio a vast amount of experience as a parliamentarian and public representative.  I have no doubt that he will make his mark in the fields of education, youth and sport.  On a personal note I thank him for his already proven co-operation.  He has visited my constituency to walk the land and consider what progress can be made in specific areas of education and with regard to facilities for youth and sport. I look forward to working with him in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are continuing to demonstrate their total commitment to the improvement of education.  Major progress has been made since 1987.  The interests of the disadvantaged and less well off have been paramount and Government policy has reflected this. Total commitment to uplifting those who have been and are economically deprived is the policy.  The aspiration is to continue to offer equal opportunity to all so that their potential can be allowed to develop. The education system, in order to achieve this equality, must improve the lot of the disadvantaged rather than give additional advantage to those who are already privileged. Facile access to education is most important and in this regard there has been a substantial improvement.  The level of growth in numbers of pupils attending schools has been huge.  It is particularly gratifying to note the growth in numbers of pupils from the less well <Col N="1681" /> off socio-economic group who are involved in post-primary education.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy over the years has been geared to the ongoing improvement of the education system.  I compliment the present incumbent in the Department on his determination to contribute hugely to this progressive thrust.  I owe Deputy Davern a great deal of gratitude because in February last he provided the funding for a badly-needed second level school in Wicklow.  After years of dithering, refusals, reversals and mind changing, Deputy Davern recognised the outdated and unacceptable conditions which the children and teachers of Blessington were putting up with.  He reacted positively and approved the building of a new vocational school for that generally deprived west Wicklow area.  I am most grateful for that.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on school transport. Generally speaking, this is an excellent service but has its drawbacks.  There are inflexibilities which are often difficult to cope with.  Cases of genuine hardship are brought by public representatives to the Department but there is a great reluctance on the part of officialdom to depart from the established line.  There are instances of children arriving in towns and villages an hour or more before the school doors are opened.  This happens in winter when children have to wander unsupervised through the streets, often in cold and wet conditions, prior to the opening of the school.  This is not general but there are a number of cases which I have brought to the attention of officialdom. I ask for a review of the strict rules which apply.</P>
    <P>There should be greater flexibility when meritorious cases are brought by public representatives to the attention of the authorities, together with recommendations as to how these matters could be rectified without great cost.  Unfortunately it is impossible to get this message across.  Half empty school buses pass children walking on the roads in rural areas simply because those children live a few yards outside the stipulated distance from the school.  This makes no sense and there is no practicality in it.  I <Col N="1682" /> wish to draw the attention of the appropriate Department personnel to this nonsense and ask them to address it.  Action should be taken, particularly in instances of hardship.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased at the progress of the school building programme, particularly since 1987.  We have made great strides in my constituency and I am grateful to the Government and to successive Ministers for Education.  In Rathdrum we have an excellent new vocational education committee school which serves a wide hinterland.  As Deputy Hillery said, this will result in greater attendance from that rural area and improve the job creating prospects of those young people.  I mentioned the much-needed school in Blessington which has been approved. We are counting on the building contract being signed this month.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be pleased to hear that news since he has a soft spot for that area.  Today I travelled to Nuns Cross near Ashford in County Wicklow where a new Church of Ireland primary school will be officially blessed and opened by the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Donal Caird.  I look forward to being present on that occasion.  There are many positive aspects within our education system.</P>

It is a pity he is not present for this important debate.  Perhaps during his recuperation he will cross the t's and dot the i's of the long-awaited Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been dithering on the production of the Green Paper. Because of the frequent changes of Minister <Col N="1683" /> since autumn there are three green papers rather than one which we should be examining and discussing at this stage. That does not give a good impression of what is happening in Government circles. One would have expected some corporate thinking would be involved and that the Government would have their basic principles and philosophy worked out and that, regardless of what Minister was in charge, that would not change. Every time a Minister is appointed &mdash; this has happened three times &mdash; we should not have to go through the process of writing the paper again.  In effect that seems to be what has happened.  This leads one to ask whether there is any Government philosophy or whether individual Ministers have their own views about different things and make all the decisions about what goes into the Green Paper.  At present there are two in the bin and the final draft is awaited.  I hope when we do get it the Government will have established a strong sense of direction in education.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the decision to means-test ESF grants was taken in the first place.  My view is that it was thoughtless, that a new Minister for Education decided he wanted his name in lights and knew that such a decision would give rise to certain controversy, as it did. When he moved on, the decision remained.  Why were ESF grants introduced? My view is that they were introduced in order to get students to follow certain courses which were thought to be desirable for the economy and the nation as a whole.  It was recognised that Irish education was too academic.  The introduction of these grants was intended to move people in a more vocational direction. Practical training in science and technology was thought to be desirable. Is that need fulfilled today?  Having examined the Culliton report it is clear that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report clearly states that Irish education is still over-academic. Things have not changed in that respect. One would suspect that the Minister who made the decision in respect of ESF <Col N="1684" /> grants did not take that into account or was not aware of it.  Had he been aware of it he would not have interfered with the operation of those grants.  It is likely, because of the changes he has made, that some people will decide not to go to third level and that others will decide to go to university because the cost will be similar. Therefore, it is likely that the change in ESF grants will not be beneficial.  The objective for which they were set up initially still remains but it has been sidelined and we have to wait and see whether the Minister will change his mind before the next term commences.  Perhaps he will decide that the correct course of action is to revert to the old system and continue to offer an incentive to students to follow more vocational-oriented courses.</P>
    <P>The present educational system is broadly the same as it was 40 years ago. Next week students will sit the leaving certificate examination which is similar to what it was when the State was founded. There have been beneficial changes in the meantime but broadly speaking it is still the same.  One would have to question whether the present system is capable of offering the kind of response required to the needs of the nation today. The points system is still firmly embedded in every student's mind.  Those who will sit the leaving certificate examination next year have their minds transfixed on having as many points as possible.  Those of us who have experience of the education system would agree with that view. Because of the points system our education system is lopsided.  What has been provided to leaving certificate students in classrooms for the past 12 months could be vaguely described as education.</P>
    <P>All our resources are geared in the direction of the few students who need points.  Naturally weaker students who are not as highly motivated and whose direction is different are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  It is obvious that the system needs to be changed; the difficulty is that the Government have not decided how they wish to proceed.  We are still awaiting those changes.  The unions will take a particular view of whatever <Col N="1685" /> changes are proposed.  We have to face matters head on and ask whether the system whereby, after five years, the two and half hours to three hours examination which decides a student's future is adequate for today's world?  Does it allow a student develop in the way the modern world requires?  I believe it does not.  It is clear we need flexibile students nowadays, students who are capable of being innovative and of using their initiative. The days when one got a job which lasted for a lifetime are gone.  We need people who will be able to respond to what will happen to them when they go out into the world.  We certainly must break the old mould that we have built around ourselves since the State was founded.</P>
    <P>I suggest a system of continuous assessment with students working towards the leaving certificate from the first day they enter post primary school.  If we introduced that kind of system we would be doing ourselves and the nation a great service.  Those who have been involved in continous assessment at third level speak very favourably of it.  There is motivation from day one and students have to pay attention through the full term of their course because, as they go along, they can gather marks which will be taken into account at the end of the year.  Continuous assessment must form the heart of whatever education system we develop in the future.  We need students who are researchers, people who are able to gain knowledge and use it.  There is not so much need nowadays for students to memorise a great deal of information. Information is essentially stored.  Therefore, we need people who are able to find the information and use the knowledge they can gain from various sources.  It is a pity we did not have more time to discuss this but we will be able to do so and the basic aspects of education in the next month or so.  Hopefully we will have the Green Paper to guide us along that path.</P>

      <P>First, I welcome the Estimate.  Like the previous speaker, I wish the Minister a speedy recovery and <Col N="1686" /> commend his Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, on the excellent way he filled the position on the Committee Stage of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill yesterday.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing to hear the constant negative approach from Opposition Deputies.  No one mentioned that this year we will spend £1,600 million on education which represents 6.4 per cent of GNP and is one of the highest expenditures on education in the EC.  That represents 20 per cent of current Exchequer expenditure on supply services and underlines the commitment of the Government to education.  The Minister might consider sending a copy of this Estimate speech to the principals of every school and heads of all education authorities in Ireland.  It is important that they realise what is being done in education.</P>
      <P>My own criticism of the Green Paper is that there is no mention of music. Music is as important as any of the three Rs. Irish people are foremost in the world not just in rock music but in classical and Irish music.  I have yet to meet a person who does not like music but this was not mentioned in the Green Paper.  I hope when the White Paper is produced there will be some reference to music because it is very important.  We are the only country that does not have a conservatory of music and that is a tragedy.  I hope that when the White Paper is published all Deputies will support the introduction of music as a major subject in schools. Music is an industry and provides a living for many people as well as much pleasure.  That cannot be stressed too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the eligibility limits for ESF grants are too low.  I agree that £12,000 is too low; it is below the average industrial wage.  I understand that the Government are reviewing that and I hope that by the autumn, or sooner, the limit will be raised to a more realistic figure.  I know how hard the people of this country work to give their children an education and what they deprive themselves of.  I speak of the lower and middle income groups.  I am in favour <Col N="1687" /> of means-testing people of wealth.  For example, a very wealthy farmer with a considerable income does not need State aid or grants from the European Social Fund to send his children to university. He is able to stand on his own and should do so.  People in lower and middle income groups who pay for everything and get nothing free should be encouraged to send their children to third level education.</P>
    <P>We are not doing enough for the disadvantaged children in our society.  The Department of Education will say that schools in disadvantaged areas are getting an extra teacher or two.  However, there are certain areas which are even more disadvantaged than others.  In Basin Lane in my constituency the Sisters of Charity, who do a wonderful job running the schools, have been looking for an extra teacher from the Department of Education as they are now educating 15 travelling children from a site that was placed recently in that area.  I know the Department are sympathetic but these nuns should not be kept wondering what is going to happen.  The people of the area gladly welcomed these children into their midst and the Department of Education have a responsibility to provide the extra teachers.  No Member would disagree with that.</P>
    <P>There was a certain misunderstanding in relation to the higher diploma courses. I understand that the Higher Education Authority notified the universities in October 1991 that, in the light of anticipated need, the number of entrants for the higher diploma course would be reduced to 500.  However, the intake in 1990 was set at 600 but was increased to 730.  It transpired that the information regarding the reduced intake was not notified by the universities to the students until January of this year causing a big problem, as those of us who were approached by students and their parents know.  I understand that in view of the effect on students of the late notification the Higher Education Authority are considering the postponement of the reduction in intake until 1993 so that <Col N="1688" /> there will be plenty of advance warning. That is the way it should be and I commend the Minister, and his Department, on their action.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the amount of money contributed by the State to education.  The provision for pay and pensions alone represents 83 per cent of the gross non-capital provision.  Education is a very labour intensive area.  I am glad that in Ireland we pay our teachers more than their opposite numbers in the UK and certainly more than their opposite numbers in the United States.  We want the right people teaching our children who are entitled to the best education.  We also want people teaching our children who are dedicated and we want to make their jobs easier, which can be done by reducing the pupil-teacher ratio.  I am pleased that the pupil-teacher ratio is improving and hope it will continue to improve.  There has certainly been an improvement on the ratio of four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>I consider that no party in the State have a greater commitment to education than the Fianna Fáil Party and we have shown that in Government.  Every time there has been a change of Government from Fianna Fáil the first cut back was in education.  I remember when remedial teachers were stopped as one of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even though the state of the public finances was difficult when Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987, we reintroduced remedical teaching.  We recognised that the most disadvantaged people in our community were the handicapped and we have done everything we can to help them.</P>
      <P>In conclusions, I suggest to the Minister that he consider sending a copy of his Estimates speech to the principals of our schools.  The speech is a succinct policy statement of what the Department intend to do this year.  The document is very worth while and I commend the Minister for presenting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I wish to state that I am profoundly disappointed at the priorities singled out by the Minister for the further development of the education system.</P>
      <P>The first priority in the education system is that it should be tailor-made to the needs of the planet.  However, there is no sign of that.  There is no sign of anything in the education policy to show that the Government are reassessing the need for encouraging a completely different kind of society, which will be much less consumerist-based than the present society.  The education system is basically geared towards perpetuation of our present industrial society, which is clearly non-sustainable.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Green Revolution&rdquo; is not a political revolution with educational implications. It is an educational revolution with political implications and is at heart an educational revolution.  It is about putting new things on the world's agenda. It is not restricted to textbooks.  If we are to save the world, not just politicians and captains of industry must be convinced but millions of ordinary people must be brought to change the way in which they live.  It is a remarkable project and its lifeblood is knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Green&rdquo; thinking on education reflects concerns that underlie &ldquo;Green&rdquo; thinking on systems in general and the need to develop increasingly democratic ways of <Col N="1690" /> organising and running society, the need to free people from dependency on professional elites and political ideologies that undermine their ability to act independently, the need to create a radically less wasteful and less destructive economic order and the need to reduce our dependence on aggression and exploitation and to instill in the peoples of the world the self-confidence to work cooperatively and harmoniously for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>We want to see education fundamentally democratised.  We want to see people believing in their own powers of learning and action, acknowledging the worth of self-acquired, traditional and craft knowledge and the knowledge held by women.  We want to see a radical transformation in the ways in which we allocate and use valuable educational resources.  We want to see the selective, exclusivist mentality of educational systems replaced by a sharing, inclusivist one.</P>
    <P>What is currently meant by education is too often little more than a form of social and material investment.  Young people study in order to get what is called a good job.  The destructive consumerist assumption, &ldquo;you are what you have&rdquo;, is inculcated from an early age.  In this environment, education has become another consumer product; something purchased from a range on offer, something which someone else has done for you or does to you.  It is a potent training in consumerism, teaching people to be passive and aggressive at the same time.  It opens the gateway to ideological manipulation.</P>
    <P>As it stands, our education system is the product of our industrial society. Schools are organised and run along factory lines.  The structures, the timetable, the scale and the principles of organisation of our educational system are leftovers from a rapidly passing industrial age.  A respect for human individuality and values, meaningful organisation of our time, flexibility and variety of provision are hallmarks of the most advanced and forward-seeing economies <Col N="1691" /> in every sphere.  Education should be to the forefront of these developments.</P>
    <P>Psychologically, education is the effect of learning, and learning is a process in which we discover ways to do the things we want to do.  The organisation of learning should therefore be directed towards the pursuit of individual, shared and cooperative aspirations.  The principles of human sharing and co-operation are pro-fundly undermined by the competitive, exam-oriented structures of our current educational system, which seek to compare and select rather than to facilitate and encourage, and are a major source of aggression in society.  It is more important for the process of education that a learner be given the means for creative discovery and be excited by the amount of progress they are making than that they should achieve any particular goal.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that while many young people are obliged to spend hours in school and want instead to do meaningful work, many adults want to return to learning and are still obliged to spend long hours in work.  No structural changes are workable without commitment to personal change on the part of those in the system.</P>
    <P>In asking for a redefinition of educational goals, we are asking all those involved in education to partake in an ongoing redefinition of their roles.  This applies as much to learners as to teachers, managers, churches, administrators and parents alike.  We hope to open up the systems available to allow wider access to educational achievement and at the same time to encourage creative initiatives, individual and social, within and outside of traditional schools.</P>
    <P>The introduction of certain key measures will enable valuable alternatives to emerge within and alongside current systems.  The Green Party anticipate that those systems will improve organically in this more open climate.</P>
    <P>With the current decline in the birth rate, it should be possible in significant measure to finance these measures simply by maintaining the education budget at <Col N="1692" /> its current level, with due regard for inflation.  The universal provision of a basic income will free parents and young people from financial pressures which often limit their commitment to learning both inside and outside academic structures. Our present economic circumstances make this difficult for many parents.  A central policy of the Greens is the provision of an individual basic income.  Considerable organisational freedom would be given to students, teachers and schools to develop new approaches to curriculum, with a view to increasing democratisation of all levels of decision making and Government.</P>
    <P>The Green objective of removing much of the elements of competition and economic necessity will reduce in importance the forms of extrinsic motivation, dominant in most of our education today. These supports will be replaced by the introduction of radical new freedoms in the design and choice of courses of study, a new emphasis on the development of each student's natural interest and, once a field has been chosen, by motivation to the highest levels of self-challenge.  We need to restore the decision-making power over learning to those involved: to the learner, the teacher, the school, the community.  The system needs flexibility and local responsibility in the management of learning, to allow people to make their own use of a wide variety of teaching and learning styles and techniques.</P>
    <P>The Green Party call on the Government to stop spending such huge amounts of taxpayers' money on an already outdated education which no longer serves the needs of our people and the needs of our planet either now or in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Vote before the House of £1,600 million for Education.  The last speaker referred to the vast amount of <Col N="1693" /> money being spent; I am sure he is aware of the proposed Green Paper on Education which will give us all an opportunity &mdash; and indeed encouragement has been given to all involved in the delivery of the education system &mdash; to develop the changing educational challenges to adapt to meet the needs.</P>
      <P>I am a product of our free national and secondary school system, which is second to none.  We recognise the importance of education.  The Department is the third highest spender, which shows the priority given by this House to education. Of course questions are asked about value for money in relation to spending and there will always be suggestions from Members of the House on how we can improve the system and get better value for money.  That should be encouraged to ensure that we get the optimum return on the money spent.</P>
      <P>The last Government speaker referred to the position of students in relation to the higher diploma in education courses. I am aware that the Higher Education Authority notified universities in October 1989 regarding the anticipated need and the numbers which should be identified for that year.  However, without justification, the numbers were increased to 730 people in 1991 instead of the identified 500 which means that 230 students are in the twilight zone.  I have been told that, in view of the late notification and its effects on students, the Higher Education Authority are considering &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;considering&rdquo;&mdash; the question of postponing any reduction in intake until 1993.  It us unacceptable that we have allowed 230 pupils to fall between two stools.  I ask the Minister to ensure that those students are accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Green Paper on Education, in particular to the central aims to which the former Minister referred as the cornerstone of her approach to the Green Paper.  I welcome the six aims: first, of which is greater equity in education, particularly for those who are disadvantaged, socially and economically; second, to broaden our educational system in order to equip <Col N="1694" /> students more effectively for life, work and enterprise culture and, in particular, as citizens of Europe; third, to make the best possible use of our educational resources; fourth, to train and develop teachers to meet the constant change in environment; fifth, to create a system of effective quality assurance; and sixth, to ensure greater openness and accountability throughout the system.  I particularly welcome the reference to maximising parental involvement and choice, indeed only recently, I tabled a parliamentary question to ask the Minister for Education what his intentions were in relation to greater parental involvement because it is very important, particularly to students throughout their early training years.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that a number of mentally handicapped children require education but that they are not being accommodated.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate the Departmental policy in relation to providing the necessary classes, teaching posts and support services to ensure that each and every child who requires education is accommodated.  I have been told that mentally handicapped children over four and a half years of age are not being accommodated.  Is the Minister aware of this?  Will he give a breakdown of the number of children in this catchment group?</P>
    <P>A number of principals in my constituency, in Clontarf, Donnycarney, Beaumont and Fairview, have raised with me the matter of how teacher allocations are determined.  I welcome the Minister of State's remarks in relation to the retention of teaching posts, which otherwise would have been lost due to falling numbers, to improve the pupil-teacher ratio.  This is in line with the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but ahead of time.  Given that the teacher allocation is determined on the basis of the number enrolled in September each year, is the Minister aware that schools may experience difficulties and find themselves down one or two <Col N="1695" /> teachers during the school year?  We should adopt a hands-on approach to address this difficulty.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe also that schools require the services of caretakers and clerical staff.  Finally, before I conclude, I would like to refer to the Youthreach programme.  What evaluation has been carried out and is the Minister of State satisfied that we are getting value for money with regard to the funds that we are spending in this area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I always welcome an opportunity of giving my few thoughts on anything connected with education.  It gives each Member an opportunity to come into the House to indicate his philosophy and outlook on education and what it should be about.  Straightaway, I want to say it is not about what people say it is; education as I see it, in the true sense, that philosophy which spoke of a healthy mind and body, is unfortunately, no longer relevant.  It has become nothing more than the new capitalism.</P>
      <P>Education is not what we claim it to be; there is no equality and there are no equal opportunities.  The Department would say that there are equal opportunities because all students are exposed to the same conditions and that, <i>ipso facto,</i> it is equal but that is nonsense as we know it is not.  The attitude towards education today is worse than ever it was. The prevailing thought is that education is about technological advances but I would demonstrate that technological advances are the worst thing that could happen perhaps and that is wrong to equate it with a healthy mind and body. Technology has no regard for the human person.  People would claim that it has all been done with a view to progress but who benefits from progress?  The answer is a small number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What benefits have accrued to my constituents because there has been in recent times this great so-called advance in technology? It has led to the vast majority of them losing their employment and that social commitment which every man and woman is entitled to have.  People who <Col N="1696" /> have been endowed with great intelligence and who are supposed to have equal rights find themselves every morning waiting for the post and wondering what they can do.  They are frustrated because there is no demand on their talents largely because of what are called technological advances.</P>
    <P>This is not peculiar to Ireland, but also affects other countries.  We can see the ever-increasing growth in unemployment and if we examine it for what it is we will see that it is attributable, to a large extent, to so-called technological advances.  What benefit is it to the vast majority of the people that some small group of people can fly in five hours from Shannon to New York and that what are called the great nations have savaged the Third World and taken wealth from it so that they can invest in armaments?  What use is technology to the vast majority of people?</P>
    <P>We also talk about making education relevant as if making it relevant would lead to the provision of a job.  We know that times change &mdash;<i>tempora mutant</i>&mdash; day in, day out, and that the one aspect of education that is eternally irrelevant is the humanities, the pursuit and study of human nature so that whether in good times or bad man and woman can be composed in whatever situation exists. We are abusing education if we say it refers to providing for a job that arises because of some technological advance. As I said earlier, the great advantage is that we can pool our thoughts in the hope that by the time we leave the Chamber we will be more enlightened.</P>
    <P>I have to say, in all honesty, that I regret and resent very much that what is called education seems to refer to a situation where professional people, who enjoy a certain status at the expense of the rest of the community, find themselves in a position where they can impose themselves and, because of the scarcity and fewness of numbers, demand fees in the order of £2,000 per day because of what they say is education.  Is it right that any one person who belongs to a certain profession and is blessed that he rather than someone else &mdash; invariably because <Col N="1697" /> of the economic situation in their home &mdash; can demand from the people of this country, who initially made the education available in so far as nine-tenths of the cost of the professional qualification that they received was paid for by the rest of the community, such a huge amount for their services?  This does not apply only to lawyers or accountants but to medical people and teachers also.</P>
    <P>We can say that there are equal opportunities and hope to contain the antagonism of the people by repeating this to them, but there are not, and education is not what it should be.  It should be about creating a sense of values which are just, fair and reasonable but, unfortunately, education today is nearer exploitation than enlightenment and, when we examine it through to the bitter end, nearer blackmail than to contributing to the wellbeing of one's neighbours, the understanding that other people exist and that they, too, are entitled to the satisfaction of knowing that they have a contribution to make while they are here on this earth.</P>
    <P>People may contend that I am a Luddite or am anti-progress.  The industrial revolution was very welcome because it elevated man from slavery, relieved him of the need to labour for some few years, at the end of which he expired.  Nowadays, when slavery has been eliminated, there is nothing more healthy or desirable than that man should have a commitment to or be given an opportunity to contribute to society in the times in which he lives.  By accepting that technological advances can be equalised or balanced with true education we are perpetuating that nonsense, fallacy and delusion. Indeed, the sooner we question that the better; the sooner we realise that man's happiness ultimately is not about technological progress or advances but rather about giving him the satisfaction of living a worthwhile life, a feeling that he has made some contribution to the life and times in which he lives.</P>
    <P>I know there will be comments to the effect that Deputy Tunney wants to go backwards.  In other areas in which anything takes place which is injurious to mankind there is an amnesty announced. <Col N="1698" /> I will not refer to the obscenity of armaments. Let us look at the technological advances made in armaments.  In earlier generations when man was subjected to incredible injustice and deprivation, whether through slavery, apartheid or communism, brave, visionary people challenged those practices heralding their ultimate downfall.  That cannot happen in the matter of technological advancement in armaments, because if such is halted, everybody will have been brought down with it and there will be nobody who will survive to say, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As Deputies Callely and Briscoe seem to have an insight into the restriction on numbers allowed participate in the higher diploma in education course from September next, will the Minister elaborate on the selection procedures that will be adopted to fill the golden 500 places?  What dialogue is taking place with the colleges in that respect?  Would the Minister agree that the present mood is a hang over from a proposal last year to reduce the number of departments of education in the universities from five to two and that following resistance from the colleges that so-called innovation was introduced?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister say What developments have taken place in relation to the establishment of an Education secretariat in Brussels?  The Minister said in the House on 18 February that he would be appointing a full-time official to that secretariat.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last, but not least, would the Minister please remove the shroud of mystery surrounding the Green Paper on Education, which is nothing other than a discussion document providing a stimulus for the <Col N="1699" /> broad education debate eagerly awaited and which has been kept under wraps for so long?</P>

Second &mdash; this is a slightly political point but on the other hand is fact &mdash; I agree with the case made by Deputy Rabbitte in respect of adult education and courses.

      <P>First, I should <Col N="1700" /> like to thank Members who contributed to this debate.  I will respond to the questions in the order in which they were presented to me.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the intake into education departments in universities. That question for the purpose of higher diploma in education course is under review.  In the context of that review consultations are taking place with the Higher Education Authority, the appropriate body.  It is hoped to have a decision thereon in the not too distant future.  It is not a question of what system or method may be used.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked when the new representative was expected to be appointed to the Education secretariat in Brussels. Since it is vital that the interests of our educational system be fully represented in the forthcoming negotiations <i>vis-á-vis</i> Structural Funds, the Minister has decided to establish a permanent Department of Education presence in Brussels. The appointment of a representative will be made in the near future.  Through our representation in Brussels we will seek to get a clearer view of the thinking of the Commission, as it develops, both on the overall size of the new funds and the underlying principles which will govern the allocation of those increased funds. This will be of immeasurable help in planning the development of education and training in the future.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt but that there will be a substantial increase in support available to this country from 1994 onwards.  This could result in a higher level of support for existing programmes.  It is intended to explore all possibilities to enhance the level and extent of student support within the context of extra resources.  I can confirm to the Deputy that there is no difficulty being encountered with regard to the rank of the person who may be appointed to Brussels.  The Deputy will be aware that all Departments are experiencing staffing difficulties at present.  We want to find the most suitable person to send to Brussels.  We hope that position will be resolved very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins's third question had to do with the present position in relation <Col N="1701" /> to the Green Paper on Education.  I can appreciate a certain amount of frustration being felt about the publication of that paper, the subject of debate for quite some time.  Unfortunately, since some three Ministes have been involved its publication has been delayed somewhat. The present Minister concentrated in the first 12 to 14 weeks following his appointment, on reviewing and revising drafts of that Green Paper.  Deputy Higgins was critical of the fact that, on occasion, the Minister was not present in the House.  Indeed, the Minister's absence was occasioned by his interest in that Green Paper&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Green Paper on Education, when published, will be seen to be the work of the present Minister, the House will appreciate that he must be totally familiar with it and in agreement with its proposals.  In the first week in April last the Minister published an introduction to the Green Paper outlining the main themes, issues and general direction of its contents.  The Green Paper has now been completed and would have been published today but for the unfortunate illness of the Minister for Education.  Let me emphasise there has been no deliberate or selective leaks by the Minister or his Department of the contents of the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to the provision of a university for Waterford, and as I come from the neighbouring county I have a personal interest in it.  However I would not like to think that the motivation behind the demand for a university for Waterford &mdash; and I know this is not the case &mdash; is in any way a criticism of Waterford Regional Technical College. Waterford Regional Technical College is an excellent and innovative third level institution which offers a comprehensive range of courses from certificate to degree level.  Its status as a regional technical college has not inhibited its development in any way.  However, the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991, currently <Col N="1702" /> being debated seeks to introduce statutory changes that will facilitate the greater involvement of Waterford RTC and other regional technical colleges in research and development and work particularly related to business and industry. In this regard Waterford Regional Technical College has provided an excellent service to the south-eastern region, of which I am well aware.  Under the provisions of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, Waterford RTC will have greater freedom and autonomy to further develop services to business and industry and to the people in the south-east region.  Waterford Regional Technical College is the largest regional technical college in the country and in excess of 40 per cent of its students are following degree level courses.  Its status as a regional technical college and not a university has not inhibited its development to date and will not inhibit its future development.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea raised the question of State pre-school education in disadvantaged areas and I wish to point out that compared with other education services in Europe, our primary education system already has significant provision for the age groups that would be regarded as being in the pre-school category. Children are eligible for enrolment in primary schools in Ireland from the age of four, whereas in other countries the age of enrolment is five or over. My Department make provision for pre-school education in the case of one innercity project and for 47 pre-schools for travellers.  In the latter case the Department meet 98 per cent of tuition and transport costs.  The main innovative development for the disadvantaged is the home-help liaison project which caters for 80 primary schools.  Through the employment of 45 full time teachers as home-school liaison officers, parents are being encouraged to become actively involved in their children's education at primary school and in the establishment of pre-school groups which are facilitated with accommodation and other assistance. There are over 20,000 children <Col N="1703" /> involved in these projects in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The provision of school welfare officers in vocational education committee areas to co-ordinate various services both voluntary and statutory was raised by Deputy O'Shea.  The need to co-ordinate voluntary and statutory services in the educational interests of children from disadvantaged areas has been recognised in the home-school liaison project established by the Department.  A national steering committee oversees the project at primary and post-primary level.  The committee consists of representatives from the Departments of Education and Health, the Garda Síochána as well as the relevant educational interests.  There are also local committees who advise and support the local co-ordinators.  Again these local committees are representative of relevant voluntary and statutory organisations and groups.  These projects are working extremely well and will form the basis for the development of further initiatives in advancing and co-ordinating services which can support the education of children in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney asked about the provision of caretaker and clerical services in schools.  I dealt with this in my opening address.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> funds will be provided for caretaking and clerical services from September next on a phased basis in all national schools with 100 pupils and upwards and at second level schools with 200 pupils or more.  I think he answered his final question in the course of his remarks.</P>
    <P>During our wide-ranging discussions many important issues were raised and addressed.  The Government recognise the key contribution that education makes towards achieving economic, social and cultural goals.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government have reiterated their commitment in line with their economic and social policies towards achieving equity, equality and effectiveness in education.  The overall strategy is to provide opportunities for everybody to <Col N="1704" /> develop to the full their talents and potential.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank all Members who have contributed to this debate and I now commend the Estimates to the House.</P>
    <P>Vote put.</P>
    <P>A division being demanded, the taking of the division was postponed until 6.20 p.m. on Wednesday, 10 June 1992, in accordance with an order of the Dáil of this day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  My officials have been taken by surprise because we were due to start at 1.30 p.m. but I am starting in advance of that.</P>
      <P>I propose that the Vote for Foreign Affairs and the Vote for International Co-operation be debated together, as is customary.</P>
      <P>Most of the sum proposed for the Vote for Foreign Affairs is required for the Department's administrative budget. This covers the salaries of staff at headquarters and at missions abroad as well as travel, accommodation, communications, equipment and supplies.  Provision is also made for repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens who find themselves in difficulties abroad, for services to emigrants, for cultural and information services and for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Estimates is one of the relatively few occasions when Members of the Dáil have an opportunity to address the full range of foreign policy issues facing this country.  I am very conscious of the fact that our present arrangements do not permit Members of the House to have as full an input in the Foreign Affairs area as I would consider desirable.  The proposed Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will provide a valuable and welcome opportunity for more detailed discussion and debate; I hope that when I come before the House to present next year's Estimates we will have a flourishing and productive committee in operation.</P>
      <P>At this time of rapid change and readjustment in the international environment, the range and complexity of issues we must confront in the foreign policy area has rarely been greater.  As I said, time constraints do not permit me to address the full range of issues in the detail I would wish.  I propose, therefore, to focus in particular today on three areas of critical importance: the achievement of lasting peace in Northern Ireland; the development of the European Community; and the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The search for a lasting peace settlement <Col N="1706" /> in Northern Ireland is a matter of the highest priority on the Government's agenda.  After 23 years of unrest and suffering, the need for a political accommodation between the two traditions which would isolate the men of violence on both sides is greater than ever.  The people of Northern Ireland desperately want to see progress made towards a settlement.  We owe it to them, and to the cause of constitutional poitics in these islands, that a sustained effort should be made in this direction.</P>
    <P>For the past two-and-a-half years, the Government have worked tirelessly to create conditions which would enable a process of dialogue to take place between the political parties in Northern Ireland and the Irish and British Governments. These efforts bore fruit with the opening of substantive political talks on an agreed basis several weeks ago.</P>
    <P>We are now embarked upon a negotiation process of extraordinary complexity, whose outcome cannot yet be predicted.  Major obstacles have already been encountered and the Government have no illusions about further difficulties which may lie ahead.  But we are aware that these talks offer an historic opportunity for lasting political progress to be made in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>All of the participants &mdash; the Irish and British Governments and the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland &mdash; have pledged themselves to the goal of achieving &ldquo;a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands&rdquo;.  This is perhaps the greatest challenge which will ever face the politicians gathered around the conference table.  If it is to be met, traditional and inward-looking approaches will not suffice.  If we are genuinely to achieve a new beginning, we must each address the fundamental issues involved with imagination, vision and, above all, courage.</P>
    <P>This is the hallmark of the Irish Government's approach.  We will work steadily to achieve new political structures which will involve, not the domination of one tradition by another, but rather a fair and honourable accommodation <Col N="1707" /> between both traditions on this island.  We will do all in our power to ensure that the process, which carries with it the hopes of the vast majority of people on both islands, is brought to an early and successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>In parallel with our efforts on the political front, we will seek to ensure that progress continues to be made in other areas which are of major concern to the Government, including the promotion of confidence on the part of the Nationalist community in the security forces and in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  We will also continue to pay particular attention to the special problems confronting those communities living close to the Border and we will pursue every opportunity for the enhancement of cross-Border co-operation in the economic and social sectors.</P>
    <P>The second major challenge facing us is our relationship with the European Community.  On 18 June, the people of Ireland will make a fundamental choice about our future in Europe when they vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  I am conscious that the great majority of Deputies share the government's conviction that the people should be encouraged to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, and have demonstrated this by actively campaigning for this result.</P>
    <P>The Government naturally shared in the very widespread disappointment at the outcome of the Danish referendum earlier this week.  Yesterday I attended a meeting of Community Foreign Ministers in Oslo to consider the various problems resulting from the Danish vote.  The unanimous conclusion of that meeting was that the other 11 member states should proceed with the ratification of the Treaty despite the Danish decision. The other member states saw no need to deprive their electorates, in the case of Ireland and France, or their legislatures of the opportunity to consider the new Treaty.</P>
    <P>While showing full understanding of the democratic decision of the Danish people, the Eleven are determined to adhere to the ratification process as <Col N="1708" /> scheduled.  The Government have concluded that we must press ahead with our arrangements for the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in our referendum on 18 June.  I am fully confident that the Irish people will approve this further important stage in European integration and vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in our referendum by a large majority, undeterred by the experience of another member state for which the circumstances and the issues are of an entirely different order to ours.</P>
    <P>Nearly 20 years ago, the people of Ireland by an overwhelming majority chose to become members of a European Community committed to creating a more prosperous future for all the people of Europe in a framework of ever-closer integration.  Successive Governments have done their best to see that Ireland brought its own contribution, informed by our particular history and culture, to the process of European construction. While the process of adjustment to membership has not been painless, there is little doubt that the Irish people have benefited enormously from Community membership.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years, Ireland has changed from having a closed, protectionist economy to an extremely open one.  The principal engine driving this has been our membership of the European Community.  Membership has allowed Ireland to attract industry to establish itself here.  It has also created the conditions whereby we have developed a substantial export-based industry with the benefits this brings.  The Common Agricultural Policy has brought huge benefits to Irish farmers and the major reform package recently adopted means that it will continue to provide a suitable framework for the future development of our agriculture and food industry.</P>
    <P>The Community provides a vital market for our exports; it also provides crucial support for our economic development programmes.  The cohesion proposals in the Delors package envisage a very considerable increase in the Structural Funds, in particular for the Objective 1 regions, which includes the whole of Ireland.  In addition, a new Cohesion <Col N="1709" /> Fund was agreed at Maastricht for the benefit of environment and transport infrastructure measures in the four least prosperous member states, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece.  Apart from the actual amounts involved, Maastricht saw agreement on the more flexible operation of these funds which is of great importance to us.</P>
    <P>Membership of the European Community has also given us an opportunity to participate with our partners in the formulation of common policies on important international issues, through the process of European political co-operation. Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, the Common Foreign and Security Policy will become one of the three pillars of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Common Foreign and Security Policy is to strengthen the ability of the European Union to co-operate and act on international issues. Events in recent years such as the changes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the crisis in Yugoslavia and the Middle East peace negotiations have shown the need for the European Community to play a fuller and more coherent part in international affairs.  Other countries are looking to the Community for assistance on such matters as the promotion of peace, human rights and development.  The provisions of foreign and security policy will enable the union to do this.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Maastricht Treaty on the Common Foreign and Security policy do not establish a common defence policy or a common defence for the union.  Neither do they establish a military alliance or require Ireland to join one.  The Treaty specifically recognises that the policy of the union will not prejudice the specific character of Ireland's security and defence policies.</P>
    <P>The Treaty provisions foresee future negotiations on the eventual framing of a common defence policy.  But discussions and decisions on the scope and content of a common defence policy are left to that future negotiation and to another Intergovernmental Conference in 1996. <Col N="1710" /> The outsome of any future negotiations would require unanimous agreement of all member states including Ireland. Moreover, the Irish people will be consulted and will have an opportunity to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any future treaty establishing a common defence policy or common defence for the union &mdash;<i>vide</i> the decision in the Crotty case.</P>
    <P>When matters having defence implications arise, these may be referred by unanimity to the Western European Union for elaboration and implementation. Because the Western European Union can be so requested by the European Union to elaborate and implement issues with defence implications, the Government believe that there would be advantages in Ireland's attending meetings of the Western European Union as an observer, as we did last year in relation to the crisis in Yugoslavia.  Attendance as an observer would not require Ireland to join the Western European Union, to take up an obligations under the Western European Union, or to subscribe to Western European Union policies.</P>
    <P>I believe that, far from being any way hesitant, we should look at the CFSP as giving Ireland a rich and valuable opportunity to play a full and constructive part in the formulation of EC policies which, more than ever, have a significant impact on the international stage.  It will allow us to promote values, concerns and priorities which are important for us in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the most heartening results of the end of cold-war rivalries has been the impetus given to the work of the United Nations.  Ireland's long standing commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN remains firm.  We welcome the renewed vigour and effectiveness of the organisation, which stems from greater international recognition of their full potential.  Global action is needed to preserve international peace, maintain the rule of international law, promote respect for fundamental human rights, protect the environment and combat hunger and disease in the world.  The United Nations provides an irreplacable <Col N="1711" /> framework for the common efforts of mankind in these and other areas.</P>
    <P>The UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights highlight the importance of fundamental human rights and the dignity of each human being.  We will continue to work within the Commission on Human Rights to highlight violations and to encourage wider acceptance and implementation of fundamental instruments designed to promote universal human rights.  We are participating actively in the current preparations for the World Conference on Human Rights to take place in mid-1993 &mdash; the first occasion since 1968 on which Governments will gather at ministerial level to discuss human rights issues.  We consider that the conference should reaffirm the universality and indivisability of fundamental human rights, should suggest improvements in the mechanisms to promote these rights and should examine the link between human rights, responsible government and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>At the European level, Ireland and our partners in the Community keep under close and regular scrutiny the human rights situation in specific countries and regions.  There is a growing understanding and appreciation of the active role of the Community and its member states in monitoring observance of human rights, in condemning gross violations wherever and whenever they occur and in promoting universal adherence to these basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operation (CSCS), the development of effective mechanisms to ensure greater recognition of the human dimension is under way.</P>
    <P>With the ending of the Cold War era, the protection and promotion of human rights, often inhibited in the past by the ideological divide, is rapidly assuming its pre-eminent place on the international political agenda.  Ireland has a long tradition, in the United Nations and in its bilateral relations, of concern for the dignity and worth of the individual.  We <Col N="1712" /> will continue to treat human rights issues as a central part of our foreign policy and I will make that a major plank in my platform as long as I remain Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The creation of peace-keeping and observer forces is another of the critically important activities undertaken by the United Nations.  Ireland has a long and proud record of involvement in UN peace-keeping.  The men and women of the Defence Forces and of the Garda Síochána have made an outstanding contribution to peace-keeping operations over many years.  In the past year, we have contributed personnel to two new missions, those in Yugoslavia and Cambodia, and for the first time to the United Nations mission in Angola.</P>
    <P>Much of the resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs at home and abroad are devoted to our participation in the European Community and in international organisations.  However, there remain significant areas of activity which will have a primarily bilateral focus for the foreseeable future.  Protection of the welfare of our citizens abroad, especially of our recent emigrants, remains a key concern of my Department and of our missions abroad.  I have charged the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs specifically with responsibility for the cause and care of emigrants wherever they are.  In the United States and Britain in particular our missions play a major role in helping to co-ordinate the activities of the various voluntary bodies and in offering practical assistance, especially to newly arrived Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>I cannot express my appreciation in deeper terms than to say that since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs I have met with many emigrant organisations in the United States and particularly in the United Kingdom.  All these organisations are based on the voluntary ideal.  The people in those organisations cannot be thanked deeply enough and long enough on behalf of this nation.  I place on record my deep appreciation of all those voluntary organisations who in one way or other assist <Col N="1713" /> our emigrants, whether in the United States, the United Kingdom or else where.  They are the unsung heroes of this country who do not receive sufficient praise from us.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the vital importance of exports to our national economy.  I would like to emphasise my strong commitment to further strengthening the role of the Department in the foreign earnings area in order to more effectively contribute to the Government's economic policy, including in the area of job creation.  I am particularly anxious that all our diplomats should play the fullest possible role in promoting trade and investment and I would like to encourage a greater awareness of the Department and our missions abroad as a resource to be used by Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>The plight of the many in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world who are the helpless victims of drought and civil strife evokes a deep response from the Irish people.  Their generous contributions to organisations involved in assisting the Third World are evidence of this.  It is the Government's duty to reflect this public concern, both directly through their ODA programme and indirectly through the stance they adopt in the EC and other fora when the interests of developing countries are in question.</P>
    <P>This year, total ODA will amount to almost £43 million or 0.17 per cent of GNP &mdash; £22.48 million will come from the Vote for International Co-operation, the balance from other departmental Votes and from the central fund.  As in past years, the bulk of our bilateral aid will go to our four priority countries: Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan. Multilateral aid amounting to over £27 million will be channelled through the European Community and other international agencies.</P>
    <P>Our programme of assistance to developing countries is an important part of the Department's activities.  Through it, we give official recognition to our duty of solidarity with countries that are struggling to provide for the most basic needs of their peoples.  I know that there is widespread support in the House for <Col N="1714" /> this effort and for the Government's commitment to undertake a planned programme of increases in our official development assistance leading to a higher ODA/GNP ratio by the end of 1944.</P>
    <P>There are major challenges facing us on this island and in our relations with Europe.  Without underestimating the difficulties, we must pursue the opportunities that exist for bringing reconciliation to all the people of this island and for providing a secure and prosperous future for them.  We must also contribute towards a world order in which the cries of the weak for basic justice and human rights are heeded and the resources of the planet are used wisely for the benefit of all mankind and for future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by apologising to the Minister for the unavoidable absence of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, our senior spokesman on Foreign Affairs, who is ill.  I trust that he will be adequately served in this House by me as deputy spokesperson on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the reference in the Minister's speech to the formation of the Foreign Affairs Committee which is long overdue.  I know that the Minister's interest in this matter has eventually unlodged the log-jam that existed in the formation of this committee.  We hope that it will be operating effectively very soon.  Like the Minister, I will concentrate my remarks on a couple of areas because time is short.  The eyes of Europe will be on Ireland on 18 June next.  It will be an historic day for this country and, indeed, for the whole of Europe.  The people will then have an opportunity to give a clear lead to the rest of Europe on the Maastricht Treaty.  We will also have the opportunity to lead the rescue from the confusion following the result of the <Col N="1715" /> Danish referendum and to provide a sense of renewed direction towards European Union.  Ireland should and will be able to restore the impetus which has been lost since Wednesday because of the Danish result.  By showing that we are proud to be Irish in Europe we will be able to play a leading role in the welding of the Europe of tomorrow.  I offer the Minister my good wishes for his continuing courage when he goes to represent Ireland in the discussions that will take place.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for the intelligence of the Irish electorate.  The people will not be side-tracked by either hysterical or well-meaning but emotional and often inaccurate interpretations of what is in the Treaty.  They will make a calm and balanced judgement on the merits and demerits of the Treaty and European Union.  As one speaker said at a meeting I attended recently, it may not be the Treaty each individual might have negotiated for himself but it is the Treaty that has come out from long and careful negotiations.  On the balance of advantage people will vote for it.</P>
      <P>In 1972, 83 per cent of our people recognised that our place was in Europe. This decision was further endorsed in 1987 by the vote on the SEA by a margin of over two to one.  The evergreen opponents of Europe were heard in 1972 and again in 1987 and they are now attempting to seize on the Danish referendum decision as a reason to reinforce their cause against Europe.  Triumphalism does not have any place in the debate and no matter how well-meaning people are they should not engage in triumphalism.  To use the Danish decision to reinforce the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote argument would be like using the example of a man walking across O'Connell Bridge and seeing somebody jump into the Liffey and therefore concluding that the next person should do the same.  We must carefully re-evaluate where Ireland stands and vote for the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, Denmark has decided to separate itself from the other 11 member states who signed the Maastricht Treaty. <Col N="1716" /> They have also decided to separate themselves from Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland and the other countries that are queueing up to join the European Community and European Union.  All sane voices will counsel that we follow the lead given by Deputy John Bruton on Wednesday night after the Danish result and renew our commitment to Europe.  I am glad that the Government, following some initial indecision and uncertainty, followed the lead given by Deputy John Bruton and resoundingly recommitted Ireland to the Treaty.  We now have the opportunity to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum and to give European Union the kind of endorsement that will reverberate throughout Europe and give the kiss of life that has been slightly shattered by the vote in Denmark, to European Union.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the Danes had problems with the SEA.  In that case in the parliament it was initially rejected.  Following a request for renegotiation which was refused, the Act was subsequently passed by the parliament and two-thirds of the people.  I have, perhaps vague hopes, that something similar will happen in this case.  If there is political will in Europe we can assist the Danes in overcoming their problems with the Treaty.  Undoubtedly, we have feelings of friendship and solidarity with the Danes and we would not like to see them in a political or economic backwater, while at the same time it must be made clear to the people of Denmark that they will not be allowed to halt the progression of European integration.</P>
    <P>Our Government must be absolutely clear on where we stand on this issue in Europe.  I am disappointed that so far the Taoiseach has not taken up the suggestion of Deputy John Bruton with regard to convening a summit meeting as quickly as possible.  Let Ireland show its stength on this issue and let us take some lead. A summit meeting would provide the stabilising influence for a clear political direction which is needed in Europe.  In the absence of such a summit meeting the stabilising influence and clear political <Col N="1717" /> direction will have to be provided by the people of Ireland on June 18.</P>
    <P>The real issue facing Iraland is whether we want to keep pace with and continue as part of the development of European Union or to isolate our country in a European limbo where we can self-righteously proclaim our independent position while at the same time continuing to look for financial aids and other benefits of membership. Self-respect alone should preclude us from doing this, but this seems to be what the people urging a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote are in effect asking the country to do &mdash; to continue to take what we can from Europe without taking our full place there.  We now have the opportunity to wrap the European mantle around us in a way that was not dreamt of prior to the Danish result.</P>
    <P>Some would argue that a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would result in the loss of some of our sovereighty.  It would be better to say that we would pool our sovereignty.  Some legislation will be imposed by European Laws, but that may not be any harm.  If we want to be part of Europe we must play our part there and obey the rules which the Twelve together negotiate.  We will not lose our sovereignty.  I know we are an intensly independent country, having fought for 800 years to get our independence, but it is not correct to say that we will lose that independent voice if we continue with European Union.</P>
    <P>Through the EC we have a voice in decisions at international level.  The best example is the GATT negotiations which are of huge importance to us, especially to our farmers.  I support the GATT process and hope that the Uruguay round can be brought to a successful conclusion. We have special concerns particularly on the agricultural chapter because here, 14 per cent of our population live on farms as opposed to 3 per cent in Europe as a whole and a mere 1 per cent in America. Similarly, our effective economic sovereignty will be enhanced through economic and monetary union which is one of the central parts of the new Treaty. European Monetary Union offers the prospect of economic growth and increased employment for Europe and <Col N="1718" /> Ireland.  Since we export 75 per cent of what we produce to the EC, the economic growth of the Community is of vital importance to us.  Our membership of the EC has helped to decrease our dependency on the UK.  Before we joined, 65 per cent of our trade was with the UK. Now only about 30 per cent is there. We are not now as hidebound by what happens in the UK.</P>
    <P>The goal of European Monetary Union is increased growth, lower inflation and interest rates.  Given our large national debt, lower interest rates will assist us in reducing that debt which is a milestone around the neck of the economy preventing the release of resources for job creation.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, in considering our decision on the Maastricht Treaty the effect on jobs and job creation must be a primary consideration.  While Europe will not solve our jobs crisis in the context of Europe and in the context of guaranteed access to the largest market in the world and supports available to us as a member, we have some hopes of coming to terms with the jobs crisis.</P>
    <P>If there is a temptation to follow the Danish decision we should realise that this would leave Ireland in a worse political and economic situation than Denmark is now facing, because the economy in Denmark is stronger than ours.  If we follow that course we will have utterly failed those who are without jobs and will leave them in a hopeless situation.  Many of those who have jobs will risk losing them because of the transfer of production facilities and investment, perhaps to Europe.  Many investors are now coming into Europe and opening factories as a door into the mainland and the markets of the 320 million people in Europe.  If Ireland puts itself on the outside of that investment many jobs will be lost to this country.</P>
    <P>Clinging to an outdated version of our sovereignty will bring cold comfort to those without jobs.  Those urging a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote have not addressed this.  A &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would be failing our many thousands of young people who would see no future for themselves here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> A common complaint I have heard is that people are confused about the content of the Maastricht Treaty.  I am not surprised.  I lay the blame for this squarely on the shoulders of the Government.  It is ridiculous that this negotiation was conducted for over a year and a half without any detailed debates in this House. During that time our requests for a foreign affairs committee were rejected and there was no White Paper, which should have been issued last year.</P>
    <P>The Irish Protocol which has led to so many problems was a <i>fait accompli</i> even before Deputies knew of its existence.  The preoccupation of the debate with this Protocol and the issue of abortion &mdash; an issue which we must resolve ourselves &mdash; has diverted public attention from the many significant issues in the Treaty.  I have attended many public meetings around Dublin and I have been amazed at the standard of the debate and the thirst for knowledge about this Treaty.  The pity is that these meetings were not going on six months ago in order to give people a chance to understand and tease out what is going on.  We are now in the final run up to the vote on 18 June.  Those of us who are committed to the European ideal must work even harder to ensure that the referendum is successful.</P>
    <P>If European Union comes to fruition both parts of Ireland will ultimately be contiguous regions in a united Europe. This opens up many possibilities for a solution to our historical problems in this island.  My party Leader, Deputy Bruton, spoke warmly and courageously about this yesterday.  A key to progress in the past decade has been the realisation that the problem of Northern Ireland has to be viewed in the context of three sets of relationships &mdash; those within Northern Ireland, North-South and between the Irish and British Governments.  This was recognised in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and is currently recognised in the talks process.</P>
    <P>For the coming years we will see in the Maastricht Treaty a further key to <Col N="1720" /> progress.  European Union introduces a fourth relationship which is an important addition to the other three.  Because of European Union internal borders are tumbling.  European Union will bring all the people of this island together in a shared European citizenship.  An integral part of European Union involves diversity of culture and identify being not just tolerated but actively valued and encouraged. In relation to Northern Ireland, this is a most open and fertile scenario which can over time help to develop the tolerance and respect which are the integral components of a Northern Ireland solution.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Single Market will confirm the recent study on North-South economic development.  It will open up enormous possibilities for manufacturers North and South, with the potential for £3 billion worth of extra business and, perhaps, 75,000 extra jobs on the island as a whole.  On the other hand, assuming the Maastricht Treaty were approved by the House of Commons in London and rejected in Ireland, it would mean that the two parts of Ireland would be in different categories of EC membership and this would turn the Border once again into a major political and economic frontier.</P>
    <P>Irish history is the history of all people who have lived on this island.  Our future involves the reconciliation of all our people, leading to a union of people rather than of territory.</P>
    <P>In this situation, our best approach is to give total support to the current talks. Everything we can do of a positive nature to encourage the success of these talks must be done.  I appreciate the confidential nature of these talks and I will not comment in any detail other than to make a point which I consider to be of major relevance.  The burden of responsibility on those involved in the present negotiations is very heavy indeed.  I genuinely and sincerely hope that all those involved will have the courage to succeed.</P>
    <P>If we learn anything from history, it is that there can be no solution without compromise.  More importantly, we can also learn from history that the really <Col N="1721" /> courageous are those who are prepared to engage in realistic negotiations in a genuine effort to find a solution rather than those who remain imprisoned in an ideological straitjacket.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not use the opportunity in the preparation of his first Estimates to give a commitment to increase overseas aid budget.  In the European Union there is a philosophy which is not selfish or inward looking.  Europe is prepared to play its part in the search for peace.  This Government's approach is not good enough.  The Minister stated that we are at one in trying to help the millions suffering in Africa and elsewhere, but not enough is being done.  Is the Minister aware that over 25 million people are threatened with imminent starvation?  We cannot sit back and allow that to continue.  Part of the reason is the huge debt burden on many of the poorest countries in Africa. The total debt of the 23 low income countries in Africa is 106 per cent of the total value of the goods and services produced by them in 1989, the latest year for which figures are available to me.  This was by far the hightest debt to GNP ratio of any major grouping of debtor nations.  This burden of debt is stopping those countries from developing their resources and feeding their people.  We cannot let that continue.  I hope the Minister is playing a vital role in mobilising food and other resources for these countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister might examine the reasons Ireland has not completed the process to ratify the UN Convention on Children.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, went to the UN in 1990, with great fanfare and publicity, to sign the indication that Ireland would ratify this Convention.  To date it has not been ratified. The real sufferers in the Third World are children, 40,000 of whom die every day from diseases such as whooping cough, measles and diarrhoea.  I know the Minister is deeply concerned about this.  I hope he will use the opportunity given to him in his &ldquo;new manifestation&rdquo; to put his fine words into practice and that he will give the Minister of State every opportunity to increase the overseas <Col N="1722" /> aid budget in coming years so that we can hold our heads high on the European stage in seeking the necessary resources for the development of the Third World. It is notable that many side meetings at the Rio Conference are attempting to get world leaders to recognise that talk will not feed many millions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Our spokesman on Foreign Affairs is unavoidably absent and sends his apologies.  The Labour Party are anxious to see the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee as soon as possible.  Recent events have illustrated the urgent need for a proper system of debate and consultation in Dáil Éireann. The Maastricht Treaty was developed in secret.  There has been no proper debate in this House or in the country in relation to it.  When States are moving towards such momentous decisions as the Maastricht Treaty contains, if we are serious about the principle of subsidiarity, consensus should be developed in a way that provides for the widest possible consultation and involvement.  I would go as far as to say that any future treaties in the Community should involve referenda in all member states so that the people of Europe build the union rather than the politicians and officials of the day.</P>
      <P>The Protocol which relates to Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution was inserted without the knowledge of this House and the people.  We are all aware of the continuing problems, which will not be solved before November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, was the original campaigner for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee. He has been very encouraged by the Government's favourable response and welcomes the proposal by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to establish such a committee.  Deputy Higgins has highlighted over many years the very valuable contributions a committee of this kind can make to our foreign policy.  It will involve all the Members of the Oireachtas in foreign policy-making, engage the public interest and enhance the accountability of Irish foreign policy. The establishment of this committee will <Col N="1723" /> also bring Ireland in line with its European partners, who already have a highly developed foreign policy committee process in their national parliaments.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the Foreign Affairs Committee will be able to continue their work even when the Dáil is not in session, thereby ensuring that an Irish viewpoint will evolve in these times of rapid international developments.  The committee will engage themselves in such international issues as the needed task of shifting resources from disarmament to the neglected policy of development aid, regional conflict, and issues before the United Nations.  It will give Ireland the opportunity to develop and stamp its very individual foreign policy on international affairs.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that this committee must be totally separate from the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which itself should become a European Affairs Committee. In order for both committees to operate effectively, it is imperative that they receive adequate staff, strong terms of reference, and proper research and back-up facilities.  The Labour Party maintain that this committee's terms of reference should allow for the involvement and participation of non-governmental organisations and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>This Government have continued to renege on their commitment to Official Development Aid to Third World countries. What are we, as a nation, doing to get on course with the UN target of 0.70 per cent of GNP?  Earlier, the Minister informed us that we will provide 0.17 per cent of GNP in the current year.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Estimates before the House today that the Government have no intention of even attempting to reach the UN target.  The Estimates appear to contradict the promise made in the revised Programme for Government of planned increases in ODA, 1992 to 1994, so as to achieve a higher ODA-GNP contribution by the end of that period.  The Estimates today will do <Col N="1724" /> nothing to lift Ireland from the bottom of the league of official aid donors.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the Government have made a commitment to undertake a planned programme of increases in Ireland's official development aid in the next two years so as to achieve a higher ODA-GNP contribution by the end of 1994.  This commitment appears to be another Government aspiration rather than Government policy.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, spoke of wanting to see Ireland pay its way towards alleviating poverty, famine and disease in the Third World, stating that &ldquo;as a Government, we have not been giving as much as we might have been ... our own problems at home do not absolve us from contributing to the betterment of humanity as a whole&rdquo;.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, has had ample opportunity to demonstrate his commitment towards the poor of the Third World, particularly in the face of the new and worsening famine facing Africa.</P>
    <P>The worst drought in 50 years is threatening 23 million people with starvation in the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa. The situation is critical in a host of African countries.  It is imperative that the world community responds immediately to the crisis with substantial food aid. There is every likelihood that millions of people will die of starvation in the coming months in the affected countries.  Ireland must respond to this cry for help &mdash; by restoring our ODA to at least its 1986 level of 0.25 per cent, with subsequent annual increases every year thereafter, sufficient to attain the 0.70 per cent GNP, the UN target by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition was responsible for the shameful abolition of the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation late last year.  This organisation played an important role in advising the Government on aid to developing countries, and kept vital contact with aid workers in the field. This organisation consisted of 19 members who were all volunteers.  They had the services of an executive secretary <Col N="1725" /> who doubled as an administrator and researcher; the total cost of the council was £84,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The advice which the council offered was the only independent advice as to why and how the State's contribution should be spent.  They were also among the most informed critics of the increasing meanness of this Government's contribution which has never reached even half of the UN target.  This is a record which flies in the face of official posturing and the public's generous responses to the appeals of voluntary or non-governmental agencies.  Political leaders often claim affinity with other post-colonial states; Ministers and officials are constantly reminding the European Community's most powerful states of their obligations to the EC's less prosperous members; our former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, was among the world's leaders who endorsed the UN pledge on children: &ldquo;to build a world that will guard the precious resources of the human race&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we examine the balance sheet on human development in the developing countries the scale of the problem faced by the world community becomes very clear.  Some 10 million children and young adults and 14 million others die each year, most from preventable diseases; 1.5 billion people still lack basic health care; over 1.5 million people do not have safe water and over 2 billion lack safe sanitation; one-fifth of the population still go hungry every day; over 1 billion adults are still illiterate, and 300 million children are not in primary or secondary schools.  More than a billion people still live in absolute poverty. Income per head has declined over the last decade in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.  Over 14 million children die each year before reaching their fifth birthday, 180 million children under the age of five years suffer from serious malnutrition. Half of rural women over the age of 15 years are illiterate.  Women are often denied the right to decide whether or when to have children.  Half a million women die each year from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.  Women are often effectively denied the right to own, <Col N="1726" /> inherit or control property.  Only 44 per cent of the rural population have access to basic health care.  There are 2.4 people per habitable room, three times the average in the north or in the southern part of the world.  One in five urban dwellers live in the nation's largest cities.  The problem is huge and expansive.  There is no time to wait.  The time for our contribution is now.  As our spokesman has always said in this House, we need to move down the road of reaching the UN target by making a worthwhile contribution to the terrible problems which face this planet rather than paying lip service and making a meagre contribution.</P>
    <P>President Robinson, during her tour of the US last year, spoke of the world's poor as invisible people whose fate is in the hands of others &mdash; leaders of the developed world.  Ireland is among the developed States; its income per head is 34 times that of other countries &mdash; the invisible people &mdash; to whom it gives aid as a priority.  These four countries were mentioned by the Minister.  It is a contrast to which the advisory council has occasionally drawn attention.</P>
    <P>The Government, when pushed in this House on the reasons for the Council's abolition, stated that the decision to abolish the council was taken in the context of the need to find savings in all areas of public expenditure.  In the face of the list of deprivation which I have presented to the House this seems an extraordinary and mean-minded decision.  Ireland should play a greater role in world affairs. Issues such as security must be defined and broadened to include not only European interests but global interests.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that the North-South contrast will dominate world politics over the next several decades. The Western world cannot continue to ignore the deprivation that exists in Third World countries.  The whole area of aid, trade and debt have to be reconstructed to let the population of the planet live.</P>
    <P>At the conference in Rio on Environment and Development, Ireland should distance itself from the US position <Col N="1727" /> that has blocked conventions on carbon dioxide emissions, the ozone layer, deforestation, indigenous people and, above all, controlling the polluting multinationals.</P>
    <P>Ireland can play a unique role in ensuring a more equitable role for developing nations.  However, this can only come about with the right will and commitment from the Government, and the Government appear to be devoid of that will.</P>
    <P>In the week that is in it, Maastricht obviously dominates the foreign affairs agenda.  There is great confusion this week because of the decision of the Danish people to reject the Maastricht Treaty.  There has been a great deal of emphasis on the differences between Ireland and Denmark.  However, I believe we should emphasise the similarities that exist.  We are both small countries on the periphery of Europe and we are both independent and democratic states.  It should not be forgotten that Denmark has proved to be an important ally to Ireland in the past during contentious European debates.  We may not agree with their decision but it is a decision that was democratically arrived at.  If roles were reversed and Ireland had opted not to ratify the Maastricht Treaty we would have looked to countries such as Denmark to help find a way of accommodating us in the position we found ourselves in.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party remain committed to the principle of European Union.  We realise that European Union provides potential and we see our role are as working to ensure that jobs and rights are brought to the top of the European agenda.  We see European Union and integration as a means to bring about greater prosperity. However, greater prosperity is, in itself, not enough.  It must go hand in hand with fairer distribution particularly in relation to the regions and communities of Europe.  Europe must bring employment to the top of its agenda.  That is the position the Labour Party will continue to pursue.</P>
    <P>The Government's refusal to postpone the referendum, which is to take place <Col N="1728" /> on 18 June amid the basic lack of clarity and confusion of the moment, has put the people of Ireland in an extremely difficult position.  We must ask ourselves whether a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June will have much more real effect than simply stating our commitment to European Union and ratifying the Treaty on another day.  Can the Maastricht Treaty come into full effect on 1 January 1993?  Can the Cohesion Fund, and the increased Structural Funds, be guaranteed?  I believe we have no choice other than to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on 18 June.  A &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote by Ireland will only add to what is already a major crisis.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me refer to neutrality which is of great concern to the Labour Party.  The Labour Party look to increased union in the years ahead and certainly post-1996 when the next Intergovernmental Conference is to take place.  We look to the countries that wish to join the European Union such as Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and Finland which are all neutral countries.  We see it as in the interests of Ireland that a neutral bloc would develop inside the Community and our vision of neutrality would become part of a more influential development inside the Community.  We take the point that the veto which exists will protect us and that we may or may not be voting post-1996 for a common defence policy.</P>
    <P>The Confusion about the Maastricht Treaty has been caused by the Government's decision to go ahead on 18 June when there is the possibility of postponing the referendum until such time as the whole position will have become clear.  Now that we are faced with the holding of the referendum we cannot do other than support a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  Unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated greatly in recent days and we await clarification from the Minister on what is the exact status of the Treaty and how and when it can be finally ratified.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much.  I am glad there are speakers on the other side of the House in this debate. I am very happy to be facing the Minister on this subject.  He may recall that more than 20 years ago when he was Government Chief Whip he approached me to ask me whether I would speak in an Adjournment Debate in this House before Christmas on the European Community and our approaching membership. I said that I would have a lot to say against the Government of the time but that perhaps at the end of my contribution I would be able to say something. With some assistance from him, I was able to continue on that occasion and to speak about the EC.  I hope that the Minister has the same happy memories of that close collaboration on the question of joining the Community as I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that this is a restricted debate. There are many issues related to foreign affairs that I should like to raise, including, of course, Northern Ireland.  I shall confine myself to one issue, the presentation in the next fortnight of the case <Col N="1731" /> for continued membership of the Community. There are arguments that need to be made but have not been made.  I appeal to the Minister and his party to address the subject from a broader base than they have done heretofore.</P>
    <P>I shall leave aside the damage done by the introduction of the totally irrelevant abortion issue into the debate by the Protocol, which has created two fresh &ldquo;anti&rdquo; lobbies in the debate on membership.</P>
    <P>On the issue of neutrality, the Government are being absolutely defensive.  The Minister's speech was itself utterly defensive.  The crucial fact is that if the Treaty is ratified we will have the opportunity in the next couple of years to make an input into the future evolution of a possible defence policy, which we can decide upon &mdash; for or against &mdash; in due course.  We could not make that input without ratification of the Treaty.  There are like-minded countries within the Community and there are other countries seeking to join the Community that will also make an input into that debate.  If we are allowed by our people by way of referendum, I should hope that between us we could help to transform and modify fundamentally the present approaches of some European states to defence issues and work towards the reshaping of the European defence concept into something to be carried out as a regional function of the United Nations, something devoted to peacemaking, peacekeeping, non-proliferation and disarmament. Agreement in the referendum would give us an opportunity to make that input together with others who share similar views.  This is the positive issue &mdash; the chance for the first time to be able to make such a contribution without committing ourselves until we know the result of that debate.  The point that has been missed in the discussion to date is that there is no commitment in the Treaty to defence but rather an opportunity is provided to contribute positively to the debate on defence.  I should like the Minister and others to present the case to the people in those terms.</P>
    <P>In this contribution I wish to concentrate <Col N="1732" /> mainly on the economic side of the debate on ratification.  I hope that in the next fortnight we will not waste too much time talking about the hoped-for £6 billion in Structural Funds.  At the meetings I have attended that aspect has emerged as a very negative factor &mdash; a kind of bribe to the Irish people, and one that does not convince people.  That is a negative approach and it is a great mistake. I am not denouncing or decrying those funds, they are important.  At present Ireland gets £3 billion over five years.  There is a possibility of increasing that funding by a further £3 billion but realistically, we should not pretend that a doubling of the funds is certain, because it is not.  It may not happen because the Commission request may not be fully met by member governments, and even if it were, the exceptionally high <i>per capita</i> grants we now get may not be maintained in the second £3 billion.  We cannot therefore assume that a full doubling of the funds to Ireland will take place.  The only completely new element is the Cohesion Fund, which is no more than £500,000 to £750,000.</P>
    <P>We should not exaggerate the issue of funding because by exaggerating the case one would only hand ammunition to those who oppose ratification.  Funding is not the crucial issue.  It is helpful; for example, if Ireland were to get £2 billion extra that could, as extrapolation from the calculations of the Economic and Social Research Institute shows, add some 1.8 per cent to our GNP by the year 2000.  That is not to be sneezed at and I am all for it.  However, it is not the crucial issue.</P>
    <P>Today I should like to put the real case, which has not yet been put and which we have less than two weeks left to put.  The real issue is the impact &mdash; positive if we join and negative if we say &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash; on Irish economic development arising from the opportunity provided by ratification of the Treaty to release a capacity for growth that this country has and about which nothing has been said in this House so far, for reasons I cannot fathom.  That capacity for growth is held up at present by virtue of our artificially high level of <Col N="1733" /> interest rates.  I think the Minister would not disagree with me in my suggestion at Irish interest rates today are some 3 per cent higher than they need to be by virtue of the fact that, in the absense of Economic and Monetary Union, we are tied to following German policy, policy paying for reunification without raising taxes that has pushed up interest rates in Germany and also dragged them up in Ireland.  A 3 per cent higher than necessary rate of interest rates is very negative indeed for a country with Ireland's level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is no single element in the economic scene more vital to economic growth than that of interest rates.  The ESRI report on the role of the Structural Funds predicts what would happen if domestic real interest rates fell by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent due to European Monetary Union.  At this stage, I believe that European Monetary Union could result in a decrease of twice that amount, and I do not think the Minister would contradict me on that.  It is predicted that the biggest impact would be in public finances; a reduction in borrowing and debt would allow for a substantial reduction in taxation or an increase in spending in the medium term. By sharing the benefits of the reduction in the public finance constraint with the private sector in that way a major increase of 10 to 15 per cent in industrial output would result in the long run.  With the current 3 per cent margin, the result could well be double that.</P>
    <P>That opportunity is available to Ireland at present if we go through with European Monetary Union and get the right policies operating; not policies that are operated by one country for its benefit but policies followed in the interests of Europe as a whole.  Our interests rates would not then be held up artificially because of the natural self-interest attitudes of particular countries.  The Treaty came about because of the idea of European Monetary Union and the possible benefits that it would bring.  Everything else in the Treaty is contingent on that objective and derives from it.  However, that case has not yet been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> What is the other side of the argument? In the few moments remaining to me I should like to consider what might happen if the Treaty is not ratified.  I should like the Government to come clean and tell people what is contained in the Central Bank bulletin, that every penny of the £4 billion borrowed by this Government since 1987 in domestic borrowings has come from outside this State, and almost all of it from Germany.  That borrowing does not involve foreign loans for fixed periods that we repay at our pace and when the time is up; it involves foreign contributions to our domestic debt.  Nothing has come from this country; over that period we have subscribed nothing in net terms to the increase in domestic debt &mdash; anything that we have subscribed has been sold off again.  The sum of £4 billion to which I have referred could be taken away tomorrow because at any moment those lenders, if they lost confidence in this country, in our commitment to Europe, the Maastricht Treaty and European Monetary Union, could withdraw their money.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of today summarises Mr. Paul Tansey's study on European Monetary Union.  It states:</P>
    <P>Rejecting the treaty would make Ireland less attractive as a location for overseas investment, the study says, and would put upward pressure on interest rates.  Foreign holders of Irish Government debt would reassess their portfolios.  &ldquo;A sharp, immediate rise in Irish interest rates might be sufficient to stem the outflow; equally it might not.&rdquo;  This could cause severe dislocation to the economy, it says.</P>
    <P>The report, when talking about Irish Government debt, does not mention the £4 billion, which is the figure involved.  A withdrawal of £4 billion would certainly cause severe dislocation to the economy. Where would we get that kind of money? What interest rates would we have to pay in this country to get hold of that money? And on the other hand, what would we have to pay abroad in foreign borrowings to get any significant part of that money overnight?  That is the kind of <Col N="1735" /> consequences we should be considering in relation to non-ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The reverse side of the coin is that if we do ratify the Treaty we will have the opportunity to get away from an artificial level of interest rates that is holding up the development of this country.  That is what ratification is about.  Why do the Government not say that?  In all of the speeches made the hoped-for £6 billion is trotted out: that is a phoney figure; at most, the funding would be £2 billion extra.  There is no mention of the real issues.</P>

Growth of 6 per cent would enable the creation of an extra 30,000 jobs a year.  There is hardly a mention of those extra jobs in any of the newspapers; a matter that should be headline news everywhere because of the possibilities open to this country is accorded only a tiny paragraph.  That possibility exists because our balance of payments surplus is the largest in the industrialised world in relation to GDP, we have no constraints on growth and we could expand our domestic economy.  If the Government had not made a mess of their budget we could do that fiscally, but that cannot be done because the past few budgets have been so badly mismanaged that there is no leeway by which taxes may be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of contributing to the debate on this Estimate.  It is significant that I speak after my immediate predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs on an Estimate in regard to which he probably had a more challenging role than any previous Minister had to face.  It is challenging in view of the complexities and, indeed, the opportunities; a Minister or Department can only give a direction on the basis of the commitment and feeling of the Irish people.  A Government can signal to Governments in Europe and elsewhere their political will, the rest of us who have a responsibility as representatives or citizens must give our Government the opportunity of doing just that, particularly at this complex and difficult time for Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former Minister I should like to say that the opportunity which has arisen for us in terms of the political signal to Europe and its people on 18 June is unique.  Of course there is a critical situation in Europe now as a consequence of the constitutional and legal complexities arising from the Danish referendum which will not be resolved overnight.  Clearly, the focus is on Ireland and it is an opportunity to signal what was rarely, if ever, in doubt &mdash; that our commitment as a proud, independent nation to cohesion among other proud, independent nations is now stronger. That is why it is very important that the signals we give on 18 June will strengthen our role in Europe.  I suppose that never before did Europe look to Ireland for a reinvigoration and renewal of commitment; we all had our responsibilities at various stages in the seventies.  I have <Col N="1737" /> been at meetings of Council of Ministers in various roles; I think I served on five councils since 1972.  This is an opportunity which places a unique obligation on us and that is why &mdash; regardless of the legal, constitutional issues &mdash; we must signal to our partners in Europe that our commitment is total.  Why?  I agree with some of the views expressed by Deputy Garret FitzGerald; indeed I expressed them some months ago.  The case is so strong for our continued involvement and even greater commitment that we should not weaken it by overstating what we do not need to overstate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also said that in overstating our case we would not put impossible pressure on the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I hope that the Commission will approve a significant increase in Structural Funds, approval which, incidentally, is not part of the Maastricht Treaty.  It is part of the ongoing development of the Community which, of course, would be further enhanced in the European Union.  However, we are dealing with 11 other member states with whom we will have to compete for a share of the funds.  We should not give hostages to fortune as we can have a common cause on that issue.  It would be unreasonable to expect any Minister for Foreign Affairs to deliver £6 billion from the Community within a prescribed time-scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had a very constant interest in and commitment to Ireland in Europe and it is significant that he has focused on the benign and positive influence which we can have in Europe in bringing about a resolution of the problems facing us in regard to our island.  I am glad the Minister is maintaining this focus.  I served as Minister for Agriculture and as Minister for Finance and I always found that what we had in common at European Councils was so self-evident that the advancement of our common interests, without any political overtone or overstatements, was probably the strongest bridge we could build <Col N="1738" /> on this island.  Nobody could object to advancing a common cause for Irish farmers, North and South, not even if they were of the deepest Unionist hue of the Ulster Farmers' Union.  How could they object to advancing a common cause for regional structural developments, North and South?  How could they tell their people that they did not want an increase in the social funds for people, North or South?  They cannot and that kind of common purpose will be the bridge which will achieve a number of our fundamental aims at the same time; among those aims is the reconciliation and unification of our people in a European context.  The risk of losing that is too awful to contemplate.</P>
    <P>Difficulties must be faced in regard to common European currency, notably in Germany.  We must acknowledge that there is a certain amount of rethinking in this regard in Germany because of their political priorities; we should not pretend that is not happening.  The same applies to France.  I was not enthusiastic about President Mitterrand's suggestion that they should have a referendum when they are not constitutionally required to do so.  We should all act on our own constitutional obligations.  However, nothing is ever fixed and immutable in regard to any political position, never mind on one island.  If we are constant in our commitment, our position will be strong and respected.  I accept that the legal and constitutional position as a consequence of the Danish referendum is very different now from the one which pertained one week ago and anyone who says otherwise is ignoring constitutional reality, European and otherwise.  I acknowledge that if we have to take a second legal step later, not because of our lack of will but because of what has happened in Europe, we must be prepared to do so.  Of course the European Union Treaty is not as binding as it would have been if the Danish referendum had gone the other way.  In any event it would not have come into effect until &mdash; at the earliest &mdash; 1 January 1993.  We must remember that the Treaty was built on existing treaties agreed by 12 member states and, therefore, <Col N="1739" /> we cannot say that we should kick the Danes out.  They are part of the foundation of Europe under the existing Community and we must find a political way of accommodating them.  No doubt, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was trying yesterday to find a political consensus which will enable us at a later stage to put firmly in place a treaty which the European people want.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about economists or enterprise.  The Treaty will mean nothing unless it positively enhances the lives and opportunities of individuals in all members states who are having difficulties. Mobile people who do not have a permanent place to live have a right to settle, those who do not have permanent jobs &mdash; we know about that &mdash; have a right to employment.  The opportunities for Ireland in a European Union will be considerable.  I am glad to say that our young people, who have unique qualifications, have adopted a European attitude and are no longer caught in a narrow Anglo-American tunnel.  Like our youngsters, we are truly European.  I have a 15-year old daughter in European at present and she does not consider herself to be anything other than an Irish person in Europe.  Our young people will have immense opportunities in a European Union and the contribution they will make, provided we renew our commitment, could be enormous.  That is the reason I am glad to have this opportunity to support the policies the Government have been pursuing during the past few critical weeks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not know what I am about to say.  I wish to refer to the position taken by the Minister yesterday at the meeting of EC Foreign Ministers in Oslo.  He said the unanimous conclusion was that the other 11 member states should proceed with the ratification of the Treaty despite the decision of the Danish people.  It seems since the Danish people made their decision that there is a conspiracy, involving the EC Foreign mission and the other member states, to frustrate the democratic decision of the people of Denmark.  The strategy adopted by the meeting yesterday, which clearly has been endorsed by the Minister, is to ignore the legal reality that the Treaty signed at Maastricht on 7 February is now null and void.  The strategy is to press ahead as if nothing had happened, to go through a phoney form of ratification in the other member states, including Ireland, and to then go back and put a political and economic gun to the heads of the Danish people and say that they should ratify or else.</P>
      <P>Where did the Minister get his mandate from to side with President Mitterrand, Chancellor Kohl and Commission President Delors in their attempts to frustrate the democratic decision of the Danish people?  Surely, the proper thing for the Minister to do, as a Minister of another small state, was to express sympathy and understanding for the position of Denmark and urge the Community to address the issues and concern behind the Danish &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote, especially since this State has not yet made a decision to ratify the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that Denmark is considered to be a soft target because it is a small country.  Does anyone seriously believe that if the French vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in their referendum the Council of Foreign Ministers will meet two days later and decide to proceed regardless?  Does anyone believe that if the French vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; EC diplomats will say that France will be left in a slow lane and that the others will <Col N="1741" /> move to the EC fast track?  The Minister knows as well as I that if this were to happen all the energies of the Community would be put into an effort to find a solution to the French problems.</P>
    <P>Following the Danish experience, I believe that many Irish people are rethinking their positions and now realise that the fundamental question involved in the Maastricht Treaty is a democratic one.  If there is such little respect for the democratic expression of the view of the Danish people what hope can we have that the many new powers provided under the Maastricht Treaty for Community institutions and which are not subject to any element of democratic accountability will not be abused?</P>
    <P>If the member states decide to go ahead with the Maastricht Treaty without Denmark it will be the end of the European ideal and raise serious questions about the rights of the smaller member states within the European Community. From the very beginning, from the signing of the Treaty of Rome, a fundamental principle of the Community was that it could only move on to the next stage of development if and when all member states agreed to the proposal.  This applied equally to all states, big and small, and was an important safeguard for the interests of the smaller states.</P>
    <P>If, as it now seems from the response to the Danish vote, this principle has been discarded then the implications for the smaller states, such as Ireland, are frightening.  I am appalled at the response of the Commission and the member states to the democratic decision of the Danish people.  Instead of making an attempt to address the legitimate concerns felt by the Danish people the response has been arrogant and threatening. The larger member states, especially Germany and France, have responded like imperial powers of old rather than what are supposed to be partners in a family of states.  I am ashamed that our Government should be siding with the Euro-bullies rather than with the people of Denmark.</P>
    <P>The commentators have been busy trying to convince the public that there <Col N="1742" /> are no similarities between the Danish situation and the Irish referendum.  While there are many factors in the Danish referendum which are not issues in Ireland there are areas of common concern. The drift towards the militarisation of the Community was a major factor in the Danish vote as was the lack of any element of democratic accountability over many of the new powers provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.  These will be major factors in determining the way in which Irish people will vote but there is an even greater commonality of interests between the two countries.  We are both smaller member states and we should stand together to prevent the larger countries from being able to dictate the course of events in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is an important lesson to be learned from the Danish experience.  We have been told by the Taoiseach that the Irish people will be consulted again in 1996 before the Community enters into any definite defence agreement but let us suppose that Ireland ratifies the Maastricht Treaty and votes &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any defence arrangements in 1996 would we then face threats and intimidation similar to those now being directed at Denmark? Would we be threatened with virtual exclusion and left behind?  The Danish experience would seem to suggest that we would.</P>
    <P>The Danish experience, and its aftermath, raises serious questions about the way decisions will be made in a European Union and the contempt being shown for the opinions of ordinary citizens in the European Community.  It is interesting to note that the Danish people, the only country in which a referendum has been held to date, are almost being treated as if they were wayward children for taking this decision.</P>
    <P>Many forces are now coming together to pressurise the Irish people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  However, it is encouraging that the Danish referendum has produced a response from citizens throughout Europe &mdash; this has been reflected in the opinion poll in Holland &mdash; in that they are now demanding that they be given a say with regard to the European Union <Col N="1743" /> that is to be constructed.  If there is a lesson to be learned from the disintegration of super powers and the difficulties which have arisen during the past few years it is that one cannot impose political and economic structures on people without first letting them know what they will be and without giving them a say in how they will be developed.</P>
    <P>In that context, I agree with what Deputy O'Shea said in relation to the formation of the proposed foreign affairs committee.  It would be a mistake to have one committee to deal with the entire range of foreign affairs and European issues.  There is a need to have two separate committees, a foreign affairs committee that will deal with the generality of foreign affairs issues and a European affairs committee.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available I would like to make a brief comment on overseas development aid and on what the Minister had to say in regard to it.  This is the second or third time there has been reference here to some kind of general commitment to increasing our level of overseas development aid by the end of 1994 but, so far, we have not seen any specifics spelled out in that respect.  It is interesting to note that the level of ODA provided for in this Estimate, at 0.17 per cent of GNP, is the lowest for over ten years.  For example, in 1981 it was slightly higher at 0.18 per cent, eventually rising to 0.25 per cent in 1986, and has been decreasing ever since.  That is most regrettable, particularly in a week in which Heads of State meet in Rio de Janeiro in an effort to address the critical issues of development, the environment, the North-South divide.  This country should be in a position now to spell out in some greater detail what exactly and how exactly it is proposed to increase the level of overseas development aid, something for which I predict there would be widespread support nationwide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pick up where Deputy Gilmore left off in relation <Col N="1744" /> to overseas development aid.  I might point out that this year we are giving £43 million.  While that may represent only 0.17 per cent of our GNP nevertheless it is £43 million we can ill spare bearing in mind our own problems.  Nonetheless we are giving it.  Indeed I might point out that that does not take into account the millions of pounds Irish citizens donate out of their pockets annually to foreign aid and charities, I have often said here that probably we are one of the most generous nations on earth when it comes to giving to charitable causes.  I make no apology for so saying.  Of course we would all love to see the figures for overseas development aid doubled.  It would be our hope that we will see the day we can afford to do so.</P>
      <P>With all due respect to Deputy Gilmore and his party, I have to say that he is a member of a party which for years supported all the totalitarian states in Eastern Europe, all those totalitarian regimes such as the Stasi in East Germany&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy can deny it if he likes but people know it to be the truth.  We know exactly where their support came from, from Stalinist regimes wherever, countries in which there was no free speech, no rights to referenda and so on.</P>
      <P>I should first like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I have no doubt but that he will fill that office with distinction as have so many of his predecessors and wish him well in the difficult days ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Taoiseach in particular on having maintained a cool head when all about him were losing theirs in the immediate aftermath of the Danish referendum.  As he told the House, there is plenty of time for debate; <Col N="1745" /> there will be a day to debate it next week, after the Foreign Ministers will have met, when there will be something about which to talk.  The wisdom of that approach will be seen.</P>
    <P>I should also like to place on record that I have the utmost confidence in our electorate doing the right thing in the referendum on 18 June by voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I am certain that the Taoiseach's chest will swell with pride at this nation when he faces the other Heads of State in Europe, showing the massive &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote by our electorate, and not merely because of the benefits to be derived, as has been said by many people.  Of course, we are entitled to inform the people of the benefits of the Treaty on European Union but there is also our commitment to Europe.  Throughout the history of this little nation we have made a huge contribution to Europe to which we are always very proud to refer whenever we address others worldwide.  I am confident that we will continue that tradition.</P>
    <P>As I said to somebody recently, were our electorate to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; by a majority in the referendum on 18 June, it would be like all of the anti-Irish jokes ever made coming true; we would be the laughing stock of Europe.  One cannot compare Denmark with Ireland.  For example, by next year Denmark will have been a net contributor to the EC, whereas we are a six-to-one beneficiary of the European Community.  Does anybody think for a moment that the remainder of Europe would cry tears if we said &ldquo;No, we will not join you&rdquo;?  As I said to some university students not so long ago, the matter might remain on the table for a minute or two but then the remaining ten member states should begin discussing the Treaty that was, drawing up a new one on the same terms as the previous one, and excluding Ireland and Denmark.  Denmark have taken their decision, a sad one, particularly when it was only a matter of some 50,000 votes or so.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in particular disappointed me in this debate.  Since I became a Member of this House in 1965 I have yet to see a Leader of the Labour <Col N="1746" /> Party who is more cowardly than Deputy Spring in the manner in which he has treated this debate.  The Labour Party purport to represent the workers of Ireland.  In fact Fianna Fáil do and always have done so.  However, here is a Member of this House who is aware that there are over 1,000 companies manufacturing products for export to European and other markets.  Does he think for a moment that those 1,000 companies, employing in excess of 100,000 of our people will remain here?  If the electorate were to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; on 18 June the IDA could close their doors and go into recess, certainly after the end of this year.  Who will dicuss establishing industries here if we vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  While I might have expected such an attitude on the part of the new Democratic Left, as they call themselves, I should have expected more of the Labour Party and particularly of their Leader, Deputy Spring, all the more so since all of the trade unions here support a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote. I am thoroughly disappointed.  While we may argue various policies and points of politics, this is something which will be absolutely fundamental to the future lives of our people.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with a union of European States.  We can see what is threatening in East Europe, with wars here and there over the next ten or 15 years.  God knows how many tragedies there will be in the homes of so many people.  We are already witnessing the development of a huge refugee problem which will have to be dealt with by Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe Ireland is capable of contributing to security matters affecting us all.  When I say &ldquo;security matters&rdquo; I am thinking of matters such as drug trafficking, terrorists crossing country boundaries, racketeering or whatever, which is what the security aspect of this Treaty on European Union is about; the defence part will come later.  Members of this House know that.  In 1996, if we are to enter into a defence arrangement, there will be a referendum held here when I have no doubt that the same people who now scream &ldquo;no&rdquo;, who <Col N="1747" /> screamed against us joining the EC in 1972, will be doing the same thing.  I call them the &ldquo;flat earth society&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with Ireland playing its part in a defence arrangement &mdash; that is my personal view &mdash; in that we are a sovereign nation and can decide what we want to do, which alliances we want to join; it is not being done for us; we are no longer tied to Britain.  Somebody referred to the time when our ties with Britain were greater, when our currency was tied to sterling. Britain operated a cheap food policy which did not benefit this country very much.  I contend the day we broke the link with sterling was one of the finest for us.  We are a proud nation and can afford to be proud.  From speaking to other members of the European Parliament, I know they envy the manner in which we run our country, the welfare provisions for our people, in many instances our schemes being much better than those in many other European countries.  Therefore, we have nothing for which to apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question will arise continuously about defence within the European context. That matter will be put to the people when the time comes and they will decide.  We have nothing of which to be afraid.  As far as I am aware, Fianna Fáil have never misguided our people whether in relation to Europe or any other matter.  It is my belief that the advice now being given is correct.  I estimate that at least 150 of the 166 members of this House fully support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.  In Denmark, although in excess of 75 per cent of the elected representatives were in favour of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, the people decided to vote otherwise even though they did not have access to all the information which the parliamentarians and members of Government had.  I felt sorry for the Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister as I can appreciate how this decision will <Col N="1748" /> affect them.  Indeed, if we made a similar decision an economic depression, like we have never seen before, would hit us. That is not a threat, it is a fact and we have a responsibility to state the facts.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress the importance of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty.  I may not have the opportunity to contribute to the debate next Tuesday so I take this opportunity to ask the people to trust me and vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I have been a Member of this House for the past 27 years and I know it is the right thing to do.  The Fine Gael Party and some members of the Labour Party agree with us on the benefits that we can gain in an integrated Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are inclined to romanticise the importance of our role in foreign affairs. When we, a small nation, were living under the shadow of our very powerful neighbour we were inclined to have a romantic view of our own importance. By virtue of our geographic location we were dependent on our nearest neighbour and luckily they were prepared to trade with us, but they did some other things.  Later, on the basis of the available information, we took a decision to join the European Community but, unfortunately, many people, including some Members of this House, still see Ireland as an outcrop on the European shelf and as a peripheral region on the continent shelf.  It is fine to make the case that we need moneys from the Structural Funds because of our peripheral location but that should not become a way of life.  We need to be more positive and think of ourselves as Europeans.  We should demand to be given the same opportunities as other people in Europe.  While we have been successful in getting moneys from the Structural Funds to develop our infrastructure we have been far too ready to accept the pay off as the next best thing to bring our standard of living up to the European average. <Col N="1749" /> Unfortunately this has become a way of life.  We are accepted as Europeans even though this is at some considerable expense to some EC member states.  We have been accepted as full Europeans capable of playing a meaningful role in Europe, a point the Minister dwelt on in his speech.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to do anything to jeopardise the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June and I do not wish to engage in scaremongering but from my experience over the past 11 years as a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC, and from talking to the people associated with that committee whom I had the pleasure of meeting at home and in Europe it would appear that a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would slow down the progress towards European Union.  The ideals of Monet, Schuman and Adenauer would be dimmed for a period and the consequences would be worse if any other member state decided on a similar course of action because our greatest fear would be realised, the development of a two speed Europe in which we could easily find ourselves in the slow lane. That would be to the advantage of countries who have applied or wish to apply for membership of the Community and to our detriment.</P>
    <P>I noted what the Minister said and I congratulate him on his remarks.  I ask him to ensure that, in co-operation with the other parties in the House, the positive elements of our continued relationship with the European Community are stressed.  I respect the views of those who have reservations; indeed, I have reservations about one aspect which I will deal with later but it is not neutrality.</P>
    <P>I am greatly worried about the amount of misinformation on the Maastricht Treaty that has been published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no foundation for it.  There are claims that our sons and daughters will be conscripted and die on battlefields in Europe but this has nothing to do with the Treaty.  Indeed, it is severely damaging to the referendum on 18 <Col N="1750" /> June.  I cannot understand why massive amounts of money are being spent on publishing information that has no basis in fact.  We need to look at this, but I am not suggesting that we should have a public inquiry into it.  I recently saw a leaflet issued by Youth Against Maastricht which contains six or seven misleading statements which are severely damaging to the prospects for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  The information in this leaflet is clearly calculated to confuse young people who may not have had the opportunity to fully brief themselves on the Treaty.</P>
      <P>I am not as optimistic as other people inside and outside this House that the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will be carried.  The reason is that diverse groups in our society are totally opposed to the Treaty for different reasons.  Some reasons are genuine, others are groundless but for whatever reason they are combined in their opposition to the Treaty.  However, I hope that between now and 18 June those who are committed to a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will succeed in getting their message across a little better.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that our unemployment level has increased because of various other changes.  This is the one area where we are at variance with our European colleagues, in having the highest unemployment level.  I ask the Minister to address this issue at the intergovernmental conferences.  As I said, we need equal opportunities.  Every man, woman and child in this country has the same right to employment as people in Germany, Holland and elsewhere.  It is up to us to put the necessary machinery in place &mdash; this can be done if we use the Structural Funds properly &mdash; to bring us closer to the centre of Europe, thereby getting the benefits which are rightly ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up a point made by Deputy Durkan.  I am mystified at the amount of misinformation which is being given out about the Maastricht Treaty.  The morning after the Danish Referendum I listened to a radio programme on 2FM presented by a man <Col N="1751" /> previously known as &ldquo;Lambo&rdquo;.  The amount of distortion and confusion which can be created by people who work for a public service broadcasting station amazes me.  However, I did not come into the House to speak about RTE and their odd way of operating.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with two issues, the first of which is outside the Maastricht Treaty. I sought to raise this on the Order of Business this morning but I did not succeed in doing so.  I am always conscious of the Chair's admonitions for Deputies to be in order.  I am in order now because this issue comes under the Foreign Affairs portfolio.  I believe all of us were happy last evening when Judith Ward walked out of Court 5 of the London Appeal Court into the sunlight on the arm of Annie Maguire, another friend of some of us here, with whom she had served a long number of years in Durham Prison.  After 18 long years Miss Ward's name had at last been cleared.  The judgment in the Ward case delivered by Justices Glidewell, Nolan and Steyn was forthright.  I have been critical of judgments previously delivered by Appeal Courts in England but I wish to make the point that this was a fine judgment, commendable in every way. It brings to an end an unfortunate and important part of the relations between this country and our nearest neighbour &mdash; the horrific series of miscarriages of justice which marred our relationships for a number of years.  While the judgment is welcome and commendable in every respect it does not bring to an end the injustice suffered by all of those involved in the Birmingham Six, Maguire Seven, Guilford Four and Ward cases. The 18 people involved, most of them Irish men and women, are now free. However, I question whether they are really free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall an evening he and I spent in the company of members of the Birmingham Six in Longlartin Prison many years ago.  Their case was coming to a conclusion at the time.  It was obvious, given the decision which had been made in the Guilford Four case, that they <Col N="1752" /> would be freed.  On that occassion one of the Birmingham Six spoke of the sense of estrangement he had from the world outside.  Today I listened to a radio broadcast during which they made the same point &mdash; they have had problems fitting back into society and relating to their families since they had been freed. During the interview one of them spoke about how he was a stranger to his children and grandchildren.  As Members of the House know, two of the marriages of the Birmingham Six which had lasted during the long time they were in prison have now ended.  The saddest part of the programme was when one of them spoke of the feeling he sometimes has of wishing to withdraw and simply close the doors behind him.</P>
    <P>After the judgment was delivered yesterday in Miss Ward's case, Miss Gareth Pierce, who has been a pillar of strength in all of these cases, called on the British authorities to make available to the 18 prisoners and their families the facilities at RAF Lynham which had been used to help British hostages and kidnap victims to readjust to freedom after years of incarceration.  I should like to repeat that call here and to suggest to the Minister, who has been such a champion of victims of injustice not just in Britain but also in this country, to use his good offices with the British authorities to ensure that these facilities are made available at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Most Members of this House share a common respect for Miss Pierce for the extraordinary work she has done and the extraordinary relationship she has established with these people.  She believes &mdash; she was speaking on behalf of the families &mdash; that these facilities would be of help to these people.  We should try to ensure that these facilities are made available.  I should make the point that while these facilities may be made available I can foresee a situation where some if not all of these former prisoners in question and their families may not wish to avail of treatment and assistance in institutions in Britain for a variety of understandable reasons.  If this is the case it will be incumbent on the Irish Government, together <Col N="1753" /> with the British Government, to see what can be done to assist these people.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises from these cases deserves some attention.  I am referring to the service we as a nation provide to Irish people living in Scotland, Wales and, in particular, England.  At present the support we give Irish citizens and citizens of Irish extraction living in the UK who are picked up under, for example, the PTA, an odious piece of legislation, comes from the Irish Embassy in London.  From time to time the small number of staff in the embassy have been criticised undeservedly.  They have given excellent service and their personal commitment has not always been recognised.  I recall one evening when the Minister and I drove around the north-west of England in the company of one of the staff of the embassy at a time when it was important for him to be in London with his family, but he gave his time freely.  He had been abused for not being available the previous week.</P>
    <P>I have long felt that the only way in which we can address the problems which arise from time to time is by creating or establishing some form of additional consular representation in some of the larger British cities, for example, Birmingham, Liverpool or Glasgow, where large numbers of Irish people live.  The Minister has always been a champion of the Irish in the UK.  I am confident that as Minister for Foreign Affairs he will do all that can be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>The issue which has exercised most minds during this debate is our Referendum and the result of the Danish Referendum.  I am absolutely mystified at the response of some opinion leaders in this country right across the board to the decision made by the Danish people. The Danish people made their democratic decision to reject the Maastricht Treaty on the basis of what they believed was the right thing for them.  This is a tragedy for Europe, and I believe it will be ultimately regarded as a tragedy for Denmark.  However, that is their business, not ours.</P>
    <P>People who last week would not have considered Danish attitudes as an <Col N="1754" /> example we should follow in any one of a whole range of social issues, least of all the Maastricht Referendum, are now trotting out their decision as a precedent. As I said, it was the entitlement of the Danes to make their decision in their own way.  I doubt very much if the Danes were conscious of what was being said in the Irish papers.  Therefore, I do not see why we should be so conscious of what was said in their papers.  I received a bizarre phone call from a person who I think would hold views which are far from the Danish viewpoint on many issues of social legislation arguing that we should follow the Danish precedent.  When I asked him if we should follow the Danish precedent in all matters he was silent and hung up.</P>
    <P>The reality is that we must make our decision on the basis of what is best for the Irish people.  Deputy Durkan, Deputy FitzGerald and several other Members have made the point that we should at long last have the self-confidence as a nation to face questions like this on the basis of what we believe is the right thing to do, first, for Ireland and, second, for Europe.  I ask those people who have conjured up bogeymen over the past few weeks and months, where will we go if, as Deputy Durkan said, we are relegated to the secondary track?  We should not delude ourselves that we are in any way significant or important in the context of the decisions to be made in regard to the European Union Treaty.  If we vote: &ldquo;no&rdquo; we will be left behind; that is the reality.  As has already been said, there are upwards of 1,000 multinational companies in this country.  They did not come here because of our sunshine or smiles but because we have good labour relations, many advantages as an industrial location and, above all, are within Europe.  What kind of message will we give these companies if we decide to go in the wrong direction on 18 June?  What will we be saying to the young people of this country?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said he has a young child who is Irish and European. I have four young children who see themselves as Irish and European.  One of the <Col N="1755" /> greatest joys of the young generation of Irish people is that they see themselves as European.  They understand what it means to be European and understand something of the dream of the people who founded the EC.  That dream was not based simply on economic advantage but on a Europe whose people would be at peace, where the extraordinary culture would combine and, in strength, would assist to create a new world order in which there would be peace.</P>
    <P>It is important that we get away from the pounds, shillings and pence of Europe.  It is important that we talk about what the principles mean in Europe.  It is worth reminding ourselves that we were the first nation after the Six to apply to join.  We made an application before the British, the Norwegians and the Danes. We made an application at a time when it was hard for us to make that decision but we did so because we were exercising a degree of self-confidence which we had not previously felt sufficiently strong to exercise.  I suggest that we exercise that same self-confidence yet again on 18 June.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EC we were aware that the Treaty of Rome did not stop at some form of trading bloc, at a customs union &mdash; it went beyond that.  The dream in the Treaty of Rome was that we would move towards economic and monetary union and, ultimately, towards political union.  That is the direction Europe will take irrespective of the decision we make on 18 June.  It is important that the Irish people hear clear and unambiguous statements on the two sides of the argument &mdash; I have always made that point &mdash; but many of the arguments that have been conjured up in recent days against a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum are, to say the least, disingenuous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not wish to pre-empt Tuesday's debate on the ill-fated Maastricht referendum in Denmark, I feel that I must respond to points the Minister made in his speech.  Unlike <Col N="1756" /> the Minister, I am extremely pleased with the result of the Danish referendum.  It is a prime example of people power &mdash; the triumph of the Danish people against the vast range of political opinion arrayed against them.</P>
      <P>The Minister was shedding crocodile tears when he said, &ldquo;while showing full understanding of the democratic decision of the Danish people, the 11 are determined to adhere to the ratification process&rdquo;. We are, therefore, aligning ourselves with the other countries in an effort to pressurise Denmark into changing their mind.  I appeal to the people of Ireland to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; on 18 June and to ensure that we retain the independence of decision-making which the Danish people have decided to keep.</P>
      <P>I would now like to turn to other aspects of foreign affairs which should not be over-shadowed by the Maastricht debate.  The Green Party &mdash; Comhaontas Glas &mdash; are concerned with the survival of our planet for future generations, as well as protecting inhabitants.  The need for world peace overrides national and commercial interests, and many of the present problems are caused by exploitation of people and physical resources. Ireland has become so closely tied to the western power bloc that it has lost some of its former good standing in the Third World, and has, therefore, been unable to fulfil its potential role as a conciliator between the developed and the non-developed countries.  A more independent foreign policy must be pursued in order to help achieve world peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's traditional neutrality has been merely military, and strong political ties with the West have led to increasing pressure to join a military alliance. Ireland can maintain neutrality only when supported by a policy of political neutrality.  Ireland's foreign policy should be based instead on the principle of constructive non-interference which will encourage co-operation between peoples for peaceful purposes.  It may be necessary at certain times to make exceptions <Col N="1757" /> to the above principles, but this shall only be done through the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The UN is intended to help resolve disputes by diplomacy rather than conflict. It is geographically centred upon developed countries and is funded primarily by the USA.  It should be physically dispersed and should be funded from a wider base.  The western nations have a stranglehold on the Security Council, which must be broken.  If a veto is to be permitted, it should be available to all countries.  The UN must assume a more positive role in the field of human rights, where surveillance work has, to date, been left almost entirely to voluntary bodies, such as Amnesty International.</P>
    <P>The EC is at present functioning inefficiently, at great cost to the environment, through the Common Agricultural Policy and a general preoccupation with trade, and to the Third World through tariff barriers. Present policies have been concerned with economic growth at all costs, and have done much to damage the self-reliance of small countries which are unable to compete on the open market. The future for European co-operation lies not in the present obsession with standardisation and increased trade, but in the improvement of intercultural communication, the promotion of a common response, where appropriate, to environmental problems, and the surveillance of human rights in member countries.</P>
    <P>The world consists of people with differing aims and ideals, but all depend on the same resources and share the same environment.  The challenge of conserving resources can be met only by international co-operation, including a large reduction in their consumption by the countries in the northern hemisphere.</P>
    <P>It is relevant at this stage to mention the Rio conference, the so-called World Summit, which is ill-fated to be a damp squib due to the failure of the United States, Japan and the EC to face up to the ecological consequences of this mad <Col N="1758" /> race for growth in which they are all engaged.  It is very sad to see this conference degenerate into yet another talking shop, with no real cutting edge and no real pressure to achieve anything in the way of international controls on COS emissions, CFCs and so on.</P>
    <P>International co-operation on intermediate level scientific and technical research, such as alternative energy sources and anti-pollution measures, must be stepped up and funding must be diverted from large projects such as space travel.  The Green Party aim to make Ireland self-sufficient, but in so far as this is not achieved, trade should be conducted on a non-exploitative and ecological basis, with due regard to economic sanctions agreed by the UN.  The present domination of international communications by the industrialised nations must be ended as a prerequisite to the elimination of cultural imperialism.  Esperanto should be promoted as the language of international communication.  The activities of multinational corporations must be controlled and forced to be more open with information.</P>
    <P>Once again, I am disappointed with the Minister when he speaks about overseas development aid, which still amounts to only 0.17 per cent of GNP instead of the UN target of 0.7 per cent, in other words less than one quarter of the UN target. While we have our economic problems, there is still no excuse for our failure to increase the paltry sum available for ODA.  I know the Minister is constrained by budgetary considerations imposed by the Department of Finance, but I wonder how hard he has fought to increase this miserable pittance of 0.17 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be too.  The Green Movement's aim is for a world of sustainable and decentralised societies which satisfy the basic needs of all.  That this has not been achieved in the Third World is due largely to colonialism and the economic exploitation which it started and has perpetuated, and the destruction of previous living patterns.  This aim could be more easily achieved if the peoples of the Northern hemisphere set an example by reforming their own economies, by lower consumption of resources and so forth, and were thus able to encourage other countries not to follow in the path of mass industrialisation.</P>
      <P>Aid should be given only when asked for, and then directly to the communities involved, or for relevant research.  It should support sustainable intermediatelevel technology based on the principle of mutual co-operation rather than disguised exploitation.  I appeal to the Minister to see what he can do to ensure that indigenous cultures are protected and their rights to avoid development are respected.</P>

      <P>I totally support the Maastricht Treaty and I will ask those who elected me to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; with me. This is not a time for playing party politics. The matter is too serious.  The consequences of not ratifying this treaty are too disastrous to contemplate.</P>
      <P>Through various Governments we have managed from time to time to attract a great deal of investment to this country, and we have used our membership of the EC to that end.  Foreign investment is here because Ireland is a wonderful place in which to locate business. We are proud that Irish people are among the best qualified in the world to handle any type of business.  We have the personnel, the workforce and access to the market places.  I shudder to think what would happen if we decided to shut off access to those European markets, through European Union and economic and monetary union; what would happen to our interest rates that are currently very high and which have a detrimental effect on employment and in which there is no indication of a substantial drop in the forseeable future because of uncertainty in the market place and among the various members of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lower interest rates bring jobs and higher interest rates are detrimental to employment.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; there will be a lack of investment, a loss of investment, a possibility of higher interest rates, a lack of a market place and a lack of opportunities for the people on whom we are spending vast sums in education. I shudder to think what would happen if, through lack of proper information, through a failure on our part to accept our responsibility, the people voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I am delighted with the leadership of Fine Gael who have left aside the opportunity to play party politics to join with the Government in trying to answer very difficult <Col N="1761" /> questions in a fair and equitable way.  Those who agree that &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is the right vote should unite and clearly spell out the answer to questions.  We should not be afraid to answer questions.  We should not promise £6 billion or £5 billion when we do not know.  We should sell the European ideal, the opportunity to be European citizens.  We have a lot to be proud of here and we can give a lot to Europe and get a lot from Europe.</P>
    <P>Some people fear that we may be dragged into a defence or a security policy that may not suit us.  However, Ireland, a small country with a tremendous record in peace-keeping will have a vote that will be as important as the German vote or the French vote when it comes to deciding on a common security and foreign policy.  We will have a tremendous opportunity to play an important role in a peace-keeping pattern in a Europe which is free from war and conflict.  Our vote is as important as the German vote. Unanimity is required in the area of foreign and security policy.  It is vitally important to stress that.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his appointment. Up to this I did not have an opportunity to participate in a debate in which Deputy Andrews was Minister for Foreign Affairs.

      <P>I have three questions. Would the Minister agree that current security arrangements on the Border <Col N="1762" /> are unsatisfactory?  Unilateral decisions on the British side determine the pattern of security, and the Irish security forces are required to co-operate with them by protecting this side of the Border, even if the operations in question seem to be counter-productive.  Would he accept that joint planning of security policy is desirable; and, if so, could some steps be taken towards that end?  Could the Minister tell us what prospect he sees for the achievement, in the reasonably near future, of the commitment to accompaniment of the Army and the UDR in Northern Ireland by the RUC, in accordance with the commitment entered into six and half years ago and which has only been fulfilled in perhaps 60 per cent of cases so far.  What steps does the Minister propose to take in that respect?  With regard to ODA, can the Minister offer us any assurance that the shortfall of £25 million, by comparison to the amount that would be payable if we had even held the figure for 1986, will be made up in the next year or two years?</P>

That will continue apace.  It is fair to say that the cost to Government on an annual basis is massive in terms of the development of troops and members of the Garda Síochána in the Border area.

In relation to accompaniment, I have stressed on the occassions I have been at the Anglo-Irish Conference that this policy must continue and I have received assurances from the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brooke, and from his successor, Sir Patrick Mayhew, that this policy will continue. I have stressed it seriously and deliberately.</P>
      <P>I agree that ODA at 0.17 per cent of GDP is not a true reflection of the wish of the nation.  The generally accepted figure is 0.7 per cent and I will do my best to reach it, although not this year or next year.  I would hope, however, that the figure would be greater than 0.17 per cent next time.</P>

    <P>Deputy Gilmore queried my participation in the Oslo meeting.  I contributed to the meeting as a matter of stated Government policy.  That was my charge and my instruction and I make no <Col N="1764" /> apology for it.  It is Government policy to continue to seek a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on 18 June.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what Deputy O'Shea was adverting to.  I would indicate to him that the ratification process continues.  The legal services of the Commission and the Council will address the legal issues on the basis that it is only in the recent past that the Danes said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Treaty. When those legal opinions become available I have no doubt they will be made public.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to all Deputies who participated in the debate and I am heartened by the serious and considered contributions from all sides.  I am aware that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is ill and could not be here.  I agree with Deputy Owen that the eyes of Europe will be on Ireland on 18 June and that it is very important to stress the need for a strong &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to reflect the continued commitment of Ireland to the European idea.  Deputies Owen and FitzGerald raised the matter of ODA and I have indicated that I will do my best to secure an improvement.  I will consider Deputy Owen's question about the ratification of the UN Convention on Children and I will report to her in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea mentioned that Deputy Michael D. Higgins had made a considerable input on the matter of a Foreign Affairs Committee over the years.  I accept that and I assure Deputy O'Shea that as far as I am concerned the committee will be brought to fruition as quickly as possible.  I understand the reason for Deputy Higgins's absence. Deputy O'Shea stood in very well for him.  There will be a difficulty in relation to the structure of the Foreign Affairs Committee.  My view is that we should have one Foreign Affairs Committee to subsume the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  There is a conflict on this point between the parties and it will probably have to be resolved between the Whips.  Instead of having two committees <Col N="1765" /> we should have one, namely the Foreign Affairs Committee.  That is a point of view but it is arguable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps a sub-committee would deal with the work of secondary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that can be looked at.  I have not ruled anything out and there are matters for discussion. The important thing is to have a committee.</P>
      <P>I indicated to Deputy O'Shea that Denmark and Ireland are good friends. Yesterday I expressed genuine regret on behalf of this country that Denmark did not ratify the European Treaty, but at the same time I said that the people of Denmark were entitled to take that view. The people here who want to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; on 18 June are entitled to do so but we are entitled to put the case for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; as strongly as we can.</P>
      <P>Dr. FitzGerald properly makes the point that we may have been over-stressing the bonanza of £6 billion.  That is a fair point.  I agree that in the event of rejection of the Treaty there will be a huge outflow of money and that investment from outside may become a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, another former Minister for Foreign Affairs, indicated that it is very important to give a signal to our European partners by way of a strong &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote that we wish to be part of Europe and to continue to pursue the European ideal.  We should make a strong case but not overstate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Garland made a number of points to which a response would take a considerable time.  He suggested that in some way we are shedding crocodile tears over the failure of the Danes to ratify the Treaty.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have the greatest sympathy for them but we recognise their entitlement to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  He also suggested that we are not pursuing the question of human rights.  Amnesty International do <Col N="1766" /> an extremely good job but other voluntary organisations have a tremendous commitment to this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche spoke about the self-confidence of the nation.  I agree that we are equal partners in Europe.  Like him, I welcome the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Judith Ward case.  I have been part of the search for justice in the case of the Birmingham Six, the Guild-for Four and the Maguire family and to a lesser degree in the case of Judith Ward.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Durkan on a very helpful contribution.  He asks that we approach this matter positively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the specific terms of the order, I must seek the agreement of the House to give the Minister whatever extra time he requires to reply.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Durkan feels we should be thinking positively as Europeans and should see ourselves as having the same opportunities as other countries, without adopting the posture of the begging bowl.  That is the last thing I would do in my participation in the Council of Ministers.  The point is well made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the ODA and the amount of money &mdash; £43 million &mdash; which is available.  In the stringent circumstances that is not bad, although I agree it is not good enough.  At the same time he praises those voluntary organisations who give so much by way of acts of charity to other countries to top up those moneys to the ODA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked about the mandate to go to Oslo yesterday.  I have explained to him that the mandate was based on Government policy.  We are the Government and if we go to Oslo we go there representing the Irish people until such time as the Irish people decide we should not govern the country.  He suggested that in some way we do not have sympathy with the Danish position; we have the utmost sympathy with the Danish position.  We are not Euro bullies, <Col N="1767" /> or Euro terrorists.  We recognise the rights of other people to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I want to make that position very clear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett concluded on a very positive note.  He shudders to think what will happen if we say &ldquo;no&rdquo; on 18 June. It would be very unfortunate if the result of the referendum was negative.  I agree that Deputy John Bruton has played a very positive role in urging both his own party and the country generally to support the referendum on 18 June by way <Col N="1768" /> of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  Basically, in a rather haphazard fashion, that is the best manner in which I can contribute by way of answers to the various questions raised.  I agree the depth of answers may not be adequate but if Deputies wish to raise anything further by way of Parliamentary Question, or privately, they should not hesitate to do so.</P>
    <P>Votes put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 9 June 1992.</P>
