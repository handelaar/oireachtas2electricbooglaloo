      <P>Will the Government agree that the Committee Stage of this Bill be taken in Special Committee?  It is a detailed Bill and has already gone through the Seanad.  A Special Committee would give us an opportunity to deal with all the matters arising, particularly the Minister's commitment last night.  It might be appropriate if the Tánaiste would respond positively.</P>

    <Title>Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important consolidating legislation, bringing together a number of electoral Acts and regulations that have been in operation for a number of years.  It may be prophetic that this Bill is reaching the end of Second Stage at a time when the climate is such that it may have to be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to the other <Col N="980" /> contributions about the general and practical measures that have been in operation over a number of elections.  The advent of computers in local authorities has resulted in a more legible register of electors being available and each polling station now has the register pertaining to it.  The Bill contains a recommendation for supplementary amendments to the register so that those who are unfortunately left off the register will have the opportunity to have their names included.  In that context it is important that we consider the introduction of a broadly based civics programme in our schools.</P>
    <P>A great number of young people who are entitled to vote and whose names appear on the register of electors do not bother to do so.  This may be because of a lack of interest in the political system, in the candidates or because of a lack of understanding of what the political system is about.  It might be appropriate that we should look at this question again.  There may be inherent difficulties from the point of view of the teaching staff and their unions as to the content of such a programme.  However, it is an important matter because at election after election young people pass the polling stations while their more elderly counterparts go in to vote.</P>
    <P>We must also face the problem of single seat constituencies.  On numerous occasions I have had to travel with my ministerial colleagues to various functions prior to elections.  Some of these functions were 50 or 60 miles apart.  I can recall on one occasion attending a public meeting about the development of a pier on the west coast in Belmullet and subsequently travelling some 80 miles eastwards to another political function in Ballinrobe on the same night.  That meant that as an Opposition Deputy I had to follow two State cars across the constituency. This makes a mockery of the ability of legislators to do the job they are supposed to do.  There is certainly merit in looking again at the question of single seat constituencies in the context of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>Everybody concerned agrees on the <Col N="981" /> banning of advertising outside polling stations.  The electorate are made sufficiently aware through local radio, the national media and so on of what the parties are offering and who the candidates are.  I agree with the proposal to abolish advertising by political parties and independent candidates in the immediate area of polling stations. Whether it can be controlled to within 50 metres is another matter.  Many rural and urban polling stations are situated at the end of long and narrow entrances which may be in excess of 50 metres.  The concept of banning advertising within 50 metres of a polling station should be extended to a total ban.  With the streamlining of effort over the past number of years most political parties and politicians would favour the use of major hoarding advertising in strategic locations throughout the constituencies to get their message across.</P>
    <P>With the change in polling stations it is necessary that there be a clear indication to the public of the location of the new polling stations.  These are sometimes changed at short notice and people who may be new to an area may not know where they are.  They should be indicated on the polling cards sent to voters because invariably would-be voters have to approach public representatives or their agents on election day to find out where the polling stations are.  There should be some way of indicating clearly to people, in particular those in urban areas, where their polling station is.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion about the reduction in the number of polling stations.  This can have a serious effect, particularly in rural areas, because of the drop in the number of people generally due to emigration and so on.  If polling stations are reduced in number people might have to travel a considerable distance to cast their vote.  In those circumstances the elderly or infirm might not be inclined to travel.  I recognise the need to centralise polling stations to an extent but this should be tempered with reason.  Anybody who has the right to vote should not have to travel an excessive distance to do so.  The abolition of <Col N="982" /> small polling stations in the west, for example, might mean the elderly people would have to travel up to 15 miles to cast their vote and their inclination would be not to do so, depending on the time of the election and the weather obtaining on the day.</P>
    <P>The removal of agents and party activists from the vicinity of polling stations is to be welcomed.  This is a major social change for many of the more experienced party activists.  It will have the beneficial effect of doing away with the near intimidation of voters at election time.  I recall last year travelling through a small town in the west during local elections and seeing a Member of the Oireachtas &mdash; I will not say from which House &mdash; on seeing an elderly lady with her shopping, sprinting after her like Carl Lewis and enveloping this poor lady in a bear hug to attract her vote, whereupon she dropped half her shopping.  The over enthusiasm of party activists and the emotional state of contestants can lead to intimidation of voters at election time.</P>
    <P>One has to understand that practically every person whose name appears on the register of electors will cast their vote in the way they had originally intended and will not be swayed by appearances, posters, literature, name calling or hint dropping on the way in to a polling station, although it may have a minor effect in terms of the other choices to be made. That is why I support the proposal that crowds of party activists should not be active in the vicinity of polling stations.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how this will operate in practice.  It may be that the next election will be fought under the existing system and that this Bill may not have completed Committee Stage when we are forced to go to the country again.  If that proves to be the case, another Government may have to implement it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, a case can be made for State funding of political parties.  This should only be given where parties can prove that their financial affairs are in order and that such State funds would be used for the benefit of their party, be it for research or organisational activities. Members of both Houses put an incredible <Col N="983" /> amount of time and effort into raising finance at local and regional level weekly. Members are elected to this House to do a job and to reflect the opinions of the people who elected them but very often they are forced to operate as part-time ticket sellers and fund raisers which ultimately leads to people being turned off when it comes to politics.</P>
    <P>The question of State funding, based on certain criteria and conditions, should be examined.  During the past number of years the major political parties in the face of financial problems, have streamlined their procedures in relation to the money they spend at election time because as I said previously, the electoral process has become very expensive.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important in the sense that it consolidates previous legislation and regulations in one Bill.  It makes an attempt to modernise the electoral process.  Given that the electorate are astute and aware politically, the Bill also attempts to remove old habits and traditions which have no relevance in the nineties.  For this reason the Bill should be welcomed.  When it is implemented, amendments may have to be introduced because we may not have foreseen some of the practical difficulties.  Some of these difficulties will be teased out on Committee Stage but one can never predict with certainty what effect general legislation will have.  This legislation, which attempts to streamline and modernise the electoral process will affect every Member of this House.</P>
    <P>Other countries introduced a system of electronic voting.  However, it has always been a feature of the electoral process in this country that the tally men appear from nowhere on the day of the count and make an accurate prediction, in some cases before the computers have started to work.  I suppose in time that this tradition will die out.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, it is very important that we consider introducing a broadly based civics programme in our schools to highlight the importance of people casting their votes.  Every effort should be made to ensure that those who are eligible <Col N="984" /> to vote are included on the register of electors and are encouraged to cast their vote.  They should have freedom of choice and be allowed to enter and leave polling stations without being harassed or intimidated by individuals or party activists.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this Bill.  Indeed, it is appropriate in light of what is happening in the country that we should have a discussion on our electoral process.  In that context the Bill is very important.</P>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State the political system has worked well in that people have been given an opportunity to make their decisions.  It is true to say that people get the Government they deserve.  Therefore people should not complain when a bad Government are elected, such as the 1977 Government which brought the country to its knees. People complained that because they had a Government that had a large majority they ran amok.</P>
      <P>People are cynical about politicians and I cannot blame them having regard to the accusations which have been made in another place in this city during the past couple of days.  This type of behaviour does nothing to enhance the reputations of politicians.  I am very annoyed because we are all tarred with the same brush; this is unfair.  I have no doubt that 95 per cent of Members elected to this House are honest, diligent and hard working and have their own points of view and it is not good enough that others can make wild accusations about their colleagues regardless of whether they can be substantiated.  People should do the honourable thing, and if the accusations can be substantiated, they should resign to show the electorate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that there ought to be no reference to the proceedings in another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, but this forms part of the picture that is being painted of politics.  As I said, the political system has worked well and if it has not produced <Col N="985" /> the results we would have liked, the people have no one to blame but themselves. For this reason it was never more important for young people to take a keen interest in the political system.  They should become actively involved and inform themselves about the pros and cons of debates.  Too many people are not clear when they go to the polling station on what or for whom they are voting.  In this regard the media have a major role to play.  Even though there may be a slant towards a certain party or policy, people should not take what they say for granted but should make further inquiries.  If necessary, they should join a party, preferably the Fine Gael Party, to learn the truth about what is being proposed at any given time.</P>
      <P>In relation to the electoral system, polling booths have not been changed during the years.  We need to review continuously the location of polling stations. In my rural, widely spread, constituency some people encounter enormous difficulties getting to their polling station. Indeed, it can happen that people may pass a polling station conveniently sited near their home to reach another in their electoral area.  That is not correct and is a further argument for revision of the siting of polling stations.  For instance, in my town of Cavan one might as well attempt to climb the Alps as reach one polling station.  While that polling station serves a purpose there is a case for locating another polling station in the town to facilitate voters on the lower levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that difficulty is not unique to Cavan town.  The returning officer should be requested to examine the location of polling stations whenever difficulties are encountered in the course of an election. Indeed, the parties should draw his attention to any difficulties experienced.  The location of polling stations should be reviewed with changes implemented where necessary.  We should not adhere to the present position simply because it has existed since the foundation of the State and has served us well.  We should <Col N="986" /> bear in mind changing patterns of population.</P>
    <P>In many areas schools which have been closed are reopened on election day as polling stations.  Such buildings are damp, cold and certainly not suitable for this purpose.  That is not good enough.  If there is not a suitable location for a polling station a caravan, of suitable size, should be put in place.  There is no reason people in rural areas should not be afforded the same facilities as their counterparts in urban areas where generally warmer, more comfortable facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>I referred to young voters in the course of the debate on the Referendum (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1992 not being given help in casting their votes. We all decry the fact that young people do not take sufficient interest in politics. What is the point in young people becoming involved in politics &mdash; we must remember it is they who have the energy and enthusiasm &mdash; if the Government decide to hold an election on an inconvenient day for them, such as the date of the forthcoming referendum, Thursday, 3 December 1992?  That day will not be suitable for young people attending third-level educational institutions.  Many of them are far removed from their constituencies. Students from my constituency attending colleges in Dublin, Sligo or Drogheda will be unable to return home in time to vote on 3 December 1992.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, and in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Harney who is present, to change that date to facilitate young voters.  They should at least make that gesture.  Why not hold the referendum on Friday when such young people return home for the weekend?  The bus service taking young people home on Fridays and back to their colleges on Sunday evenings is now a major business.  They reach home at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. on Fridays.  If polling took place on a Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., summer or winter, such young people would be facilitated.  During the two hours between their reaching home and the end of polling the party workers <Col N="987" /> would get them to their relevant polling stations.</P>
    <P>I would prefer that voting would take place on a Saturday but many reasons have been advanced against that, including the cost involved.  While Saturday would be my preference Friday would be a step in the right direction.  Young people would perceive that as a gesture to them, affording them an opportunity to vote.  If the provisions of this Bill did nothing else but change this nonsense day of Wednesday or Thursday, which suits very few people other than those fortunate to be at home or have a job near home, they will have achieved something.</P>
    <P>The funding of political parties has been a major bone of contention.  Political parties should be State-funded, and the electorate have had just about enough of collections and subscriptions. On almost every Sunday there is a church gate collection for some organisation or other, the political parties having their traditional Sunday slot.  Likewise, the national lottery takes every penny of peoples' ready cash.  State funding should be put in place for registered political parties based on their membership in this House.  We must make every effort to preserve our democracy of which we are so proud.  People may criticise party activists, parties collecting funds and so on, but there is no other means of their generating income apart from church gate collections or fund-raising activities.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also that without such funds a party cannot operate. That is our system of democracy and it should not be denied any registered party.  An election should not be postponed because of shortage of funds.  The question of the cost of an election should not lead to its postponement.  For example, in any good company bad management would not be allowed to continue simply because the company could not afford to sack its managers then its business will collapse.  Likewise, the country can collapse if it cannot afford to sack its managers.</P>
    <P>It is time the activities of some party <Col N="988" /> activists at polling stations were stamped out because they have gone overboard.  I firmly believe that before our electorate go to their respective polling stations they have already made up their minds, that 99 per cent of people are quite definite for whom they will cast their vote.  Pushing, pulling, talking in people's ears can have the effect of putting people off and lead to resentment.</P>
    <P>I have been in politics since 1974 and I can honestly claim I never canvassed a vote outside a polling station.  Yet I have succeeded in being elected, or thereabouts, on each occasion.  I would not insult the intelligence of a voter approaching a polling station by asking him or her not to forget me when they go inside.  It happens and that is wrong and frustrating.  In particular old people do not like that type of canvassing or being pushed around.  That is not democracy. People should be left free to travel to their polling stations, walk in dignity and comfort without being hassled by anybody, and cast their vote in accordance with the decision arrived at within the privacy of their homes in discussion with their families.  That type of campaigning or canvassing should be barred from the precincts of polling stations.</P>
    <P>Within reason election literature should be allowed.  Frequently one sees party activists from daylight positioning themselves in prime spots, armed with their literature, denying other parties a prominent place.  That jockeying for positions is of no benefit to anybody.  That practice never won an election for anybody. If party posters are to be erected or put on display, then the respective parties should be allocated their spaces or positions, with the exception of space for cars for the party machines.  That is only right since many people depend on those workers for getting to and from their polling stations.  Some people may be unsure where to cast their vote.</P>
    <P>The tally men practice is a nonsense, is outdated and has got totally out of hand.  We must remember that it is the State that appoints the various personnel within polling stations.  In the case of a multi-booth polling station the State <Col N="989" /> should appoint somebody to guide voters.  In some polling stations in rural areas there may be anything from one to five booths and people may not know where to cast their votes.  It is wrong to have voters arriving at polling stations being approached by party activists, being taken by the arm to the relevant booth, or inquiring of them their number on the register.  That is wrong.  Of course, in the first place their polling cards should have been issued to them, clearly stating their polling booth.  Obviously in many cases they are not issued because I have seen voters arrive at polling stations totally confused, and the party machine purporting to provide them with this great service.  We have reached the stage where people park caravans outside polling stations from which they sell tea and soup.  It is more like a circus than the serious business of casting votes.  The State should ensure that one or two people are present at the entrance to polling stations to assist people to the table at which they should present themselves to collect their polling papers.  All the other nonsense should be done away with.</P>
    <P>Facilities are not provided at polling stations for the handicapped or the aged. I accept the facility of the special vote, but people are entitled to be present at polling stations to cast their vote and they should be facilitated in doing so.  It should be illegal to site polling booths in schools or buildings that are unsuitable for handicapped or aged people.  People in wheelchairs and so on should be able to drive to the door of the polling station and assisted, if necessary, in entering the building.  These people should have the same right to go into the polling booth to cast their vote as have people with full use of their limbs.  That is not the case in many areas where people who are handicapped are discriminated against.  They are now being told that they have a special vote and may vote at home.  Many people will be quite happy with that but we must at all times ensure that people have the choice of voting at the polling station if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I hope that all faith in politicians will <Col N="990" /> not be lost as a result of recriminations in other parts of the city.  I look forward to better elections, a better system of Government and a better country as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fortunate that we are discussing this Bill at this time in view of the developments that are taking place outside the House, as referred to by the previous Deputy.  There is uncertainty in terms of the survival of the present Government and one would question whether this Bill will be enacted before the next election.  There are many laudable provisions in the Bill.  I particularly welcome the measure dealing with the special voters list.  The requirement that people produce a medical certificate to prove they were eligible for inclusion in the special voters list was unacceptable. Where a medical condition has prevailed for many years it is only right that the person be automatically regarded as eligible for the special voting facility list. I welcome the deletion of the provision that the person be of sound mind.  That was insulting and gave offence to many people.</P>
      <P>There appears to be an acceptance in the Bill &mdash; although the objective was probably to ensure that candidates do not go forward for election frivolously &mdash; in relation to the amount that must be deposited by candidates.  There is a perception that politicians are well off and can easily afford £500, as provided in the Bill, but that is not necessarily the case. The increase in the deposit from £100 to £500 is dramatic and is not justified.  I hope that this punitive measure will be considered further on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a sophisticated electorate and candidates who go forward for election have a sense of responsibility.  There have been very few incidents of abuse in this regard in the past.  In the last election a segment of the community who felt offended &mdash; I am talking about Army wives &mdash; went forward for election, but if the deposit on that occasion was £500 I doubt very much whether these people, who had a laudable grievance at the time, would have had the opportunity of going <Col N="991" /> forward.  This measure should be reconsidered because it is unfair and puts extra pressure on politicians at election time. Admittedly these people can retrieve their initial deposit of £500 if they conform to certain conditions during the election and achieve a certain vote on election day, but it is an unnecessary burden on people who are saddled with many expenses during election campaigns.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision relating to the razzamatazz on election day, particularly outside polling stations.  Many speakers have referred to the fact that voters are almost accosted on entering polling stations.  Unlike the previous Deputy, I have stood outside polling booths at elections down the years.  It was felt that if I or my party were not present on polling day we would be the exceptions because all other parties were involved in that activity.  I welcome the provision that canvassers be at least 50 metres from the entrance to a polling station.  However, an element of excitement is generated on polling day by canvassers standing outside polling stations.  In many cases the electorate may not have made up their minds when they attend polling stations and canvassers feel that it is crucial they be present.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the measure dealing with posters.  In rural Ireland posters add to the excitement of an election &mdash; I am not sure if the same applies in urban constituencies.  In my town of Newcastlewest many banners and posters are put up during election time and as soon as polling is finished they are removed.</P>
    <P>I would refer to a matter I raised in the past at the local county council, that is the inclusion of a photograph of a candidate on the ballot paper.  I regret that this has never been done, and I do not believe it would be impossible to make such an arrangement.  It would be extremely helpful to people who are illiterate in that they could identify candidates on the basis of their photograph.  Sometimes these people experience difficulties on election day and spoil their vote as a <Col N="992" /> result.  This matter should be seriously considered for the future.</P>
    <P>A matter of concern to me relates to a small polling station about seven miles from my home, in a place called Feohanagh.  In the last election the people from that region had to travel to another area, perhaps up to seven or eight miles away, to cast their vote.  In rural Ireland today people feel they are deprived of many things &mdash; in some cases there are closures of creameries and in others, of schools and post offices.  People will see this measure as another death-knell for their community.  The county registrar should act with caution before closing down local polling stations, subjecting people to inconvenience.  In the area of Feohanagh people were very annoyed, and rightly so, at the sudden closure of their nearest polling station.</P>
    <P>Another cause of concern to me relates to the accuracy of registers.  Politicians who attend polling stations on polling day are approached by many people complaining that their names are not on the register.  Perhaps this is due to computer errors but it amazes me that a person who has been on the register for many years suddenly finds his name has been removed.  Such errors are a cause of much annoyance to voters.  I welcome the provision in the Bill which proposes that a person may have his name included on the register up to 12 days before election day.  During the week I received a letter from a woman who was aggrieved because her daughter's name had not been included on the recent register.  She rightly asked how I would feel if my name had been omitted from the register.</P>
    <P>Many students are upset because they will not have the opportunity to travel home to vote in the forthcoming referenda. This area should be examined and it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to allow them to have postal votes as many of them would like to vote for people within their own community. Last night a colleague showed me a voting paper which his wife had received to enable her to exercise her franchise in the American election, which can be returned to the American Embassy in <Col N="993" /> Dublin.  They go to a lot of trouble to ensure that an American citizen living in this country can vote in the American election and yet many of our students are precluded from voting in our elections.  I do not know why elections cannot be held on a Saturday &mdash; or even on a Sunday &mdash; because many students travel home for the weekends and if they feel strongly about the matter, they should be entitled to vote.  It is not right that some parties in an area try to get students who support them home to vote; a postal vote would solve that problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and some of the proposed changes and hope it will be implemented in the near future.  As it is a consolidation Bill, I hope the changes will lead to more meaningful elections in future and make life a little easier for voters.  I hope the Minister, on Committee Stage, will consider the reservations expressed by many people in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the useful and constructive debate.  It is an area on which all of us feel competent to comment and I look forward to responding on Committee Stage and to introducing the long overdue reform in many of the areas referred to.  Several issues have been touched on and I will try to deal with as many as possible.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers referred to the question of votes for emigrants.  Representation for emigrants in the Oireachtas raises fundamental questions, including constitutional questions, and of fairness towards emigrants and the resident population.  The matter has been thoroughly considered by the Government. The revised Programme for Government indicated that when the 1991 census figures were published, a commission would be established to advise on constituency boundaries.  Work on the publication of the detailed population figures necessary for constituency revision is now under way and when the necessary figures are published a commission will then be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A general review of our electoral <Col N="994" /> system would require a constitutional amendment and this Bill, therefore, could not deal with that matter.  Reducing the minimum age for Dáil membership and giving the right to vote at presidential elections to persons who are not Irish citizens would also require changes in the Constitution.  Under existing law Dáil elections could not be held on a Sunday. This Bill will remove the prohibition and it will be possible to consider the matter for future elections.  There are advantages and disadvantages associated with Sunday voting and there must be regard to the fact that the minority churches are firmly opposed to it.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with funding of political parties or the control of expenditure at elections.  Up to 30 years ago, the amount which a candidate would spend at an election was subject to a statutory limit but this control was removed on the recommendation of an all party Oireachtas joint committee which took the view that the control was not necessary, relevant or effective.  In considering the financing of political parties it would be necessary to address complex questions, including public funding, and the examination would have to take account of the parliamentary functions as well as the electoral role of political parties.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which deals essentially with the technical procedures of Dáil elections, would not be an appropriate vehicle for dealing with such questions. Where two polls are taken together some electors may vote 1, 2 and 3 on one paper and continue their preferences &mdash; 4, 5, 6 &mdash; on the other.  The decision on the validity of a ballot paper is a matter for the returning officer and under section 118 of the Bill he or she has the discretion to accept as valid any mark which, in his or her opinion, clearly indicates a first preference.  Further legislation in relation to that point does not seem necessary. It is desirable that the returning officer should, as far as possible, adopt a uniform approach and the matter will be raised with them.  However, it has been my experience that returning officers tend to accept as valid any mark which <Col N="995" /> gives a reasonably clear indication of what the voter had in mind.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposed increase in the deposit for candidates, we have probably the most open system of nomination. Any citizen of Ireland, irrespective of place of birth or residence or any connection with the country or constituency, may nominate himself or herself or be nominated by just one elector.  There is a need for some restraint on candidates getting involved in elections for reasons other than electoral.  A deposit is one way of doing this; other possible measures would be to restrict the right to nominate to, say, registered parties or to require the signatures of a substantial number of electors.  The former approach would clearly not be acceptable and the latter would involve verification of large numbers of signatures by the returning officers.  In our circumstances this would not be practical given the very limited time available at a Dáil election.</P>
    <P>Requiring a deposit is of long standing, is well known and understood and, of course, the deposit is refunded if the candidate attracts a certain minimum support. That minimum is being reduced from one-third to a quarter of the quota. To be effective, the deposit must be fixed at a significant level.  In today's values a sum of £100 is hardly significant.  I do not know exactly when, but this sum was established in the early twenties.  I do not want to get into an argument about its equivalent today, it is not relevant, but if it did not create problems in the twenties and thirties a small increase at this time is unlikely to cause a war in Kildare, Wicklow or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>I repeat that the objective is to deter bogus candidates whose aim may be to disrupt or confuse.  There is no intention of putting obstacles in the way of genuine candidates, whether they are candidates of the smaller parties, single issue candidates or those with far out views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The register of electors will continue <Col N="996" /> to be published each year and will continue to be the main document.  The supplement will only be used to add names which should have been included from the start.  There must be a cut-off point for applications for inclusion in the supplement to ensure that they are fully checked and that the status of the register proper is not undermined.  The proposed closing date will allow applications to be made up to about a week after the dissolution of the Dáil.  This has been welcomed on all sides.  It is something which many of us thought should have been possible long ago and I am glad that Deputies on all sides welcome this measure.</P>
    <P>The supplement is a safety net to catch those eligible electors who should have been included in the first place.  It will not cater for persons who reach 18 after the coming into force of the register.  An elector who reaches the age of 18 on or before the date of coming into force of the register is eligible for inclusion on that register.  The proposal is that in selected areas electors' lists, instead of a full draft register, will be tried out.  There will be three lists, the first consisting of the register in force, the second, showing the proposed additions and the third, the proposed deletions.  Public representatives will be able to see proposed changes at a glance.  The list will replace the draft register, not the final one.  The final register will be published each year as a single document, as is the case at present.  I am sure most Deputies are familiar with circumstances in which a person's name which had been consistently on a register for, perhaps, 25 to 30 years was removed coming up to election time.  Such people find it difficult to understand why their names are removed from the register.  We want to devise appropriate ways of ensuring that such errors will not be repeated in the future and we should take whatever steps are necessary to avoid that.</P>
    <P>An elector's name may be retained on the register for up to 18 months provided they have a firm intention to return to the address in question within that <Col N="997" /> period.  That relates to temporary absence from one's residence.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for a financial penalty on registration authorities in the event of failure to carry out their duties satisfactorily.  The purpose is to impress on all concerned that the Oireachtas is serious in its desire to see a substantial improvement in the standard of the register and that sloppy performance is not acceptable.  The Department's publicity campaign in relation to the register will be reviewed in the context of bringing the provisions of the Bill to the notice of the public once the Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>The field-work for the register cannot commence much earlier than 1 September because of the absence of many households on holidays during July and August.  However under the revised timetable all significant work on the register will be completed before Christmas, leaving only the printing of the final document to be done post-Christmas.</P>
    <P>Speakers suggested that postal voting should be made available for various categories &mdash; emigrants, students, merchant seamen, fishermen, the disabled, people working away from home and so on.  An excellent case could be made for such a facility for all sorts of categories. However, experience here and elsewhere has shown that postal voting is particularly open to abuse.  The bottom line in regard to postal voting is that it is not possible to extend to the postal voter and their ballot paper the guarantee of secrecy, security and integrity which are provided at the polling station.  It is not that the individual voter would abuse the system &mdash; the problem is that they could be the victim of abuse.  They could be subject to pressure and intimidation. Until a way is found of coping with this, it is unlikely that extended postal voting can be regarded as acceptable.  In an ideal world this might be acceptable, but experience shows that we are somewhat away from that ideal world, if we ever reach it.</P>
    <P>There are 3,738 persons on the current special voters list.  I understand from the Department of Finance that, at the 1989 general election, the total cost of operating <Col N="998" /> the special voting arrangement was £29,000.  The period for applying for entry on the list is being extended from one to almost three months.</P>
    <P>In regard to the prohibition on canvassing outside polling stations, the limit of 50 metres will be measured from any entrance to the curtilage of a polling station.  In general, this will mean 50 metres from any gate leading to the school yard.  Whether the distance should be 50 metres or 100 metres or even longer can be examined on Committee Stage.  It appears from the balance of opinion here that we should extend the 50 metre limit.</P>
    <P>I hope and expect that the spirit as well as the letter of this provision will be complied with and that the practice will cease altogether, not just move down the street.  Enforcement will be a matter for the Garda.  The penalties for breach of the provision, as well as for other electoral offences, are set out in section 157.</P>
    <P>A complete statutory moratorium on canvassing on polling day and possibly on the day before polling day would be extremely difficult to enforce.  Progress could best be made on this through agreement between parties and candidates, without a formal statutory base.  I think voluntary agreement would also be the best way of regulating display of posters.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the inclusion of the photographs of candidates on ballot papers would assist voters unable to read or write or those with impaired vision.</P>
    <P>Section 103 of this Bill restates existing law under which electors with difficulty in reading or writing or with impaired vision may be assisted in voting.  While the inclusion of photographs could be of limited assistance to some voters, it would give rise to severe practical difficulties for returning officers in the very restricted time available for producing ballot papers at a Dáil election.</P>
    <P>Photographs on ballot papers could assist some electors in identifying the candidate they wish to vote for but only, of course, if they already know what the candidate looks like.  That is generally not a problem in rural constituencies.</P>

      <P>I have never had the opportunity to stand in a constituency where the public were in any doubt as to what the candidates looked like.

      <P>I do not know if that would be sustainable in all circumstances.  From the point of view of principle our electoral system is already criticised for putting undue emphasis on personality rather than on policy.  Including photographs would exaggerate this tendency and could have the effect of trivialising elections and turning them into a kind of beauty contest.</P>
      <P>Regarding the need to curb the use on ballot papers of names adopted by candidates by deed poll, section 52 repeats existing law which requires the returning officer, in ruling on nominations, to object to the name of a candidate which is not the name by which the candidate is commonly known or is misleading or includes a political reference.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that names on ballot papers should be arranged in random order would create great difficulty for voters particularly those with poor eyesight or a low level of reading skills.</P>
      <P>The requirement to show the back of the ballot paper to the presiding officer after voting is not a new provision.  It has been part of the electoral law since the foundation of the State.  The purpose is to ensure that material other than the ballot paper is not put in the ballot box.  It seems a sensible precaution which should be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 99 provides that a person employed by the returning officer including <Col N="1000" /> a presiding officer or poll clerk, may be authorised to vote at a polling station, other than their usual polling station, within the constituency.</P>
    <P>A general election involves a separate election in each constituency.  It would not be appropriate to authorise an election official to vote in an election for a constituency other than their own.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the recruitment of staff is a matter for the returning officer. However, it has been the practice of successive Minister, to request returning officers to employ, as far as possible, unemployed persons in connection with the election.  In this regard, it must be recognised that the efficient conduct of the election is the overriding consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 95 requires the returning officer to allow candidates to inspect the list of persons proposed to be appointed as presiding officers or poll clerks.  This is related to section 61 which provides that a returning officer shall not employ any person who has been employed by or on behalf of a candidate or who has been promoting the interests of a political party at the election.  The right to inspect the list provides an opportunity for such matters to be brought to the notice of the returning officer.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues the existing arrangement for free postage for candidates but enables the Minister to alter the arrangements following appropriate consultation and with the approval of both Houses. There is some dissatisfaction at the present arrangements and consultation on possible changes has begun.  If agreement emerges involving a change in the present Bill this could be taken on board on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Points raised concerning the condition of ballot boxes, the location, lighting and access to polling stations etc. will be examined and taken up with returning officers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the right of tallymen to attend at the count, tallymen are in fact agents appointed by the candidates to represent them.  Under section 60 (2) the number of agents who may be appointed on behalf of any candidate is fixed by <Col N="1001" /> the returning officer.  He is, however, required to allow each candidate to appoint the same number and give them adequate facilities for overseeing the proceedings.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that all orders to be made by the Minister under the Bill should be subject to approval by both Houses.  Orders under section 8, which could affect the electorate for Dáil elections, will require such approval.  So would an order under section 57 amending the free postage provisions. However, it would not be appropriate to have such a requirement in relation to an order under section 96 fixing the polling day at an election.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank Deputies for their positive and constructive approach.  Their suggestions have been sensible and helpful and will be considered carefully.  I would also like to acknowledge the kindness of Deputies in complimenting the Minister, the Department and the others involved in the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Committee Stage which, presumably will take place next week, so that some of the provisions contained in the Bill can be enacted in good time for the forthcoming referenda and also so that Members will be able to tease out some of the areas in which there is scope for further change.</P>

    <Title>Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill, 1992  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Justice to appoint persons to be known as assistant censors to assist the Film Censor in the performance of his duties and functions under the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1970, and the Video Recordings Act, 1989 &mdash; particularly the latter Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, the Video Recordings Act, 1989, aims at three levels of control. First, it contains provisions for the licensing of wholesale and retail video outlets. Second, it provides that the censor may, on grounds specified in the Act, prohibit <Col N="1003" /> the supply of video films which he considers unsuitable for viewing.  Third, it provides for the classification of video films in terms of their suitability for viewing by different age groups.</P>
    <P>The first two levels of control mentioned &mdash; licensing and the censor's power to prohibit certain videos&mdash;were brought into operation in 1991. However, the third level of control &mdash; classification of all video films by reference to their suitability for viewing by younger people &mdash; has yet to be brought into operation.  This is where the present Bill becomes relevant.  The volume of work which will be involved in the examination of all new videos and those already on the market with a view to determining their suitability for viewing cannot be undertaken by the censor alone.  He will need considerable assistance, hence the need for assistant censors.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the details of the Bill I would like to remind the House, briefly, of the circumstances which made it necessary to enact the Video Recordings Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>Video films came on the scene in the early eighties.  They enjoyed an amazingly rapid growth in popularity during that decade.  Evidence of this rapid growth was to be found in the proliferation of outlets supplying video films and the fact that video recorders became commonplace in homes.</P>
    <P>There were thousands of video film titles available and the number was being added to at the rate of approximately 1,000 new titles each year.  Most of these films were unobjectionable in their portrayal of adventure, comedy, romance, sport, education, etc. However, just as the print and film media can be exploited by the unscrupulous to make money at whatever cost to others, so too with videos.  Increasing numbers of what came to be termed &ldquo;video nasties&rdquo; were put on the market.  These were thoroughly objectionable films which depicted extreme and graphic violence or uninhibited pornography.  The extremely violent films contained many scenes of <Col N="1004" /> the most stomach-turning and ghastly violence, while those of a pornographic nature portrayed sex in a totally objectionable manner.  The nature of some of this material was such that responsible parents were very concerned lest their children be exposed to it.  Women, in particular, were fearful that these videos, if they were to be widely available, would increase the incidence of sexual attack and assault on them.  As a result, there was a widespread demand that controls be introduced to deal with these films. The response to this demand was the Video Recordings Act, 1989.  That Act is, as I said, being brought into operation in stages by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>The first important step was to ensure that those in the business of selling and supplying videos on hire could be identified and monitored.  This was done by introducing a licensing system.  In April 1991 regulations were made which require retail and wholesale video dealers to be licensed with effect from 1 May 1991.  These licences were issued by the Film Censor and authorise the sale or letting on hire of video recordings at or from a particular premises.  A licence remains in force for a period of 12 months.  The fees prescribed for licences are: retail, £100; and wholesale, £4,000.</P>
    <P>The second step was to ensure that &ldquo;video nasties&rdquo; would not be allowed in the marketplace.  In July 1991 a further order was made enabling the Film Censor to exercise his powers under the Act to prohibit the supply of video films which he considers to be unfit for viewing in accordance with the criteria contained in the Act.  To date, the censor has issued prohibition orders in respect of 221 such video films.  A further order and regulations will be required in the coming months to commence the remainder of the Act and enable the Film Censor to examine all new video films intended for supply and also to commence the systematic examination of all video films already on the market.  The censor will examine the videos to determine whether they are suitable for viewing and, if suitable, will assign one of the following four classifications to them: (i) fit for viewing <Col N="1005" /> by persons generally; (ii) fit for viewing by persons generally but for a child under 12 years only in the company of a responsible adult; (iii) fit for viewing by persons aged 15 years or more; and (iv) fit for viewing by persons aged 18 years or more.</P>
    <P>However, because of the volume of work which will be involved, it will be necessary, as I said, to first appoint a number of assistant censors to assist the censor.  The classification system, when in operation, will provide parents with the means to monitor what their children are watching.  The video which a child or young person may wish to buy or hire will be clearly labelled as to its suitability for viewing by younger age groups.  It will be up to parents primarily to control what their children are watching.  The law cannot extend into the family home.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to quantify accurately the number of video films involved, information received from trade interests clearly indicates that the task could not be performed by the Film Censor alone.  The trade say they will be submitting in the region of 700 new video films each year to the censor for examination. This figure does not take account of those video films already on the market.  It is estimated that there could be as many as 12,000 to 15,000 video films already on the market which will also require examination.</P>
    <P>With that background in mind I would now like to address in broad terms the provisions of the Bill before the House. As I said, the main purpose of the Bill is to amend existing legislation to enable the Minister for Justice to appoint assistant censors to assist the Film Censor in the performance of his statutory duties and functions.  Section 2 of the Bill deals with this.  The Bill also provides for the rectification of anomalies in the existing legislation which relate to the fees to be prescribed for appeals to the Censorship of Films Appeal Board.  Sections 3, 4 and 5 are the relevant sections of the Bill in this regard.</P>
    <P>In section 2 it is proposed to empower the Minister to appoint as many assistant censors as will be required to assist the <Col N="1006" /> Film Censor in the performance of his duties.  The assistant censors will be given the same statutory powers as the Film Censor to make decisions in relation to the certification and classification or prohibition of cinema and video films with the exception of the following powers which will be reserved to the Film Censor: (i) the power under the Censorship of Films Act, 1970, to review a decision made over seven years previously, (ii) the power under section 4 (3) of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, to give a higher classification, i.e. one indicating unsuitability for younger viewers, in the case of a video film, (iii) the power under section 7 (3) of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, to revoke a prohibition order in respect of a video film and (iv) the making of annual and other reports under section 29 of the Act of 1989 to the Minister for Justice on the censor's activities as to censorship of cinema or video films.</P>
    <P>Thought was given to whether a system could be devised whereby the assistant censors could operate in a subordinate role to the censor and where final decisions on certification and classification or prohibition could be left to him.  Such a system would have the distinct advantage of guaranteeing uniformity in determining classifications. However, given the sheer volume of work which will be involved and the fact that the video distributors will need speedy decisions on the certification and classification of their product, it would make such a system unworkable.  However, under the system proposed in the Bill there are provisions aimed at ensuring a uniform approach to classification.</P>
    <P>First, it is proposed that the Film Censor, subject to any directions that may be given to him by the Minister for Justice, may determine which functions an assistant censor may perform and to what extent he or she may perform such functions.  Second, there is provision that the assistant censors will perform the functions allocated to them under the general superintendence of the Film Censor and consult with him from time to time about the performance of these <Col N="1007" /> functions.  These provisions will provide the Film Censor with the means to establish classification standards and maintain a consistency in their application.</P>
    <P>As to the appointment of persons to the position of assistant censor, there is a number of factors which will have to be taken into account in determining their conditions of employment.  For example, the video business is subject to peaks and valleys.  Some of the variations are seasonal while others are related to customer trends and demands.  Regardless of such variations, however, distributors of video films will demand a consistently speedy service from the Film Censor's Office in having their product examined, certified and classified in time to meet planned release dates in the market place.</P>
    <P>In addition, experience elsewhere has shown that persons employed on the examination and classification of video films maintain consistently better standards of judgement if employed for short periods and given long breaks.</P>
    <P>Also, more assistant censors will be required during the first years of examination of video films until such time as the backlog of films already on the market have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the appointment of assistant censors on a full-time basis to examine video films may not be the best way to cope with these factors.  Other options would be to appoint assistant censors on a contract basis for a definite period or to appoint them on a part-time basis as the need arises or a blend of both such systems.  I am having these matters examined at present but it may not be possible to determine all these issues until the examination of videos gets under way and we learn from experience what is the best method of approach.</P>
    <P>Assistant censors will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The annual cost involved will depend on the volume of new video films released each year and the rate at which those films already on the market can be examined. It is not possible, therefore, to state accurately what the level of cost is likely <Col N="1008" /> to be during the first or second year of operation.  All costs involved in the operation of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, will be recovered by the charging of fees for services provided.  Accordingly, there will not be any nett additional cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the other proposals in the Bill before the House which are intended to regularise matters in the existing law covering the prescribing of fees for appeals in respect of cinema films and video films &mdash; sections 3, 4 and 5 refer.</P>
    <P>The effect of the relevant provisions of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, in relation to appeals in respect of cinema films is that a fee of not more than £5 may be prescribed in each case and, where that appeal is successful the fee shall be refunded.  In the case of appeals under the Video Recordings Act, 1989, in respect of video films, the requirement is that the appellant pay such fee as may be prescribed with no provision for repayment of that fee.</P>
    <P>If those provisions of the Acts of 1923 and 1989 are allowed to stand, further anomalies will exist in that the fee for an appeal in the case of a video could reflect modern day values while the corresponding fee for a cinema film will be limited to £5 and, while this fee may be refunded if the appeal is successful, such is not the case in an appeal involving a video.</P>
    <P>What I now propose in the Bill is to regularise the matter by leaving the amount of fee in respect of appeals in both cases to be fixed by regulation but to provide that the fee to be paid by the appellant in the case of either a video or a film should be repaid if the appeal is successful.  The provisions in this Bill in relation to the appointment of assistant censors are essential to the implementation of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, that is, the examination and classification or prohibition of all new video films intended for supply and the systematic examination of all video films currently on the market.  I hope that I will have the support of the House for the measures <Col N="1009" /> proposed and I look forward to an open and informative debate on the proposals.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to the need for censorship is fraught with argument. Legislation on the subject is difficult to apply, as is obvious to all Members of this House.  Any time a ban is applied to any publication it automatically acquires a notoriety which provides it with high powered and free advertising, thereby enhancing demand for it.  Even though supplying the publication is against the law, and even though it is prohibited, the black market satisfies demand in all cases and as a result makes huge profits, no percentage of which ever reaches Government coffers. There is, indeed, a thriving black market as we are aware and we see evidence of that regularly.</P>
      <P>That black market operates in all contraband materials, drugs, videos, films and publications.  The Garda cannot control this market. From time to time they make a big haul of various materials, but the day after the same people or others will move in, if there is a gap in the market, and make a supply of this type of contraband material available.  I understand that the black market in videos &mdash; and I assume the Minister's figures are fairly accurate in this regard &mdash; stands at present at approximately £15 million a year, and neither the Government nor the Garda can stamp it out. Those who want pornographic material will always be able to get it.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is a necessary consequence of the Video Recordings Act, 1989.  It is a simple measure which makes provision for the appointment of assistant censors.  It outlines their functions and duties, from whence they derive their powers and their method of payment. It proposes to amend the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, and the Video Recordings Act, 1989, in a manner which I find entirely acceptable and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the eighties, as the Minister has told us, there was a huge growth in the video film industry.  Video recorders have <Col N="1010" /> become part of the furniture in many households.  Gradually there was a demand for legislation which would apply some control to the industry.  The Video Recordings Bill was introduced in this House in 1987, and as is clear today, that legislation has not yet been finalised. One would wonder why there has been such an inordinate delay with that legislation. I suspect that although the problem was perceived as an acute one, there was no sense of conviction about enacting the legislation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the 1989 Act is to protect society from the criminal side effects of viewing videos which often depict extreme violence and uninhibited pornography and may incite people to hatred against minorities.  Perusal of the Act is quite revealing.  Whom does it purport to protect?  Certainly the official censor has power to refuse to certify certain videos, thereby making them illegal, and the power to make it illegal for wholesalers and retailers to stock such videos or to rent or sell them.  Everyone in this House knows that people who want to get their hands on this type of material will succeed. That market is well looked after. The banning of such material gives it notoriety and significantly increases the demand for it.</P>
    <P>The Garda manage to detect and confiscate hordes of pornographic videos on a regular basis and they will continue to do so.  It is a very profitable game for black marketeers to be involved in and there is evidently a substantial market for such material.  It is clear that those who want hard pornography will be able to get it.  On 1 January 1993 when there will be an open market in Europe and borders will be more open than they are now, it will be much easier for people to bring such material into this country and the black market will thrive.</P>
    <P>Prohibition always puts money into the pockets of the unscrupulous dealers.  I find it very disappointing that nowhere in the Act is there a section or subsection which specifically protects innocent, immature children.  A five year-old or a ten-year old can enter a video retail unit today and purchase or rent an adult video <Col N="1011" /> and do so perfectly within the law.  The person who sells that product to a child is not penalised under the 1989 Act. While we are all agreed that the State cannot decide what parents and their children may watch in their own homes, if we decide that censorship is necessary surely we should ensure that children should not be able, under the law, to procure pornographic material for themselves. We prevent adults from purchasing hard video pornography by refusing to certify it, thereby making it illegal.  Yet we allow five-year-olds to buy or rent an adult video which may contain explicit sex scenes.  The logic of that escapes me entirely.  It brings to mind an old Irish proverb, &ldquo;an tslat, nuair a chruann le haois, is deacair í a shníomh ina gad.&rdquo;  Loosely translated that means that a branch loses its flexibility as it gets older, and we are all aware that the same applies to the human condition.</P>
    <P>It is arguable whether adults are adversely affected by pornography or by video nasties.  Some would say that people who have a particular inclination may be incited to commit unlawful acts as a result of viewing such material, etc. Psychologists and sociologists tell us, however, that our emotional make-up and social characteristics are formed in our childhood.  In my view, violence and depravity are generally inculcated in one's formative years and in the environment of one's own home.  Regular exposure to video nasties and pornographic material at a young age will have a destabilising effect on one's development.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the State, when it decides to introduce legislation on censorship, to offer as much protection as it possibly can to innocent and vulnerable children.  The 1989 Act did not deal with that issue.  I am not sure what the motivation for that was, but, although I have not had an opportunity to read the Official Report in detail, it seems that it was excluded deliberately.  The thinking probably was that parents are the people who must act as censors and oversee what their children view and <Col N="1012" /> read.  Obviously, Governments cannot decide what parents and children watch and read in the privacy of their own homes.  However, as videos are sold or rented through retail units, the Government do have control to some degree at that stage.  The Government should have exercised that control by making it illegal for persons who own or manage those properties to sell or rent adult video nasties to children.</P>
    <P>The Government have control at that stage but they do not have control over the material people view or read in their own homes.  We should signal to the nation our view that it is unacceptable that children should be allowed to view such material by introducing legislation to make it illegal.  The Government have refused to do this and I would ask the Minister now to consider this.  Before this Bill passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas I hope we will have an opportunity to put this matter right.  It is essential that we do this in order to indicate to parents and to society in general that this is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>That immediately brings to mind the difficulties the Government have with regard to the legislation on the use of alcoholic drink by minors.  That legislation was reviewed and amended in 1988 and yet the will to implement it appears to be lacking.  We are all aware that youngsters are able to get as much drink as they can consume in various pubs at weekends.  Even though this is against the law, it happens and the people who serve them drink are tolerated by society. This kind of tolerance is extremely dangerous.  One can imagine the effect watching pornographic videos after consuming too much alcohol can have on immature and vulnerable people and the kind of activities they can get involved in.</P>
    <P>Many cases of incest and child sexual abuse result from the irresponsible use of pornographic videos and alcohol.  I am sure other Members will agree that a depraved adult who wishes to take advantage of a child can easily set the scene for his evil intentions through the use of what might be called a soft porn or blue video.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> Children who are exposed to pornographic material can grow up to believe that sexual behaviour of a particular kind is normal and can easily agree to get involved in undesirable activities.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that child sexual abuse does terrible damage to those who are abused and that they can suffer unbelievable consequences.  For example, some of them suffer from emotional disturbance and end up on the fringes of society involved in prostitution and substance abuse.  As these people are unable to form a relationship they do not have a normal family life.  Given the consequences of child sexual abuse and the fact that we are aware that watching pornographic videos and consuming too much alcohol can impact on children in a very negative way and lead to the perpetration of sexual abuse, we should avail of every opportunity to send out signals that certain types of behaviour are not acceptable.  We should send out signals to those involved in the retail business and parents that viewing certain films and reading certain material are not acceptable in any circumstances.  We did not do this in the 1989 Act, but we still have time to send out these signals to people. That was the only effective thing we could have done in terms of censorship under the 1989 Act.  Adults who want to watch pornographic videos will be able to get them irrespective of the laws enacted by this House.  Banning certain videos only draws attention to them and makes the black-market much more lucrative for those who operate in it.</P>
    <P>In discussing censorship and the application of the censorship laws we should aim at protecting the innocent, people who are unable to protect themselves and those who are not mature enough to make decisions for themselves.  I hope the Minister will give some heed to what I have said in this regard.  I have very strong views about this issue.  I have been studying the issue of child sexual abuse for some time and I am aware of the awful problems it creates.  The extent of the problem is still unknown; we can only guess it at this stage.  Television programmes, the ISPCC and others who deal <Col N="1014" /> with children have told us that the problem is more widespread than the official statistics indicate.  In 1984 very few cases of child sexual abuse were reported while thousands of cases will be reported this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the growth of the video industry during the eighties was remarkable.  There is a connection between the growth in the reported cases of child sexual abuse and the growth in that industry.  I am not saying there is a direct connection but it is significant that both have grown apace.  I hope that sociologists, psychologists and those working in university departments will carry out an investigation in an effort to establish the connection between the increase in the reported cases of child sexual abuse and the growth in the video industry. Anyone who looks at these issues, even in a superficial way, will see the connection.</P>
    <P>Children who watch unacceptable videos in their homes tend to accept the norm and are, therefore, much more susceptible to become involved in unacceptable sexual behaviour.  This matter needs urgent attention.  My information &mdash; I am sure the Minister and other Members will agree &mdash; is that thousands of victims of child sexual abuse need counselling and therapy but are unable to receive treatment as the State cannot afford to provide it.  If all the victims in the reported cases received therapy and counselling they could begin to recover from the awful consequences of child sexual abuse.  If they do not receive this therapy many of them will end up on the fringes of society, become abusers, become involved in criminal activities of one kind or another and help to increase this circle by getting other people involved.  This enormous problem helps to fill our jails and creates violence.  We have read in the papers of people walking along a street at night being attacked for no logical reason by a group of young people.  This behaviour by the attackers can be traced back to malformations of some sort during their formative years. This issue is of extreme importance to <Col N="1015" /> the Government, society and me and it should be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>I am happy with some of the provisions in the Bill.  I welcome the provision in relation to the grading of videos, which was not included in the 1989 Act.  This provision is good in that it will give parents an indication of the type of videos their children bring home to watch and whether they should be allowed to view them.  It is an important provision. Obviously we want parents to take their responsibilities seriously and to insist on vetting videos and television programmes. In this way, children will only be able to watch programmes and videos which are suitable for their age group.  It is a difficult thing for parents with a busy lifestyle to do.  The satellite television channels cannot be controlled.  When parents go out of the house late at night children can watch all sorts of material which is entirely unsuitable for their age group.  Of course the Government cannot handle that sort of thing.  We cannot be responsible for things which parents do within the confines of their own homes. The best we can do is try to educate people as to the consequences of not being responsible.  Most parents try to be responsible but there are homes where there is grave and deliberate irresponsibility with regard to these matters. The majority of parents will try very hard to carry out their duties but some will not.  It is these people who will always cause difficulties for society at large. They will raise children who are unfit to take their place in society because they have not been allowed to grow up in the normal way.  Pressure on our jails will increase as a result.  We need to educate people as to the dangers involved.  I am glad the Government have introduced a &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; programme in schools which will enable children to learn about the kinds of relationship which are acceptable and to discern those which are not.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for us to rethink the terms of the 1989 Act.  We have an opportunity to discuss it as we go through this Bill.  We have control over what children may buy or rent in a retail outlet.  We <Col N="1016" /> should give maximum protection to those children by making it an offence for an adult working in such an outlet to sell or rent to children adult videos containing explicit sex scenes.  That would be some measure of protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given an indication of how it is proposed this legislation should operate.  He is not in a position to say how many assistant censors he will require but he is able to make an estimate of the number and of the amount of money that will be required to pay them.  Who those people will be is an important question. One would hope they would not be party hacks who have done their duty by their party and have to be repaid.  That would be entirely unacceptable.  It would be necessary for them to have some background in the business and to know something about films in general.  They should also be able to exercise good judgement. The enormity of the task will require them to work and make decisions on their own and they must have the necessary expertise.  I hope the Minister will consider appointing women to at least 50 per cent of these positions.  Women have a caring attitude and would be able to make good decisions.</P>
    <P>My party broadly accept this Bill but we hope that certain amendments will be made to it and to the 1989 legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>My party also welcome this Bill in so far as it goes.  Our criticism is that it is yet another piecemeal attempt to deal with a major problem.  We would have preferred the legislation dealing with films, videos and publications to be updated in a consolidation Act which would confront the challenges in this area.</P>
      <P>It is important that legislation of this kind should be capable of changing a perception of this area as being exploitable for easy profits to a highly risky commercial activity in which people will be discouraged from investing in undertakings which produce such filth.  That is the kernel of any legislation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not go far enough in updating our legislation.  The existing definitions of pornography are outdated <Col N="1017" /> and anti-woman.  It is time for the Minister to amend existing legislation on pornography to provide a more real approach to the issue.  Various statutes which define pornography do not go far enough.  They look at pornography from a moral perspective which focuses on defining pornography as an attack on public morality rather than on women. As a result, loose definitions of pornography have been used to ban a wide variety of reputable films and publications which would not be pornographic in their depictions of women. The challenge facing society is to formulate a definition of pornography which avoids this problem.</P>
    <P>The existing Censorship of Films Act of 1923 allows a film to be banned if it is indecent, obscene, or blasphemous or because the exhibition thereof in public would tend to inculcate principles contrary to the public morality or would otherwise be subversive of public morality. Books may be banned under the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946 if they are indecent or obscene or if they advocate abortion.  The Video Recordings Act, 1989 which this Bill brings further into force has a more extensive definition but, nonetheless, a vague one.</P>
    <P>I believe the existing legislation defining pornography fails to address the kernel of the matter.  A more positive approach would be centred on the concept of pornography as sex discrimination and as the subordination of women.  This definition of pornography would include the graphic, sexually explicit subordination of women whether in pictures or in words.  The re-definition of pornography would not be a backward step for our society but would ensure that the pornographic films that portray women in a degrading and subordinate way would not be allowed to be distributed in Ireland.  This can only have a positive influence on our society and would remove, once and for all, the vagueness that prevails in our existing definitions of pornography.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot agree with what I am saying here and with what I suggest as a re-definition of pornography, at least <Col N="1018" /> he could offer the House a guarantee that on Committee Stage he will introduce an amendment to provide a single uniform and coherent definition of indecency which will remove the arbitrary nature of most of the judgements which have to be currently made.  It is hoped that this definition would cover all three pieces of legislation on films, videos and publications.</P>
    <P>I believe that the censorship board would be much more productive in its work if it reviewed the horrible depiction of violence in films that often receive PG certificates and would therefore be accessible to children.  This Bill before the House provides for the appointment of assistant censors to assist the official censor of films in the performance of his functions in relation to films and videos. According to this Bill the Minister for Justice would have sole power to appoint these assistant censors.  I do not believe that this is a safe decision in that the Minister of the day could use appointments to these positions as a payoff or compensation for political favours to the exclusion of appointing suitably qualified persons to the job.  It is vitally important that people with suitable qualifications and experience be appointed.  There is no mention in the Bill of desirable qualifications for such appointments.  There should be a set of minimum requirements; the basic qualifications should be obvious.  It is a failure of the Bill that it fails to assert what qualifications, skills and relevant experience are required by these important provisions.  Having said that, the best qualified people are parents but, as I said at the outset, if we can have legislation to attack at source the manufacture of video nasties, the copying of video nasties, even the possession of video nasties and horrible pornography, then protection comes a bit more easily. Concentrating on protection and not on the source can be counter-productive.  It must be made commercially unattractive to go into such business.  Not alone must it be made commercially unattractive but the highest possible penalties should be imposed at that point.  If that could be done it would help enormously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> It is also sad when a video nasty or a film depicting all kinds of pornographic behaviour gets front page publicity in other forms of the media that tends to promote rather than to curtail the said videos, films or publications.  Here again the responsibility spreads over a wider area to ensure that no comment is made that has the effect of giving free publicity to the promotion of this activity.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would urge the Minister to bring into the House a Consolidation Bill covering this area, updating the definitions that need to be updated and clarifying what qualifications and experience he will be looking for in the people he has in mind to appoint as assistant censors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was debated in the Seanad there was a lengthy debate on the nature of censorship itself. It was implied, if not directly expressed, by a number of contributors that there should be no censorship and that citizens should be free to view what they want when they want to and to make up their own minds and exercise their own judgement in relation to pieces of film. That may be fine in an ideal world but we do not live in an ideal world and we do know that, since the introduction of the technology of videos, many videos have appeared both on the official market and on the black market which were vulgar, violent and pornographic.</P>
      <P>I happen to believe also that there is a link between exposure to violent, pornographic and vulgar videos and the increase in crime, particularly crimes against the person.  The increase in some of the more savage crimes perpetrated in recent times, the increasing crimes against women in particular, are I believe linked to exposure to this kind of film.</P>
      <P>Society must make some effort to protect the public against exploitation of people, of women or of minorities. Therefore I support the principle of censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question that arises is where does censorship apply, to whom does it apply <Col N="1020" /> and to what does it apply.  This question can only be addressed by way of a democratic debate about the nature of censorship and a regular review in this House of the measures that are in place.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Pattison. Instead of introducing legislation dealing with two matters which do not merit legislation, the appointment of additional assistant film censors and the question of a refund of fees paid by an appellant incurred in appealing against a film censor's decision, it would have been better if more comprehensive updated legislation dealing not only with the censorship of films but other material also was introduced.  I suggest that such legislation should also deal with the question which arises time and again about censorship in the public media, particularly in the broadcasting sector.</P>
    <P>I note, for example, that some of the legislation being amended dates back to 1923.  The nature of films has changed dramatically since then.  In 1923 not only were we in the early days of the State we were also in the early days of film as a medium.  I am sure many aspects of Colmcille's prophecy had greater credibility in 1923 than the idea that in every home in the country there would be a box in which one could put a package no larger than a cigarette box and view the modern equivalent of Charlie Chaplin.  I am sure this idea was far from people's minds in 1923.  Therefore, the legislation dealing with censorship needs to be updated.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that if one censors something one will drive it underground and create an illicit demand and a black market for it.  While this is partly true it is not an argument in favour of doing nothing.  The problem in relation to censorship is that down through the years it has been abused to censor material which did not deserve to be censored.  When one thinks of the works of writers that were censored and of the debates which took place in the Oireachtas on the censoring of such titles as <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> it is hardly surprising that the idea of censorship got itself a bad name because of the way it <Col N="1021" /> had been used to censor material which should not have been censored in the first place.</P>
    <P>The focus of concern down the years has weighed heavily on erotic material and morality.  At the same time however the issues of senseless violence and acts of cruelty arising from viewing violent films have received little attention.  In order to continue a productive discussion on censorship we must initiate a shift in our collective emphasis from the moral nature of erotic material to the relationship between violent films and crime. Gentle and preventive measures used while the problem of violence is in its early stages of growth will make potentially harsher measures at a later date less than necessary.</P>
    <P>The main issue surrounding censorship is the inviolability of the human person as laid down explicitly in our Constitution. The protection of this inviolability is a social and collective concern which should seek to prevent acts of cruelty, both common and sexual, against individuals. Yet, Ireland as a whole is witnessing an ongoing increase in violent crimes attested to by the recent savage killing of a Donegal fan following the All-Ireland final.  The tragedy is that this came only a week after a similar incident in my constituency where a young man was literally beaten to death while on his way from a disco.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this kind of violent behaviour is encouraged by the repeated viewing of violent films resulting in a form of desensitisation which permits such crimes.  There are many factors which contribute to crime such as alcohol and drug abuse and record high unemployment. They create an atmosphere in which violent crimes are committed.  It is necessary to recognise and address the issue of societal violence and violent films.</P>
    <P>One need only glance at the relevant statistics to realise the increases in violent crime which we have been witnessing in recent years, especially among juveniles. For instance, the number of convicted or cautioned persons increased by 36 per cent between 1978 and 1990.  Furthermore, <Col N="1022" /> the number of persons under 17 convicted or cautioned rose by 29 per cent approximately.  What is even more frightening is the fact that 50 per cent of all persons convicted in 1991 were under 21 years of age.  The number of violent crimes, especially among young people, is rising.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves which is the greater scandal: the senseless killing of innocent people or the erotic material portrayed in films.  Given that the trend in crime is increasing why have the State and the Church always supported the censorship of erotic material, sometimes at the expense of more violent material? A more definite approach will have to be taken by the State in dealing with the question of exposure to violent crime and, since this Bill deals essentially with videos, exposure to violent crime on videos.</P>
    <P>Many people wonder why in recent times we have seen an increase in a senseless form of violent crime.  I do not think it takes a great deal of deduction to make a clear connection between exposure to violent videos and the increase in violence on our streets.  While I accept the point made by Deputy Cotter that parents should exercise a degree of control over what their children view and are exposed to, it is not just a question of protecting children from material which is not suitable for them having regard to their age and level of development. There is also the question of denying access to violent material to people, either young or old, who may at a later stage be influenced by that material which would lead them to posing a threat to the rest of society.</P>
    <P>I am however curious about this legislation in a number of respects.  First, I am curious as to why it is necessary to introduce legislation essentially to enable additional film censors to be hired.  It would appear that the reason for this legislation, as expressed in the Minister's contribution, is that the volume of videos currently on the market which have not yet been viewed by the censor &mdash; the Minister put the figure at 15,000 &mdash; is so great that additional resources and staff <Col N="1023" /> are required.  Second, the number of videos coming on the market &mdash; I think the Minister put the figure at something in the region of 700 annually &mdash; requires additional staff simply to view their number.</P>
    <P>The question which was not addressed by the Minister in his introductory remarks and which I should like to see addressed before the conclusion of this debate, is why is it necessary to introduce legislation to increase the number of film censors.  Why was it not possible simply to enable the Official Censor of Films to employ assistants just as would be the case in any State body, agency or other controlling body here?  Why did we need legislation to say that additional censors are to be appointed?  That is my first question in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>My second question has to do with the manner in which it is proposed to engage the new assistant film censors.  In his introductory remarks the Minister went through a range of options he says were considered in relation to how film censors should be employed, ranging from additional film censors being employed on a full-time basis to censors being employed on some kind of contract basis. I do not see a great distinction between the employment of film censors on a contract basis and the kind of panel system being proposed in this Bill.  We are being told that panels of assistant film censors will be appointed on a part-time, temporary, non-pensionable basis.  The Minister argues that the reason for employing a panel of assistant film censors is that there are peaks and valleys in the way in which videos come on the market.  I accept that that is the case.  The Minister also went on to argue that there are 15,000 videos out there that have not yet been viewed by anybody.  That negatives the argument for having a panel which can be called on when there is a demand and let go when that demand lessens. It appears to me, from the Minister's remarks, that there is a case made for the employment of additional assistant film censors on a regular, full-time basis. There is nothing to indicate that the numbers <Col N="1024" /> of videos coming onto the market will lessen; if anything, the indication would be that the numbers are likely to increase.</P>
    <P>The only indication there is as to what might be the rationale behind the Minister's proposal is that it will be he who will appoint the panel.  I should like to have this point addressed also.  Why is the Minister for Justice, who has so much on his plate, to occupy himself assessing the competence, experience, knowledge of the film industry and so on, of potential assistant film censors?  If legislation was necessary at all, why was not some simple enabling measure provided by way of legislation which would have enabled the Official Censor of Films to increase the complement of people available to him if and when the need arose, either by the appointment of people on a full-time basis or by drawing from people on a panel?  That would appear to me to have been a much more appropriate way to have dealt with this.  It would have put the engagement of assistant film censors in the hands of somebody with knowledge of the film industry, who presumably would know the requirements that should be met, who would know the work involved and the kinds of qualifications necessary.  Why is the Minister for Justice reserving to himself the appointment of assistant film censors?</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I have to wonder if, in the same way as one could tell a peace commissioner's politics by ascertaining the year in which he was appointed to the position, we are now to have a new designation of film censor &mdash; FC &mdash; and be able to deduce the political persuasion of certain people in our community from the date they were appointed to the panel of film censors.  I must say the only conclusion I can reach in relation to the manner in which the power is being reserved by the Minister for Justice <i>vis-á-vis</i> the panels to be appointed, is that what we are getting here is yet another example of Government wishing to find some way of doling out patronage, by offering people who have done favours in the past, a new chocolate sweet: being able to watch <Col N="1025" /> filthy films and being appointed as film censors for that purpose.  I hope I am not being too harsh on the Government in this respect but, in the absence of any other explanation of why the Minister for Justice wants to reserve himself the right to appoint panels of assistant film censors, when it could be done in some other way, I do not have any alternative.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill about which I am curious is the provision that the fees to be paid for appeals against a film censor's decision are to be refunded in cases where the Censorship of Films Appeal Board find that the appeal should be upheld.  At one level that seems perfectly fair, that if one lodges an appeal and is successful, one should have one's fee refunded.  But I cannot think of any other case in legislation &mdash; certainly not in any of the legislation introduced by this Government &mdash; where fees are to be paid for appeals, where this approach has been taken.  If one takes the example of planning appeals, there was a debate in this House not so long ago about the Government increasing the fee to be payable by members of the public for lodging planning appeals, in the course of which Members on this side of the House asked the Government, whether, in cases where somebody had paid a fee to seek an oral hearing on a planning appeal which was not granted, that fee should be refunded.  The Government refused that request.  Yet here we have a Bill being introduced in the case of the film and video industry stipulating that whenever an appeal is upheld the relevant fee will be refunded.  I wonder whether the Government have been subjected to any kind of pressure on the part of the film industry or the video distribution business to relax the measures being taken in relation to the control of videos, whether this refunding of the fee is in some way extending something to the industry in some kind of trade-off, ensuring that all the films will be looked at by the censor, that there will be a new panel of assistant film censors but, on the other hand, if people are successful in their appeal, they will get their money back.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> I would be much happier about it had the Government a consistent policy in relation to the refund of fees for appeals, which does not appear to be the case.  I am curious why, having refused fees to people in the case of other appeals, it is allowable under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister responding to these questions.  In general my party support this legislation.  We will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage, in particular to deal with our concern about what appears to be in this Bill a possible politicisation of the censoring of films.  I contend the appointment of panels of assistant film censors should be divorced from the political domain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <P>I welcome the Second Reading of this Bill this morning.  It would be my hope that the remaining Stages will be passed quickly also because there is urgent need for the measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Video Recordings Act, 1989, and the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, were before the Dáil, I tabled amendments to both Bills and was supported by Deputies on all sides of the House but particularly by my colleagues on this side.  I remember arguing strongly that pornography led to unacceptable violence against women and children.  I gave a definition that had been drawn up by other countries in this regard.  Unless we legislate for and take strong action against pornography, violence against women and the abuse of children will continue and there will be confusion between hard porn and erotica. For too long we have been afraid to take a strong stand against pornography. I know that the women's movement were aware of invidious attacks on women for many years but fearing that censorship would be considered in an overall way they were reluctant to request that laws be made and action taken against pornography. However, in view of the correlation between pornography and violence against women and abuse of children, it is not a matter of being afraid <Col N="1027" /> to speak out; it has become a matter of civil and human rights.</P>
    <P>A definition should be written into legislation to distinguish between pornography and the depiction of good, healthy sexual love.  Part of the difficulty in this country, with our history and tradition, is that no attempt has been made to distinguish between these two areas and there was a fear that there would be a blanket censorship, denying everybody the opportunity of watching good films filled with loving relationships between men and women.  By defining pornography we would assist in education, particularly sex education, in our schools, and we would also assist the censorship board.  With the appointment of assistant censors, which all of us applaud, guidelines are necessary in this area.  People from various backgrounds may have different perceptions of porn and what should or should not be censored.</P>
    <P>In the past some very fine films displaying eroticism or mature sexual, loving relationships were edited, removing a large part of them, while at the same time unacceptably violent films were passed.  Violence is now regarded by young people as acceptable, macho and almost heroic.  Films containing violence have a great effect on young people and there is a correlation between violent films and the increase in violence on streets and in the home, as referred to by Deputy Gilmore.  This problem is a social one which must be dealt with in legislation.  However, in doing so we must also provide for freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>Much has been written recently, particularly by women and the women's movement about taking a stand against pornography and providing definitions of it.  Men have also joined in this call.  A man from the United States, John Stoltenberg, wrote a provocative book entitled <i>Refusing to be a Man</i> dealing with pressures on men in terms of their sexual perception of women.  He was refusing to be a traditional iron man, recognising that men had been conditioned to having sexual, dominating or even violent perceptions of women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> I welcome very much this debate and the debate on this matter in parliaments around the world.  It is only by dealing with the matter at local level that we will be effective in our aim.  This is a global problem.  Many debates and publications feature the abuse and exploitation of women and children in the developing world.  In Ireland, with our tremendous commitment to helping the poor and less developed countries, it is totally unacceptable that these people be exploited and abused.  I am sure everybody is aware of the making of films called snuff films using the victims of such abuse, and in which the woman or child is killed in the end.  Such films are unacceptable.</P>
    <P>For too long pornography has been perceived as an acceptable industry with the freedom to act as do other industries. A book published by the Montreal Council of Women in 1984 entitled <i>Pornography: A Human Rights Issue Which Concerns Both Men and Women</i> states:</P>
    <P>No one ever asks why blacks and Jews strongly object to hatefilled images of themselves created by those who want to humiliate, destroy or dominate them.  Why, then, are women still being asked why we object to pornography?</P>
    <P>The book also states: &ldquo;Violence against women is an appropriate, even rewarding, social activity&rdquo;.  Hopefully through legislation and education as well as rejection of this type of hard porn we will get across to people the anti-social dimensions of pornography.  There is tremendous ambivalence in regard to pornography such as in men's magazines, page three photographs, and the objectifying and exploitation of women in advertisements and otherwise.  When women object to these matters they are regarded as whingeing, anti-man or narrow-minded.</P>
    <P>Only recently has research and studies been carried out in this area.  A colleague told me of a recent conversation he had with an Irish judge who presides over many of these cases.  He asked the judge to what he attributes the increasing rise &mdash; not just in rape and incest &mdash; but in <Col N="1029" /> perverted rape and incest.  The judge said it was caused by video nasties, blue movies.  This is the view of a man who has evidence presented to him every day in our courts.  The relationship between hard porn, violence against women and abuse of children has been proved over and over again.  I do not have time to give examples but a submission was made by the Irish Campaign Against Pornography and Censorship to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights in 1991 which was backed up with a great deal of research, particularly from the United States.  It was a tremendous help to the committee and made us realise the enormity of the problem as it affects women and children.  I will send a copy of the submission to the Department because I am sure it would be helpful.</P>
    <P>When we discussed this matter at some length during the debate on the Act which prohibited incitement to hatred and the Video Recordings Act, 1989, it was generally acknowledged by Members &mdash; and by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke &mdash; that there was a need to initiate legislation to control this type of abuse.  Indeed, he had started a process of drafting legislation which would concentrate on pornography; I hope that can be introduced in the near future as a follow-up to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should also like to comment on the Second Stage speech of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn.  I reiterate what Deputy Cotter said, that in this area women should be part of the censorship board and assistant censors because research shows that the perception and reaction of women to such pornography may differ from that of men.  However, the board should not be composed of men or women solely, there should be a balance of women and men on the board. I am sure we can discuss this matter in more detail on Committee Stage.  All Members referred to the availability of this type of video and films and their effect on young, impressionable children. Child care workers have told me that the level of sexual sophistication in very young children with whom they come in contact &mdash; and who are looked after in <Col N="1030" /> children's homes &mdash; is frightening because they do not have a healthy perception of sex, they have a totally perverted and distorted view.  If a child in its formative years does not have any other sex education, the terrifying thing is that their perception, as they grow up, is that this is the norm.</P>
    <P>We welcome the sex education programme which has been introduced into our primary schools, where children are at their most impressionable.  Some of the programme should focus on the total unacceptability of this kind of violent sex and sexual degradation.  Children could assimilate that information which would go a long way towards balancing what they are exposed to in other areas.  We cannot protect our children all the time but if we build a strong healthy sexual perception within our children they would reject that type of violent, sickening sexual exploitation when they are exposed to it.</P>
    <P>We must extend the number of assistant censors in the first few years because there is a huge backlog, to which the Minister referred.  Many women write to me &mdash; and to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights &mdash; complaining that because films have not come before the censor they are still widely available.  There are also complaints about unmarked vans in rural areas renting good, healthy videos in the front but which contain unacceptable, violent films in the back.  Very often, these films are released in housing estates to people who are totally unprepared for them and who do not realise the enormity of the damage they do.  We must keep track of that kind of exploitation.  The purveyors of this kind of video must be treated in the same way as drug pushers, because they are exploiting and damaging young people, many of whom may never recover from the experience.  We must view it as seriously as that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's promise of an annual report.  I know there must be a certain amount of confidentiality but I should like the report to be comprehensive. Perhaps there could be a philosophical statement within the report <Col N="1031" /> instead of bald statistics.  Perhaps it could even come before the House to be debated.  It is very important not to throw the assistant censors in at the deep end and to have some kind of qualifying levels in relation to them.  There should also be consistent and comprehensive classification of films, I hope we will pay more attention to that on Committee Stage.  I welcome the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this debate and I am fortunate in following some of the speakers because I know that my colleague, Deputy Cotter, has done a great deal of research in this area.  Deputy Barnes is well known for her role in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights in relation to this issue.  In recent years many of us have felt despondent in relation to the media and their focus on cases of rape, incest, child abuse, and so on, compared with newspapers in the past.  One wonders what has happened in Ireland and whether there has been a tremendous change in attitude.  I would say that part of our problem, particularly during and since the eighties, lies with videos.  As Deputy Cotter said, videos are now found in many Irish homes and are often in constant use.</P>
      <P>Legislation was introduced in 1989 in order to control the videos coming into this country.  I have noticed during my time as a Member of the House that, unfortunately, we are rather slow at implementing regulations and ensuring that controls come into operation.  There has been a certain amount of tardiness in the implementation of controls on videos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the move to appoint assistant film censors.  When one considers that since 1989 the film censor has restricted 221 films one has to ask how many films have been released here.  Even though I am not a researcher on the subject, I know that videos, pornographic videos in particular, have led to many of the problems manifest in our society in recent times.  One recent development of which I am sure the Minister is well aware, has been the installation of satellite dishes, <Col N="1032" /> often seen at the gable end of houses, throughout the country.  As we all know, anyone with a satellite dish has access to continental television programmes, and it is well-known that some continental stations show pornographic material.  I have talked to parents who are extremely concerned about the content of television programmes to which they have access.</P>
    <P>They purchased their satellite dish to gain better access to sporting programmes and so on but they did not realise that they would also be gaining access to pornographic material.  Now, they say, they are half afraid to go out at night, for fear that their older children or a babysitter looking after their children might be watching pornographic movies. I am not sure whether that aspect can be controlled under this legislation but it is a factor we should be aware of.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous growth in the availability of video films and pornographic material.  Deputy Barnes referred to the nondescript vans operating in the video business, which are a common sight in the countryside.  Vans pull up outside various video premises and make accessible to retailers hardcore pornographic videos.  There are retailers who are unscrupulous enough to accept those videos, which will subsequently be found on the top shelf in their shops.  It is well known that a subversive element is making money from the sale of pirate pornographic videos.  In the United States the Mafia have been bankrolled from the business of pornographic movies.  That factor has to be taken into account when we consider the operations of the nondescript, unlicensed vans to which reference has been made. In the Dáil we made a great deal of fuss &mdash; rightly so &mdash; about vans going round to farmers selling various products for animals.  We said we would have to ensure to monitor those vans and that the antibiotics or other products they were distributing were properly regulated.  We now have a problem with vans distributing videos.  Any retailer will say that he or she has been approached by people from nondescript vans who sell pornographic videos.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> Recently in my home county of Kerry, a raid on a premises yielded many pornographic videos.  That was a welcome seizure. I am sure raids are taking place in other parts of the country also.  Pornographic videos are becoming a very big problem and their distribution is something we shall have to try to stamp out.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned a delay in implementing regulations on the control of videos.  I have a concern relating to the number of assistant film censors who will be required to implement the legislation. There should be no restriction on the number of assistant film censors to be appointed.  We will need a big number of them to deal with the estimated 700 videos a year that come into this country as well as the videos already in circulation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of licensing controls on retailers and wholesalers of videos but I have queries about regulations that accompany those licences. For example, if it were discovered that someone was selling pornographic movies from a retail outlet, what would happen to his or her licence?  Will a licence have to be renewed each year? Will account be taken of the way a retail outlet is operated at the time an application is considered?  There is no point in issuing licences unless there are accompanying regulations to ensure that the licensee follows the rules and runs a professional business.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, there is the element of parental responsibility.  We have all seen videos, which may have been recommended as unsuitable for those under 15 years or those under 18 years, the content of which cause concern. Parents do have to take responsibility. We can legislate but ultimately it is a matter for parents.</P>
    <P>The future certification and classification of videos is a desirable development. This Bill is a timely response to a problem we have in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The production and distribution of videos must be a &ldquo;mega-buck&rdquo; business by now.  There has been a proliferation of video outlets in the past few years. Every town and village has at least one <Col N="1034" /> video outlet.  Some shops do a very good business and I have no doubt that some of them are run extremely well.  I am concerned that the very desirable regulations in relation to videos be implemented.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Government to do everything possible to stamp out the piratting of pornographic movies, which certainly provides funds for subversive elements.  It is my belief &mdash; and previous speakers have mentioned this &mdash; that many crimes, particularly crimes against women, emanate from the influence of pornographic material.  Pornography could certainly influence our younger people and our children in the wrong direction and lead to all kinds of problems. Our parents did not have to contend with either videos or televisions and I often wonder the sense of values of Ireland of the past might not be much better than our present sense of values. Every parent and public representative is very interested in this matter.  It is incumbent on all of us to try to do something about these insidious influences.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about censorship. I wish to God we could censor some of those who portray themselves as representatives of our country and who are supposed to act as ambassadors for our country.  Censorship is needed when such people get carried away with emotional performances &mdash; perhaps their objective is to advertise their records and sensationalise their personality.  I refer to the recent incident in which Sinéad O'Connor featured.  I am sure I speak on behalf of everyone when I say that I was appalled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> The other aspect I should like to speak about is the sensationalism that follows the announcement that something is to be censored.  I am amazed at the way in which a great deal of money can be made from such publicity.  I speak particularly of Madonna's book; the way its release was packaged, presented and marketed; and the way it was regarded as contradictory to our sense of values.  From what I have heard, the book is proving to be a best seller around the country and is becoming a prized possession as so many people want to look at it.</P>
    <P>When I consider the number of pornographic movies that have come into this country and the controls that are often sought over &ldquo;girlie&rdquo; magazines such as <i>Playboy</i> I question our sense of priorities and values.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Farrelly</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the number of recommendations of the Gleeson report which have been implemented; if he will give details of those recommendations which have been implemented; if the implementation has been agreed with the representative bodies of the Army; and when it is intended to implement the remainder of the report.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following publication of the Gleeson Commission's report the Government immediately accepted the recommendations relating to remuneration and approved their implementation as recommended.</P>
      <P>Accordingly the increases in pay proposed by the commission have been fully implemented and there has been further enhancement of those pay rates by the additions provided for under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The commission recommended increases in and extention of military service allowance, which combined with rank pay makes up basic remuneration for military personnel, and those increases have been fully applied.</P>
      <P>Military personnel qualify for a wide range of additional allowances, for example, for a variety of security duties such as those connected with cash escorts; for prison duty and for overseas service.  Increases recommended in those allowances have all been fully applied as well as subsequent additions under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission proposed the introduction of several new allowances, for example, for bomb-disposal teams, for instructors, for officers on substitution duty and for personnel maintaining essential public service.  These are fully in place while administrative arrangements <Col N="1039" /> to provide for a number of further new allowances are nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The report of the commission dealt extensively with non-pay aspects of conditions of service and proposed improvements to these.  Meals provided for soldiers now have a greater variety of food items and better nutritional value and more personnel now receive free meals and free accommodation.  Uncertified sick leave facilities for non-commissioned personnel are now in operation.  The first phase of a new comprehensive welfare and counselling service for the Defence Forces, involving the employment of civilian specialists in social work, has been introduced and is working effectively.</P>
    <P>The commission's recommendations in regard to military personnel on overseas service have been implemented.  For those in Lebanon this has meant apart from increased allowances, free telephone calls home to relatives.  Charges have been waived for certain items of equipment which attracted a charge in the past.  Personnel have been reassured that requests for free repatriation on compassionate grounds will be sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>In addition a new scheme of promotion on merit for commissioned officers, as recommended by the commission, is being phased in and a number of competitions for promotion to lieutenant-colonel and more senior ranks have been held in line with the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>In effect about three-quarters of the commission's 170 recommendations have been implemented.  From the beginning there has been full consultation between my Department and the representative associations in regard to the implementation of the Gleeson report.  This consultative process was firmly established following the formal setting up of the associations in May 1991.  The national forum in which both civil and military personnel of my Department meet with the associations on a regular basis, provides the mechanism for the ongoing monitoring of progress.</P>
    <P>As to the remainder of the commission's <Col N="1040" /> recommendations, these relate in the main to the area of management; military structures, organisation rationalisation and deployment; manpower and personnel policy; and superannuation. These are complex matters and a programme to address them systematically and comprehensively is being pursued. Considerable progress is already evident and an examination of organisational and administrative changes affecting the Permanent Defence Force is proceeding.</P>
    <P>The time-frame in connection with the recommendations in the areas to which I have just referred is dependent on the complexity of the issues involved and in many cases on the necessary consultative process with the representative associations. Of their nature, they are different from remuneration recommendations which admit of definitive disposal; organisational reform and rationalisation, for example, are ongoing evolutionary matters rather than once-off issues.  There has been sustained attention by my Department to the Gleeson report and progress with its implementation will continue to be made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing what an election can do for different groups in society.  I am delighted that three-quarters of the commission's recommendations have been implemented at this stage.  May I ask the Minister when he expects the remaining recommendations to be implemented?  The report was published on 31 July 1990, over two years ago.  Can the Minister give a time scale for the implementation of the remaining recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will allow me the indulgence of congratulating Deputy Farrelly, my near neighbour, on his appointment as spokesman on Defence for Fine Gael.  If he wants any information he should come to me or to my office rather than going to the military people.  It is possibly because of inexperience that he may have thought otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the latter part of my reply I indicated <Col N="1041" /> the nature of the recommendations which remain to be dealt with and the difference between those recommendations and the recommendations with regard to pay and allowances.  I want to tell the Deputy and the House that we are working on the resolution of the final recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind wishes.  I am sure there are two different points of view on certain information. I would not say that approaching the military people was due to a lack of experience; rather it was to find out the exact details so that I would have a balanced view when I came into this House. May I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the proposals in regard to voluntary severance pay and early retirement will be introduced?  When does he think these proposals will be introduced?  Is he in favour of the recommendations in the report in this respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely indicating to the Deputy that this House does not normally interfere in the military part of my Department.  Information will be available from my office for the Deputy on any subject he wishes to raise, rather than he contacting the military people.</P>

      <Quest>the current status of the Efficiency Audit Group's recommendations; if, in the light of this, it is proposed to amend Defence Forces Regulations; if so, if he intends to bring these before Dáil Éireann; and the discussions, if any, he has had to date with the relevant representative bodies regarding the implementation of the EAG's recommendations.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group was established by the Government in 1988 to examine the workings and practices of each Government Department with a view to recommending improved or alternative practices or methods which would reduce costs and improve efficiency.</P>
      <P>In the defence area two working groups have conducted studies on behalf of the group.  The first study focused on the civil branches of the Department of Defence and arising from the recommendations made, a second working group was established to examine administration in the military branches of the Department of Defence and within the Defence Forces.  I am informed that this working group have now completed their work and that the Efficiency Audit Group are considering the findings of the working group and will present their report in due course.</P>
      <P>When the second report of the Efficiency Audit Group becomes available, it is my intention to consider its finding and recommendations, together with the findings of the first report.  Earlier this year, I met with the staff associations representing Civil Service staff in my Department at their request to discuss the implications for their members of the first EAG report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister when he received the first report?  Taking into consideration the commitment given in this House to my predecessor, can he say why the report has not been made available?  Will he give a commitment to the House that he will make the first report available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the <Col N="1043" /> activities in my Department and the military section interlock.  There is a working group on the Defence Forces administrative structures and a working group on the civil branches of the Department of Defence.  The first working group dealt with the Department and they reported to the Efficiency Audit Group.  The result of that investigation pointed towards the setting up of the second working group. When the reports of the two working groups are available to me further action will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect the report of the second working group to be completed?  This reminds me of what the relevant Minister did when I was in my last portfolio &mdash; when the Minister received a report from one committee she set up another committee to deal with it and set up yet another committee to deal with the next report.  When will the report be finalised and published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my initial reply, I am informed that this working group have now completed their work and that the Efficiency Audit Group, the mother group so to speak, are considering their findings and will present their report in due course.  I could not put a date on it but I do not expect it will be very long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A study as to how the administration and training of the FCA might be carried out in a more cost effective manner has been underway for some time and is still ongoing.  In that regard <Col N="1045" /> the report of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces clearly underlined the need to examine the whole question of the present deployment of the Defence Forces.  There are some 900 members of the Permanent Defence Force employed full time with the FCA and their pay and allowances amount to approximately £16 million a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread concern in the PDF, the FCA and Slua Muirí that there is a deliberate policy of downgrading these forces so that they will become irrelevant?  That concern has been expressed to me and probably to the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be disappointed if the forces which have been mentioned felt that their service was not appreciated. It is appreciated by me and my Department and, I venture to say, by the citizenry in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That appreciation is not reflected in the finance given to the services to enable them to do the job they are supposed to do.  There has been a reluctance on the part of the Department to fund the forces properly over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers have been roughly the same since 1980, that is, over 13,000.  I indicated in my reply that the PDF people who deal with the FCA, the Slua Muirí and so on are being funded at the rate of £16 million per annum.  As our American cousins say, that is no small potatoes.  The report of the Committee on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces underlined the desirability of examining the whole question of the deployment of the Defence Forces.  I appreciate what the FCA and the other auxiliary forces are doing and the service they are providing. There is no way I will neglect them.</P>

In 1992 to date, 6 cadets, 4 apprentices and 50 recruits have been recruited to the Naval Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>There are 115 women serving in the Permanent Defence Force.  Of this total 105 are serving in the Army and ten in the Air Corps.  This represents 0.96 per cent and 0.98 per cent respectively of the total strengths involved.</P>
      <P>There are 192 women in the FCA which is 1.26 per cent of the total strength.  The most senior rank attained to date by a woman is that of Commandant.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in this House on 14 May 1992 when introducing the Defence Estimate, I have made a decision in principle to end the restrictions which up to now have prevented women from serving in all areas of the Defence Forces.  The military authorities are engaged in the detailed planning necessary to implement this decision.  While it is not possible to say when this planning will be completed, the position is that women are now eligible on the same basis as men for employment on operational and ceremonial duties, for assignment to military courses and for promotion.  In essence the basis of selection in all of these areas will henceforward be suitability rather than gender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister be a little more specific about the progress that the Army authorities are making with regard to his recommendation? I understand from his reply on 14 May that he had instructed the General Staff to set up structures by which the board's report would be implemented.  When does the Minister expect the structures to be in place, because obviously the recommendations he is making and has accepted cannot be fully implemented without the structures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy <Col N="1052" /> that the structures are necessary but the substance of my reply was that women are now eligible on the same basis as men for employment on operational and ceremonial duties.  Military courses are necessary prior to promotion and for promotion itself.  The Army is working on the structures.  The most important part relates to the opportunities for operational duties, promotion, staff courses and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the Minister's decision that he announced in May, but May is the best part of six months ago and it does not seem reasonable to expect women in the Defence Forces to wait any longer for proper structures to be put in place for promotional purposes.  The Minister pointed out that the highest position achieved by a woman so far in the Defence Forces is that of Commandant. Could the Minister, therefore, indicate in broad terms when he expects that the General Staff can report to him that they have the structures in place?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>The question of general recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force is kept under review in the light of operational requirements.</P>
      <P>The annual nett extra cost of our current level of participation in United Nation's peacekeeping missions amounts to approximately £3.6 million.  Normal pay and allowances for the 762 personnel involved amounts to a further £13.3 million.

While obviously there would be some cost, given that service with United Nations forces results in payment from the United Nations to the State of the costs involved would the Government accept that recruitment to the Defence Forces would be an ideal way of taking significant numbers of people who want to join the Army off the unemployment register?</P>

May I ask the Minister therefore if he would at least look at the proposals which have been put forward by the representative association and accept that not only would this be a way of reducing the numbers on our unemployed list but a way of improving and expanding our valuable role in international peackeeping?</P>

I will believe both the United States and the former USSR when they pay their debts.  The Permanent Defence Force provide a satisfactory career for young people.  I am glad that many applications have been received for membership of the Defence Forces.  The Government will make their own decisions in due course as to whether recruitment should start.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 52 units in the FCA comprising 15,212 members.  At 31 August 1982 the strength of the FCA stood at 21,151 personnel.  Up to 31 August this year 7,700 FCA personnel have attended annual training.  It is expected that by 31 December next 8,075 personnel will have attended annual training.  The numbers of personnel who have attended annual training in each of the last five years are <Col N="1060" /> as follows&mdash; 1987, 8,300; 1988, 8,335; 1989, 8,204; 1990, 8,100; 1991, 8,175.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the duties assigned to the FCA I consider that the current strength is satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated in his reply a drop of 6,000 in the number of people serving in the FCA.  Indeed the latter part of his answer would seem to indicate that he is happy with that decrease in numbers.  Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Happiness is not something I predicate of myself very often.  I want to let the Deputy know that from 1982 to 1987 there was a drop in the FCA of approximately 5,200.  Since then there has been an infinitesimal percentage of a drop, the numbers now standing at 15,212 members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is some concern among people active in the FCA and on the part of people training the FCA from the permanent Defence Force about a directive issued by the Minister's Department, or himself, to the effect that the numbers of trainers &mdash; that is trainers from the permanent Army &mdash; should be reduced by 25 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a question on that already and dealt with it before the Deputy came into the Chamber.  There was a recommendation in the Gleeson Report about the PDF personnel involved in the training of the FCA.  The statistics speak for themselves.  Since 1987 we have kept up the numbers and train a substantial number each year. That is not to say that I am complacent about the funding of the FCA.  I would like to be able to invest more money in the force but the approximate 900 personnel, as emerged from an earlier question, involved in the training of the FCA cost the State an annual £16 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1061" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he is prepared to initiate a recruitment drive for the FCA to bring their numbers back to previous levels? He has given figures of a continuous reduction since 1982.  Is he prepared to initiate a recruitment campaign and increase their numbers to their previous levels?  Second, in connection with their duties would the Minister say on what basis &mdash; rotation members are trained? The Minister mentioned 8,000 this year, or up to the end of August in the region of 7,700.  Would the Minister say with what frequency members are trained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to recruitment I should say that the Government of which Deputy Deasy was an efficient and honourable member reduced the FCA by 5,200 approximately.  In 1987 the figures stood at 15,000-plus and have remained at that level.  In the last sentence of my reply I indicated that, having regard to the duties assigned to the FCA, I considered that their current strength was satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I know there are criteria laid down, that if members of the FCA meet those criteria they are eligible for the course of training in any particular year and that, if they have not participated in so many parades and so on, they are excluded.  I cannot answer the Deputy as to whether that is rotated or whether the remainder of the people who were not called, say, this year will be called next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been a constant chipping away at the FCA by successive Governments' policies to the extent that, in many cases, the members feel that the end of the force is in sight?  Furthermore, would he agree that the figure given of 8,000 does not reflect proper man hours in so far as their annual training is and has been reduced in recent years to one week?  Finally would he agree that it is not possible to give any reasonable level of training, nor will it ever be, to FCA personnel within a period of one week in an annual training camp?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1062" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In past years I would say that the week's training would not have been sufficient but the Deputy should remember it is a week's training in camp in addition to the training which takes place throughout the year and the other training courses individual members may have attended.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question I would feel I was not doing my duty if the FCA were not properly appreciated in my Department for the work they are doing and have been doing.  I might add that there is no intention on the part of my Department or the military forces, the PDF, to downgrade the FCA in any way.  In fact I subscribe to the strong theory that the force is as important as the PDF.  I should say I am having a study conducted of the military system in Switzerland where the strong, efficient Army &mdash; of course aided by mountains &mdash; are recruited on similar lines to our FCA.  I know there have been some rumblings of discontent in Switzerland as well but my thinking is along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if there is a curtailment on recruitment or is every suitable applicant who applies accepted into the FCA nowadays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a question I could answer for the entire country.  All I can say is that their strength is being maintained at 15,000-plus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that when my party were in Government between 1982 and 1987 the figure was reduced from 20,000 to 15,000.  Is the Minister telling us that he concurs with the decision made then, that he is not prepared to make his own decision and increase the numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>All I did was read out the facts and I hope they do not irritate the Deputy.  The figure is 15,000-plus, and it is my considered view, and that of the Department, that that is an adequate number to perform the duties.</P>

      <Col N="1065" /> The establishment figure is to a large extent a notional concept which has never been attained and is not directly related to current needs.  In that regard the present military structure is under review in order to arrive at a more realistic establishment figure.</P>

      <P>The establishment figure referred to by the Minister is almost 18,000.  In 1990 the then Minister for Defence indicated that this notional figure as it was referred to was under review.  Why has it taken so long to complete the review?  How soon is it expected that a correct establishment figure will be produced?</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that while the present figure may be notional one must assume that it was originally established to service the various barracks around the country and the various duties the Army needed to fulfil. Given that a number of barracks are being closed down and we have considerable commitments to the United Nations in terms of peacekeeping&mdash; this to some extent is a link to my earlier question &mdash; would it not make sense to recruit to the Army, bringing the figure up to the existing establishment figure, and take on a greater role in peacekeeping?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The way to proceed is to decide on the numbers that are adequate to perform the duties, taking into account our very good record in United Nations peacekeeping.  One must come to a conclusion as to the number needed and that will be the realistic establishment figure. <Col N="1066" /> The recruitment of 1,000 people would cost between £12 million and £14 million per annum in pay and allowances alone.</P>

It was never a notional figure; it was a figure established to assess the security and operational needs of the Defence Forces at the time. The Minister said the matter is being reviewed at present, but Deputy De Rossa said that such a review was also promised by a previous Minister.  Will the Minister say who is carrying out the review?  Is it the Department, the Department in partnership with the Army or a team of professional advisers perhaps, from other countries, or indeed management consultants here?

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my statement in the House on 7 October 1992.</P>
      <P>Investigations into the incident are continuing at United Nations and Irish contingent levels.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Dempsey, conveyed the grave concern of the Government to the Lebanese authorities in Beirut on 1 October 1992.  In particular, the Minister of State asked that the Lebanese Government use their authority and influence to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.</P>
      <P>Ireland's permanent representative to the United Nations in New York raised the issue with his Lebanese counterpart on 9 October 1992.  The Lebanese permanent representative cabled the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Lebanon advising and urging that measures should be taken immediately in relation to the people directly involved.</P>
      <P>Security procedures in respect of all military personnel serving with UNIFIL are under constant review and changes are made when considered necessary. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection.  They are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment and operational procedures are geared to provide maximum safety for our troops consistent with the carrying out of their mission.  In addition, physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is steadily being improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Government continue to avail of every opportunity at the United Nations and in meetings at diplomatic level to press for the implementation of the necessary measures to enable <Col N="1069" /> UNIFIL to carry out its mandate effectively.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I wish to convey my sympathy to the Defence Forces, the family of the man who was killed and the family of the man who was injured in that incident.  Will the Minister agree that the likelihood of the new Lebanese Government taking action in relation to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, who were responsible for this attack, is unlikely until the Israeli Government agree to withdraw from southern Lebanon and cease their support for the so-called South Lebanese Army?  Will he also agree that it is at that level we should exert most of our political pressure &mdash; bilaterally in relation to Israel and at United Nations level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would find it a matter of some delicacy to comment on what the Lebanese Government might do in the circumstances.  I know that the Chief of Staff of the Lebanese Army, who is a very impressive man, is intent on spreading the authority of the Government and his army to areas where they do not have such authority now.  He is recruiting into his army a mix of Muslims and Christians so that his army will not split, as the Lebanese Army did in the past.  With regard to the Deputy's second question, we should leave the matter to the Arab-Israeli negotiations going on at present and not intrude upon them.  The negotiating process has had its ups and downs, but I hope that out of it will come a general peace in the Middle East which will settle the south Lebanon-Israeli border conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that for the last 12 or 14 years the South Lebanese Army have been the cause of most of the violence in south Lebanon and have been, directly or indirectly, responsible for most of the deaths of Irish troops in the area?  Will he also agree that the latest incident, the subject of this question, was possibly the result of a failure of communications and identification on the part of the United Nations <Col N="1070" /> forces in the area?  The party of men who were intent on bombing and shooting at the South Lebanese Army on their retreat did not identify the post as a United Nations one nor did they identify the people who stopped them as being United Nations troops.</P>

It is very difficult to know when an inquiry will end, particularly when the people involved do not owe allegiance to any Government.  We tend to deal Government to Government in these matters and it was for that purpose that the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, went to Beirut to emphasise how seriously our Government took this matter.  As I mentioned, we indicated very strongly, through diplomatic channels, through representation to the United Nations and in other ways, that we take a very serious view of the loss of a soldier of the Irish Army who was there on a peacekeeping mission, probably the most important mission in which any soldier could be engaged at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to welcome the Bill and say that I am glad to have the opportunity to address the House on this issue.</P>
      <P>It could well be said that we are becoming a video-watching society and that a video culture is developing throughout our society.  The popularity of videos is not confined to any one section of our community &mdash; it is not confined to our young people or to our unemployed &mdash; but goes right across the board.</P>
      <P>The way in which the distribution of videos has been allowed to develop without any order and without prohibitions has led to the problems now being experienced in the whole video industry and especially in the proliferation of violent videos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, I welcome the provisions of the Bill.  However, I am disappointed that the Bill fails to give protection to young children, especially in the purchase or rental of videos.  The 1989 legislation on video recordings failed to give that protection and that failure is not remedied by the present Bill.  There is nothing to stop a child from going into a video shop and purchasing or renting a video of his or her choice.  That is a failure of the Bill. No penalty is imposed on those who serve young children.  This Bill should have made it an offence to sell or rent videos to young children and it should have provided for the imposition of fines on the owners or employees of video outlets who commit that offence.  I understand <Col N="1167" /> that the Fine Gael spokesman in this area, Deputy Cotter, has already referred to that aspect.</P>
    <P>The provision for the licensing of wholesale and retail video outlets is certainly welcome.  The development is not before its time.  The widespread sale and distribution of videos from unauthorised outlets has been a major problem.  It is to be hoped that the Bill will ensure that video outlets will now be controlled and be subject to regulation.</P>
    <P>People operating video outlets will also have to be responsible.  They will have to comply with regulations.  That is another positive measure.  To a certain extent those people can control the kind of videos being made available to the public at large.</P>
    <P>The Bill also enables the Film Censor to prohibit the supply of video films that he considers unsuitable for viewing.  This is a very important step.  Ireland generally has a good censorship record in the sense that we are not overcensored.  Many of the videos now freely available do need to be censored, however, which is, as the Minister has explained, one of the primary purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the most important provisions is that concerning the classification of video films in terms of suitability for viewing by different age groups.  In this regard the appointment of assistant censors is vital.  A major commitment in personnel will be required merely to review the existing videos in the country, of which there is a bank of 13,000 to 15,000.  I understand that about 700 new titles come on stream every year.  To examine all of those films will require a major commitment in personnel, which makes the services of assistant censors important. Questions have been raised in relation to the way in which the assistant censors will be appointed.  That is another matter.  The important issue is that assistant censors are appointed and that the appointees have expertise.</P>
    <P>When in operation the classification will provide parents with a means to monitor what their children watch, as videos, I understand from this legislation, <Col N="1168" /> will be clearly labelled as to their suitability for viewing by younger age groups and so on.  However, this puts the onus on parents because, as stated by the Minister, the law cannot interfere with what goes on in the privacy of a family home. Are parents sufficiently responsible to decide what is right for viewing by their youngsters?  For example, in a case where both parents are working can they control what goes on in their home?  In the case of large families where some children may be viewing videos in one room and where some other activity is taking place in a different room, can parents control what is happening?  A major emphasis is put on the role of a family, which must be questioned.</P>
    <P>Also there is a trend nowadays for people to leave home at a young age either to go to school or to go into digs.  In those instances there is no one to decide what is suitable for viewing.  The video culture has taken off since the early eighties. Almost 1,000 new titles are introduced each year.  It is important to point out that most of these videos are not objectionable.  In fact, they can be of educational and recreational value. Videos are very important in that they provide safety valves for society.  Most unemployed people have no recreational facilities, no gymnasium, and were it not for videos would have nothing to occupy their time.  The whole video culture has advantages but videos are becoming so much part of the life of ordinary people that monitoring is important.  Up to now there was little or no control.</P>
    <P>A number of objectionable videos have become available recently.  These have been referred to as video nasties but I feel they should be referred to as vicious videos.  That would describe them more accurately and appropriately.  Most of these videos are directed at violence and pornography and, as many previous speakers have said, they downgrade women and young children especially, who are treated as objects in the videos. I agree totally with previous speakers who said they had led to violence being directed at both women and young children. They have created the impression <Col N="1169" /> that violence in certain forms is acceptable, and that society, by making these videos available, is giving tacit acceptance to the form of behaviour portrayed in these videos.</P>
    <P>Nowadays we are all very impressed by the visual media.  It could be said that the American Presidential election will be won on television.  When we see the influence videos have on young people it is easy to understand the fears expressed by people concerning the transfer from video nasties or, vicious videos, to real life.  That is why it is important that we as legislators do something to control what is happening, and I thank the Minister for making some effort in this regard.</P>
    <P>This matter is not just a problem for young people.  Crime is also perpetrated by the older generation in our society. When one watches some of the serial murderers throughout the world one finds they are mostly older people, all of whom have been influenced by different events in their lives but, no doubt, the influence of videos must also be taken into consideration.  A statistic recently showed that on average each young person views television or videos about three hours a day, mostly in the evening time.  That is an alarming statistic.  That is why we have a very unfit generation of young people, but it also leads to more crime, especially violent crime.  I hope this Bill will do something to control this trend.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, and I have said time and again that young people must be educated in life skills.  At present there are very few life skill programmes in our schools principally because of the race for points and because of exam pressures. Both young people and parents must be educated in how to cope with the visual material being thrown at them at present. Newman said many years ago that an educated person is a person who can detect what is sophistical.  It is important that our young people are able to detect what is sophistical.  It is important that our education system produces people who can make mature decisions for themselves. <Col N="1170" /> The conclusions reached on the contents of a video are personal decisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the attempts being made in this Bill to do something about the uncontrolled manner in which our video industry has been allowed to develop.  I am disappointed that it does not give the protection to children that we on this side of the House would have desired but I welcome it as a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation so far as it goes.  Without doubt it was necessary.  This was found to be the case following the enactment of the last item of legislation relating to videos.  Its desirability is self-explanatory in that it is generally accepted, belatedly, that videos, whether we like it or not, do have an influence of one kind or another on very young or impressionable people.  That goes without saying.  I am not a prude by any stretch of the imagination.  I believe people should as far as is possible, be able to make up their minds as to what is good for them.</P>
      <P>It is alleged that outside an electrical dealer's shop in the main street of a certain town in the midlands on a specific afternoon for the past five years, more people congregated to watch a certain video in the shop window than would be seen at most football matches.  That indicates there was a certain type of material that appealed to a particular sector of the population.  While watching these videos may stop people becoming involved in certain types of crime, in the final analysis certain types of videos can have an adverse influence on people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the benefits of videos and we all accept that they can be beneficial from an educational point of view.  However, there is a downside to them in that much of the street crime that is reported daily can be attributed to some of the undesirable videos that are readily available here.  I do not have to explain to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, the type of street crime I am referring to.  Generally it involves mugging. rape and handbag snatching, the types of crimes that are re-enacted and glorified in these videos. <Col N="1171" /> They are not petty crimes, they are serious crimes.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with this Bill we are debating which is acceptable, desirable and progressive, the Minister should introduce legislation to crack down on the crime that is prevalent in our society at present.  There is no point introducing legislation at this eleventh hour to deal with what I regard as the source of the problem, namely, video nasties, without also addressing the problem of the adverse influence of these videos.  There is obviously a problem or the Minister would not be introducing the legislation in the first place.  I commend the Minister for taking this action but I must point out that there exists in the minds of many people in our society a real fear, with particular reference to women.  Women are in constant fear driving across this city by day or by night.  A couple of weeks ago I witnessed a handbag snatch at traffic lights in this city.  The inspiration for this type of crime came from videos.  I am not saying that they are the only cause but the people who carry out these crimes get their inspiration from certain types of video.  This crime I witnessed took place while at least 20 people stood idly by and did nothing.  Two women in a car were terrorised by a thug who grabbed one of their handbags and ran off towards a well known locality.</P>
    <P>The sad feature of this crime is that it happened in broad daylight.  Similar crimes occur every day and, I am sure, every night.  When I talk about videos, I am referring to video nasties, not the general videos to which I have no objection. I am referring to the type of crime that is glamorised on certain videos. Once upon a time the main character in films was a hero.  Nowadays, it seems that the nastier the gurrier and the more serious the crime which is perpetrated against an innocent victim on some of these videos the more the criminal is glorified. It is a sad reflection on society.</P>
    <P>I am not a prude.  We should have a liberal attitude to this but there comes a time when we must say stop.  We must recognise this problem for what it is.  It <Col N="1172" /> is a good industry for the people who produce these videos but they are of no benefit to society.  For that reason I commend the Minister on the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The classification of videos as a means of enabling parents to identify what is and is not suitable for their children is useful and welcome.  However, I do not believe it can be enforced because of a lack of parental control.  That is one of the criticisms of modern society.  How can we expect parents to supervise their children's viewing?  They would either have to ensure that the children only view certain material by staying in to monitor this or give in to them and allow them watch what they want.  How does society determine that only children of a certain age group are permitted to avail of certain material?  There is no way this can be done and I do not believe legislation can enforce this.  That is a serious flaw in this whole procedure.</P>
    <P>There are those who may say that my remarks are extremely conservative, outdated and, to coin a modern phrase, square.  I was young once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue is who is the greatest beneficiary of a liberalisation of legislation governing videos?  Ultimately, the lowest will become the common denominator, a small group of seedy individuals who produce highly questionable material.  I do not believe society should allow these people to promote their wares to a greater extent than they do.  They are well capable of doing that.</P>
      <P>I applaud some of the proposals in this Bill.  However, it has limitations and certain flaws.  The classification of videos is a great idea but I do not believe it will work.  The Minister, together with this Bill, should introduce legislation to address the problem of street crime which, I believe, is inspired by the videos this legislation seeks to control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some of those videos the victims are <Col N="1173" /> portrayed as people who are cheap, are easy prey for every thug and thief and it is the perpetrator of the crimes who is glorified.  He is portrayed as a macho, tough and callous individual.  There is no compassion or sympathy for the underdog in the video world.</P>
    <P>I wish to make two final points and I do so with sadness in relation to what I regard as the by-product of video nasties, street crime.  Very often, politicians make excuses for people who engage in street crime.  At a public meeting I attended lately at least three elected politicians made excuses for the perpetrators of street crime on the basis that these people were socially deprived.  That is no excuse. Those who commit the types of crime I am referring to do not necessarily come from socially deprived backgrounds or areas.  In any event that is not an excuse.</P>
    <P>Modern technology has made it possible for virtually everyone to view films, mainly via satellite dishes and so on.  The Minister will need to examine this system shortly because some of the material available on satellite channels is highly questionable, is unlikely in any way to improve the quality of life of the people who view it and is equally unlikely to improve the quality of life of the people who have to live with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation in general terms.  It progresses the provisions in the Video Recordings Act to a certain extent.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the serious implications, particularly for young people, if the legislation and criteria governing the sale and rental of videos are not tightened up by the Government.  It is important that those involved in the video business, both retailers and wholesalers, clearly understand that they must adhere strictly to the criteria governing the issuing of licences. The Minister referred to licence costs in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally important to remember that within five years up to 100 satellite television channels will be beaming all kinds of material onto our television screens.  Many of these programmes will be in a foreign language and many will <Col N="1174" /> be perfectly normal, but a certain amount of the material will be grossly unsuitable for young people.  Even though the material shown on any television channel can be videod, this Bill does not really address this issue.  It is important in an era of mass communications that this issue be addressed to whatever extent possible.  I am not sure how one could attempt to censor material which has a detrimental effect on young people when over 100 television channels can be beamed into a small country like Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to classify videos &mdash; for example, videos which can be viewed by persons generally, videos which can be viewed by children under 12 years of age in the presence of an adult, videos which can be viewed by persons of 15 years of age and over and videos which can be viewed by people of 18 years and over.  Obviously this grading is very important in terms of parental control and the kind of material young people are exposed to.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the sale of videos on the black market.  Information which has become available indicates that certain terrorist organisations have become involved to a great extent in the production and sale of pornographic videos and video nasties.  This is a matter for another area of the Department of Justice in terms of border controls and the general wellbeing of the community. Apparently this black market business is very lucrative for terrorist organisations. One cannot really understand the consequences for young people who are repeatedly exposed to video nasties which show extreme violence and contain complete objectionable references to sex, etc.  It is very important that the Department of Justice and people generally are aware of the increased involvement in this lucrative area of the black market by those involved in racketeering, crime and terrorist activities.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ensure that the people appointed as assistant censors have a genuine interest in being appointed to the board and that they have a clear understanding of the classifications referred to by the Minister in his <Col N="1175" /> speech.  Obviously a considerable amount of time will be required to view the several thousand new videos which come on the market every year.  The vast majority of videos are harmless and their story lines are clearly displayed. However, it is important in cases where problems arise that these people clearly understand the requirements of the Bill in terms of classification.</P>
    <P>New advances in video recorders are taking place all the time.  For example, some video recorders can be preprogrammed a fortnight or three weeks in advance while others can record split programmes.  If one records a programme which is three hours long one has to have three hours to spare to watch it.</P>

      <P>When one arrives back from constituency meetings at 2 a.m. one can be held up for a further two hours watching a recorded programme.  Therefore, the assistant censors will have to devote a considerable amount of time to watching and classifying the 1,000 new video recordings which come on the market every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I welcome the Bill in general terms.  It should be borne in mind that a child is entitled to go into a video shop and either buy or rent an adult video.  I am sure the Minister will refer to the requirement for continuing parental observations of the material contained in videos.  Video outlets are open quite late at night and at present many people, who should not be allowed to do so, can rent adult videos.  It is well known that while the material on display in some video outlets may be completely inoffensive and perfectly watchable, there are other shelves, which are not seen by the public, where the video nasties and hard pornographic videos are kept.  Obviously this is not the case in all video outlets, but it happens in some.  There should be constant monitoring of the material available <Col N="1176" /> in all video outlets.  I hope that the practical implementation of the provisions in the Bill will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  I commend the Minister on his initiative in addressing this problem which has been a source of concern for many parents.  The arrival of videos on our market led to the development of a dirty trade.  The expression &ldquo;dirty trade&rdquo; does not adequately describe it.  A very lucrative dirty trade has been going on for many years.  Many cowboy operators from the twilight zone of the Border where I live have made a lot of money from importing pornographic videos which have been freely on sale in outlets in every county.</P>
      <P>Various Deputies have referred to the current level of crime.  In the past 20 years the crime rate has become totally unacceptable.  There is no single reason for the growth in crime.  Unemployment has a certain amount to do with it, allied to the appearance in society of the liberals and the people who believe that everything can be rationalised.  Unfortunately there is a criminal class.  In Dublin the level of crime is on a par with any city in Europe.  Many would-be tourists are deterred from coming here.  Crimes against tourists have been well chronicled in the newspapers in recent years, including the tragic death of an English tourist in O'Connell Street, almost in broad daylight. There have been many cases of tourists whose cars and handbags have been stolen and the incidence of such crimes has reached a totally unacceptable level.  There is a belief in certain quarters that it pays to engage in crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons for the rise in crime is society's liberal attitude to the perpetration of crime.  There is always somebody from the bleeding heart brigade to say that the accused was illtreated as a child, that his mother let him fall on his head or some other ridiculous excuse. It is the absence of deterrents that has brought us to this.  Murder is now commonplace. The tragic events in the North are met with a kind of acceptance by <Col N="1177" /> society here in that they are no longer a nine day wonder.  We read lurid reports in the newspapers every day of grotesque murders committed in this State.  The incidence of rape is frightening.  The fact that 31 cases are currently before the Central Criminal Court indicates that this type of crime is not being controlled.  I am not blaming the Minister, who inherited the problem.  Irrespective of the Government in office, there is no punishment to fit the crime.  In the case of rape, a frightful and traumatic crime, I have my own particular remedy.  I would refer the Minister to the system of chemical castration employed in the southern states of America.  That would solve the problem for the person involved and would make society a lot safer, especially in the case of a persistent sexual offender.  Most sexual deviants or criminals are recidivists.  They do not get the message.</P>

      <P>Much of the trade in videos, particularly pornographic videos, involves paramilitary organisations.  It is a well known means of fund raising for the IRA and the UDA in the North.  These people are totally involved and I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there are responsible <Col N="1178" /> people in the video trade.  Regarding the proposal to issue a licence to people trading in videos, how does the Minister propose to monitor the operation of the system?  We probably have more legislation on the Statute Book than most other countries.  We are very good at introducing legislation but not too good at monitoring it.  Will there be constant surveillance and will a unit of the Garda Síochána be involved in monitoring?</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's initiative in introducing this Bill and I hope it will be a step towards the curtailment of what is a very dirty trade.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do na Teachtaí a thóg páirt sa díospóireacht maidir leis an mBílle seo.</P>
      <P>Deputies deserve to be congratulated on their contributions to this debate.  The Bill is simply to enable the provisions of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, to be brought fully into operation.  There is general agreement that the video market needs to be adequately controlled to prevent the circulation of violent or pornographic material.  All the necessary controls were provided for in the 1989 Act. We are providing the necessary resources to the Censor's office so that the last link in the chain of controls provided for in the 1989 Act can be brought into operation. That means simply the examination, classification or prohibition of all new video films intended for release and the systematic examination of approximately 12,000 videos currently in the market to see if they are suitable.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cotter for his well thought-out and constructive contribution. He raised a point, which was echoed by Deputy Kenny, regarding the black market.  The Deputy is quite right.  There is quite a sizeable business distributing, manufacturing and controlling the use of pornographic videos in the country.  It accounts for a lot of money.  Deputy Cotter put a figure on it &mdash; I will not say yes or no to that except to say that it is big business and it needs to be controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the provisions of the 1989 Act requiring the certification <Col N="1179" /> and labelling of all new videos will make a black market in videos more difficult to operate.  I do not think I can go any further than that at this time.  It will certainly help the Garda to identify illegal videos.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cotter commented at some length on the question of children buying these adult videos.  Deputy Deenihan also mentioned it.  In that regard the 1989 Act aims to control the situation by providing for the labelling of videos as to their suitability for young persons.  This provides guidance to parents.  However, putting a legal responsibility on retailers would create enforcement problems.  We are all aware of these in the intoxicating liquor trade.  In the case of videos the problem would be even more difficult. Instead of one there would be three age groups to deal with &mdash; 12, 15 and 18 year olds.  It would be asking a lot to oblige a retailer to establish the age of a young person with that degree of accuracy and, anyway, would the imposition of such a responsibility on the retailer have any real practical effect?  For example, if an 18 year old or somebody who is over 18 years of age rents a video, is it not then available to his six year old friend or his brother or his sister?  That is the difficulty. Deputy Cotter is quite right when he says that that kind of control can only be exercised by parents who know where their children are, what they are viewing and with whom they are viewing it.  That is the reason the 1989 Act was passed in the way it was.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cotter questioned the position of the assistant censors.  That was also echoed by Deputy Pattison.  In effect, the qualifications that would be required for assistant censors could be summarised as follows.  There are no special academic or technical qualifications required for the position of assistant censor.  What is required here is somebody who has a practical common-sense attitude, possibly with some interest in films or videos; and the person would need to be nonprejudicial in order to perform the task objectively.  This is the kind of person who has been appointed in the past to <Col N="1180" /> perform censorship work and it has always worked out very satisfactorily. Such people included parents, teachers, those who are involved with the young and those who have a good deal of common-sense and understand modern day situations.</P>
    <P>The Question of appointing women was raised by Deputy Barnes.  I would like to assure her that it would be my intention to ensure that women are adequately represented. It would be only reasonable that in circumstances where we are dealing with children's viewing of films women and mothers would be involved as well.  I will take on board what the Deputy has said in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison raised the question of banning some books and films on rather doubtful grounds.  This, in hindsight, might very well be the case.  However, I would ask him to accept that society changes and moral standards change too and I believe that the existing Censorship Board and the Film Censor examine books and films by reference to what present day society finds acceptable.  That is really the yardstick that one has to apply in this case.  The assistant censors, together with the Censor, are living in the modern world.  They will recognise what is tolerable and acceptable today and we would expect them to apply that criteria to their decision making.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison requested that the video nasties should be tackled at source. That was also stated by Deputy McGahon. It is a good point, because it involves the whole question of seizures by the Garda.  What Deputy McGahon said is quite true.  A lot of business, if one could call it that, has been undertaken by certain groups in this matter in this country over the past few years.  There are factories producing filth.  I would rather the Deputies did not press me to give details, but the Garda have made quite substantial seizures in different parts of the country &mdash; in Deputy McGahon's part of the country in particular and further south &mdash; involving millions of pounds worth of equipment and videos.  I am not at liberty today to give any great details except to say that it is a constant concern <Col N="1181" /> of the Garda to keep on top of this.  It is regrettable that the money from this business goes into a certain area of operation that we would wish to stop finally by law.  We hope that we will make further progress in that regard, that there will be further seizures and that we can stamp it out once and for all.  The Garda have committed a lot of effort and resources in this area of activity, over the past six months particularly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked why legislation was needed to appoint assistant censors and why they should be appointed by the Minister.  The simple answer to that is that the assistant censors will be exercising statutory functions that can only be conferred on them by statute.  The reason they must be appointed by the Minister has nothing at all to do with party politics.  They will be exercising statutory powers on a par with those exercised by the Censor.  It is appropriate therefore, that, just like the Censor, they would be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There was a desire for a comprehensive Bill.  Deputy Pattison made some comment on that.  It was a reasonable point to make and it is probably a good idea.  I just have to say by way of explanation that I do not have the resources at the moment.  We have an enormous book of legislative proposals that have to be brought forward.  We will be very busy in that regard and there are some criminal matters that need to be attended to as well.  For that reason I do not have the resources at the moment to deal with the Deputy's request.  However, it is something that can be taken up at a later date when I would like to be able to pursue it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore was anxious about emphasis being placed on violent as opposed to erotic videos.  In the Video Recordings Act the criteria by which videos may be prohibited include incitement to commit crime or the stirring up of racial hatred as well as the matter of sexual pornography.  We are providing for a refund of fees in so far as successful appeals are concerned because that has always been done in regard to films.  We <Col N="1182" /> are really bringing videos into line with current practices relating to films.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes raised an interesting point.  She spoke about the need to have new definitions in relation to pornography. Most people do not wish to see grossly offensive, violent or indecent films on public view.  That is a fact and it is well that we should say it here collectively today.  That is the reason I am so pleased that the Bill is getting the unaminous support of the House.  I think everybody would be happy to have films vetted by the official Censor by reference to the criteria set out in section 7 (2) of the 1923 Act and in the video Recordings Act.  I accept that those criteria are broad in definition, but this is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>What constitutes the norms of public decency or public morality is difficult to define in exact legal terms and obviously these change from time to time.  The factual position is however that over the years censors, through the interpretation of the existing provision in the light of prevailing public opinion, have been able to set standards of censorship which are to a great extent acceptable.  This is evidenced by the small number of appeals against decisions of the Film Censor in relation to the number of films submitted. For example, in the period 1980 to 1991, 4,378 films have been submitted to the censor.  Only 32 of his decisions on those films have been appealed.  I would hope for the same kind of percentage so far as the new assistant censors are concerned. This will be uppermost in my mind when I come to appoint them, that they will deal with these videos expeditiously and in a proper way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane asked if licences could be withheld from dealers who sell pornographic videos.  It is an offence to supply a video recording containing a video work in respect of which a prohibition order has been made.  The 1989 Act already provides that the censor shall not grant a licence to a person in respect of a period for which he is disqualified from holding a licence.  Persons are disqualified by the court from holding a licence for five years if convicted of two or more offences under the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> Deputies Kenny, Durkan and Finucane referred to the problems encountered in relation to satellite television programmes.  Deputy Cotter mentioned that it is very difficult to control these matters and made the point that parents have a huge responsibility in supervising their children in the home.</P>
    <P>By way of explanation in this matter an EC directive on broadcasting activities came into force on 3 October 1991. Briefly, this directive sets minimum criteria for broadcasting in each member state and imposes some obligations on broadcasters.  While a member state cannot restrict the retransmission or reception of broadcasts which comply with the terms of the directive and originate in another member state a number of provisions are incorporated into the directive to safeguard the physical, mental and moral development of minors.</P>
    <P>Article 22 of the directive refers to this matter specifically.  It states:</P>
    <P>Member states shall take appropriate measures to ensure that television broadcasts by broadcasters under their jurisdiction do not include programmes which might seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular, those that involve pronography or gratuitious violence.  This provision shall extend to other programmes which are likely to impair the physical, mental and moral development of minors except where it is ensured, by selecting the time of the broadcast or by technical measure, that minors in the area of transmission will not normally hear or see such broadcasts.  Member states shall also ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement to hatred, on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.</P>
    <P>The relevant provisions of the directive have been transposed into Irish law under the Broadcasting Act, 1990.  These were supplemented by two sets of regulations which became operative with effect from 3 October 1991.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> Deputy Durkan also raised the question of the role of videos in inciting certain types of crime.  I should say to him that section 3 (1) (a) of the Video Recordings Act, 1989 recognises this danger and enables the Censor to prohibit videos which may incite persons to commit crimes.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon touched on a matter about which I am particularly concerned at this time, that is, the activities of certain individuals and groups who are pursuing this matter in an organised, commercial way close to the Border.  This involves the illegal importation and copying of tapes in factory units in a professional way for sale on the black market.  It is our intention to try to put those operators out of business.  I am sure the House will support the Garda in their attempts to do this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cotter carried out much research for his contribution and spoke about the effect video nasties have on adults as well as children.  He also mentioned that parents have a huge responsibility in these mattes and in making sure that they know what their child is doing at any given time.</P>
    <P>I have tried to respond to most of the questions raised by Deputies.  They will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to go into these matters in more detail, if they so wish.  While I look forward to that debate I should say that the response we have received on Second Stage has been encouraging.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>I hope so and I appreciate your concern, Deputy Pattison.  I am glad to be able to bring this Bill before the House at this time.  The issue of interception of communications, or as it is sometimes more colloquially called, telephone tapping, makes the headlines from time to time.  Although many of the issues that give rise to those headlines may be outside the scope of this Bill, which has a precise purpose, the Bill is important for two good reasons.  First, it will place on a statutory basis the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interceptions of postal packets and telecommunications and, in so doing, introduces two new provisions for controlling the exercise of the Minister's powers in that respect.  Second, it takes full account of the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the purposes &mdash; and the only purposes &mdash; for which the Minister may authorise interceptions shall be those of criminal investigation <Col N="1186" /> and the security of the State.  It also sets out in detail the procedure that must be followed before an interception can be authorised.  The two new provisions it introduces for controlling the exercise of the Minister's powers are, first, for the operation of the Act to be kept under review by a judge of the High Court and, second, for the appointment of a legally qualified referee to investigate complaints of improper authorisation by the Minister.</P>
    <P>To accept in general the provisions of this Bill one must first of all accept in principle that a system of authorised interceptions is justified.  I say this because I contend that any reasonable person will recognise that it is important to preserve the privacy of communications and that any breach of that privacy could only be made in the most controlled and exceptional of circumstances. To that end the system of authorised interceptions in this Bill embodies the reconciliation of two important principles.  The first is the privacy of correspondence and telephone calls; the second is the need to combat crime and subversion.</P>
    <P>Little needs to be said as to the importance of preserving the privacy of communications.  If you post a letter, you expect it to be delivered unopened to your correspondent; if you make a telephone call, any telephone call, whether it is made from your home, office or car, you do not usually want third parties to listen to it and you do not want it published in newspapers or otherwise published. Indeed, it is not too much to say that it is one of the features of life in a free country that people should be able to write to other people, or speak to them on the telephone, without their letters or telephone calls being intercepted.  Interception of letters or telephone calls, except under lawful authority, is an offence under sections 84 and 98, respectively, of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  I will refer further to those important provisions in a moment.</P>
    <P>It has always been recognised that the importance of combating serious crime or <Col N="1187" /> subversive activities is so great and that it should prevail, in strictly limited circumstances, over the principle of privacy. For example, the Garda may have information that a kidnapping has been planned or that a large quantity of dangerous drugs, or of arms or explosives, is about to be imported or moved, and there may be good reason to believe that the final arrangements are going to be made by telephone calls between some of the persons involved.  If the telephone calls could be listened to, this might provide a link in the investigations which would enable the crime to be prevented or detected. In fact the European Court of Human Rights has accepted that, and I quote,</P>
    <P>...the increase of crime and particularly the growth of organised crime, the increasing sophistication of criminals and the ease and speed with which they can move about have made telephone interception an indispensable tool in the investigation and prevention of serious crime.</P>
    <P>It is because of the conflict between the need to preserve the privacy of postal and telephone communications in general and the need to allow them to be intercepted in particular circumstances that the system of interception under the authority of a warrant by the Minister for Justice has been established.  The actual interceptions are carried out by the appropriate officials of An Post or Bord Telecom on foot of a direction under section 110 of the 1983 Act but, in every case, there must be a warrent by the Minister for Justice authorising the interception by reference to the address or telephone number in question.  Thus, the Minister has cast on him the disagreeable duty of deciding whether the need to combat crime or subversion obliges him to authorise the official opening of people's correspondence or eavesdropping on their telephone calls.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of the Bill. It is similar in many respects to the Bill presented to the Dáil in 1985 but which was never debated and to the Private <Col N="1188" /> Member's Bill presented in 1990.  There are differences; some of these are more than drafting changes and some are made necessary by the passage of time. However, there are some substantive changes.  I will explain the reasons for these when I come to the provisions in which the changes occur.</P>
    <P>The only definition in section 1 to which I need refer at this point is that of &ldquo;interception&rdquo;.  This definition is fundamental to the Bill.  Stated briefly, &ldquo;interception&rdquo; means opening a letter or listening to, or recording a telephone call, except that in the case of a telephone call the definition will not apply in a case where either party to the call has consented to the listening or recording.  This Bill does not create any offence of unauthorised interception.  As I have already said, what it does is to regulate the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interception.  The actual offences of unauthorised interception are at sections 84 and 98 of the 1983 Act.  For example, section 98 makes it an offence to intercept telecommunications messages being transmitted by Telecom Éireann or to disclose the existence, substance or purport of any such message which has been intercepted or to use for any purpose any information obtained from any such message.  The penalties for interception are severe; on conviction on indictment the fine could be as high as £50,000, or imprisonment for up to five years, or both.</P>
    <P>Also, in these days of continually advancing technology the meaning of &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; is important in the context of interception.  &ldquo;Telecommunications&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill; neither is it defined in the 1983 Act. One has to go back to the last century to trace the meaning of the word &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo;. With the assistance of case law it is clear that the fact that a particular method of communications was not invented or contemplated when definitions were first provided in legislation does not prevent that method from falling within the meaning of &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo;. Therefore, modern means of telecommunication are taken <Col N="1189" /> to come within the meaning of &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 2, read with section 3, lays down the fundamental requirements of the Bill that interception of letters and telephone calls may take place only in accordance with an authorisation given by the Minister for Justice and that the only purposes for which the Minister may given an authorisation are those of criminal investigation or of the security of the State.  The reason I said that section 2 has to be read with section 3 is that the actual interceptions, as I said they are at present, will be carried out by An Post or Bord Telecom as the case may be in accordance with directions by the Minister for Communications.  These directions are given under section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  What section 3 of the Bill does is to provide that a direction by that Minister, if it is one requiring an interception, shall be given or remain in force only if and for so long as there is in force an authorisation by the Minister for Justice applying to the interception.  An authorisation by the Minister for Justice must be given by a written warrant signed by him except that in a case of exceptional urgency he may give it orally in the first instance, but in that case he must confirm it by a written warrant as soon as may be.</P>
    <P>I stress the requirement that the only purposes for which an interception may be authorised will be those of criminal investigation or the security of the State. These are the same restrictions as have been established by governmental undertakings in the past.  It is also important to note that under section 2 the power to authorise interceptions will be much more restrictive against the Executive than is required under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Under Article 8 of the Convention interference with the right of privacy for correspondence is permitted if it is &ldquo;necessary in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&rdquo;. <Col N="1190" /> Thus, of all the grounds for authorising interception on which the convention permits Governments to rely, we shall be relying on only two &mdash; national security and the prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>Section 2 includes other provisions restricting the power of the Minister for Justice to issue a warrant.  Read with sections 4 and 5, it restricts the cases in which warrants may be issued for the purpose of criminal investigation and the security of the State respectively; this restriction is that the Minister shall not give an authorisation unless he considers that the particular conditions laid down in sections 4 and 5 respectively stand fulfilled.  Under section 2 the Minister must also consider that there has been no contravention of the procedure which under section 6 must be observed before he may issue the warrant.  The warrant will have to include a positive statement that these requirements have been complied with.</P>
    <P>The warrant will specify the relevant postal address or telephone number.  In the case of a postal address it will also limit the authorisation to particular addressees unless the Minister considers that this would be prejudicial to the purposes of the proposed interception.  A warrant will remain in force for a maximum period of three months but may be renewed for similar periods provided that the same conditions as justified the original issue are fulfilled.  The Minister may, before deciding whether to issue or renew a warrant in a particular case or in a case of any particular class, consult the judge of the High Court who, as I mentioned at the beginning, will have the duty of keeping the operation of the legislation under review.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the conditions which the Minister for Justice must consider to stand fulfilled in order to justify him in issuing a warrant authorising interception for the purpose of criminal investigation. The offence or suspected offence being investigated must be a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; as defined in section 1.  This means that it must fulfil both the following requirements. First, it must be an offence punishable with at least five years' <Col N="1191" /> imprisonment.  Second, it must involve loss of human life, serious personal injury, serious loss of or damage to property, or a risk of this; or it must result, or be likely to result, in substantial financial gain; or the facts and circumstances must make the offence a specially serious one of its kind.  The investigations already being undertaken must have failed, or be likely to fail, to produce, or to produce sufficiently quickly, the required information or evidence sufficient for the purpose of a prosecution and there must be a reasonable prospect that the proposed interception will help to provide such information or evidence.  In the case of an offence apprehended but not committed, the last of the conditions I have mentioned will be that there is a reasonable prospect that the proposed interception will be of help in preventing the commission of the offence or in detecting it if it is committed.  In addition to these conditions it will be necessary also &mdash; and I stress this particularly &mdash; that the importance of obtaining the information or evidence concerned is in all the circumstances, and notwithstanding the importance of preserving the privacy of letters and telephone calls, sufficient to justify the interception.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister for Justice will have to take a considered decision, in each case, after balancing the claims of privacy for communications and those of criminal investigation, before deciding that the needs of criminal investigation must prevail.  Only if he so decides will he have power to issue a warrant.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the conditions which the Minister for Justice must consider to stand fulfilled in order to justify him in issuing a warrant authorising interceptions in the interests of the security of the State.  In this case the Minister must consider that, and I quote from section 5 (a):</P>
    <P>there are reasonable grounds for believing that particular activities that are endangering or likely to endanger the security of the State are being carried <Col N="1192" /> on or are proposed to be carried on,</P>
    <P>Moreover, the section requires that other conditions, similar to those that apply under section 4 in the case of warrants for the purpose of criminal investigation must, in the Minister's opinion, stand fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the procedure that must be gone through before the Minister may issue a warrant authorising an interception. This is not a mere technical matter as procedural provisions sometimes are: on the contrary, it is vital to the legislation.  The purpose of the procedure laid down in the section, which complements sections 4 and 5, is to secure that warrants are issued only in furtherance of investigations already in existence. Neither the Minister nor officials of his Department will be able to initiate the process leading to an interception.  If the purpose of the proposed interception is that of criminal investigation, the process will have to be initiated by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  If the purpose is that of the security of the State, the process will have to be initiated by either the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or the appropriate military officer of the rank of colonel or above designated by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The commissioner or the designated officer will have to make an application in writing containing sufficient information to enable the Minister to determine whether the relevant conditions stand fulfilled.  The application will be sent or given to an officer of the Department of Justice nominated by the Minister for the purposes of the Act.  An application by the designated military officer will require to be accompanied by a supporting recommendation by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The nominated officer of the Minister will consider the application and make a written submission to the Minister stating whether in his opinion the relevant conditions under the Act for the issue of a warrant stand fulfilled or, if not, in what respects they fail to do so.  The decision whether to issue a warrant will of course <Col N="1193" /> be that of the Minister himself.  Section 6 formalises the procedure for application for warrants for the rigorous scrutiny of such applications.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides a particular procedure for the ending of an authorisation for interception in a case where interceptions are no longer required for the purposes for which they were authorised. It is another safeguard which will ensure that interceptions are kept to the minimum necessary for the purpose for which the power is conferred.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning that the Bill introduces two new provisions for controlling the exercise by the Minister of his power to authorise interceptions. The two new provisions are contained in sections 8 and 9.  These sections serve quite different purposes.  Section 8 provides for a judge of the High Court to keep the operation of the Act generally under review, irrespective of any complaint by a member of the public as to how it is operated; section 9 provides a procedure under which a person who believes that his letters or telephone calls have been intercepted may have the matter investigated and may obtain redress if it is found that the interception, if it took place, was improperly authorised. Before describing the two procedures in more detail, I would remind Deputies that the sections deal only with interceptions where there has been a warrant by the Minister.  The sections are not concerned with illegal interceptions, which are a matter to be dealt with by the prosecuting authorities and the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the Government shall designate a judge of the High Court to carry out the duty, if he accepts the invitation to do so from the President of the High Court, of keeping the operation of the Act under review and ascertaining whether its provisions are being complied with.  The judge's duty will include that of reporting to the Taoiseach at intervals of not more than two years on the general operation of the Act and from time to time on any matters that the judge considers should be reported.  The judge will have power to investigate any case in which an authorisation has been <Col N="1194" /> given.  It will be for him to decide what numbers of cases he should investigate in order to determine whether the Act is being complied with.  For the purposes of his functions he will have access to, and may inspect, any official documents relating to an authorisation or the application of it.  Further, any person who was concerned in the giving of an authorisation or in the application for it, or has any information relevant to these matters, will be required to give to the judge, if requested by him, all the relevant information in his possession.</P>
    <P>The result of these provisions will be that the judge will be able to select for investigation, whether at random or otherwise, any case in which an authorisation has been given, that he will be able to examine all the official documents relevant to the case and that he will be able to require any person to give him any information in his possession concerning the case.  He will thus be able to trace every warrant to its source, and no official or other person will be able to object on the ground of secrecy, confidentiality or any other ground to giving him any relevant information.  So the whole process will be subject at all times to scrutiny by the judge.</P>
    <P>The designated judge will make reports to the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach will be required to cause copies of all these reports to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The reports will be laid in full except that, if the Taoiseach considers that the publication of any matter in a report would be prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime or to the security of the State, he may exclude that matter from the copies of the report as laid.  Before deciding to exclude any matter he will have to consult the designated judge, and every report when laid has to be accompanied by a statement as to whether any matter has been excluded from it.  Apart from these formal reports the designated judge will, if he thinks it desirable, be able to communicate with the Taoiseach or the Minister on any matter concerning interceptions.</P>
    <P>There are three other important provisions <Col N="1195" /> designed to strengthen the supervisory role which the designated judge will play in relation to interceptions. First, section 8 (6) provides that, if the judge informs the Minister that he considers that a particular authorisation should not have been given or should, because of circumstances arising subsequently, be cancelled, or that it should not have been renewed, the Minister shall, as soon as may be, inform the Minister for Communications and shall then cancel the authorisation.  Second, there is the provision in section 2 (7) that the Minister may consult the designated judge before deciding whether to give or renew an authorisation in any particular case or in a case of any particular class. Third, section 9 (6) gives the designated judge, in certain circumstances which I shall mention when I come to deal with section 9, the function of determining whether the Minister was right in considering that a particular offence was a serious offence as defined in section 1.</P>
    <P>Before leaving section 8 I would like to mention the differences between it and the 1985 Bill.  The reference to a judge of the Supreme Court has been deleted. On consideration it has been decided that it would be inappropriate for a judge of the Supreme Court to undertake these duties.  Also in the Bill, the President of the High Court will invite, after consultation with the Minister, a High Court judge to undertake the duties specified in the section.  If the judge accepts the invitation the Government will designate him for the purposes of the Act.  It is more appropriate that the initial invitation come from the President of the High Court rather than the Government having regard to the President's duties in regard to the allocation of business among judges of the High Court.  Having regard to the duties which would be imposed under section 8 it is the intention of the President of the High Court that the designated judge would not take part in criminal trials or appeals.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10, which are to some extent interlocked and which I must <Col N="1196" /> admit are complicated in places, are intended to secure two objects which in the nature of things cannot be easily reconciled &mdash; hence the complications. The first object is that, although the question whether an authorisation should be issued in a particular case must be a question for the Minister's decision, it is right that a person who believes that his letters or telephone calls have been intercepted and that the Minister was not justified by the Act in authorising the interception should be able to have the matter investigated and to obtain redress if this is the case.  The second object which must be achieved is that of maintaining, as far as possible, the secrecy of interceptions.  It is obvious that persons suspected of complicity in crime or subversive activities should not be able merely by instituting legal proceedings to discover whether their communications have been intercepted. If this were possible, the whole purpose of authorising interceptions &mdash; that of combating crime and subversion &mdash; would be frustrated.  Briefly, the solution adopted by the Bill is to provide that a breach of the provisions of the Act will not enable a person affected to take proceedings in the courts, except for a cause of action that is an infringement of a constitutional right to privacy.  Instead he will be able to have the matter investigated by a legally qualified &ldquo;complaints referee&rdquo; equipped with all the necessary powers, including power to quash the authorisation and award compensation to the complainant.</P>
    <P>There is a significant difference between section 9 (1) in the 1985 Bill and section 9 (1) in the present Bill.  Since the 1985 Bill was prepared the High Court has held that the unenumerated personal rights guaranteed by the Constitution include a right to privacy in respect of telephone conversations and the right to hold such conversations without deliberate, conscious and unjustified interference and intrusion by servants of the State.  The court said that the right to privacy was not an unqualified right.  Its exercise might be restricted by the constitutional rights of others and was subject <Col N="1197" /> to the requirements of the common good and to public order and morality.  I have been advised that, in the light of that decision, there would be a risk of a successful constitutional challenge to the Bill if it were enacted including section 9 (1) of the 1985 Bill which sought to preclude a cause of action for a breach of the provisions of the Act.  I have, therefore, amended section 9 (1) as to make that provision inapplicable to a cause of action where such a breach also constitutes a breach of an individual's constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>Section 9 also sets up the office of `Complaints Referee&rdquo;.  In the 1985 Bill the &ldquo;Complaints Referee&rdquo; procedure was provided for as an alternative to a cause of action in a court for a breach of a provision of the Act.  Even though, as I just mentioned, an action for such a breach where it also constitutes a breach of a constitutional right will be possible, I propose nevertheless to retain the &ldquo;Complaints Referee&rdquo; procedure as a simple, inexpensive and easily availed of remedy which will be open to aggrieved persons as an additional safeguard.</P>
    <P>The holder of the office of &ldquo;Complaints Referee&rdquo; will be a judge of the Circuit or District Court or a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years' standing.  He will hold office for a term of five years and will be eligible for reappointment and while he may resign at any time, he may be removed only for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and upon resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for his removal. The conditions as to when the referee may be removed from office will thus be similar to the conditions for the removal of a judge from judicial office, so the referee will be wholly independent in the exercise of his office.</P>
    <P>Any person who believes that a letter sent to or by him, or a telephone call made to or by him, has been intercepted after the commencement of the Act in the course of its transmission, will be able to apply to the Complaints Referee for an investigation.  The referee, unless the complaint appears to him to be frivolous or vexatious, will then investigate <Col N="1198" /> whether there was a relevant authorisation in force at the material time.</P>
    <P>If the referee concludes that there was not a relevant authorisation in force at the material time, then he will simply give notice in writing to the complainant that there was no contravention of the Act and that will be the end of the matter. As I have explained, the referee will be concerned only with breaches of the Act and if he finds there was no authorisation under the Act there will be no occasion for him to inquire whether there was an unauthorised interception, because, if there was no authorisation, there was no breach of the Act.  To require the referee, in a case where there was no warrant, to go on to inquire whether there was an interception would saddle him with the functions of criminal investigation, because, as I have pointed out, the interception would be an offence.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the referee concludes that there was an authorisation in force at the material time, then he will have the important task of investigating whether there was a contravention of any of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the authorisation.  This means that the referee will have to investigate whether the authorisation was lawfully issued, whether the application for it was made and dealt with in the required manner, whether interceptions were continued in contravention of the Act after the appropriate authority had reported that they were no longer required and whether the Minister failed to cancel an authorisation after the designated judge had informed him that, in his opinion, it should not have been issued or renewed or should be cancelled.</P>
    <P>If the referee concludes that there was a contravention such as I have mentioned, he will notify the applicant in writing of his conclusion and make a report of his findings to the Taoiseach. He will also have extensive powers to order redress for the applicant.  He will have power to quash the authorisation and direct the destruction of all copies of the communications intercepted pursuant to the authorisation; and owing to the definition of &ldquo;copy&rdquo; in section 1 such <Col N="1199" /> a direction will apply also to any transcript, extract or summary of a communication or any tape on which it is recorded and to any record of the identities of the parties to the communication, for example, an envelope in which an intercepted letter was sent.  Further, the referee will have power to recommend that the applicant should be paid a specified sum by way of compensation for the wrong done to him in having had his communications intercepted; and the Minister will be required by the section to pay the compensation recommended. Any notification to the applicant or report to the Taoiseach will have to state the effect of any order made by the referee such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 9 includes a special provision &mdash; this is in subsection (6) &mdash; in relation to the question whether, in the case of an authorisation for the purpose of criminal investigation, the offence in question is a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; within the definition of that expression to which I referred earlier.  The Minister will not be empowered to give an authorisation unless he considers that the offence is a serious one.  That is to say, it will be for the Minister, after considering the facts and circumstances, to make a judgment as to whether this is the case.  It is an essential feature of the scheme that the Minister should be entrusted with the duty of making the judgment.  However, subjection (6) provides a special safeguard in order to enable a person whose communications have been intercepted to have the advantage of an independent judgment on the question whether the offence in question was a serious offence. If the referee considers that, although there was no contravention of the relevant provisions, nevertheless, in spite of the Minister's opinion, the offence in question was not in fact a serious one, then he will refer the question whether the offence was a serious one to the designated judge for his determination.</P>
    <P>If the designated judge agrees with the referee that the offence in question was not a serious offence, the referee will act as if he had concluded that there had been <Col N="1200" /> a contravention of the relevant provisions of the Act; and this will include the power to make a binding recommendation that the applicant should be paid compensation. If the designated judge disagrees with the referee, that is to say, if he agrees with the Minister's opinion that the offence was a serious one, the referee will simply, in accordance with the scheme of the section, give notice in writing to the applicant that there was no contravention of a relevant provision of the Act; again he will not say whether there was an authorisation or an interception.</P>
    <P>Like the designated judge under section 8, the referee will have access to all the official documents relating to a relevant authorisation and the application for it and be able to inspect the documents; and again, as in the case of an investigation by the designated judge, all persons who were concerned in, or have information relevant to, the giving of an authorisation or the making of the application for it will be required to give the referee, on request by him, any information in their possession relating to the application or authorisation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 may be regarded as complementary to section 9 in the sense that it restricts the possibility of making use of legal proceedings, criminal or civil, for the purpose of discovering whether an authorisation of an interception has been issued or an application for an authorisation has been made.  To impose such a restriction is, in the Government's view, clearly justified because of the need in the national interest to protect the secrecy of the system of interception and because the complaints procedure under section 9 fully protects members of the public from any possible abuse by the Minister of his powers under the Bill. Section 10 does not seek to exclude completely the possibility of raising in legal proceedings the question whether there has been an authorisation: its purpose and effect are to prevent such a question from being raised unnecessarily or prematurely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for detaining the House beyond the time allotted to me but this matter goes back to 1985.  There is a great deal of new material in the Bill which needs to be explained in detail.</P>
      <P>As section 10 is fairly complex, I will endeavour to explain it in some detail. Subsection (1) relates to criminal proceedings. It provides in effect that a private prosecution for an offence consisting of unlawful interception of a letter or telephone call shall require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Without this restriction a person wanting to find out whether his telephone had been tapped might start a prosecution against an official of Bord Telecom or of the Department of Justice in the hope of compelling the accused to say whether there had been an interception and, if so, an authorisation.  If an application were made to the director for his consent for a prosecution, the director would investigate the case, and would simply refuse his consent if there was no evidence of an offence whether or not there as an interception.  The section would not prevent a person from issuing a summons for an offence, but he would not be able to take the matter beyond that stage and any remand without getting the director's consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) relates to civil proceedings. It applies to a case where a person might bring an action in respect of an interception which, if it took place and was not legally justified, would have amounted to one of the offences of unlawful interception in respect of which the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for a criminal prosecution would be required by subsection (1).  The effect of subsection (2), subject to an <Col N="1202" /> exception, is that, if any such civil proceedings are taken, the question whether there was in fact an interception will be determined before any question can be raised as to whether there was an authorisation. Accordingly, unless and until it is determined that there was an interception, no person who from his official duties might be concerned in, or have knowledge concerning, authorisations will be permitted to give any evidence, or be asked any question, that would tend to show that an authorisation was or was not given or that an application for an authorisation was or was not made or that proposals or steps for that purpose were or were not made or taken.  Nor will the defence be permitted to make any disclosure or allegation to this effect in the action before it is determined that there was an interception.</P>
    <P>If this preliminary inquiry fails to show that the interception complained of occurred the action will of course, fail. But if it is determined that the interception did occur the action will proceed and the result will depend on whether the interception was justified on the ground that there was an authorisation by the Minister or for some other reason.  The court will, on the application of any party to the proceedings, allow any amendment to the pleadings that may be necessary in order that the question of whether there was an authorisation may be determined; this is necessary because, as I said, the defence will have been prohibited from raising this question before it was determined that there was in fact an interception.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides another safeguard against attempts to use legal proceedings for the purpose of discovering whether, for example, an authorisation has been given.  The subsection provides that no person shall be compellable in any proceedings to give any evidence or information to a court or tribunal or any person which shows or tends to show that an authorisation was or was not given or that an application for an authorisation was or was not made or to be made.  This will apply to proceedings of any kind and not only to proceedings directly related <Col N="1203" /> to interceptions.  The subsection will not prevent a person from giving the evidence or information voluntarily. Whether an official possessing the information gives it voluntarily will be a matter between him and the service to which he belongs.  There will be three exceptions to the rule of non-compellability under subsection (3).  First, it will not apply in criminal proceedings for an offence of unlawful interception.  Second, it will not apply to evidence that a person has been convicted of such an offence. Third, the information will have to be given on request to the designated judge or the complaints referee.</P>
    <P>Although a person will in general not be compellable to give evidence or information such as I have referred to with regard to any authorisation or the application for one, a certificate signed by a person authorised by the Minister and giving the information in question will be admissible, under subsection (5), as evidence in any legal proceedings in which evidence of the facts stated in it is admissible.  Therefore, if, for example, a person was prosecuted for any unlawful interception, the fact that there was no authorisation in respect of the interception could be proved by means of the certificate without the need to call formal evidence to this effect.  There will, of course, be no obligation on the Minister to give a certificate, but he would naturally do so in a proper case in which evidence or the matter that would be included in the certificate could have been given orally.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that all the official documents relating to an authorisation and the application for it must be retained for a period of at least three years after the authorisation ceases to be in force. This requirement will apply, for example, to documents in the possession of the Garda Síochána, An Post or Bord Telecom as well as those in the possession of the Department of Justice.  The documents might be required by the designated judge or the Complaints Referee for the purposes of their functions under the Act.  Section 11 will not apply to <Col N="1204" /> copies of material which have been intercepted. Under section 12 these will have to be destroyed as soon as their retention is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides extra safeguards for the benefit of persons whose communications may have been intercepted. It requires the Minister to ensure that arrangements exist to limit to the minimum necessary the disclosure of the fact that an authorisation has been given and the contents of any communication that has been intercepted.  The arrangements will also secure that copies of communications that have been intercepted shall not be made to a greater extent than is necessary and shall be destroyed as soon as their retention is no longer necessary.  For these purposes &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; will mean &ldquo;necessary for the prevention or detection of serious offences or in the interests of the security of the State&rdquo;.  The adequacy of the arrangements made by the Minister for these purposes will be among the matters that will be subject to investigation by the designated judge under section 8, and the judge will, of course, under that section, have full power to inspect all relevant official documents and to question all persons concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 13 makes a number of amendments to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. These are mostly technical and the only one that calls for particular mention is that contained in section 13 (2).  It relates to the practice known as &ldquo;metering&rdquo; which consists of the mechanical recording of the making and duration of telephone calls.  Section 13 (2) inserts a new subsection in section 98 of the 1983 Postal and Telecommunications Act.  The new subsection makes it an offence for a person employed by Bord Telecom to disclose information such as I have mentioned to anybody else unless the disclosure is made in the circumstances specified in the subsection.  Disclosure will be permissible if it is made at the request or with the consent of the subscriber; for the prevention or detection of crime or for the purpose of criminal proceedings; in the interests of the security <Col N="1205" /> of the State; in pursuance of an order of a court; or in the course of the employee's duty as such.  I have added another circumstance to the original list, that is, for the purpose of civil proceedings in any court.  This is to put beyond doubt that Bord Telecom could disclose information obtained by &ldquo;metering&rdquo; in, say, any legal proceedings relating to the number of telephone calls made.</P>
    <P>Section 14 repeals section 18 of the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  The latter section empowers the Minister by warrant to require the production to him of telegrams sent to or received from places outside the State.  The section reproduced a section in the British Official Secrets Act, 1920, which applied to the State.  The power is very wide, the only condition being that the Minister should be of opinion that production is &ldquo;expedient in the interest of the State&rdquo;.  The power under the section has never been used, so far as is remembered in the Department of Justice, and the Bill is a convenient occasion to abolish it.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of my speech I said that the Bill takes full account of the requirements of the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. I will end by explaining the way in which it does that.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the European Court of Human Rights, in the case of Malone against the United Kingdom, held that the tapping of Malone's telephone was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights in that the interference was not in accordance with the law.  It is not sufficient that the conditions for the authorisation of interceptions are carried out on an administrative basis.</P>
    <P>The court also held that the practice of providing the police with information obtained from metering should be regulated by law.  Also of relevance is that Malone submitted to the court that there was no domestic remedy available to him for the breaches of Article 8 of which he complained and that, consequently, there had been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.  The court held that, having regard to its decision on Article <Col N="1206" /> 8, it was not necessary to rule on the issue of Article 13.</P>
    <P>The present Bill takes full account of the requirements of the convention in the following ways.  First, as I have explained, it sets out in detail the conditions under which the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interceptions is to be exercised and it regulates the procedure for authorisations; as a result, interceptions will be carried out only &ldquo;In accordance with the law&rdquo; in the sense in which that phrase was interpreted by the court and, of course, only to the extent permitted by Article 8. Second, it ensures that information obtained from metering is not disclosed save as permitted by Article 8.  Third, it provides for &ldquo;an effective remedy before a national authority&rdquo;, as required by Article 13, for a person whose rights under Article 8 are violated.</P>
    <P>I have taken some time but I considered it was worth while to get the full explanation of what I intended in this Bill on the record of the House.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should mention that I do not have the Fine Gael brief for this Bill and the substantive input from our party will be made by Deputy Shatter.  Deputy Shatter is unavoidably absent at present, being at the Special Committee on the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill.  The Deputy has been working on that all day and has therefore found it impossible to be in the Chamber at present.  Deputy Shatter will make his own contribution to this Bill later on and I look forward to hearing that myself, because this matter could not be in better hands than those of Deputy Alan Shatter.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House.  This legislation is a particularly difficult matter for the Minister's party in so far as much of the history which led to the bringing of this Bill before the House would be a cause of embarassment, while not personally to the Minister nor to many of the Ministers in Government today, to the party in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are obviously <Col N="1207" /> necessary.  It was essential that the whole matter of the interception of telephone calls, letters etc. should be properly coordinated and controlled.  This Bill sets out to do that.  My party, and in particular Deputy Shatter, will be examining the Bill very carefully in so far as we produce legislation, to which the Minister referred, dealing with this issue.  We will want to ensure that the parts which the Minister decided to omit and to remodel etc. are acceptable to us.  We will examine it critically with a view to tabling our own amendments later.  Deputy Shatter will deal with that in detail.</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill is quite disturbing.  The early eighties was an era in which we had widespread headlines on a regular basis with regard to telephone tapping and which led to great public outrage.  It is clear in retrospect &mdash; it may not have been clear to anybody at the time, particularly those involved &mdash; that individual rights were infringed.  The rights of individuals to carry on their lives, to make telephone calls and to write newspaper articles on the basis of what they might learn were infringed.  In retrospect, it is amazing that normally sane individuals will do things in Government which are completely contrary to the purpose of Government and totally contrary to what Ministers should be doing, which is upholding the rights of the people rather than taking those rights away.  A number of well known journalists suffered the consequences.  In retrospect, it is clear that the interception was carried out for political purposes.  It was an attempt to protect either a politician or a political party, which was a very spurious base for what was done.</P>
    <P>The interference with the basic rights of individuals was simply to protect a political party or an individual politician under some pressure at the time, someone in receipt of fairly severe criticism from the media, much of which, it was thought, emanated from his own party. The purpose of the interception was to find out who in the party was responsible for giving the information to journalists so that those people could be dealt with. <Col N="1208" /> It was sad that politicians should get bogged down in underhand dealings with members of the public.  The whole event, which has been well documented, led to a court case in which people had their rights vindicated and were awarded compensation.</P>
    <P>I recall &mdash; and I am sure this is also well documented &mdash; another episode where it was not a telephone call, or a letter or postal packet that was intercepted, but an important witness in a court case in a certain part of the country was intercepted, held and not allowed to appear in court.  That saga led to unsavoury things being done and to considerable public outrage.  It was important that people would not accept that this type of behaviour was normal.  I suggest that this legislation is a delayed reaction to that public outrage and the people's insistence that their level of intolerence did not stretch that far and that political power would have to be used in a sensitive and sensible way.  That whole business was a perfect example of the gamekeeper turning poacher.  It was sad to see the particular individual involved being later appointed to a very senior position in the Houses of the Oireachtas, a position which he left under rather suspicious circumstances. To be honest, the two main players in the game did seem to have something on one another, to put it colloquially.</P>
    <P>While the main player was not convicted of offences in the court, it was well known that what he did was not acceptable and certainly he was not a responsible Minister.  To appoint him to a very senior position in this Parliament was stretching things rather far.  At the end of the day it did have a happy ending in so far as the dog turned on his master. By his own actions, which forced his resignation from that position which, according to public opinion, he should not have held in the first place, he turned on his master and removed him from office by spilling some of the beans he had held on to for so long.  That sorry saga has led to the production of this legislation.  Indeed, I congratulate the Minister on having the courage to introduce <Col N="1209" /> it.  He had nothing whatsoever to do with the unsavoury dealing that took place in the early eighties except in so far as he belonged to the same party.  Prior to that time a dangerous ethos was building up &mdash; two individuals meet in an office, one discovers that the other is in possession of a piece of machinery designed to copy what he said so that it could be used against him.  Thankfully, that was brought to an end.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's contribution and having glanced through the Bill, I imagine that it will be very difficult for what has been described as &ldquo;grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented&rdquo; to happen again.  When this Bill is enacted it will be quite difficult for individuals to come together and, by subterfuge or otherwise, misuse the powers which Ministers have in this respect.  On a superficial reading of the Bill I note various checks and balances which may have existed in some form or other previously but which certainly did not exist in legislation.  This means it will be much more difficult for people to step outside their powers.  In future whenever interceptions are proposed the procedures that will have to be followed will ensure that they will be done for a proper purpose, clearly identified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the only purposes for which interceptions may be authorised will be those of criminal investigation or the security of the state and it goes on to deal in detail with them.  In his contribution the Minister gave a full briefing on what was meant by the terms the &ldquo;security of the state&rdquo; and &ldquo;criminal investigation&rdquo; The Bill deals also with the kind of criminal investigation that can be the subject of interception.  In relation to the security of the State, quite obviously with a private army on the prowl we must be in a position, at all times to gather information from all sources, both in this and the other part of the island, to enable us to defend the security of the State, which is at risk.</P>
    <P>We live daily with this illegal private army.  All political parties in this part of the island do not and have not at any stage given their support to the members <Col N="1210" /> of that private army nor do they approve of its existence.  We tend from time to time to be a little complacent about this. It would be quite easy for a number of people to take over this House.  There could be a very simple coup.  That may not be as easy as it appears to me but there is a danger of becoming too complacent. If we adopt the attitude that we know everything that is going on, that we have a great deal of information, we might get lazy and not be as vigilant as we should.  As there is a private army operating on this island we must be very vigilant.  I agree with the Minister that the regulations governing matters pertaining to the security of the State must be given priority in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the right of individuals to their privacy, and so on is protected.  Section 9, which deals with the complaints procedure, provides that members of the public who suspect they are under surveillance may make a complaint. The complaint will be referred to a referee, another party who can be involved.  This new check that has been introduced into the system is welcome. The more people involved in this procedure the better.  This assists us in ensuring the system will be fair and will be used for the purpose for which it is intended.  The complaints procedure is good.  The role of complaints referees are well defined in this Bill.  We will examine them to see if they need to be amended.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 8 which deals with the appointment of a High Court judge to review the operation of the Act.  That is a good, honest and secure way of ensuring we will not go astray as we have in the past.</P>
    <P>I admire the Minister's courage inbringing forward the Bill.  It took a long time for it to come before the House. The Minister had no direct involvement in the events that took place in the eighties which outraged the public and created a demand for this legislation.  We will have an opportunity of having a full and frank discussion on this Bill.  We will be able to examine it in great detail to ensure that its provisions will be effective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> I look forward to hearing Deputy Shatter and I am sure he will give an in-depth analysis of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister outlined the aims and objectives of this Bill in his speech.  He summarised its provisions very neatly.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The system of authorised interceptions in this Bill embodies the reconciliation of two important principles. The first is the privacy of correspondence and telephone calls; the second is the need to combat crime and subversion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That encapsulates the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum also gave details of the purpose of the Bill in simple, clear and concise language.  It states:</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out in detail the procedure for applications for and issue of warrants authorising interceptions. The procedure is similar to that followed at present.  But in addition the Bill introduces two new provisions for controlling the exercise of the powers of the Minister for Justice in respect of these interceptions.</P>
      <P>The new sections are sections 8 and 9.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the Bill is more remarkable and important in regard to what it omits rather than what it contains.  I will give some examples of those omissions. It is impossible to debate this Bill without referring at the outset to the recent incident involving the apparent bugging of the telephone of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton's telephone conversations with Deputy Noonan and Senator Manning were recorded without his knowledge or consent and were subsequently published in a number of national and local newspapers. It is essential that this House, and the public, be informed of the progress of the investigation into that case.  From <Col N="1212" /> information available to me, it is clear that there was more to that incident than meets the eye.  At the very least, I am satisfied that this was not a random, accidental once-off incident.  Given the manner in which the telephone was bugged, the number of telephone calls bugged at that time and the amount of time and distances involved in the case, it is clear to me that this was not a chance, casual encounter.</P>
      <P>We need answers to questions that this case throws up.  Was this bugging part of a pattern?  Was it carried out by professionals on hire, and if so, who hired them?  Was it carried out as part of an exercise in the gathering of political intelligence, and if so, by whom and for whom?  Can we be assured that whoever did this is not still employed for that purpose?  These disturbing questions must be answered before one can be happy that this Bill will deal adequately with abuses in this area.</P>
      <P>The Bill is aimed at curbing, controlling and monitoring the power of a Government Minister.  The first question that must be asked about the Bill is, will it curb the power of amateurs and professionals, who are not accountable to anyone, to invade individual privacy? At present, no authorisation is required either by a private individual or the gardaí for the planting of a bugging device.  I fail to understand why this legislation fails to address this very critical issue and the questions I have posed.  This is one of a number of major flaws in the Bill and I hope it and other matters can be dealt with through debate on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      <P>If we are going to take seriously the issue of &ldquo;informal&rdquo; tapping of telephones, we need to do more than pass laws: we also need administrative and structural changes.  For example, there is a range of tapping equipment and technology now available, which can be bought or sold without any need for registration or licensing or any other qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This equipment can be used to tap mobile telephones, to listen to conversations taking place in distant rooms, to replicate the software that is built into mobile and other digital equipment and so on.  It is possible, for instance, for anyone with access to relatively simple technology to clone a mobile telephone &mdash; to copy its software so completely that all calls on one mobile telephone will automatically be treated as if they were made on another telephone.  It should also be pointed out that all calls made on the cloned telephone will be billed to the original telephone.  We have seen a good deal of expansion, indeed an explosion, of technology in this area.  This is not confined to the bugging of politician's telephones.  Similar devices are also used in industry.  We have heard about industrial espionage in recent times.  The fact is that private detectives all use the type of bugging devices I have described.  However, the Bill does not deal with this issue.  This is one of its major flaws and deficiencies.  The Bill is about ten years out of date and it does not deal with any of the abuses I have outlined for the House.</P>
      <P>The availability and extent of the technology I have described is such that a proper licensing system is needed.  It should not be possible for individuals or companies to buy or sell logic, scanners and other pieces of sophisticated equipment without registering all such equipment so that the authorities know who owns, controls and has access to it.  It is not necessary to set up a bureaucratic structure to deal with this issue.  I believe the remit and resources of the Data Protection Commissioner should be extended to enable him to take control of this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did the Minister and his officials examine the equipment to which I have referred when drafting this Bill?  Are they aware of the explosion in terms of the sophisticated machinery and technology now available?  If they are, this should have been included as a central part of the legislation.  The exclusion of this machinery from the Bill is like talking <Col N="1214" /> about a mint with a hole.  One cannot talk about bugging, telephone tapping and the interception of mail without making provision for the abuses I have described.  This Bill will be flawed and irrelevant unless it sets to deal in detail with the ease with which privacy can be invaded in modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill also fails to take account of modern technology in the section dealing with the interception of mail.  The Bill requires the Garda to obtain a warrant in order to intercept mail by opening an envelope.  This section does not take into account the scanners which can be used to read the contents of a letter without opening the envelope.  Again, I do not understand why there is no provision in the Bill in regard to this type of equipment which is fairly well known to people outside the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with the interception of mail.  Mail can be intercepted in the way I have described and the contents of a letter read without opening the envelope.  The Bill is flawed in this respect.  I am sure my colleagues will also take up this point.  I intend to table a series of amendments on Committee Stage to rectify this omission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is flawed in a number of other respects.  First, the power to authorise a warrant should be vested in a judge of the High Court, and not in the Minister, in order to safeguard against abuse. Second, an annual report should be made to the Dáil and to the Taoiseach.  It is not necessary, for obvious reasons, for persons against whom warrants have been authorised to be named in such reports, but the Dáil is certainly entitled to receive copies of these reports.  Third, the Bill, as drafted, appears to allow taps to be placed on the telephones of persons <Col N="1215" /> with whom criminals might be in communication as well as on the telephones of suspected criminals.  It is widely known that at least one journalist believed his phone was tapped because of the possibility that he might be having a conversation, for journalistic reasons, with suspected terrorists.  Unless a person is suspected of a serious crime or of being a threat to the security of the State, no authorisation should be given to tap his telephone.  The Bill should provide for this more clearly than it does at present. Fourth, like previous legislation, this Bill is silent on the question of people who record their own telephone calls.  It should be illegal for any person in the State to record their telephone conversations unless the person on the other end of the line is specifically made aware that the conversation is being recorded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>People who speak off the cuff during a telephone conversation can find out afterwards that the person on the other end of the line had recorded the conversation.  That should not be allowed, and the Bill should provide accordingly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in regard to the appointment of a complaints referee. It has been said that many telephones were tapped in the past by all sides.  One wondered whether these complaints were frivolous.  Sometimes people of social status claimed their telephones were being tapped.  I hope the complaints referee will not have to deal with a rash of frivolous and vexatious complaints about telephone tapping; he could become bogged down in dealing with such complaints. I hope that common sense and intelligence will be the order of the day in this area and that where there is abuse it will be investigated thoroughly by the complaints referee.  The major failing in this legislation is that it contains no specific reference to the interceptions and buggings to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister referred to the provisions of the European Convention <Col N="1216" /> on Human Rights.  It is important in the context of legislation such as this that we do not act in isolation from our partners in Europe.  We need to look at the provisions in similar Acts introduced in other countries.  Most of these countries have larger populations and more experience of crime and subversion than we have &mdash; although we have far more crime and subversion than we need &mdash; and we could benefit from their experience.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the Minister referred to the well known case of Malone v.  United Kingdom.  The decisions reached in that case were very important and I am pleased the Minister has taken account of them in this legislation. It is important that we look at the legal systems in other countries and see how they deal with crime and threats to their security.</P>
    <P>Of course, all the safeguards and monitoring measures in the world will achieve nothing unless the Minister and Government are honest and have integrity.  I believe this legislation is based on our having an honest Minister and an honest Government.  If this is not so, all our efforts in this House will be set at nought. Unfortunately, as we saw in the Bruce Arnold and Geraldine Kennedy cases ten years ago, party political considerations can often override legal constraints.  As we all know now, there was no justification whatsoever for tapping the telephones of these two journalists. Unfortunately, the Garda were also involved in this affair.  This was a great mistake and a great tragedy for the gardaí concerned.  The Garda should never allow themselves to be exploited or compromised or act illegally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cotter outlined the history of that case at some length.  There is no point in going back over the case; it is water under the bridge and all the talk in the world will not undo the harm done on that occasion.  As public representatives, all of us, especially the Minister and the Government, have a responsibility to act with integrity and honesty.  If the Minister does not have integrity how can we expect ordinary citizens to have integrity? <Col N="1217" /> It is totally unjustified to invade the privacy of any individual, including journalists.  Let us hope we have seen the last of these cases.  Reference has been made to the bugging of a telephone conversation between Deputy Noonan and Deputy Bruton.  I am interested in seeing the outcome of this case, but I hope we will hear no more about such abuses and malpractices.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this Bill has been brought before the House.  Indeed I wish it had come before us much earlier than now; many people, including me, have been looking forward to its introduction. I hope it will be discussed in detail and in an intelligent way by Members on all sides of the House.  I hope abuses similar to those I have mentioned will not occur again.  As I said, the Bill has a number of flaws and omissions, and I look forward to dealing with them on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I welcome this Bill, except that clearly there are circumstances where in tackling crime and subversion it is necessary for the security forces to intercept telephone conversations and mail and to assemble the intelligence and the evidence necessary effectively to tackle crime generally and subversion.  The issue is whether the Bill is likely to be effective and whether it will provide the kind of safeguards the public need to ensure that there will not be abuses against individuals, that the rights of individuals are protected and that there are sufficient grounds in place to warrant the intercepting of telephone conversations or of mail communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kemmy that it is regrettable the opportunity was not taken in this Bill to deal with contemporary problems with regard to the interception of conversations on mobile telephones and the use of scanners in relation to mail.  These issues need to be addressed. Perhaps it is a commentary on the fact that this Bill is a product of circumstances which arose ten years ago that these issues have not been addressed.  It is very regrettable that the public concern which <Col N="1218" /> has given rise to the emergence of this Bill is related to the abuse of the power of telephone tapping, mainly for political purposes and for the gathering of political intelligence.  We must ensure in this legislation that this kind of abuse will not arise in the future.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that there is a necessity for the State to tackle crime by means of telephone tapping and the interception of mail.  The gardaí have many times complained that it is becoming increasingly difficult to assemble the evidence necessary to obtain a conviction in court. If this Bill helps to curb the escalating crime problem it will be worthwhile, particularly if it is useful in combatting elements of organised crime who are involved in drug trafficking which is destroying individuals and communities and destroying hope among young people.  That type of crime is organised on a highly sophisticated basis.  The Bill will also be worthwhile if it helps to tackle the plague of armed violence which we have had for nearly a quarter of a century, involving the killing of our fellow citizens for allegedly political purposes. Sophisticated organised crime, whether of the general criminal variety or of the subversive variety, requires sophisticated measures to deal with it.  I have no hesitation in supporting the use of these measures in combatting that type of crime.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the boundary in tackling crime and subversion may be extended somewhat by some Minister or Governments.  The term &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo; has been used extensively and quite loosely in the past.  The justification offered for the telephone tapping of journalists was an illegal concern about the security of the State.  There was an implication that journalists were acting on behalf of foreign Governments and so on.  It is possible to use a term like &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo; in a very loose way which was not originally intended. In Britain in the course of the miners' strike in the early eighties the then Prime Minister and some of her Ministers saw the National Union of Mineworkers as posing a threat to the security of that <Col N="1219" /> State.  During the protests in this country relating to taxation when large numbers of people took to the streets, there were claims and hints that in some way this was a political strike which involved some threat to the security of the State.  We must be very careful about the way in which the term &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo; is interpreted.  Certainly it must be interpreted in a way that is opposed to subversion and the use of force, but it should not involve the use in a backdoor way of the measures provided for in this Bill against legitimate political activity, trade union activity or agitational activity of one kind or another.  If that happens it will seriously undermine what should be the intent of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Offences Against the State Act, which was introduced specifically to deal with the problem of subversion, is being used increasingly in a loose way.  In some cases people are arrested under the Offences Against the State Act when it is clear to everybody, including the gardaí making the arrest, that there has not been an offence against the State.  It is a handy vehicle to obtain an arrest and to detain people.  When this legislation is enacted and implemented we must be careful that it is not used in a way that would undermine it and allow it to become a vehicle of abuse.  We should not forget that it was a form of political abuse in relation to telephone tapping which gave rise to this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a number of areas of concern in this Bill which we will have a greater opportunity to address on Committee Stage.  I am concerned about some of the mechanisms for obtaining an authorisation to intercept.  In particular I am concerned that the Defence Forces are to be given the power to initiate the procedure. In legislation of this kind the initiation of the procedure should be reserved to the Garda.  It may be that circumstances will arise when Army intelligence may have to obtain information through these means.  They should be required to go through the Garda and a procedure should be established for that rather than that they should have the <Col N="1220" /> power to initiate the procedure.  There is a very clear distinction that has to be drawn here between the role of the Defence Forces and the role of the Garda.  I am quite concerned that under this legislation an Army officer above the rank of colonel will have the power to use this legislation to seek and obtain a telephone tap on, perhaps, members of the civilian population.  I do not think that should be permitted.  The mechanism for that should be through the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are a number of measures included in the legislation to provide for accountability, including the provision that a High Court judge may review the operation of the legislation, provision for the appointment of referees and provision for a complaints procedure. While there are some details of those procedures which I would like to raise on Committee Stage, I think they are very welcome.  However, I wonder if they go far enough.  Deputy Kemmy quite rightly made the point that the report of the High Court judge should be made to this House rather than directly to the Taoiseach.  I would agree with that. There are matters which should be included in a report and there should be a regular report on the operation of this legislation.  There must be transparency and accountability.  I am not suggesting that we should have a report which lists everybody whose telephone is being tapped.  Quite clearly that would be nonsensical and would defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.  However, it would be helpful if we had a report on an annual basis setting out the number of interceptions, the number of authorisations which have been issued and some general breakdown of those &mdash; for example, the number of those that related to criminal activity generally and the number that related to the issue of the security of the State.  That would be very useful.  It would be an important safeguard as well for the public.  For example, when the numbers dramatically increase under a particular Minister for Justice they will be able to see that it may not be entirely due to that Minister's predeliction for <Col N="1221" /> tackling the problems of crime but may be due to a kind of &ldquo;Hiace van&rdquo; phenomenon. Those kinds of precautions are necessary in order to give the public some comfort in that area.</P>
    <P>I agree too with the point made by Deputy Kemmy in relation to the protection of privacy.  I would urge the Minister when we come to Committee Stage to give consideration to Opposition amendments in this area.  Deputy Kemmy mentioned the case of the Fine Gael leader and speculated as to what may have been behind the tapping and the publication of his particular conversation. There was also much concern expressed in this State about the tapping, apparently by a private individual, of a private telephone conversation of a member of the British Royal Family.  I would not normally come into this House and concern myself a great deal about the British Royal Family.  However the concern it raised &mdash; certainly in me and in many people in the State &mdash; related to the possibility that private individuals out there may be tapping the telephone conversations of other people.  Quite clearly that is a very serious invasion of the privacy of the individual.  I know the Minister, in responding to the points made by Deputy Kemmy, seemed to suggest that this really was a matter for his partner in the &ldquo;country and western alliance&rdquo;, the Minister for Communications.  I do not know if I would agree entirely with that distinction.  I do not care which of them is still here as a Minister after 1 January&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would like to see is legislation aimed at protecting the privacy of individuals and the privacy of citizens in an era of very sophisticated telecommunications when we have sophisticated methods of intercepting those communications.  Individual citizens have a right to the protection of their privacy in that area and that should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill certainly does address the use of interception by the State.  It certainly does provide for a procedure whereby <Col N="1222" /> the organs of the State have to go through a particular procedure in order to intercept a telephone call or a letter.  It provides certain precautions &mdash; perhaps not sufficient &mdash; to protect the rights of individuals in that area; but it should go that step further and deal with the illegality of private citizens or groups of citizens interfering with and intercepting the private telephone calls of individuals.  We have had many examples of it over the years.  We had an example a couple of years ago when it emerged that the owners or managers or a particular company managed to tape a meeting of its employees.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Kenneally, might have some recollection of this.  That type of thing must be prevented and the public need to be protected from it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that we will dwell in greater detail on these matters on Committee Stage.  However, I would ask the Minister, when we do come to Committee Stage, to be willing to consider amendments which are aimed at extending what is generally a very good piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I give a qualified welcome to the Bill. However, it is somewhat out of date before it comes before us at all.  This Bill draws its inspiration from a similar Bill published by Fine Gael when in Government in 1985.  That was some years after the incident that triggered off the need for it.  This now is several years later 1985 and we are now talking about legislation that should have been introduced ten years ago.  The legislation now being introduced is late and does not go nearly far enough towards curbing the problems that have just been outlined by my colleague and by the two speakers on my right.  I know the Minister will say that this is the responsibility of another Government Department.  Frankly, I do not care what Government Department it refers to; this is a matter that should be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal first with what is not but should be in the Bill.  I refer to the situation <Col N="1223" /> whereby a person can obtain a scanner device and eavesdrop on classified telephone conversations between members of the security forces and between members of the Garda Síochána, etc.  This happens very often. Indeed, in the not too distant past, in respect of a certain criminal gang, a &ldquo;sting&rdquo; was arranged in the Dublin mountains but with the aid of modern technology the gang were able to blow the cover long before the trap could be sprung.  This is a clear indication that there is a need to introduce legislation to curb the availability of such technology.</P>
    <P>I brought this matter to the attention of the Minister and his predecessor. Indeed, it has been well aired here in recent years.  I agree entirely with those who say it is wrong that people should be able to buy technology which would allow them to listen in to somebody else's telephone conversations.  I resent the fact that some smart alec can buy sophisticated technical equipment which is freely available within this country and listen into telephone conversations while driving in his car.  For some unknown reason no reference is made to the illegal scanning of telephone conversations in this legislation.  I am most disappointed therefore that the Minister has not availed of this opportunity to influence his colleagues in Government as to the need to bring forward legislation to make this activity illegal.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the inspiration for this legislation.  I have no desire to make political capital out of this matter or to go through all the events that occurred in 1982 but they lead to this legislation.  I would like the Minister to explain the reason it will not be a criminal offence if one of the parties involved agree that their conversation should be tapped.  I fail to understand why this should be the case.  In other words, if I decide to hold a telephone conversation with another Member and one of us agree that the telephone conversation should be intercepted it will not be a criminal offence if at some future date an investigation takes place.  The unfortunate individual at the <Col N="1224" /> other end of the line is entitled to know whether that telephone conversation is being intercepted.  I would resent any of my telephone calls being intercepted. Indeed, we have often got the impression that our telephone conversations were being tapped.  However, there is no necessity for people to have to have modern technology to record telephone conversations.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are circumstances where it is necessary in the interests of the security of the State to tap certain telephones and there is a proper procedure to do this.  This happened previously within the State.  Reference has been made to the fact that the telephones of journalists were tapped in the seventies in the interests of the security of the State on the basis they had made contact with subversives.  I have no evidence of this but if a person had made such contact I agree that in the interests of the security of the State their telephone conversations should be intercepted.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies in the case of criminal investigations relating to the people to whom Deputy Gilmore referred.  No stone should be left unturned in dealing with highly organised and mobilised criminal gangs who are well versed in the use of modern technology. One should have no difficulty in obtaining permission to tap their telephone conversations if it is believed that they are in the process of organising a crime.  People in a liberal society cannot expect to be able to combat these forces, having regard to the developments that are taking place in technology, unless they resort to using some of this technology.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes too many references to the need for authorisation for legal tapping while making no reference to the unauthorised interception of telephone conversations which happens regularly. Some time ago an individual was able to give me details of a series of conversations which had taken place between people known to him on mobile telephones, including the subject matter and the location of the person at the other <Col N="1225" /> end of the line.  It was possible to gather from this information the name of the person concerned.  He pointed out to me that there was a necessity for legislation in this area.  I fulfilled my duty and raised this matter on numerous occasions by way of parliamentary question. However, I never received a satisfactory response.  There was always some reason it was not possible to introduce such legislation; for example, another Minister was responsible and other legislation had to be introduced first but, all in all, the response has been most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It is now possible to have an open broadcasting system.  Under a CB-type system it is possible for all and sundry to listen to telephone conversations.  While this may be illegal such equipment is available within the country.  I have no objection to the use of such equipment for the simple reason that one does not have to pay a fee to use it as this service is not provided by a State or semi-State body.  The technology exists to enable people eavesdrop on telephone conversations.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is also possible to lock into an ordinary household telephone.  Using mobile equipment all a person need do is pass close by the location of an ordinary fixed household telephone and lock in to the system to make telephone calls.  That is not covered in the Bill.  If people are able to do this there is no reason they cannot lock into the system to eavesdrop on conversations.</P>
    <P>A criminal robbery took place approximately 18 months ago when an organised gang had staked out the Garda at least as well as the Garda had staked them out and used modern, technical equipment to do so.  The Minister and his Department will know the circumstances and occasion to which I refer.  It is not that such things do not exist, they do, and there is a crying need for attention in that area.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make was made also by Deputy Gilmore, that is, how the public mind wants to be titillated by snippets of private conversations.  It may be connected with the British Royal Family today, perhaps between the Taoiseach <Col N="1226" /> and somebody else the next day and so on.  Quite frankly, it is none of their business; it is as simple as that.  It is a criminal offence to publish such conversations, but for some unknown reason nobody ever appears to pursue that.  Perhaps the reason is that the people who are hounded and afflicted by that type of activity may feel they are in no position to pursue its perpetrators.  Obviously, the British Royal Family will not take legal action to pursue people who publish their telephone conversations or whatever the case may be.  Indeed, I do not even know that it was members of the British Royal Family who were overheard recently at all, but somebody suggested it was.  What action can they take to protect themselves? What action can people take in this country at present to protect themselves in this respect?</P>
    <P>It all appears to be fine when it is politically acceptable, when the snippet of information is sufficiently intimate to add a little spice and draw a newspaper headline a couple of days afterwards. However, I must sound a warning note that there will come a time when something really serious will occur which will be intercepted or overheard by somebody with a criminal intent.  Then everybody, Ministers included, will wake up to their responsibilities and realise that had action been taken in time in this area they might have averted a tragedy.  I referred already to the &ldquo;sting&rdquo; that was set up in the Dublin Mountains a couple of years ago but which did not come off because of the technology available.  Who knows but that at some future date somebody's life may be at stake resulting from lack of action in that area.  The points I and other speakers have raised should be sufficient to enable the Minister and his Department to take whatever action is necessary to ensure people's rights are not eroded.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatsoever to the surveillance of criminals.  In this respect I do not go as far as some of my colleagues in that I contend that because of the nature of their occupation, which is the erosion of other people's rights, their rights are not as great or in such danger <Col N="1227" /> of erosion as those of the innocent private citizen.  If such people engage in organised crime they do so for a purpose.  I know there may be many liberally minded people who would not agree with me in that.  Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, in view of the way crime is growing here at present, unless the problem is recognised and rectified in this House, somebody somewhere outside will decide it for us.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatsoever to the provisions of the Bill in regard to the security of the state, which matter has already been well covered by other speakers.  However, I must reiterate that I strongly resent anybody having available to them the means of listening to somebody else's telephone conversation &mdash; for which, mark you, they do not pay. They have no right whatsoever to do so; it is just the same as opening somebody else's post.  While it might be very interesting for them and be grand to talk about around the fire on a winter's evening or in the public house, it is none of their business and is an offence.  The comments of the various Members who have spoken on that subject this evening should be a sufficient warning to the Minister to take immediate action.</P>
    <P>Recently some considerable interest was shown in a telephone conversation between my party leader, some of his Front Bench colleagues and others.  I was amazed at the interest shown in that conversation. Generally speaking, I am sure politicians did not take a great deal of interest in it because it did not appear to involve or disclose a great deal of informative material to me or to any other politician.  Nonetheless it did one thing: it illustrated that something was lacking in a system which allowed somebody to intercept such conversations. Such people can do so whenever they want.  As we sit here there are people doing just that now &mdash; listening to other people's telephone conversations, some of a sensitive nature, others of a business type.  There has been reference already to industrial sabotage and so on.  That whole area needs to be examined.  While <Col N="1228" /> that intercepted telephone call between my party leader and others might have been laughable from the point of view of those who might have wanted to take a swipe at members of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; I am not saying it was anybody here &mdash; it could be somebody else's turn tomorrow when it might not be laughable at all.  My philosophy is: there, but for the grace of God, go any of us.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to use his influence with his Cabinet colleagues. I am not too concerned which Minister assumes responsibility, but let whoever does take quick action in that area.  I predict that, if they do not, there will be an inquiry at some future date when the question may well be posed: why was action not taken to curb the use of illegal devices, known to be readily available and used regularly by criminal elements? Why was action not taken and who was responsible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is particularly to be welcomed because some of the events that might have attracted the attention of a person with a particular political interest would have been those occurring in the overall area of telephone tapping over the past decade or so.  Much concern has been expressed in regard to interception of such normally private telephone conversations.  The general public will perceive the introduction of this Bill as a welcome step in establishing a framework for authorised interception, clearly setting out how such authorised interception will operate.  The provisions of the Bill deal ably with unauthorised interception, much to be welcomed also.  Of course, we all recognise that in the general area of communications there have been huge developments over the past decade or so. While the telephone network may not necessarily have changed enormously in that the message still comes across by cable, the actual instrument and ancillary instruments, such as fax machines and others, have reached new heights of sophistication.  We have witnessed here an enormous increase in the use of such <Col N="1229" /> communications systems, computers and so on.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to a number of matters, including the use of mobile telephones and the interception of private telephone calls via these telephones. Those who use mobile telephones, whether they be totally mobile or car phones, are usually asked by the receiver of the call &ldquo;what number are you at?  I will ring you back.&rdquo; It is my understanding that these small instruments cost in the region of £1,000, plus whatever back-up equipment is necessary such as power packs, charges and so on, probably bringing the cost to £1,300 or £1,400.  Having paid such a price for these phones people should be allowed use them satisfactorily.  This is a matter that should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Because of the range of technical equipment available it is easy to obtain sophisticated telephone tapping equipment, which is on sale in a number of outlets.  A constituent of mine brought this matter to my attention recently when, within a couple of days of making a private telephone call, he was advised that the call had been tapped illegally. The equipment used, which was purchased in Ireland, cost in the region of £20 to £25.  There are many devices designed in such a manner that they will not interfere with the telecommunications network.  I have one such item in my own home, a baby listening device which plugs into the electric sockets in the house.  Although it is not designed to do so, this device has on occasion picked up conversations from the telephone in my own house, from an adjoining property and from radio cab units.  There is much that needs to be addressed in regard to the equipment that is available and its use, intentional and unintentional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision of a framework for the official interception of telecommunications and postal packets We are also providing severe penalties for unauthorised interception.  I would welcome a detailed reply from the Minister on sections 84 and 98 of the 1983 Act.  I would like him to tell us the number of <Col N="1230" /> times that Act was implemented and the number of prosecutions that ensued from such implementation.  As regards the penalties for interception.  I welcome the introduction of a fine of up to £50,000 or imprisonment for up to five years or both. That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that authorised interceptions will take place only on ministerial warrant, and that is to be welcomed. The operation of the Act is to be kept under review by a judge of the High Court and a legally qualified referee will be appointed to investigate complaints of improper authorisations by the Minister. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Little needs to be said as to the importance of preserving the privacy of communications.  If you post a letter, you expect it to be delivered unopened to your correspondent; if you make a telephone call, any telephone call, whether it is made from your home, office or car, you do not usually want third parties to listen to it and you do not want it published in newspapers or otherwise published.  Indeed it is not too much to say that it is one of the features of life in a free country that people should be able to write to other people, or speak to them on the telephone, without their letters or telephone calls being intercepted.</P>
    <P>I believe that nobody in this House would disagree with those comments of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The unauthorised interception of letters and the telecommunications network has taken place for many years but we do not know to what extent interception takes place.  I have no doubt that in drafting the legislation the Minister undertook a number of matters, including research into the whole area of interception and the extent of the activity that has taken place to date.  Is it within the Minister's ambit to restrict the sale of devices used at present for interception, particularly in the area of telecommunications and developments of that network, such as fax machines and computers?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> The previous speaker made the point that media attention was focused in the recent past on the unauthorised interception of telecommunications when a journalist quite easily picked up, via a car telephone, the conversation of a senior politician and that conversation was reported verbatim in one of the national papers.  A similar incident took place in the UK in regard to a member of the Royal Family.  I wonder whether a family in that position would be prepared to challenge those who made the unauthorised interception of the telephone calls. I would like to know what research has been undertaken by the Minister into the unauthorised interception of the senior politician's mobile telephone and into the whole question of interception.  Is the Minister aware that there are people in private industry selling facilities to intercept any type of communications and post and that these services are being advertised in a number of journals on the Irish market?  Will the Minister have any powers to address the area of advertisements of this kind?</P>
    <P>One other issue which has been brought to my attention is perhaps a matter which should be more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, who has just come into the house for Private Members' Business.  The shortage of necessary infrastructure for our telecommunications network is causing complications in relation to crossed lines and easy interception of telecommunications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the House for allowing me to speak on this issue.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications have instructed Aer Lingus to seek a partner.  Aer Lingus are a company handicapped by a debt of £580 million and they have lost £40 million over the past two years.  They are also expected to lose £40 million this year on their core business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company operate on the fourth busiest route in the world and the second busiest route in Europe, i.e. the Dublin-London route.  Aer Lingus lose £6 per seat for every passenger carried on this route which amounted to £20 million last year, a horrific loss.  British Midland reported a profit of £1.5 million this year, Ryanair made a profit on their route to Stansted Airport, although the profits are wafer thin.  Even though their aircraft are very old they are still able to make a profit because they do no supply trimmings like <Col N="1234" /> meals.  They are competitive and make money, more power to them.  They have also created competition on the London route, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>There has been a downturn in passenger traffic since the Gulf War and, as a result of that &mdash; and the Shannon stopover &mdash; no partner in his right mind would buy into Aer Lingus.  I will qualify my remarks; the regular businessman and frequent traveller, mainly tourists, from the east coast and midlands of Ireland travel to London, Manchester and Glasgow, for their trans-Atlantic flight which saves them the inconvenience of having to make two stops.  By using the British airports they have only one stop in getting to their destination whereas, if they use Shannon, they have to make two stops. A businessman's time is very valuable, he is anxious to get to his markets in the USA and to sell there so his progress must not be impeded.  It is a very serious matter for a businessman to lose two or three hours of his time.  I have been told that it is cheaper for Irish people to travel from British airports on other airlines. Our national airline tries to compete but it is worrying to hear that other airlines can transport people to the USA more cheaply than our airline.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus employees have given marvellous service to the national airline over the years.  However, those working in the airport &mdash; and who are constituents of mine &mdash; tell me the ludicrous travel arrangements which exist whereby Americans must fly into London, Manchester, Glasgow and Amsterdam before travelling to Dublin.  Canadians and Americans from the west coast travel to Amsterdam and Paris and then to Dublin.  It is obvious that if it costs tourists more to fly to Dublin they will go to other destinations, to where they can get the best deal.  American tourists, as we know, select their destination and they like good value for money.  When they know they have to fly to other airports before flying to Dublin they are put off, which is a loss to our tourist industry. Pan-American in their heyday, TWA, Air Florida and North West Airlines pulled out of Shannon and Dublin due to <Col N="1235" /> the Shannon stopover.  Delta still fly here as they operate to Atlanta, the hub of their operations, and would not consider using New York or Boston.  Air Canada have told Bord Fáilte that they will only operate in Ireland if they have direct flights in and out of Dublin.  Germany, France, Italy and Spain have helped their national carriers.  Why will the Government not help Aer Lingus?  The airlines of the countries to which I referred are helped because their important function in bringing tourists to their countries is recognised.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in relation to Aer Lingus price them out of the travel and tourist business.  The Minister should help and support the national airline and their employees to overcome this depressing, indeed disastrous, situation which is not totally their fault, it was caused by circumstances outside their control.  For a start, will the Minister consider reducing landing fees at Irish airports and ensure that there is a proper fare structure on all Aer Lingus routes? Many of my constituents work in Aer Lingus; I live in Baldoyle and many people in the area work with the company. They are worried and their morale is low.  Some of them are newly married couples, they have bought new houses and taken out mortgages.  They fear for their future and a morale problem in the company does not help.  Others have been with the company for many years and have helped to build it up, they are at the stage now of sending their children to third level education.  They too are worried for the future of their families, they wonder will it be their turn to lose a job if the company decide to lay off workers.  They are naturally worried that they will end up on the dole and it is the Minister's responsibility to remember that.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have been a good employer over the years, they worked very hard to ensure their survival but, at this stage, the employees are losing confidence.  They have also read that the Minister and the Taoiseach have asked the directors of the board to enter into an arrangement to <Col N="1236" /> sell part of the airline to other companies. If that happened will it end like the B &amp; I?  When the Bill in relation to the B &amp; I was being debated we on this side of the House asked that a 51 per cent share be retained by the employees.  The way we put it was that a golden share would be held to enable the employees to have say in their future.  However, they did not get that, the Government sold them out.</P>
    <P>As a Dublin representative and as a man born and reared in Dublin, I will stand by my constituents and insist that the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government do not sell out the employees of Aer Lingus, a company with 7,600 people on the payroll.  Many of those employees come from my constituency. They have worked hard over the years to ensure that the company survived and that it made profits, and they are not to be sold down the river. The Taoiseach and the Minister should make sure that if they enter into an arrangement with some other company a golden share be held to ensure that the future of the employees is intact.</P>
    <P>Finally, I put it to the Minister that any company that had the foresight to form companies such as GPA, PARC, Cara, Airmotive and TEAM, who created jobs at a fraction of the cost that it costs the IDA to create jobs in this day and age, should be supported rather than hand-bagged.</P>

      <P>The cyclical nature of the aviation industry tends to mirror the ups and downs of our general economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In front of the terminal building at Dublin Airport there is a memorial to the late Seán Lemass, whereby Dublin Airport is recognised as one of the greatest legacies Mr. Lemass left to the nation. Indeed, through Seán Lemass going back to the times of de Valera and the foundation <Col N="1237" /> of our party and our State, it has been the policy of Fianna Fáil to give ardent and sustained support to our State industry and, since its establishment, our aviation industry, whether in good times or in the most challenging of times.  We are now looking at the sad spectacle of a Fianna Fáil Minister who is apparently prepared to abandon policy stretching back 60 years by failing to even contemplate supportive action for our national airline, the stated primary mission of which is to serve Ireland as a profitable, customer-focused quality airline.</P>
    <P>I come from a tradition within Fianna Fáil established by de Valera and developed by Seán Lemass in which both public and private sectors are recognised as having important parts to play in promoting economic development and in providing employment.  Probably the single greatest example of that philosophy within the public sector has been Aer Lingus.  I consider it cavalier of the Government to dismiss casually, as they appear to do, the request for an investment of additional equity without giving due consideration to the arguments and in advance of a fully documented development plan by Aer Lingus.  That is a rejection of all our traditions.</P>
    <P>I found it incredible that a Fianna Fáil Minister would &mdash; as was done in this House last night &mdash; refer to Deputy Jim Mitchell of Fine Gael as a great Minister for Transport and use his decisions as a justification for actions taken.  It was Deputy Mitchell who in his period as Minister for Transport closed that other great national flag carrier, Irish Shipping, and left this nation without a deep sea fleet.  That cannot be allowed happen to Aer Lingus.  It was also Deputy Mitchell and the Fine Gael-Labour Government in the mid-eighties who consistently refused to sanction fleet replacement by Aer Lingus, refused to sanction a new runway for Dublin Airport and refused to commence work on a new runway in Cork. In my view, Deputy Mitchell does not fit the description given him last night of a very good and courageous Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> In the past week we have witnessed a concerted news media campaign to denigrate our national airline at board, management and staff levels.  Suggestions of lack of commitment and lack of decision-making have polluted the air.  Let me set the record straight: Aer Lingus results show the following group profits: 1983-84, £5.6 million; 1984-85, £8.2 million; 1985-86, £22.9 million; 1986-87; £24.3 million; 1987-88, £33.4 million; 1988-89, £52.7 million; 1989-90, £28 million; and in 1990-91, £8.3 million.  In 1991-92 there was a loss of £11.8 million.  In those years combined there was a net profit of £171.6 million &mdash; that is after interest, tax and extraordinary items.  However, that is not to suggest that everything on the air transport side of the business is as we would all like it to be.  But air transport is only one element of what is a proud and strong group that cover many enterprises. As well as the passenger and cargo services in which division are the three airline companies of Aer Lingus &mdash; UK &mdash; Europe services, Aer Línte US services and Aer Lingus Commuter there is also Aer Turas on the cargo side and holdings in Futura and Pegasus, both European charter services and a reservation system.  The group also include TEAM, Aer Lingus, Airmotive, Irish Helicopters, DEVTEC, Copthorne Hotels, PARC Ltd &mdash; which is involved in personnel and management services &mdash; Cara Data Processing and Computer Services, among others.  Aer Lingus have focused on enhancing their customer services in all areas of customer contact. They have achieved punctuality standards outstripping their competitors in the closely monitored and highly congested markets in which they operate. I would suggest that Aer Lingus are a company worth supporting, employing as they do 7,600 people.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, along with other airlines throughout the world, have been facing difficult times in the airline side of the group business, particularly since the Gulf War.  They have had two years of exceptionally difficult trading conditions in their principal markets.  The board, management and staff have recognised <Col N="1239" /> that it is important to Aer Lingus and to the country as a whole that the potential of the group as a creator of wealth and a provider of jobs be fully exploited.  They recognise that their overriding concern must be to generate profits from air transport if the core business is to serve the nation adequately.</P>
    <P>It is not unique for the company to receive support during one of its cyclical difficult phases in the airline business. The Government of which I was a member in 1982 decided &mdash; and that policy was honoured by our successors &mdash; that at that difficult time, when the company were going through a loss phase, on the Atlantic services in particular, they merited support.  Consequently, the company got an equity injection of £30 million and £12 million by way of Atlantic cost alleviation was provided for the MO.  The company used that investment efficiently and they used it well, as is demonstrated by the results.</P>
    <P>Accusations have been made that, faced with the present problems, Air Lingus board, management and staff have not responded and are only now trying to come to grips with the position. Nothing could be further from the truth. For example, last year alone £11 million of payroll savings were agreed with the workers.  The workforce have responded with wage moderation, new salary scales with lower starting points, the foregoing of due incremental rises and other changtes in work practices.  On that question of costs, the Boston Consulting Group report on Aer Lingus in relation to staff costs on the general and administrative side stated that they were comparable to other carriers due to a combination of low average labour costs and slightly above average number of employees.  Similarly, cabin crew costs are relatively low.  Cockpit crew utilisation was found to be comparable to the best practised in the industry.  The management have attempted to negotiate alliances with nearly all the major airlines in Europe. They have also attempted to take advantage of the hard-won fifth freedom rights, only to face ruthless competition from <Col N="1240" /> the major players in the industry, who are also having to struggle with the present world economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>In relation to Shannon, the Minister in her statement was &mdash; to put it at its most charitable &mdash; being slightly disingenuous when she suggested that Aer Lingus had changed their position on this question. The reality is that the airline recognises that in the short term with a change in that policy they would face competition from new carriers on the Dublin route. However, in the long term unless they can turn around the financial results of the Atlantic, their fleet of 747s must be retired in the near future and no commitment for the Atlantic fleet replacement can be entered into.</P>
    <P>I realise that to talk of a change in the Shannon stop-over is to refer to a hot political potato.  I recognise that friends on all sides of the House hold strong local views on this matter but the national interest must prevail over spurious arguments for retention of the present position. To think that we can stand still is to offer the workers and the people of the Shannon region not security for the future but a mirage.  What did Aer Lingus offer for a change in the rigid policy on Shannon?  They said that only New York and Los Angeles could sustain direct services to Dublin.  In the event of change there would have been a daily year round service to both Dublin and Shannon with the latter service turning around at Shannon. All Boston and Chicago services would have been routed through Shannon and by 1995-96 half of the New York peak services &mdash; nine out of 18 &mdash; would have turned around at Shannon.  By replacing the Boeing 747s with Boeing 767s increased services could be provided to Boston and to Chicago.</P>
    <P>The national reality is that 64 per cent of passengers from the US flew direct to Ireland in 1986; by 1990 this had reduced to 50 per cent with the other 50 per cent travelling here via the UK.  Yesterday's announcement by the Government in my view cannot be long sustained against the reality that exists in the real world in which we live and must trade.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of equity, <Col N="1241" /> great play is being made of the possible refusal of the EC Commission to an injection by the shareholder in its own company. Precedent, of course, shows that this is a nonsense.  EC documents available to me stated that both Air France and Sabena have received, with EC approval, equity from their own Governments.</P>
    <P>Time prevents me from elaborating on the need for a clearly defined air transport policy.  It is not sufficient to refer to Ryanair and Aer Lingus operating Dublin/London at suicidal fare rates and call it a policy.  We need to look at the global picture.  We need to know about the future semi-State status for Aer Rianta.  We need to know where air transport fits into a tourism policy.  Generally, we need to see where we are going in the future.  This entails more than thinly veiled attacks on the board and management of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I would also wish tonight to have had sufficient time to elaborate on the need for EC support for funding for aircraft. We are the EC's only island nation State and if aid for the peripheral regions means anything, surely aid for the purchase of aircraft for Ireland is a classical example.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that if we are serious as a nation in promoting a modern economy, based on exports of goods and services, it is essential that we maintain our own State owned national airlines.  If it was true in the time of de Valera and Sean Lemass how much more so is it today when two out of every three jobs in the manufacturing sector depend on exports.  In my view the Irish people will be harsh in their judgment of any Government which weakens our national airline and which refuses to come to their aid in times of difficulty.  I want to clearly state that that aid does not include a partial sale of Aer Lingus.  We have seen, not too far from our shores, countries where bargain basement sales of most of their national assets have now led to the side effects of hundreds of thousands of their people marching on their streets.</P>
    <P>The failed ideology of privatisation which is apparently the Fine Gael way <Col N="1242" /> forward should be rejected by the Minister. I suggest that rather than using her role model as Deputy Jim Mitchell, as a courageous Minister for Transport, she should revert to the real champion of Aer Lingus in good times and bad who recognised the benefits of a mixed economy with a strong public sector and a strong Aer Lingus &mdash; I refer to Sean Lemass.  The Fianna Fáil record and tradition calls for nothing less.  Fine Gael may wish to support the privatisation way forward but it is not the Fianna Fáil way. I appeal to the Minister to think again and reject this road to privatisation.</P>
    <P>There is never a good time in the national finances for requests for funding for projects but equally there comes a time when Governments must respond to legitimate requests for capital from what has been historically one of our nation's greatest successes.  If it was a multinational, I suggest to this House, is it not true to say that the IDA would be directed by the Government to shower it with aid.  In this case it is our own.  As a nation we are proud of it and woe betied anybody who casually damages it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment to the motion before the House.  I rise in this debate to congratulate and thank the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for her very positive and uncompromising decision on the retention of the stop-over in Shannon Airport.  This decision has been greeted with great relief and celebration by the people of the mid-west as any other decision would have been detrimental to the social and economic life of the whole region.</P>
      <P>The people of the mid-west, and the area's public representatives, have been fighting this issue for more than three years.  Now that this unambiguous and unequivocal statement has been made it has safeguarded the jobs in the airport and surrounding areas that would otherwise have been seriously under threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision also means that business and tourist interests are now in a position to plan knowing what the future holds.  I <Col N="1243" /> am aware that the main reason for the Minister's decision was based on the maintenance of jobs and of the potential of further job creation.  The Minister in her press release of 27 October 1992 said:</P>
    <P>Fundamentally this decision is about jobs, jobs in Shannon and along the western seaboard.  It ensures that these jobs are preserved and that new jobs can be created but it does not endanger a single job anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The Minister also went on to say:</P>
    <P>This Government cannot write finis to the development of the rest of the country in order to provide a hypothetical advantage to business on the east coast, no matter how publicly popular that would be in the short term with these interests.</P>
    <P>I must put on record that we in the mid-west were most disappointed that Aer Lingus was seen to suggest that the Shannon stop-over was responsible for some of the economic difficulties it is experiencing at present.  We always felt that that was a red herring in the general debate.  Aer Lingus sought the rights to operate a Los Angeles service in the late eighties.  It got them with effect from 6 September 1990.  Aer Lingus sought this route on the basis that the stop-over would stay, yet subsequently refused to operate the Los Angeles route unless there was a change in the Shannon stop policy.</P>
    <P>I am happy, however, to note from the Minister's statement last night that the most recent proposals made by Aer Lingus management to the board acknowledge that the interests of the airline are currently best served by retaining the stop-over.  It has been consistent Government policy that Shannon is Ireland's sole transatlantic gateway.  This policy has been an important plank of air transport policy since the foundation of an airline industry in Ireland.  In a time of such uncertainty in worldwide aviation, as at present, now is not the time to contemplate change.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the retention <Col N="1244" /> of the Shannon stop policy has also been endorsed by all sides of this House. Indeed, I would go further and say it has the backing of the vast majority of Members.  It is also the decision which the ICTU and the Bishops forum on the development of the west recommended. The Minister, by her decision, has put the national interest first.  Let us be quite clear that this decision is in the national interest.  We have independent studies to prove that, including a study from the former Leader of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The decision on the Shannon stop is accompanied by a number of other initiatives, including in particular proposals for new transport development plans for the west and mid-west region to build up transport infrastructure in the regions.  This commitment is to allow the west and mid-west an opportunity to achieve its full development potential by giving an adequate transport infrastructure. Therefore, I fail to see how the accusation can be levelled at the Minister that her decision was taken on narrow political grounds.  Her decision yesterday is an affirmation of an integrated approach to transport policy which takes account of all major economic, social and regional development considerations. This type of approach to policy is one which people not only on the west coast but, I would argue, all over Ireland want to see.</P>
    <P>As regards the Minister's reference to a special traffic development task force for Shannon Airport with a budget of £1 million over two years, I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify this concept.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have problems, as we all acknowledge.  The greatest challenge ahead for Aer Lingus is replacing their transatlantic fleet in the coming years. Aer Lingus will require all the energy, imagination and resources of management in order to undertake the necessary investment.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge, as did Deputy Burke, the commitment of the workforce in Aer Lingus who have faced continuing demands not only for wage moderation but also for new salary scales with lower <Col N="1245" /> starting points, the forgoing of due incremental rises, changes in crewing and staff levels, increased flexibility and other changes in work practices.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised at Deputy Flanagan's contribution to the debate here last night.  He seemed to raise many points which had already been articulated unambiguously by the Minister in her comprehensive statement on air transport policy and the troubles of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Deputy thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I hazard a guess that perhaps this was a prepared statement and, in fairness, Deputy Flanagan may not have paid full attention to the views that were expressed last night by the Minister.  The Minister acknowledged the contribution that Aer Lingus employees have made to the company and particularly expressed her appreciation of that contribution.  As I have already said, the Aer Lingus employees in Shannon have been more than committed in this regard. I believe that the board have an obligation to their workers to come up with a credible remedial plan to halt the crisis in Aer Lingus, because the workers cannot be made to suffer in this situation and jobs must be protected.  I believe that reasonable Government aid will be forthcoming on presentation by the board of a well thought out and costed proposal.  Fianna Fáil will not let Aer Lingus down.  After all, they are responsible for establishing our national airline and we wish to see it thrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to Aer Lingus availing of business opportunities in ancillary activities, in aircraft maintenance etc. and pursuing strategic alliances and joint ventures.  Last night Fianna Fáil, through the Minister for Tourism, Transort and Communications, outlined yet again that this Government have a clear and integrated air transport policy.  It emphasises job creation, competition in international markets, the strengthening of existing routes, the need to seek new opportunities and new markets and, finally, the <Col N="1246" /> need for substantial capital investment in infrastructure over the years and in the years immediately ahead which has been the policy of Fianna Fáil Ministers in the past.  I know they will continue to give this commitment to Aer Lingus, which is something we would all wish to see and encourage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can send a copy of that policy to Deputy Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday's decision was a decision in support of jobs, jobs at Shannon and, indeed, jobs in Aer Lingus.  To say that the Minister is antiAer Lingus or its employees does not stand up to scrutiny.  We in Shannon know too well how US carriers have pursued a pick-and-choose policy in the past regarding services to Ireland.  Delta Airlines have been a loyal and committed carrier to Shannon for the past six years, opening up links to the south and southwest of the USA.  Now is not the time, however, to begin opening up more competition on existing routes in the midst of an international recession and a weak dollar.  This is putting tourism and existing jobs at great risk.</P>
      <P>I would now refer to the commitment that the Government have given to substantial investment in our transport policy generally.  I hope I can be forgiven for making particular reference to the substantial commitment that has been and will be given in the immediate future to Shannon Airport.  We note that the Government propose to fund a new self-drive car park at Shannon and improvements to passenger terminals at Shannon Airport also.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to highlight the fact that we in the mid-west and west generally would like to see Shannon Airport developed as a hub.  I believe it would not take a great deal of extra money to do this.  There are many advantages that Shannon Airport can point to in order to create this particular concept and put it immediately into action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned at the recent deterioration in the financial performance of Aer Lingus and were surprised <Col N="1247" /> and disappointed to learn that the airline is and has been losing around £40 million annually on their air transport operations.  Let me emphasise that this is not due to the Shannon stop.  It is primarily due to low fares on the Dublin-London route and interest payments for new aircraft which Aer Lingus assured the Government would pay for themselves. I am sure that when the Exchequer finances improve, the Government will sympathetically look at equity for Aer Lingus if it is commercially viable.  The Minister suggested a number of ways in which she wished to see matters approached.  I hope the board will listen to what she has said and that they can quickly find a path forward to keep Aer Lingus to the forefront of Irish aviation. They have the suport of the Minister to turn the company around.  They have the support of my party, Fianna Fáil.  Let us show them that they have the support of this House also, by accepting the Minister's amendment this evening.</P>

      <P>This is perhaps one of the most important private motions that has come for debate in the lifetime of this Dáil.  The Government, including the Progressive Democrats, have acted with a Pavlovian knee-jerk response, namely, by putting their party before the country. The Minister has not had the courage to approach the issue from a national point of view.  Instead, she has assessed the political cost of offending voters in the immediate catchment area of Shannon Airport.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in dire fear of airport candidates being put up for election by the people of Shannon to the <Col N="1248" /> detriment of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat parties.  It is extraordinary that a person of such high calibre as the Minister, whose firm wish and prayer is to be the next EC Commissioner for this country to Brussels, could make such an insensitive and unbelievable error of judgment.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus was established by the Government in 1936, 56 years ago.  It employs approximately 7,600 people and received the paltry sum, in today's terms, of £73 million from its only shareholder, the Government, for investment purposes. This company is worth in excess of £600 million.  During the years 1983-91 Aer Lingus employees paid a total of £224 million in PAYE and PRSI contributions and Irish airline superannuation schemes have £203 million of Government security bonds.</P>
      <P>The value of Aer Lingus to Ireland extends beyond its direct employment capacity.  It has more overseas offices than any other Irish agency and it makes a major contribution to our image abroad.  At home, Aer Lingus supports jobs in hundreds of Irish companies through annual expenditure of more than £90 million on goods and services.  Irish airports and air traffic control services earn more than £30 million per year from Aer Lingus.  Yet Aer Lingus are in severe financial difficulties.  One can justifiably ask why this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, and her predecessors, including the former Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, must accept total and ultimate responsibility for the air transport division's poor performance.  The buck stops on the Minister's desk; she is the boss.  The Minister's nominees to the board of Aer Lingus must not have advised her or her predecessor of the gravity of the situation.  On Wednesday, 1 January 1992 the lead headline in the <i>Evening Press</i> was &ldquo;Fares go up as Aer Lingus loses £50 million&rdquo;.  This paper circulates to more than 200,000 homes and everybody in the country knew about those losses but the Minister did nothing about them.  I predicted at the time that the airline's poor performance would inevitably have to be paid for by the <Col N="1249" /> taxpayer and through job losses, especially in Dublin and, in particular, on the north side of the city.  When these losses were considered together with the problems of Aer Lingus Holdings, where between £15 million and £17 million is alleged to be missing, alarm bells must surely have been sounding for the Minister.</P>
    <P>On one occasion last year the Ceann Comhairle ordered me out of the Dáil for trying to raise the issue of Aer Lingus Holdings Limited in Spain.  Aer Lingus has a property interest in Tenerife through Aer Lingus Espana Limited, a property development and hotel operating company established in 1973.  The name of the site is Puerto Santiago &mdash; the Minister is probably familiar with it &mdash; which has a total of 279 apartments, of which 55 remain unsold.  Aer Lingus Espana Limited is responsible for 20 of these units.  It is in partnership with a Mr. Kurt Konrad who is now in very severe financial difficulties in the Canaries. Stories abound about the Tenerife site, about apartments over-financed and under-written by Aer Lingus for private individuals.  In short, when the books were investigated and the penny dropped, it appears that between £15 million and £17 million of taxpayers' money was missing, presumed lost and never to be found.</P>
    <P>Senior management bear an onerous responsibility for this debacle, which is the subject of a criminal inquiry of which we are all awaiting the outcome.  As a result of bad senior management decisions the Puerto Santiago site has not realised its full potential.  In short, if this site had been properly developed at the time it would have realised £52 million for Aer Lingus Holdings Limited instead of losses.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is in severe financial difficulties because of the reluctance of successive Governments to honour the shareholder's responsibility to invest adequately in the company.  Aer Lingus has been forced to take out expensive loans from private institutions to finance the expensive capital costs associated <Col N="1250" /> with the aviation industry.  These repayments are a millstone around the neck of an otherwise financially sound company. Until such time as it is addressed, this problem will effectively cripple the entire company.</P>
    <P>Even the most zealous supporter among the &ldquo;Fly Dublin Brigade&rdquo; never suggested that all transatlantic flights should fly direct to Dublin.  It was recognised that strict safeguards to maintain jobs and protect investment would have to be built into any programme.  For example, as a short experiment why could 50 per cent of all flights not fly direct to Dublin, the capital of this country? How could such a proposal be regarded as menacing to the mid-west region?</P>
    <P>The Minister has used the traditional method, the time honoured practice, and placed all the blame on the board of this semi-State company.  She did this safe in the knowledge that no member of this board &mdash; apart from the political appointees, all of them are civil servants &mdash; would be able to answer the serious and grave charges she has levelled against them.  She has taken the soft option, the cowardly way out, of lacerating the board of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Minister has missed a glorious opportunity to put the country before her party.  This would have required sacrificing simple electoral gains to secure long term national interests.  The Minister, her party and the Progressive Democrats, who are in Government for the moment at least, have followed the course of self-interest, political survival at all costs.  The people of Dublin and those along the eastern seaboard do not seem to figure in the Government's plans. How can they ignore the pleadings of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce or the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Task Force on Tourism, who were set up by the Government, Board Fáilte and SIPTU?  This defies logic.</P>
    <P>Direct flights to Dublin fall into that rarest of categories, common sense.  Our tourist industry has been responsibile for one in three of the new jobs created during the past five years.  Internal tourism <Col N="1251" /> was a net contributor to the Exchequer to the tune of £4 million last year.  This industry is second in importance only to our agricultural industry. Once again the people of Dublin, especially those living on the north side, have been sold down the Liffey into the Shannon by a political party who put the west of Ireland, Shannon Airport and the Fianna Fáil Party before the good of this country.  Seats in Dáil Éireann are more important to the Minister and her charlatan cavalier Taoiseach than the pleadings of Bord Fáilte, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Task Force on Tourism, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the 7,500 employees of Aer Lingus and their immediate families of approximately 25,000 people.</P>

      <P>Any other decision would have inevitably led to the demise of Shannon Airport and the loss of thousands of jobs in the mid-west and west regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industries in my constituency depend to a significant extent on Shannon Airport. I am glad we do not have to depend on Democratic Left or the Labour Party to provide jobs.  Both Neodata Services Limited and Nyle Erin in Castleisland receive data for processing from America through Shannon on a daily basis.  The processed information is relayed back to the USA via our state-of-the-art telecommunications system.  The decision to retain the Shannon stop-over is also vital as regards future investment in the mid-west region.  A change in the Shannon stop-over status would have diminished the future of the region in terms of attracting jobs from the US.  Income from tourism in County Kerry amounts to £164 million.  Our tourism industry is now larger than our agricultural industry.  A substantial amount of this money comes <Col N="1252" /> from the revenue provided by North American visitors.  In 1991, 80,000 US tourists visited County Kerry.  This year there should be an increase in this figure of approximately 7 per cent.  The majority of these visitors disembarked at Shannon.  Country Kerry would suffer considerably if Shannon Airport was bypassed.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the preparation of a plan for presentation to Brussels seeking major EC funding for rail, roads and ports in the mid-west region.  This region needs major investment.  From the point of view of industry and tourism, the road from Shannon via Limerick to Foynes, Tarbert and north Kerry must be included in this plan; otherwise the land bank in Tarbert-Ballylongford will remain undeveloped.  Now that the uncertainty is over regarding the future status of Shannon as the trans-Atlantic gateway, we must develop Shannon as a hub between North America and Europe.  The success of Aeroflot proves this point.  Closer links between Shannon and the regional airports along the western seaboard should be fostered.  It should be possible to establish close cooperation between the proposed new airport at Farranfore and Shannon.</P>
    <P>Regarding the future of Aer Lingus, I, like all other Deputies, would urge the Government to help the company to survive. Aer Lingus have made a major contribution to the economy.  No other single agency has provided such a service for industry and for tourism.  I know there are constraints on the Minister but it is important that every effort be made to ensure the survival of Aer Lingus.  If this means Government intervention, so be it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister has at long last made a public announcement in relation to Shannon's status and the continuation of its role in relation to trans-Atlantic flights.  I could not help thinking during the past year of Shakespeare's famous line, &ldquo;Procrastination is the thief of time&rdquo;.  On this issue there was a lot of prevarication and vacillation which had a destabilising <Col N="1253" /> effect in the area.  We are thankful that the announcement has been made.  I wonder if it is the harbinger of an imminent general election.  It is an indication of the fight which took place in the mid-west region and in the west in relation to the retention of Shannon's status.  I publicly compliment Signal and the Shannon Status Committee on their tremendous work to ensure Shannon's survival. The culmination of their efforts was the march in Limerick of 30,000 people to show solidarity with Shannon and to ensure that Shannon was regarded as a viable entity of vital importance to the area.</P>
      <P>Over the past year while uncertainty prevailed I have no doubt that decisions were deferred in relation to investment in the Shannon area, but I believe these investments will now proceed.  Shannon's significance has not been lost internationally in the aviation field and much is happening in aviation circles in Shannon. The GPA Aerospace investment is progressing very satisfactorily.  Regional development is recognised as being of great importance in relation to the principle of subsidiarity, the buzz word in EC circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the Shannon issue has been used as a smokescreen by Aer Lingus in relation to their financial problems. The full significance of those problems has been exposed recently.  Many of the economic problems which assail Aer Lingus cannot be attributed to Shannon. We must consider the scale of those losses and the failure of many of the ancillary activities of Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus was admired by all of us when we were growing up.  It was the company we looked up to.  I hope the Government will consider closely the proposals put forward by Aer Lingus.  The Government say their commitment is to create jobs, not to lose jobs.  I hope they will bear this in mind when considering the case of Aer Lingus. While I recognise the importance of Shannon, it gives me no joy to see what has happened to Aer Lingus.  None of us wants to see job losses in the company. If such losses must occur we hope they will be minimised.  We want to see the <Col N="1254" /> survival of Aer Lingus.  I trust therefore the Minister will look sympathetically at Aer Lingus in the future.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcome the Minister's announcement in relation to the Shannon stopover and the commitment of resources for the development of the western and midwestern regions.  We support regional development but it should be remembered that there are regions other than those I have mentioned.  The Minister stated that she is committed to regional development but if she is serious she must put in place a national aviation policy which will allow for tourism, industrial and commercial development.  There are six regional airports.  The Minister specifically referred to Waterford Regional Airport which is without any airline providing scheduled services, following the withdrawal of both Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  The Minister must ensure that conditions obtain in the national aviation scene which will allow the regional airports to compete on a level playing field.  The key is the operation of a fare structure on the Dublin-London route which will ensure that commercially viable fares will operate.  The present crazy price war cannot be allowed to continue because it is undermining the viability of services of Irish origin, in the long term at least.  The Minister must provide the aviation framework to hasten the return of the national carrier, Aer Lingus, to operating scheduled services out of Waterford and to allow for other carriers to provide scheduled services.  It cannot be overstressed that infra-structural development of the regions will be greatly held back if air access is not rapidly expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tourism Task Force, as well as recommending Government investment in Aer Lingus, draw attention to the fact that the amount of money spent on marketing <Col N="1255" /> Ireland has declined in real terms. The welding together of the tourism sector and Aer Lingus in the context of marketing Ireland to promote tourist facilities and attractions of a wide nature has been improved by the input of many sectors, not least the local authorities and the regional tourism organisations.  The bottom line must be to increase dramatically passenger numbers on all Aer Lingus scheduled services.  Aggressive promotion of an integrated tourism product is the obvious growth area.</P>
    <P>Three elements are essential for the survival of Aer Lingus and to enable the company to overcome the current crisis.  These are strategy, financial capability and a competitive cost base.  All three elements must be addressed to secure the future of the airline in the face of deregulation of the European market and the increasing globalisation of air transport services.  First, any strategy must begin from the premise that Ireland's national interests in terms of scheduled services to a maximum number of destinations can only be secured by ourselves and not left to the outcome of market forces.  In practical terms this means that we will have to continue to attempt to manage aviation against the tide.  This will see the elimination of many routes, the collapse of a number of airlines and a weakening of all peripheral locations. Truthfully, Aer Lingus are now caught between the rock of European deregulation and the hard place of financial starvation by this Government.</P>
    <P>A national strategy requires immediate ministerial intervention to protect the viability of both Aer Lingus and Ryanair on the Dublin-London route.  This means an end to the below cost seats and the elimination of the £20 million loss incurred by Aer Lingus.  It is a bit rich for the Minister to demand that Aer Lingus simply increases its fare on this route while Ryanair would retain £58 fares to Stansted.  In an economic boom Aer Lingus could attract a premium for the extras it would provide in both inflight and other concessions.  However, the <Col N="1256" /> Minister is overlooking the reality that in a recession price is everything.</P>
    <P>The second issue that needs to be addressed is the establishment of a proper payment to Aer Lingus for the provision of services ex Shannon which are unprofitable.  Having put a national strategy in place, equity capital must be provided to the company to ensure a debt ratio of 75 per cent as against the current level in excess of 130 per cent.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me stress that privatisation or golden shares are not the route to maintaining a vigorous, viable national airline with a full range of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>It is a coincidence that today the all-party Oireachtas Committee on jobs met the chief executive and other senior management of Aer Lingus to talk about the capacity of the public enterprises to create new jobs.  Aer Lingus being the most prestigious and the fourth largest employer in the country, all Deputies were anxious to see how Aer Lingus could contribute to the job creation task that is of such a scale and arguably the biggest problem facing this society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equity crisis that now faces Aer Lingus absolutely rules out any question of Aer Lingus making any contribution to the job creation challenge.  Very dynamic subsidiary enterprises, many of them at the leading edge of technology, have been created by Aer Lingus in recent years &mdash; for example Airmotive, Pratt and Whitney, both in my own constituency, Devtec and a couple more.  But the equity crisis is now so serious that it does not just pose a threat to the core <Col N="1257" /> business of Aer Lingus but to the subsidiaries also.  So bad is the financial situation in Aer Lingus that the very future of the company is at risk.</P>
    <P>Yet what do we get from the Minister? We get her flouncing around like a poor imitation of Mrs. Thatcher, handbagging the management and claiming that they are responsible for this mess, and making a decision three years too late on the Shannon stopover.  At this stage the Shannon stopover is only a smokescreen. I understand the Deputies who come from that area who have to get up and say what they have to say, but the argument is finished.  Three years ago the Minister's predecessor should have made that decision.  The Minister has been sitting on it until now, and now she has managed to create an effective smokescreen in the House about Shannon rather than dealing with what she is going to do about the crisis in Aer Lingus.  Everybody knows there is no successful airline in the world at the moment that does not have an element of long haul business, and we can never develop a long haul element to Aer Lingus until such time as Dublin is a hub.  Really the Shannon stopover is a non argument.</P>
    <P>The question is what does the Minister mean by saying that there is no free equity?  What does &ldquo;free equity&rdquo; mean? Is she talking about grants or hand-outs? Any shareholder is entitled to beef up the equity in their own enterprise to make sure that it is viable and has a future. That is not free equity; that is a prudent investment decision in a country that spends £500 million every year on industrial policy, sometimes for a very poor return.  Everybody admits that we have got very poor value for money spent on industrial policy, but every year some £500 million at a minimum is spent.  Yet the Minister says there can be no question of putting equity into a company that has a proven track record, that is the fourth largest employer in this country, that created some 1,400 jobs in the last three years alone &mdash; more jobs indeed than the leading private companies put together. That is the depth of the crisis we are in.  The Minister has made this popular <Col N="1258" /> decision for the mid-west which is going to carry her past the general election but which does nothing for Aer Lingus, which in the meantime is faced with a crisis that threatens the very future of the airline.</P>
    <P>I argue that it is manifest and transparent nonsense for the Minister and the Taoiseach to argue at this eleventh hour that we are looking for a partner.  What kind of partner would take the Aer Lingus that have been allowed to accumulate such problems over the last three to five years?  The Minister suddenly discovers these problems then handbags the management left right and centre and talks populist nonsense that if there are to be redundancies they will start at the top.  That is no solution.  That does not constitute an aviation policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister kept reiterating last night, like a mantra, &ldquo;I have a policy, I have a policy&rdquo;.  There is no policy.  There is not aviation policy.  There is no policy for the rescue of Aer Lingus.  Either one puts in equity, one gets a partner or one gives it away, like Dan-Air, for £1 in a takeover.  Presumably we are not going to give it away.  Delta may well be a takeover bidder in terms of getting our slots at Heathrow, but presumably we are not going down that road.  A partner is not a practicable option; that is acknowledged by everybody in the business. Therefore we are left with the equity option.  If Aer Lingus is to be kept alive as a major instrument of economic welfare in a country that put tourists at such a high premium, then it needs equity and its needs it now.  I simply do not understand this expression &ldquo;free equity&rdquo; and the statement that the Commission would not permit it anyway.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister mean when she says that the Commission would not permit it anyway?  Last week because of the sterling crisis, we voted £50 million for the market development fund to bail out private companies trading into Britain.  That is going to the Commission for adjudication afterwards.  There seems to be one rule for the private sector when it comes to bailing them out, as in the cases of ICI and PMPA, and a different <Col N="1259" /> rule for the public companies.  Let us make the decision now and worry about the Commission afterwards.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that I do not know what the Minister means by &ldquo;free quity&rdquo;.  If the shareholder decides to put equity into Aer Lingus, the issue of it being impermissible by the Commission is another smokescreen.  Sadly, it looks as if the jobs of the 7,600 people employed in Aer Lingus are at risk in an economy that has devastating unemployment levels already.  Yet this Government have suddenly adopted some sort of dogma that under no circumstances, no matter what the track record of the company, will they put any more money into it.  It is a shame.  I do not think that it constitutes an aviation policy.  We should now stop flouncing about, handbagging managers and making populist statements and address the crisis in one of our largest companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have much time this evening but there are some issues I want to cover so I will be brief in my comments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring says he believes it is essential that commercial decisions be made on the basis of the soundest possible commercial criteria.  I must take it that he accepts, therefore, that there should be an adequate rate of return on such investment.  This is the line the Government have followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate last night, the Minister quoted figures in relation to the present value of the Exchequer investment in Aer Lingus if it had been invested on a risk free basis.  My Department have <Col N="1260" /> asked Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance Limited to carry out a technical exercise to confirm the Department's view of what these investments would have generated if they had been invested on a risk free basis.  This is the independent report referred to by the Minister during her contribution to the debate last evening.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to Deputy Spring that similar comments were made by consultants in 1986 in relation to the Exchequer investment in Aer Lingus during the period when his party were in Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt eloquently yesterday with the baseless and contemptible allegations that the Government have no air transport policy. She spelt out the measures to strengthen the Irish presence on our air routes; the development of our national and regional airports; the provision of the latest high technology radar and communications equipment which have revolutionised Irish air traffic control services; and, finally, the development of Ireland as a &ldquo;centre of excellence in aviation&rdquo; with the focus on Shannon.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with a further baseless allegation made by Deputy Flanagan who claimed that Ireland has no Government policy on the matter of EC funding for transport.  The Deputy is either being disingenuous or else this demonstrates an astounding lack of knowledge on his part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to air transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that a major EC funded programme of investment in transport infrastructure in Ireland is being carried out under the operational programme on peripherality and we have lodged an application with the EC Commission for funding of mobile assets.  A key objective of the investment under the operational programme is to reduce the transport cost disadvantages which Ireland's unique peripherality and island nation status imposes on Irish exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the position is clear.  There are financial difficulties facing Aer Lingus <Col N="1261" /> which demand urgent and decisive remedial measures in order to prevent these difficulties developing into a full scale crisis.  It is without question the responsibility of the board of Aer Lingus to come up with proposals for a commercially viable airline and I urge them to do so quickly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke was selective in referring to group profits only over a nine year period.  The fact of the matter is that during the past two years on the aviation side Aer Lingus have lost over £80 million and it is predicted that they will lose £40 million in the current year.  While Aer Lingus have undoubtedly a strong and proud record it is the future that I am concerned about.  All sectors in the group are now consuming capital that could be used for expansion while the air transport sector are facing unacceptable losses.</P>
    <P>I should say that Deputy Burke made an outrageous attack on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications this evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Labour Party have availed of Private Members' time to debate this very important matter given that this is the greatest crisis ever to hit Aer Lingus in their 50 year history.  It is important that this House should discuss issues of the day rather than spend time discussing frivolous and vexatious matters.</P>
      <P>It is essential, as an island country, that we should have our own distinctive air transport policy.  We need to identify our air transport needs and the role of Aer Lingus while it is our duty to attempt to meet those needs and to serve our people to the best of our ability.  That is the central issue in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, Governments, like people, have short memories and tend to forget easily the contribution that has been made by the workforce of Aer Lingus during the past 55 years.  The company <Col N="1263" /> have been the motor engine in making progress in this State not only in industry but also in the tourism sector. Indeed, Aer Lingus have been a visible symbol of this country both in Europe and North America.  Everywhere one goes in those lands Aer Lingus are a household name.</P>
    <P>They have a good track record, have given good service and have accounted for their stewardship.  They are much more than an airline; they are a large and complex organisation embracing many strands.  They go far beyond the conventional definition of what an airline means.  They are both national and international and are our lifeline to the large world out there.</P>
    <P>They are operating in a tough, highly volatile and rapidly changing business. Regulations are being dismantled daily and ownership is concentrated in fewer companies.  Profit margins have been slashed and the global recession has led to fare wars in many countries, including our own, with the result that airlines, especially small companies, have been hit very hard.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have come under increasing pressure in recent times.  Their difficulties are obvious: they are operating in a small domestic market with a small population and are not big enough to challenge major airlines on the world market.  They are also losing out badly on the Dublin-London route.</P>
    <P>The airfare war with Ryanair is both stupid and senseless; there is no need to engage in that battle.  The Government should have exerted their authority and influence long ago to put a stop to it. They are two small Irish airlines and it is a form of madness that they are fighting each other.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that Aer Lingus need all the Government protection, help and support they can get. Consensus and co-operation should be the key words, not confrontation.  Who needs confrontation at present when the country is struggling for survival?</P>
    <P>I found the Minister's statement last night disappointing and I am a fair <Col N="1264" /> minded person.  It is well written but it was remarkable for what was left out rather than for what it contained.  The Minister spoke around the problems rather than dealing with them head on. She made no positive proposals or constructive suggestions and made no effort to chart a new way forward or to present a new salvage package for the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister's meeting with the board last week achieved nothing other than some publicity for herself but we do not need that kind of publicity at present. The Minister is the representative of the shareholders, nothing more, nothing less.  She is not some kind of neutral observer standing on the sidelines.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister was wrong-header since she is the shareholder's representative, nothing more and nothing less.  She is not some kind of neutral observer standing on the sidelines; she is a shareholder in this company.  She was wrong to go to the board meeting last week with all guns blazing, macho style, adopting a brutal, heckling approach which solves nothing and gets one nowhere.  It reminded me of an old fashioned school teacher going in to lecture an unruly, delinquent class.  One cannot conduct industrial relations in that manner.  The management of Aer Lingus are not above criticism.  Had I time I would be the first to criticise them in many ways.  However, the Minister's remarks last evening and her attack on the board of Aer Lingus last week were nothing more than a smokescreen.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House of an old Irish expression, uisce féin d'tealamh. Certainly there is much water under the ground in this case.  The Minister has not fully revealed her hand here.  She is adopting a cloak and dagger approach to the future of this company.  She has a strategy up her voluminous sleeve and it is time she came clean on it.  I must remind the Minister again that she cannot pose as a neutral observer, she is not one. The company belongs to the Irish people and the Minister is the sole shareholder. The Minister must not be allowed evade her responsibilities in this area.  My party have no intention of letting the Minister <Col N="1265" /> off the hook; we will not allow her funk or duck this one.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is in deep crisis, its problems being deep-seated but are not intractable or insoluble.  They can be solved with good will, intelligence and co-operation all round.  The Minister spoke of the national interest.  What does that mean?  It has all to do with people at work and our economy as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House also that the company's workforce have made many sacrifices over the years which I have not time to detail this evening.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish of me to finish my contribution without welcoming the Minister's initiative <i>vis-à-vis</i> Shannon Airport.  Indeed some Members have spoken with false tongues, such as former Minister, Deputy Burke, who can engage in the luxury of voting with the Government while, on the other hand, castigating the Minister.  Such people may fool those listening in the Public Gallery but not other Members.  Such people cannot speak with a false tongue and support the party policy.  They must obey the party whip, be a party person or get out of that party or, alternatively, vote against the Government in favour of our motion.  But they cannot play on both sides.  The same could be said of some Members of the Fine Gael Party who spoke also.  I know they have a policy on this issue which I admire but they should make that policy known.  They should not come in, one speak from one side of the mouth and another from the other side. As far as I am concerned that is not politics.</P>
    <P>There are many reports available from both sides on the Shannon issue. Members should read those reports and, if they like, take on the Minister but they should not engage in the luxury of saying one thing and doing another.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan took the party stand and will speak for himself in a few moments.  He does not need any <Col N="1266" /> help from Deputy Vincent Brady. Deputy Brady has sufficient on his plate fighting his own battles.  Indeed, I would say he fought them very badly in recent times.  Deputy Brady should not come in here and snipe at me.  He should have said his piece where it counted and not gone behind closed doors to do so.  He should have fought his battle and opted out.  There is no point in running away from battles; one must fight one's battles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, I am proud to be back with this party.  Our party will not turn their back on Aer Lingus and its workforce.  We will stand by them, as we have done in the past, because we believe the company is viable and can be saved with some ingenuity, good will and intelligence. But, above all, it is important that Government support be available, particularly financial support.  We will not baulk at that one either.  As Deputy Rabbitte mentioned, £50 million was made available in this House last week for which I voted &mdash; because I am not a hypocrite on that issue &mdash; to aid exporters.  Every week we appear to vote money for agricultural sectoral interests, but we must remember that the workforce of Aer Lingus all form part of our society.  We intend to ensure that their rights are supported here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had not much time to say what I would have liked on the Shannon issue. I would like to have dealt with some of <Col N="1267" /> the points raised.  But beidh lá eile ag an bPaorach.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned there is one way forward only for Aer Lingus, through co-operation, consensus and Government support; nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indeed pleased to bring this debate on Aer Lingus and air transport to a conclusion.  Indeed, were it not for the Labour Party, and the commitment of the Parliamentary Labour Party, in allowing this motion to be tabled this evening to judge by the performance of the Government over the years we would wait many years before the urgency of present circumstances would be realised.  I predict today will go down in history as the day this Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government failed Aer Lingus.  I shall not refer to the Progressive Democrats because I know their policy in relation to Aer Lingus and its privatisation.  Instead I will refer to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This successful semi-State company, to the forefront over the past 56 years in facilitating and participating in the economic growth and development of this country at local, national and international levels, sought the Minister's help and that of the Government in the form of State equity to bring their finances round.  The Minister failed them in their time of need.  It is not that Aer Lingus have been approaching successive Governments with a begging bowl over the years; they never did so.  On the contrary, they have been highly successful in a most <Col N="1268" /> competitive field.  Up to two years ago they achieved substantial profits, providing dividends for the State coffers.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the vote tonight, notwithstanding the Minister's remarkable comments when she met the board last week, will be retrenchment, cutbacks in services and, ultimately, the privatisation of the company and its subsidiaries.  We all know that such remedial action has led in other countries to massive redundancies and unemployment.  This will have a devastating effect on thousands of families nationwide, particularly those in the wider north Dublin area about which I am speaking.  That area witnessed a net loss of some 20,000 jobs in the industrial field since 1973.  The Fianna Fáil Party of the past &mdash; which established Aer Lingus in 1936 &mdash; would not have adopted this approach.  Indeed, I am sure many of their members and workers in the aviation industry are shocked at their change of policy this evening.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Members for their contributions in the course of this important, timely debate.  I appeal to the Government to withdraw their amendment and support our motion.  My constituency colleague gave an enthusiastic commitment to Aer Lingus which I share fully.  I call on him to support the motion which seeks to provide the necessary equity to ensure that Aer Lingus can compete with other airlines in Europe and world wide, thereby ensuring the future of the company and its staff.  I ask the House to support our motion.</P>

      <P>The Molnlycke factory in Dunmanway in south-west Cork is the biggest industrial employer in west Cork and has a workforce of 250.  Thus, the announcement last weekend that the factory is to reduce that workforce by more than half is a devastating blow to the entire area.  Already the jobless total in south west Cork is at its highest level since the foundation of the State.  We can ill-afford to lose such a significant number of industrial jobs on top of the existing record levels of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The impact is, of course, especially felt in Dunmanway town and district, where the people were already trying to come to terms with the closure last month of another small factory in the town and the letting go of a number of employees in a factory in the nearby village of Enniskean.</P>
      <P>The Molnlycke factory was established in the town of Dunmanway in 1975 and experienced two large expansions in the eighties.  It is part of the Swedish group which employs 10,900 people worldwide and has manufacturing units in 15 countries, with a turnover of more than £1 billion.  It is a major operation internationally. This multinational company blame the cutbacks in Dunmanway on the European recession.  That may be a very small part of their operation, but the consequence of this decision is despair in many households in the Dunmanway area where couples are striving to make ends meet and are now wondering how they can meet their mortgage repayments.</P>
      <P>The Government have a responsibility to our area which they have not discharged. The first act on coming into office in 1987 was to axe the £15 million west Cork package put in place by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government. Since then no industrial project of consequence has been established in south-west Cork and clearly we figure very low on the priority list of the present administration.  I demand, for whatever remains of the term of this Government, that top priority be given to south-west Cork in the location of new industrial jobs.  Unless this commitment is given and acted upon the continuing haemorrhage of emigration and unemployment will be seen as the only plan which this Government have for west Cork.  We have a crisis at local level in relation to unemployment.  I do not want to hear from the Minister, by way of excuse, about the national situation.  The unemployment figures in south-west Cork are worse than the national figures and the present situation will make it even worse.  I should like to know whether this Government have any response, any ray of hope, that will give confidence to our people in south-west Cork that they care one whit for the plight of our people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, for allowing me time to speak on this very important matter.  I join with him and call on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to seek an <Col N="1275" /> immediate meeting with the management of Molnlycke Limited to ascertain if the restructuring programme in their Dunmanway factory, where over 50 per cent of the workforce have been made redundant, will be carried out in the manufacturing units in the other 14 countries throughout the world where they are established.  They boast of employing 10,654 outside this country with a turnover of over £1 billion.  Is Ireland the only country where they are winding down their operations?</P>
      <P>The Irish factory was grant aided generously by the IDA.  On that ground the Minister should request them to withdraw this hasty and premature action and to weather the competition storm which they fear they will encounter in the surgical gown market in Europe and throughout the world.  Competition is the life of trade.  Surely they owe something more to this country than winding down operations in this manner.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to take immediate action with that company to ascertain whether they will implement that policy in the other 14 countries throughout the world in which they operate.  If not, he should have another look at the Dunmanway company to ensure that they maintain their workforce, because south-west Cork is a job starved constituency. A setback such as this is highly detrimental to the morale of the constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to apologise for the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister was aware that Molnlycke Limited announced on Friday a restructuring of its Irish factory in Dunmanway which will have the effect of reducing by 126 its workforce of 246.  The situation is at an early stage and discussions have just started with employee representatives on the company's rationalisation plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Molnlycke Limited, originally Steritex Ltd, was established in 1974 and started operations in Dunmanway in 1975, producing <Col N="1276" /> plastic medical disposables &mdash; surgical gowns, caps and drapes.  It is part of the Clinical Products Division of Molnlycke AB, Sweden, which is in turn part of the giant Swedish forest group SCA.  The company underwent major expansions in the years 1985, 1987 and 1990.  These projects were assisted by the IDA.  Over the past two years the parent company has invested over IR£1 million in new equipment.  The Dunmanway factory today produces an extensive range of disposable surgical drapes.</P>
    <P>Management told staff on Friday that the announcement was a reflection of the European recession and the market conditions Molnlycke are facing for their disposable surgical drapes and gowns business in Europe.  Competition from Far Eastern products has greatly affected the company in their European markets. The Irish operation is now going to concentrate on the manufacture of surgical drapes.  The company remain optimistic that the restructuring will strengthen their competitiveness in future years, but at the same time they are actively developing new products.  The new products, while having a very positive initial reaction, have not so far succeeded in making a significant impact on a highly competitive market but are confidently expected to do so at some stage.</P>
    <P>The IDA met with the company on Friday, 23 October 1992 to discuss the rationalisation plans.  The company have had no option in the face of severe competition from Far Eastern products but to reduce the workforce at their Irish operation in Dunmanway.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Minister has no direct responsibility for the action of the Swedish parent company or indeed any other firm in the running of its business.</P>
    <P>I understand from the IDA that discussions are continuing with Molnlycke with a view to getting the company to manufacture new products at its Dunmanway facility.  Other steps being taken to assist the south-west Cork area include actively marketing a 24,000 sq. ft. facility in Bantry, which is 12 miles from Dunmanway. This facility has been visited by three overseas companies in the last six <Col N="1277" /> to eight weeks.  All overseas officers are fully aware of the availability of factory space and the advantages of the area.</P>
    <P>Three 3,000 sq. ft. units are being actively promoted in Skibereen, which is 16 miles from Dunmanway.  These units are primarily suited for start-ups and indigenous industry.  The south-west Cork area is being marketed as an entity. As a number of Molynlycke workers live in the surrounding towns of Bantry, Skibereen and Bandon as well as Dunmanway and its hinterland, they may find alternative employment as a result of these efforts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>In summary, the Minister is conscious of the employment situation in the south-west Cork area and of the impact of the job losses at Molynlycke on the Dunmanway area in particular. I can assure the Deputy that the IDA will continue their strenuous efforts to locate new industries in the area which, as previously stated, is being marketed as an entity.  While support agencies play an important part in assisting industrial development and expansion, much depends on the external trading environment. It is regrettable that at this time the European recession, coupled with intense competition from Far East products, has led to this unfortunate job loss situation in Dunmanway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I appreciate the opportunity you have given to me to raise a matter which is the subject of serious concern in County Tipperary.  It is causing a great deal of anger and frustration, is the subject of rumour and counter-rumour, allegation and gossip and, if allowed to carry on without clarification, it will completely undermine the hopes and aspirations of a number of people who have invested heavily of their time and resources.  I refer to the Leader programme, a <Col N="1278" /> scheme designed to give a substantial boost to entrepreneurial flair in rural development and the means by which talent and ambition could bring dreams to fruition.  The exact opposite has happened. Not alone have dreams been savagely shattered, but a number of people have been driven to the edge of despair by the manner in which they have been treated and by the way their plans for the future have been trampled on.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme in Tipperary is being administered by the Tipperary Enterprise Company, an organisation set up initially to promote the county and its products.  It is now clearly evident that this was a major mistake in relation to the Leader programme.  Far from being administered, the scheme is in a state of dissaray and appears to be in a hopeless tangle.  The reason for this is that Tipperary Enterprise lacks the administrative structure to properly look after such a scheme and should not have been the vehicle chosen to do so in the first place, given that Shannon Development and Tipperary County Councils already had the administrative structures and expertise to discharge the responsibilities of a scheme involving £2.5 million of public money.  The board of Tipperary Enterprise are all highly competent people, chosen because of their excellence in their own fields of endeavour. Their individual competence or ability is not in question.  What is at issue is why the responsibility for the Leader programme was handed to a company which simply do not have the administrative backup necessary for the proper execution of their duties in this matter.</P>

    <P>A number of projects which had been prepared for submission to the Leader programme and which were destined for financial assistance &mdash; some of these had been given unequivocal verbal assurances and others written assurances that support would be forthcoming &mdash; eventually found themselves caught up in a morass of conflicting replies, half truths and plain downright bungling.  One project was submitted last year and was given approval in late 1991 to go ahead.  On the basis of a written assurance from Tipperary <Col N="1279" /> Enterprise, the project organisers went ahead and arranged bridging finance. They were assured that the project was excellent, that it passed the feasibility study and received written confirmation that it met all the Leader guidelines.  Yet a bare two months later the amount of money promised was slashed from £30,000 to £10,000 despite the organisers having already committed themselves to a substantial bank overdraft.  It took a further two months of hassle and extreme difficulty to get a payment through a bank account in Clonmel.  This action has effectively scuttled the project and wasted public and private funds.  This is not what was envisaged for the Leader progrmme.</P>
    <P>The abysmal standards of administration and the total lack of professionalism in the scheme are illustrated by the way in which a community-based project in Borrisokane, sponsored by Tipperary Lakeside Development Company is being betrayed.  In its original format, the project was included as an integral part of the Tipperary Enterprise Leader submission to Brussels and the organisers were given to understand that the application was successful under four broad headings.  That was over 18 months ago and now, despite having a massive voluntary input into the project, despite having a number of business people waiting to move into premises, despite having appointed a project director and having leased a property from Shannon Development, no definite funding has been forthcoming.  Co-operation from Tipperary Enterprise has been badly lacking and in fact promises already made are being reneged upon.  One of the people intimately involved in the project has told me that from their earliest dealings with Tipperary Enterprise they have been appalled by the lack of business practice, even to the basic courtesy of answering letters.  I understand that Tipperary Enterprise Company are presently functioning without a chief executive, that telephone calls are responded to only by an answering machine, that staff have been disemployed <Col N="1280" /> and that they are now operating with a skeleton staff.  The company have serious financial problems.</P>
    <P>Very serious questions are awaiting reply.  Is the Minister aware through his Department's representative on the board, of the alarming, disgraceful and unacceptable level of incompetence displayed by administrators purporting to represent Tipperary Enterprise and the Leader programme?  Is he further aware that by defaulting on commitments an appalling level of financial hardship, mental stress and strain has been inflicted on individuals whose dreams have been shattered.  Where does the accountability lie in this case, and what steps is the Minister taking to ensure that all promises given will be substantiated with finance?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister how much money has actually been handed over to Tipperary Enterprise for disbursement under the Leader programme?  Could the Minister also tell us, how much of the money has been spent to date on approved projects, and how many they are in number?  Further, could I ask the Minister how much has been spent on the administration of the programme by Tipperary Enterprise and what percentage this forms of the total amount handed over?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the budgetary guidelines are being met, and that administrative spending is within the ratio laid down?  Is the Minister satisfied that applicant project submissions are being examined and treated in a dispassionate and objective fashion, since many worthwhile projects are not being accepted and there appears to be a degree of selective subjectivity in some assessments that have been accepted?  Who has the final decision on the eligibility of projects offered?  Could the Minister even attempt to explain how an executive of a company disbursing money on behalf of his Department could sign a contract for £89,000 for a computer which, a short time later, has current value of £15,000? These questions must be answered as a matter of urgency in order to protect the future of the Leader programme and to assure the public that the confusion, anomalies <Col N="1281" /> and administrative failures will be corrected to enable the scheme to be conducted in an orderly and proper fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Lowry's concern and I am disappointed to hear his analysis of the Leader management team in Tipperary. He has outlined for me and for Members of the House a number of very serious anomalies as he has presented them.  I want to assure the Deputy that the statement which he has made here tonight <i>vis-á-vis</i> the operation of Leader management in Tipperary will be fully examined and analysed by me immediately.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should say &mdash; I am sure most Deputies know and I do not wish to spend time explaining this &mdash; that Leader is the EC's own initiative in rural development.  The programme runs for the period 1991-93 and is funded to some £35 million; £21 million is provided from the European Community and £14 million is provided by national funds.  It is being made available for 16 Irish groups covering about half the country.  The programme is a pilot one with limited funding and so it is not possible to cover all parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Leader is to assist rural communities to develop their own areas in accordance with their own priorities. The essential approach, therefore, is what is popularly called &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; development.  In line with this, the most significant feature of the programme is that the decisions about the investments to be undertaken with the global grants provided by the EC and the national authorities rests with the groups themselves. In effect, the groups are the grant-giving agencies in their own respective areas for the purposes of the investment categories set out in the Leader programme such as, rural tourism, small firms, craft enterprises and local services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to explain the role of my Department in this important initiative.  The EC has designated the Department as the so-called &ldquo;intermediary body&rdquo; in Ireland, <Col N="1282" /> that is, the organisation responsible for its implementation here from a national point of view.  For this purpose there is a formal legal agreement between the EC Commission and the Department on the one hand and between the Department and each Leader group on the other. These agreements clearly spell out the respective duties and obligations of each of the parties which is necessary to ensure the smoothest possible operation of the programme.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department have provided all the groups here with comprehensive guidelines on the operation of the programme to ensure both that the group's operations are compatible with EC and national sectoral policies as regards granting of aid, and that there is a maximum co-operation at local level with all the official grant-giving agencies. In addition officials of my Department are available at all reasonable times for consultation on any difficulties that may be encountered at local level by these individual Leader groups.  Arrangements have also been made for periodic visits by inspectors of the Department to the group to discuss and monitor their progress.</P>
    <P>These mechanisms have been put in place not to hinder or limit the operations of the groups but to ensure that the &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; principle can be exercised to the maximum in the full spirit of the programme as intended.</P>
    <P>I have had the privilege of being involved with the formal launching of some of the Irish Leader groups including Tipperary, in recent months and participating in other functions organised by the various groups.  On these and on other occasions I have been at pains to stress my total commitment to the principles of Leader and my concern that the opportunities provided by the programme be grasped by these individual groups.  In this connection I cannot emphasise too often that the success of Leader rests ultimately on the groups themselves and that this will determine to a significant degree the decision on whether the EC Commission will launch <Col N="1283" /> a second Leader programme for the post-1993 period.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it clear how this innovative programme is intended to work.  I am fully supportive of the groups' efforts in making it a success &mdash; and will do everything I can to help and to iron out any difficulties that may arise from time to time.  The onus to making Leader work in practice rests, as I have indicated, primarily on the capacity and enthusiasm of the local groups.  Both the EC Commission and the Irish authorities have entrusted the programme to them on the basis of the quality of the business plans they submitted for funding last year.  Now we are at the stage where the groups must repay that trust.  This is the first time that local groups are being given the resources to undertake the development of their areas, based on their own priorities rather than on what has been decided for them elsewhere.  On the evidence to date I am convinced that these groups are succeeding.  I do not wish to delay the House but I want to reiterate that I take seriously the points raised by the Deputy in the House tonight.  As I said in my opening comments, I will have these allegations investigated immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being present in the House to reply to the matter.  At the outset I should say that there was an appreciation among sheep farmers generally at the decision to bring forward the headage payments by three weeks so as to ease the serious financial problems of some sheep farmers. However, there was total consternation at the decision to reduce the level of grant by 35-40 per cent in some cases.  This reduction arose from a regulation which has recently been introduced.</P>
      <P>People who had been paid a grant for a number of years were reasonably accurate in their estimation of the amount they should receive.  When they made inquiries about the reduction they were advised that a new regulation had been introduced by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  They were told that in the case of mountain ewe headage payments the acreage related exclusively to mountain grazing.  This meant that small farmers with sheep in closed fields were excluded from availing of the grant. I am sure the Minister realises that farms in handicapped areas are small and uneconomic and that when we speak of mountain grazing we are referring to mountain farms.  I understand that the people who had their grants so drastically reduced were told that the remainder of their farms were being treated as lowlands. One would find it very difficult to explain to a farmer who lives at the foot of mountain in Cahirciveen or Killorglin that fields which had been excavated and reclaimed over generations were being treated as lowlands.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to urgently review this regulation with a view to restoring to these people the grants to which they are legitimately entitled.  This reduction in the grant has inflicted much hardship on these people.  As this is a Department of Agriculture and Food regulation the Minister has the power to remove it and restore the well deserved grants in respect of all ewes maintained by these farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan for sharing his valuable time with me. This anomaly has led to a reduction in <Col N="1285" /> the incomes of sheep farmers living in disadvantaged areas.  It has added to the reduction in income already suffered by sheep farmers as a result of the schemes operated by the EC which have led to changes in the premium headage payment and the collapse in the market value of lambs.  It is essential that the Minister of State acts with all speed to remove this anomaly.  The Minister can fight to remove the other anomalities which we asked him to remove two weeks ago so that sheep farmers would not have to march to Dublin to make their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan and Deputy Ferris for raising this very important matter with me.  Payments of the 1992 headage grants to farmers in disadvantaged areas commenced in mid-October and some £60 million has now been paid.  A further £2 million will be paid during the coming weeks.  The position under the sheep headage scheme is that grants are payable on the following types of animals: (a) certain breeds of mountain breeding ewes which are substantially maintained on mountain grazings within the disadvantaged areas and (b) hogget ewes of all breeds, irrespective of whether they are maintained on mountain or lowland grazings within the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>However, there are restrictions on the amount which can be paid.  No flock owner can be paid grants on more than 200 ewes or hogget ewes combined.  No flock owner can be paid in grants more than 36.27p per forage acre of his holding. This allows for payment on a maximum of 3.627 ewes or hogget ewes per acre.  The limit of three to the acre, which over the years has been applied to mountain grazings, is very reasonable considering that the maximum which can be applied to lowland grazing is 3.627.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where flocks consist entirely of breeding ewes there is no reasonable case which can be made for extending the limit beyond three to the mountain acre. However, in the case of flocks made up of breeding or hogget ewes, I am delighted to be able to say that I am prepared to respond sympathetically to the <Col N="1286" /> possibility of accommodating on lowland grazings a surplus of hogget ewes which were excluded by the three to the acre restriction on the mountain grazings.  I think that is what the Deputies are asking me to do here this evening.</P>
    <P>While my Department will be looking at the situation of such flock owners during the coming weeks, it would help them if any flock owners who fall into the category were to bring their cases to the attention of the local office of the Department. As I said, genuine cases will be sympathetically examined.  I acknowledged that the anomaly which both Deputies have brought to my attention deserves urgent and sympathetic consideration by my Department.  I can assure them that this matter will receive immediate attention.</P>

      <P>One of the headlines in <i>The Sligo Champion</i> last week read &ldquo;Sligo train service under attack again&rdquo;. Sadly there is nothing unusual about criticism of the Sligo-Dublin rail service, but what is unusual this time is the origin of the criticism.  This time the criticism which is quite rough, was not made by the Sligo Chamber of Commerce, Sligo Corporation or me but was made by a man who lives in Los Angeles.  This man <Col N="1287" /> has visited Ireland twice in recent times, twice he has used the Dublin-Sligo rail service and twice he has come a cropper. The first time the train did not arrive and he had to finish his journey by bus.  On 8 August everything was OK until the train was five miles on the Sligo side of Mullingar when an engine gave up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The train was stopped first for ten minutes, then 20 minutes and eventually limped into Dublin almost one hour late.  That was the experience of a man called Peter J. Gillan who lives in Washington Place, L.A.  One wonders how many other people with similar experience have never written to a newspaper. How much damage has the condition of the Sligo-Dublin line done to the north-west, to tourism and business in particular, apart from the convenience of the people of the north-west area who are entitled to a decent rail service, just as good as they have in Cork.</P>
      <P>It is not the fault of Irish Rail.  The trouble is with the track, the signalling system and the rolling stock.  They are so bad that speeds have to be reduced to 40 miles an hour or less.  That is no way to run a railway.  This year some improvements have been made.  Some £2 million was spent on continuous welded rail. That is enough to do seven miles.  At that rate it would take 20 years to complete the job.  Needless to say, the people of Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and the north-west will not wait that long.  We are seeking greatly increased investment in track renewal in 1993 and inclusion of the railways in the next <i>tranche</i> of Structural Funds, with priority given where it belongs to the Sligo-Dublin line, and a definite timetable for when the track, signalling system and rolling stock will be brought up to a decent modern standard.  The people in the north-west are calling &ldquo;time&rdquo; on the second class rail service on offer.  I have to admit, in fairness to Irish Rail, that they very successfully brought the Sam Maguire Cup from Dublin to Sligo on its way to Donegal.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the specific question of the Sligo line I should say that Exchequer support for the mainline rail network as a whole has been very significant over the years.  Total direct support for the railways amounted to over £940 million between 1980 and 1991.  In addition capital investment of almost £230 million was made by CIE in the network over the same period.  In the current year the Exchequer financial support to CIE amounts to over £108 million, of which £90 million is being allocated to Iarnród Éireann.  Of the £90 million which will be received by the railway £45 million will go towards the maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure, that is, the trackwork, signalling, stations, bridges etc. &mdash; the physical basis on which railway services are operated. The other £45 million will go towards the operation of socially necessary services which do not operate on a commercial basis and to make interest and other exceptional payments, including £10 million in respect of the loans taken out to finance the development of the DART system.  Apart from the DART interest, the deployment of the Exchequer support is a matter entirely for CIE and Iarnród Éireann themselves.</P>
      <P>The public capital programme for 1992 provides for capital expenditure of £17.8 million by Iarnród Éireann on investment in rolling stock, signalling equipment and other essential rail related infrastructure. The allocation of these resources to specific programmes and projects is a matter for Iarnród Éireann.  When viewed against the severe financial constraints on the Exchequer in recent years the level of State support which has been and continues to be provided to the railway is clear and incontrovertible evidence of the Government's commitment to the railway network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I are aware of the concern of the people of the west of Ireland about the railway network.  The Minister met a delegation from Sligo Borough Council earlier this year and heard at first hand their concerns about the future of the Dublin-Sligo line.  The deputation also had a detailed discussion with <Col N="1289" /> senior officials of the Department on the matter.  In the course of these discussions the deputation was reassured that there were no proposals to close or downgrade the line.  At that time there was a particular concern about the postponement by Iarnród Éireann of some track renewal work on the line during last year which led to the introduction of some speed restrictions on parts of the line between Mullingar and Sligo.  I am pleased to say that that particular difficulty has been overcome and track renewal and maintenance work involving expenditure of over £2 million has been spent on the line this year.  Some of the speed restrictions have been removed and I have been informed that Iarnród Éireann hope to have the remaining restrictions on the line removed as soon as possible.  These improvements will be reflected in the 1993 timetable for services on the line.</P>
    <P>More generally, the Deputy will be aware that Sligo station has been upgraded as part of Iarnród Éireann's Transtrack freight re-organisation and it now caters for groupage and sundry freight traffic for the north-west region. Plans are already well advanced for the replacement and upgrading, with financial assistance from the European Community, of the rail freight gantry crane at Sligo station.  The new gantry crane will be capable of lifting larger containers and of more efficient operation generally, expediting the movement of heavy cargo through the station.  These improvements to services at the station are evidence of Iarnród Éireann's commitment to the Dublin-Sligo line.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department, in conjunction with CIE and the Department of Finance, are currently conducting a major strategic review of the mainline rail network.  Consultants have been engaged by my Department to assist in this work and it is expected that they will be submitting their report shortly.  The study will address all the major issues, including the options for the future of the railway network and the costs, investment requirement and funding possibilities in relation to these options.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this review the Minister <Col N="1290" /> will be bringing proposals before the Government for a major investment programme for the national railway network for which she will be seeking significant EC assistance under the next <i>tranche</i> of Structural Funds and the proposed Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise an important matter with the Minister of the Marine.  I refer to the necessity for his Department to grant category A status to Roaring Water Bay in south-west Cork.  Over 700 tonnes of mussels were exported to the French retail market at a total value of over £500,000 during the past 12 months.  It is vitally important to the industry in the bay that the waters there be classified as category A status.  Over 50 people are employed in this development and any EC directive that would impinge on it would sound the death knell of this expanding industry.  The quality of the water in the bay is outstanding.  It is of vital importance for the Department to issue a favourable decision as soon as possible if the energetic work force is to be maintained in a jobs starved area.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accede to the request of the Roaring Water Bay Fish Farm association for the construction of a breakwater cum pier and an area for the training of mussels for the export market.  This is a very important facet of mussel production.  A training area is important if the industry is to survive. Plans have already been submitted to the Department and the project has been given priority.  Work has begun on the taking of levels and so on.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give a commitment that the meagre grant of only £250,000 will be made available because it will mean so much to the development of Roaring Water Bay.  I ask the Minister to give the green light.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan added several items to the original matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that all areas, including Roaring Water Bay, will be fully classified by the end of November and that my Department will be in a position to issue classifications for all such areas during <Col N="1291" /> December.  I think it would be helpful to explain the background to the classification of areas for mariculture development.</P>
    <P>A new EC Directive laying down the health conditions for the production and placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs is due to come into effect on 1 January 1993.  My Department have been actively preparing for the introduction of the new standards for some time and I am confident that we will be ready to comply with the parameters set down in the Directives.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;live bivalve molluscs&rdquo; refers to certain filter feeding shellfish, which in Irish waters mainly cover mussels, scallops, native and Japanese oysters and clams.  In order to be fit for direct human consumption the live bivalve molluscs must fall into what is commonly known as category A.  Under this category the product must contain less than or equal to three faecal coliforms per gram of mollusc flesh.  This is quite a high standard and not all areas will fall into that category.</P>
    <P>There are two other categories known as B and C.  Shellfish in category B may not exceed 60 faecal coliforms per gram of flesh.  These bivalve molluscs may be collected but may only be placed on the market for human consumption after treatment in an approved depuration centre or after relaying in clean waters for a suitable period of time.</P>
    <P>Finally, bivalve molluscs in category C may not exceed 600 faecal coliforms per gram of flesh.  These may be collected but placed on the market only after relaying over a long period of a least two months, which may also include intensive purification, for a period yet to get laid down by the Community's veterinary experts.</P>
    <P>The processes required for purification of bivalve molluscs coming from areas that fall into categories B and C will be necessary until the products from these areas reach the standard set for category A.  By 1 January next my Department must provide to those producers affected, lists classifying into categories A, B and C production and relaying areas from which live bivalve molluscs may be taken.</P>
    <P>I will bear in mind the questions raised <Col N="1292" /> about construction work etc.  I agree with the Deputy that the area is a very important one.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter and, indeed, the Minister for the Marine for his presence in the House.</P>
      <P>The drop in the value of sterling is having disastrous repercussions on the Irish fishing industry and at present there are hundreds of jobs in imminent danger of collapsing and vanishing.</P>
      <P>The problem is twofold: first, a high and significant percentage of our fish catch is being sold into the United Kingdom and due to the drop in the value of sterling we are getting between 15 per cent and 20 per cent less for our product than we were a few weeks ago.  This is particularly true of the white fish sector and that part of the industry is in a deep and serious crisis.</P>
      <P>Second any fish product that is common to Ireland and the UK such as shellfish, crabs and prawns is also in severe difficulty.  We are competing with the United Kingdom in a common European market in France, Spain, Portugal and Germany.  The United Kingdom have passed on their devaluation to their continental customers and we are unable to compete due to the high value of our punt.</P>
      <P>Again the situation is critical in the mackerel and herring area.  Our main competitor again is Scotland and with the benefit of their devaluation being passed on to our common and shared customers we are being severely undercut.  The terrifying result of this is that hundreds of jobs are in jeopardy and urgent action is immediately required if we are to avoid the total collapse of our fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediate steps must be taken by the Minister and the Government to safeguard an industry that is totally based on one of our most valuable natural resources.  I would suggest that the market development fund should immediately be extended to the industry. It is not sufficient to just extend it to the exporters as the fleet and the operators are also in danger of collapsing.  An urgent relief rescue package for the industry is immediately required to protect <Col N="1293" /> our fishermen and those engaged in the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government responded immediately to the difficulties being faced by Irish firms on account of the unprecedented sterling currency situation.  On 6 October the Government set up a market development fund.  Up to £50 million has been made available to assist Irish firms and enable them to maintain employment.  This fund is administered by a management board on which I am represented by a senior official of my Department.  A full time management team has been specially drawn together from An Bord Tráchtála, IDA, FAS and the Civil Service on the basis of their expertise and knowledge of the sectors affected.</P>
      <P>Over the next few days applicants who meet the criteria for grant aid will be told the level of grant support which they can expect.  I have set up a helpline to assist those involved in fishing, fish processing and fish exporting.  This week some 20 firms are being assisted in contacting buyers and demonstrating their products at the SIAL Food Fair in Paris.  This is a major international showcase and allows our fish and shellfish exporters to tap into the major European markets.  Fish exporters are also being supported by in store promotions in retail chains in the UK and France.  The Government have also specifically set aside £1 million for accessing and identifying new markets.</P>
      <P>On 8 October I moved a Supplementary Estimate here in the House for £100,000 to add to the £50,000 already secured for the fishing sector.  This fund of £150,000 will be administered through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I have directed my Department and BIM to extend any assistance they can to those who are affected by the currency movements. This is in addition to the general service set up to deal with applications to the market development fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the work undertaken by the Government centrally, I have also set up a helpline to ensure that there is continuous contact with the individuals in the industry.  We first dealt with the associations representing the industry and then set up direct contact with the <Col N="1294" /> individuals to ensure that any assistance that was available would be given to them and also that any difficulties they were having would be reflected immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy McGinley, I would like to thank the Minister for being present in the House.  All too often Cabinet Ministers do not attend for adjournment debates or grievance time discussions.  We appreciate his presence.</P>
      <P>The question I want to raise is about the ramming of a Helvick trawler the <i>Ainnir Ordha</i> at dawn on 31 March 1991 by a Spanish trawler by the name of <i>The Nuevo Ebenezer.</i>  This ramming took place 40 miles south of Baltimore in west Cork.  As a result £40,000 worth of damage was caused to the trawler and the boat was laid up for a month afterwards.</P>
      <P>In regard to the ramming, it was a ramming, not an accident.  The previous day the Spanish trawler had warned the Helvick boat to get out of the area as it was interfering with its fishing operations and those of its sister ship, another Spanish boat.  The ramming took place in sinister circumstances in that a second Spanish boat positioned itself in such a way that the Helvick trawler was unable to evade the ramming procedure.</P>
      <P>The Helvick boat sent out a distress signal and, as the <i>Nuevo Ebenezer</i> was coming around to ram it a second time, to finish it off and sink it, the distress call it had put out was answered by the Killybegs trawler the <i>Veronica.</i>  Were it not for the response from the <i>Veronica</i>, which was heading towards the vicinity of the incident, I have no doubt but that the Helvick boat would have been rammed a second time and sunk. Whether or not there would have been fatalities is a matter of conjecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know what procedures the Government have put in place to apprehend and prosecute the Spanish skipper and boat owners in question.  It was a deliberate act of piracy.  It was a criminal act and the people responsible will have to be made accountable for their actions.  Has the Spanish Ambassador been called in by the Government?  Was the boat apprehended by the Irish Naval Service afterwards?  Were the crew questioned? Have the Spanish Government <Col N="1295" /> made any offer of damages?  Have they prosecuted the individuals concerned? How is the skipper of the boat going to be compensated?  Have the Government, through the Department of the Marine or the Department of Foreign Affairs, made any approaches to the Spaniards? If not, are they going to do so?  The events are irrefutable and the crew of the Helvick boat were lucky to escape with their lives.  This type of incident is all too prevalent and it does not always end in ramming but rather wholesale intimidation. I ask the Minister to take a stand and to see to it that the people responsible are brought to book.</P>

      <P>The incident to which the Deputy refers involved a collision between the Irish trawler <i>Ainnir Ordha</i> and a Spanish registered fishing vessel, the <i>Nuevo Ebenezer</i> on 31 March 1991. As was explained to this House shortly after the incident, the appropriate form of redress in cases of collisions involving an Irish and a foreign vessel outside territorial waters is by way of civil action.  I understand that proceedings under civil law have been initiated by the owner of the <i>Ainnir Ordha.</i>  I have noted what the Deputy said about the alleged ramming in this case.</P>
      <P>The incident was investigated by the Navy and by a marine surveyor of my Department.  The question of alleged ramming incidents involving Irish and Spanish fishing vessels in the waters off the south-west coast was taken up with the Spanish authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the Deputy I would like to outline the legal background to our national regulations governing collisions at sea.  The &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; for ships moving in our territorial waters are contained in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, as amended.  The latter are implemented internationally on a uniform <Col N="1296" /> basis and that basis is enshrined in the Collision Regulations (Ships and Water Craft on the Water) Order, 1984, as amended by the Collision Regulations (Ships and Water Craft on the Water) (Amendment) Order, 1990.</P>
    <P>Those committing wilful breaches of these regulations are guilty of a mis-demeanour under section 419 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 and are punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to two years under section 680 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  However, there is a difficulty in that the collision regulations do not apply to foreign-registered vessels where incidents occur outside our territorial waters.  The incident referred to by the Deputy occurred outside territorial waters.  In the circumstances the only option is to report to the maritime authority of the flag state concerned and this was done.</P>
    <P>A basic tenet of maritime law is that the flag state is responsible for the regulation of its vessels' behaviour in international waters.  The response of the Spanish authorities was that they were anxious to help and would not hesitate to take action against Spanish nationals in situations where it could be shown that they had been culpable.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I am anxious that the State's powers in this area should be enhanced to provide a more effective remedy in cases such as this.  The Attorney General has been asked to examine this complex area of maritime law to see if any means can be found of overcoming the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not feasible to take a civil action in this case because of the costs involved.  It involved ramming, not a collision.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 October 1992.</P>

      <P>The position is that persons appointed as aeronautical engineers in the Air Corps are usually in possession of basic degree level engineering qualifications on appointment and require further training for a number of years before they are fully qualified aeronautical engineers. The Gleeson Commission accepted that the granting of applications for retirement from Air Corps officers must be done on a phased basis which allows for the gradual release of officers, while allowing the Air Corps to fulfil its operational commitments.  Since the publication of the Gleeson report a policy of <Col N="1073" /> allowing a limited number of Air Corps officers to retire each year has been implemented.  Under that policy two aeronautical engineers were granted permission to retire in 1990 and one aeronautical engineer was granted permission to retire this year.  It is considered unlikely that the compulsory retention of any category of Air Corps officers will be necessary after 1995.</P>

      <P>The Gleeson Commission which has been established by the Government to review conditions of service in the Defence Forces recommended in 1990 that &ldquo;the selection of officers for promotion should change from a system based almost exclusively on seniority to a system based on merit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The commission outlined a new system of promotion, the principal feature of which was the establishment of promotion boards to assess and interview candidates for promotion up to the level of brigadier-general.  The boards would comprise senior military officers and in the case of certain ranks a civilian member appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>Promotion boards are required to certify that an officer recommended for promotion is considered best fitted for promotion having regard to a number of criteria as regards suitability.  These criteria include: (a) leadership qualities and capacity for personnel management; (b) performance in appointments held; (c) innovative and initiative demonstrated; (d) qualities of reliability, devotion to duty, zeal, industry and ability; (e) recommendations in Annual Confidential Reports or equivalent certifications; (f) performance at various courses of training, and (g) length of service in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>These criteria are based on the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission and, following consultation with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, were set down in Defence Force Regulations which are Statutory Instruments made by the Minister for Defence under the Defence Act, 1954, as amended.</P>

    <P>Arrangements for the holding of promotion competitions, including eligibility requirements and criteria for assessment of candidates, are appropriate for discussion <Col N="1075" /> and agreement through the representative structure which has been established.

      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes provide for the payment of a special increment of £3.34 a week in addition to his basic pension to a soldier for each year of his pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years. As a general rule, this special increment continues to be payable until the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension (at age 65) or to a contributory old age pension (at age 66), at which stage the increment ceases to be payable.  This is in accordance with the principle of co-ordinating occupational pensions in the public sector with social welfare pensions in the case of employees who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>The loss of the additional increment (amounting to a maximum of £33.40 a week if the pensioner had 31 or more year's pensionable service) is more than compensated for by the social welfare pension which stands at £66.60 a week for an individual, with an additional £42.40 a week for an adult dependant.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Government programme to review statutory and information requirements which impact on business and industry, the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group (ICMG) in the period 1988 to 1990 assessed a wide range of issues covering such areas as the construction sector, labour legislation, environmental regulations and Revenue matters, to mention some of the major topics.  The ICMG made recommendations on these issues for consideration by the Departments concerned. In a number of cases, these recommendations were dealt with in the context of other developments, for example, the introduction of self-assessment for taxation purposes and reviews of labour legislation and planning, environmental and building legislation.</P>
      <P>Among the recommendations made by the Group, I am informed that the issues listed below were implemented and are representative of the broad range of issues which were assessed under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> 1.  The recommendation that small businesses should be allowed to make returns for PAYE/PRSI and VAT on a <Col N="1082" /> yearly basis with payments to continue as at present.</P>
    <P>2.  The recommendation that the limit for VAT exemption on parcel post by registered persons be increased from £200 to £500.</P>
    <P>3. The recommendations that procedures in relation to importation of goods by parcel post should be critically reviewed by Customs and Excise in conjunction with An Post as significant delays were experienced by importers.</P>
    <P>4.  The recommendation that the operations of the Land Registry Office should be reviewed with a view to the application of computerised systems which would lead to improved efficiency of procedures.</P>
    <P>5.  Duplicate Sub Contractor C2 certificates had to be returned to the Revenue Commissioners by the end of June every year.  The ICMG were not aware of any overriding reason for the early return of the duplicate certificates.  It, therefore, recommended that the possibility of their being available over the full year should be examined by Revenue.</P>
    <P>6.  It had been suggested by the Construction Industry Federation that, because of the high level of employee turnover in the construction industry, the Revenue Commissioners often mislaid P45s submitted to them and that this gave rise to a high frequency of requests for form P43.  The ICMG recommended that this issue be examined by the Revenue Commissioners sector were dealt with quickly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>7.  An office notice was issued to all Government Departments in March 1984 setting out the identification procedure to be followed in personal, written and telecommunications dealings with the public.  Given the period that had elapsed since this notice was issued, the ICMG recommended that the notice be updated and reissued by the Department of Finance and the Public Service.</P>
    <P>8.  The recommendation that the <Col N="1083" /> Department of the Environment should draw up regulations at national level to control the level and operations of bylaw approvals.</P>
    <P>9.  The recommendation that clear guidelines should exist for determining when an Environmental Impact Statement is required.</P>
    <P>10.  The recommendation that the format of the annual return to the companies Registration Office used by companies incorporated under the Companies Acts should be simplified.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to extend the deadline beyond May, 1993, for the urban renewal incentives in designated areas in view of the fact that currency fluctuations and the recession have combined to make it difficult for developers to put a complete package together in time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main impact on construction activity of the recent exchange rate upheaval is likely to come via the associated rise in interest rates.  As I have said elsewhere, I expect the recent increases in official and retail interest rates will only be temporary and that in a few months at most retail rates could fall back to previous levels.  An encouraging sign is that already wholesale money market rates are well below their peak.</P>
      <P>Given the temporary nature, therefore, of the current disturbance in the markets, I have no proposals to extend the existing deadline for the urban renewal incentives beyond the provisions made in section 29 of this year's Finance Act.  This allowed for final extensions to the current timescales applying to the urban renewal incentives in the Custom House Docks area and in the designated areas in general.  In the case of the designated areas in general the final extension is for one year, up to 31 May 1994, with the proviso that &ldquo;new build&rdquo; developments must have their foundations fully laid before 1 June, 1993.  The extension was given to allow for an orderly cessation of the incentives.  In the case of the Custom House Docks Area, and Temple Bar, the termination dates are 24 January 1997 and 5 April 1996 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ending of the incentives is as essential component of the Government's commitment to the reform of the tax <Col N="1086" /> system.  The aim of this reform is to reduce the income tax burden on employees and the cost of this reduction is to be met through the abolition or curtailment of special reliefs.  The resultant creation of a simpler and more equitable tax system will benefit both employers and employees alike and thus promote employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The harmonisation of VAT rates on confectionery products in this country with those applying in the UK and Northern Ireland would involve the extension of the zero VAT rate to flour confectionery, i.e. cakes and buns, frozen desserts and biscuits other than chocolate biscuits. These products are currently standardrated here.  Application of the zero rate would give rise to a very substantial loss in revenue and, accordingly, consideration of any such measure can only be carried out in the context of the normal budgetary process.  As the Deputy knows, it would not be appropriate for me to detail my budgetary plans at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same rate of VAT applies to all confectionery sold in this country, irrespective of origin.  Thus the VAT treatment is of no relevance to purchasing patterns at trade level; this will reflect consumer preference and relative cost competitiveness at the production level. While private consumers may make purchases of confectionery in the context of general cross-border shopping trips, it is not possible to quantify these since they <Col N="1087" /> come with in the scope of the general travellers' allowances regime.  It is not considered, however, that this has any significant adverse effects on the domestic market for confectionery products.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that non-consultant hospital doctors were granted a tax free allowance of £1,865 in respect of expenses, of which £1,665 represented medical indemnity insurance.</P>
      <P>In July 1992 a change occurred in the arrangements for medical indemnity insurance.  Under the new arrangements the Health Boards bear the full cost of the insurance cover.  In the circumstances the doctors are no longer entitled to the £1,665 included in their tax free allowance. To prevent significant undercharges arising at the end of the year the tax offices set about reducing the 1992/93 tax free allowances of the doctors concerned. This work is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In amending tax-free allowances the normal practice, unless hardship arises, is to apply the adjustments on a cumulative basis.  This method was followed in relation to tax-free allowances adjusted in the early stages of the process and resulted in arrears of tax arising from the adjusted allowance being collected from the salary payment immediately following the adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an adjustment to tax-free allowances <Col N="1088" /> on a cumulative basis would cause hardship the Revenue Commissioners apply the adjustment from a current date and collect any arrears in a later tax year. This treatment will be applied to doctors who have not yet had their tax-free allowances reduced, as collection of the arrears due at this late stage in the year in one sum would cause hardship.</P>

      <P>In the first case of imports the competitive electricity market in the UK permits large customers, such as ESB, to choose the electricity company or plant from which they will purchase electrical power.  This means that there is no requirement to purchase nuclear generated electricity.</P>
      <P>If it proves desirable in the future to export Irish electricity, wind generated or otherwise, the provision of an interconnector would facilitate such a transfer of electrical power.

      <P>The Private Bog Development Scheme, introduced under the Turf Development Act 1981, was terminated in 1987.  The purpose of the scheme was to stimulate the development of private peat resources and the success of the scheme can be measured by the fact that turf production from this source has increased by 50 per cent to 1.5 million tonnes per annum over <Col N="1090" /> the equivalent figure for 1981.  I have no plans to reintroduce the scheme but provision has been made in my Department's Vote, up to and including this year, to meet outstanding commitments.</P>

      <P>Mulroy Bay was designated in 1982 under Council Directive 79/927/EC on the quality required of shellfish waters.  The decision by the Department of the Environment, in consultation with my Department to revise the designation of the waters of Mulroy Bay under Article 4.3 of the directive was taken in 1988 in light of the decline in annual scallop spatfalls experienced in the bay from 1983 onwards.</P>
      <P>Spat levels in the bay have considerably recovered over the last two years due to weather conditions, a BIM stocking programme and fishing restrictions introduced by my Department.  In light of this, the question of redesignation of Mulroy under the directive is being considered by my Department which has in the meantime taken over responsibility for implementation from the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 78 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors referred a claim to arbitration to have a number of allowances which are paid to members of the force made pensionable. The arbitrator recommended that some of those allowances &mdash; including rent allowance &mdash; should be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982. The recommendations contained in the Garda Arbitration Bopard Report No. 15 have been fully implemented.</P>
      <P>The Garda Pensioners' Association subsequently asked to have the benefits of the recommendation concerning rent allowance applied to their members who retired before 1 October, 1982.  That association was informed on 2 August, 1984 that, because of the very considerable additional costs involved and the critical state of the Exchequer finances, the recommendation could not be applied to those members.  There are no proposals to change that decision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The female prisoner to whom the Deputy refers was sentenced to four concurrent ten years sentences for armed robbery and firearms offences.  She is one of a very few long term female prisoners in the prison system and is, at present, the only long term prisoner in Limerick Female Prison.  However, at no stage since her incarceration has she served any portion of her sentence in isolation.</P>
      <P>The cell she occupies is one of twelve cells in the female section of the prison and is similar in dimension to other cells in Limerick Prison.</P>
      <P>At present about 40 per cent of the prison population have either in-cell sanitation or 24-hour access to sanitary facilities and it is planned to extend this on a phased basis.  Limerick prison does not at the present time have in-cell sanitation. However, female prisoners in Limerick have access to out-of-cell toilet facilities up to 10 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She has access to a range of education, <Col N="1103" /> recreation and craft facilities and is, in fact, at present pursuing a university level course.  Work in the kitchens, laundry and trades areas is not available to female prisoners as these are located in the male section of the prison.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate continued contact with her family I recently approved an arrangement under which this prisoner would be brought to Mountjoy four times a year to meet her family.  The first such visit took place in Mountjoy Prison on 21 October, 1992.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which the prisoner is detained and the accommodation available to her in the female prison in Limerick are the same as those which apply to all prisoners detained there. There are no plans at present to transfer her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the reference in the question to upper and lower courts is to be taken as encompassing the High, Circuit and District Courts, the implication seems to be that in all of these courts there is a serious situation with a backlog of cases awaiting hearing.  That is not in fact the position.  The reality is that, in general, the courts are operating effectively and that in the vast majority of cases there are no undue delays.  As an extremely wide range of issues and cases come before the Courts every day, it must, of course, be recognised that it is inevitable that delays may arise from time to time.</P>
      <P>If delays arise in any court venue or in relation to any particular category of court business, every effort is made to address the problem by the holding of additional court sittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> As regards the District Court I am aware that there have been delays in the criminal and civil business of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.  In order to deal with the backlog of cases the President of the District Court has arranged additional Court sittings which it is expected will reduce the volume of arrears substantially.</P>
    <P>There are some delays in bringing civil cases to trial in both the Circuit and High Court in Dublin and Cork.  However, it must be pointed out that delays in hearing civil actions are not all related to court sittings, and that some of the reasons for delay are attributable to the litigants themselves.  Among the measures taken to eliminate delays in the High Court was the appointment of two new High Court judges in October of last year.  In the last twelve months there has been a substantial reduction in the backlog of cases for hearing in the High Court in Cork.  In Dublin two new courtrooms will be made available to the High Court and one new courtroom will be made available to the Circuit Court within the next few weeks which, it is expected, will greatly assist in alleviating delays in the future.</P>

    <P>Oberstown Boys Centre, which was opened in September 1991, is authorised <Col N="1105" /> to hold up to ten boys on remand and a further 20 boys on long term detention. On 27 October 1992, the centre had eight boys on remand and 20 boys on long term detention.</P>
    <P>Boys can be remanded by the courts for periods of up to four weeks.  In the case of long term detentions, the minimum period is two years and the maximum period is four years.</P>
    <P>As regards the young person referred to by the Deputy, Oberstown Boys Centre confirmed the availability of a remand place for him when inquiries were made by the court on 1 September 1992.  However, when the boy was brought to the centre it was found that the order presented from the court was for a 12 month detention period.</P>
    <P>The centre could not accept the boy as it is not permitted by law to take long-stay placements for periods of less than two years.  The boy has not yet been rereferred to the centre on the basis of an appropriately-amended placement order.</P>

      <P>Work on the upgrading of various facilities at Rosslare Harbour has been ongoing since 1987.  Details are as follows.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the development involved the building of the new terminal, overhead walkways etc. and was completed in 1989.  The total cost of this work was £5.2 million.</P>
      <P>The second phase of development work on the Harbour commenced in 1991 and provides for the upgrading of pier and berthing infrastructure.  Total expenditure of £11.4 million is expected to arise on this phase of development, which will be completed by the end of 1993.  To date, expenditure of £10.4 million has been incurred.</P>
      <P>The third and final phase of the development, costing £7.4 million, is due to commence in 1984 and be completed by the end of 1995.  When completed, this investment will bring total expenditure on the Rosslare Harbour Development project to £24 million.</P>

      <P>The estimated number of persons treated in general hospitals due to road traffic accidents in 1991 was about 7,800.  It is not possible, without conducting a special survey, to estimate the total cost of the treatment provided in respect of those admissions, as the treatment and costs involved varies widely from patient to patient.  In 1991, the total amount received by health agencies for road traffic accident cases was £3.728 million. Hospitals do not receive recoupment of costs from insurance companies; these costs are recovered from patients who have already received compensation.</P>
      <P>The amounts received by the hospitals for treating road traffic accident cases do not in all cases reflect fully the total costs of treatment.  My Department is discussing with representatives of the insurance industry ways and means to improve the payments procedure so that all moneys recouped by insurance companies in respect of hospital costs are paid to the hospitals.  The future range and level of charges to be made by hospitals are also being discussed.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the provision of orthodontic treatment in the South Tipperary area is as follows: currently in treatment, 514; awaiting treatment, 162; awaiting assessment, 219.  A consultant orthodontist took up duty with the South-Eastern Health Board in September 1992 and will carry-out the remaining assessments in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Apart from her own direct clinical involvement, a primary task of the consultant orthodontist is to organise and coordinate orthodontic training to specialist and sub-specialist levels for health board dental staff.  This will result in further improved levels of service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of places which a private nursing home provides is a matter to be determined by a health board under the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964, and the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1985.  In 1987 the Southern Health Board conducted an inspection of St. Martin's under section 2 (1) of the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964. The board came to the conclusion that it was overcrowded and they imposed a <Col N="1129" /> limit of 40 on the number of patients to be accommodated in the home.  At that time, St. Martin's was a home approved by the Minister for subvention under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>No directive was issued from my Department limiting the number of places in the home as this was the responsibility of the Southern Health Board as outlined above.</P>
    <P>St. Martin's Nursing Home is no longer in operation.  In 1990 the proprietor purchased a larger nursing home, known as St. Mary's and transferred the 40 patients from St. Martin's to St. Mary's.  On 1 March 1990 the Minister approved the transfer of approval under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, in respect of 40 beds from St. Martin's to St. Mary's Home.</P>
    <P>Following a judicial review of the Minister's decision in the High Court, Justice Barr, in a judgment of 4 February 1991, was satisfied that the Minister's approval of St. Mary's Home, subject to a maximum of 40 patients, was within the ambit of the powers granted to the Minister under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>

      <P>I have read the article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> referred to by the Deputy.  Miscarriages are not registered or notified, and therefore there is no national recorded rate of occurrence.  Miscarriages which occur very early in pregnancy may go entirely undetected.</P>
      <P>Admission rates to maternity hospitals would suggest that admissions due to miscarriage occur in approximately 10 per cent of pregnancies.  This may be the source of the ratio of 1 in 10 referred to in the article.  This is, of course, a hospitalisation rate and not a rate of occurrence for miscarriages.</P>

      <P>Under the Department's system for monitoring deaths from AIDS, reports are submitted from the doctor in charge of the patient directly to the medical officer in my Department who is responsible for the collection and evaluation of the data.

The data would not, therefore, indicate the precise location of death of the patient.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the need for utmost confidentiality and anonymity in relation to the monitoring of the infection and, in this regard, I am satisfied that the information collected by my Department in the reporting of deaths from AIDS is appropriate.</P>
      <P>As regards epidemiological information for the purpose of planning programmes and services for AIDS/HIV, the availability of detailed information regarding the prevalence and incidence of HIV is highly significant.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that I recently extended the HIV-surveillance programme through unlinked, anonymous batch screening of surplus blood donated at ante-natal clinics for routine clinical purposes.  I propose to announce further initiatives in this area shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 174 to 177, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 29 July 1992, Roscommon County Council submitted an environmental impact statement to me in respect of the proposed N4 Curlews project and applied for certification in accordance with article 38 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990. Public notice of this application was given in the local press by the local authority on 7 August 1992 and interested members of the public had the opportunity of making submissions to me in the matter within one month of the date of the notice.  The environmental impact statement and all submissions received are currently under examination and a decision will be made by me as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roscommon and Sligo County Councils have, over the years, examined the possibilities for upgrading or replacing the existing N4 route across the Curlews mountains.  In all, more than a dozen possibilities were considered.  Three routes which the councils considered most favourable on engineering and economic grounds were included for further study in the environmental impact <Col N="1134" /> statement.  Environmental aspects were also borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the route recommended in the environmental impact statement is £17 million.  The timing of construction would obviously depend on the outcome of the statutory procedures involved.  In view of my quasi-judicial role in relation to the scheme it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</P>

    <P>As regards trends in the production of toxic and dangerous waste, national annual arisings of these wastes are provisionally estimated at some 60,000 tonnes, with organic solvents, 53 per cent, and chlorinated solvents, 19 per cent, representing the bulk of this amount.

      <P>An environmental impact statement in respect of the treatment plant for this scheme has been prepared by Wexford Corporation and is currently being assessed in my Department.  Without prejudice to this assessment, an advance section of the sewer network contract has been completed at an estimated cost of £733,000 and tenders for other parts of the sewer network are under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the reason applicants for naturalisation are told by the Irish Embassy in London, England, that there is over a three month wait between the date of application and the arrangement of the necessary interview; and whether this is a new procedure which has been implemented.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Inquiries concerning Irish citizenship by naturalisation are referred to the Department of Justice and are not the subject of Embassy interviews.  I take it that the Deputy is referring to applications for citizenship by way of Post-Nuptial Declaration, which are processed by Irish missions abroad on behalf of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Two factors led to the present procedures being put in place at the London Embassy: (i) The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986 tightened up the conditions under which the spouse of an Irish citizen can be accorded Irish citizenship by Post-Nuptial Declaration; (ii) Certain irregularities involving the granting of Irish citizenship were discovered at the London Embassy in 1987; these related mainly to false applications for Irish citizenship by way of Post-Nuptial Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> To meet the requirements of the 1986 Act and to prevent any recurrence of abuse of procedure, more stringent documentary requirements were introduced and revised structures put in place.  As part of these new procedures each applicant and his/her Irish spouse resident in the UK are now interviewed at the Embassy, London in the presence of two Embassy officers.</P>
    <P>In the interests of efficiency, it is the practice of the Embassy to group applications and then to set aside a period of a few days to conduct interviews.  The timing of interviews depends to a large exstent on whether applications are correctly completed when first received; on the availability of applicants and their spouses for interview during the nominated period; and on the other responsibilities of the Embassy officers concerned.  There is no uniform waiting period and every effort is made to hold interviews as regularly as possible.</P>

      <P>The scale of fees for visas for entry to Ireland for foreign nationals who require such visas is fixed on the basis of reciprocity.  That is to say, the fee which we charge for an Irish visa to a foreign national is equivalent to the fee which his or her country would charge to an Irish citizen for a visa of a similar kind.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out in Irish pounds the fees charged in each case.  It is our practice in issuing visas in London to convert from Irish pounds to sterling at parity.  Accordingly, the table below also shows the fees actually collected in sterling by the Irish Embassy in London for each kind of visa.</P>

      <P>Since 1990 provision has been made in the Vote for Foreign Affairs for financial assistance to a number of Irish immigrant assistance groups in the <Col N="1153" /> United States.  In 1990 and 1991, the Department made annual grant payments of £200,000 to these groups.  In view of the current difficult budgetary circumstances the Government was reluctantly obliged to reduce the amount available in 1992 to £50,000.</P>
      <P>In 1987 Irish Immigrant Working Committees were established in the main Irish centres in the United States &mdash; Boston, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco.  They meet on a regular basis under the auspices of the Irish Consulates in those cities and serve as a forum for the various groups to co-ordinate their efforts and to identify areas where action is necessary.  This very useful work through the Consulates will continue.</P>
      <P>Aid schemes also exist to assist Irish immigrant groups in the United Kingdom.  These are administered by the Department of Labour, advised by the Government Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare (the &ldquo;DÍON&rdquo; Committee) whose work is co-ordinated by the Irish Embassy in London.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The method of calculation of the ewe premium was adjusted as a result of an agreement reached by the Council of Ministers in 1989 on the reform of the sheepmeat regime.  The new method which came into operation in full only in 1992 involved the calculation of the premium on the basis of the average Community drop in income rather than the income loss in individual regions.  The level of the estimated ewe premium for 1992 on which the first advance of the 1992 premium was based, was calculated by the EC Commission on the new basis last June.  This led to a reduction of £1.76 in the first advance of the ewe premium. This method of calculation led to a reduction of £2.05 in the second advance of the premium which was fixed on 23 <Col N="1157" /> October 1992.  These losses are partly offset, in the case of producers in disadvantaged areas, by an increase of £1.31 in the Rural World Premium, the full amount of which was paid with the first advance.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the 1992 premium foreshadowed by these first advances is occurring at a time when market prices are falling in a way which points to the fact that the alignment in market prices across member states expected at the time of the 1989 reform has not materialised. Ireland has been warning the Council and Commission for some time that this was likely.  When our fears in this regard were borne out I immediately submitted a case to the EC Commission for an increase in the ewe premium because of the special circumstances obtaining in Ireland.  I have discussed this case with the Commissioner on a number of occasions and impressed on him the importance of a positive response from the Commission.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter at the July Agriculture Council Meeting.  Again at my insistence, the serious situation facing Irish sheep farmers was placed as a substantive item on the agenda of yesterday's Agriculture Council in Luxembourg.  At that meeting I emphasised the need for urgent action to ensure a positive response to my proposal to compensate producers for the impact of the changes in the premium arrangements which came into effect this year and for the fall in market prices.  I again emphasised that the expected price alignment on which the reform of the market organisation for sheepmeat was based had not taken place and, as a result, a number of member states were receiving inadequate compensation for current income losses.  I once again sought the support of my colleagues for a solution which would restore equity in regard to premium levels.</P>
      <P>Both the Council and the Commission showed understanding and sympathy for the position of Irish sheep farmers and it was agreed that the Commission would examine the problem as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Since 1988, self-employed people have been included in the social insurance system for old age and widows pension purposes.  Pension arrangements generally for the self-employed will be addressed in the forthcoming report of the National Pensions Board and any changes in the present arrangements will be considered in the context of that report.</P>
      <P>Under the present arrangements self-employed persons earning under £2,500 a year are not covered.  A minimum earnings threshold for social insurance cover is necessary to ensure that there is a reasonable relationship between contributions and benefits.  Such a relationship is necessary to safeguard the financing of the Social Insurance Fund. Furthermore, if there were no lower limit, people could engage in self-employment for a few hours per week with minimal earnings, solely for the purposes of establishing entitlement to benefits. I have no plans to extend the scheme to self-employed people below the earnings threshold.</P>

      <P>Provision was enacted in the Social Welfare Act, 1991, to enable an agreed amount to be deducted from a social welfare payment with the consent of the recipient and paid over on his-her behalf to a specified body.  The type of specified body is defined so as to allow for the participation of all the recognised utilities and local authorities.</P>
      <P>An Post have been commissioned to develop the necessary deduction facility on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare.  Negotiations have been under way between An Post and the various utilities and housing authorities on the proposed operation of the household budgeting facility.  An Post have received considerable co-operation from these bodies in designing the proposed scheme. The proposed facility is currently being developed and it is hoped to test the facility on a number of claimants in the Dublin area in January 1993.  Depending on its success it is then intended to progressively extend it to cover as wide an area as possible.</P>
      <P>The facility will allow a client to agree with An Post to make deductions in respect of any number of specified bodies subject to an overall limit on the amount of the payment that can be deducted.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the long delay in making a decision on the application made by a person (details supplied) in County Cork who applied for disablement benefit in January 1992 and who has not yet received a decision.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disablement benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme on 31 January 1992 in respect of occupational deafness.  In order to qualify for <Col N="1161" /> disablement benefit the deciding officer has to be satisfied that the claimant (1) is suffering from sensorineural hearing loss of at least 50 decibels in each ear and (2) where he has left an employment which is prescribed in respect of the disease, that he was employed in such prescribed employment within five years of the date of claim.</P>
      <P>I indicated in a reply to a previous question from the Deputy, Question No. 240 of 30 June 1992, that no decision regarding the claimant's deafness would arise until it was determined whether his employment from 1978 onwards came within the prescribed categories.  Accordingly, the claimant was asked about this latter aspect and a letter from his solicitors in the matter was received in response.  However, the solicitors also furnished with their letter a consultant surgeon's report which indicated that the claimant failed to satisfy the deafness condition for benefit as described at (1) above.  This report was submitted to the deciding officer who decided on the basis of the medical evidence available that the claimant did not suffer from the required degree of deafness necessary to qualify for disablement benefit.  He accordingly disallowed the claim.</P>
      <P>The claimant was notified of this decision on 23 October 1992.  He has also been advised of his right to appeal against the decision if he so wishes.</P>

      <P>FÁS has not established offices in Europe, rather it has arranged for three officials to be placed recently in the Dutch and German employment services.  This development is in furtherance of EC Regulation No. 1612/68 on the free movement of workers and follows agreements between FÁS and their Dutch and German counterparts.  The objective is to assist Irish people obtain employment in either country and to benefit fully from the EC free movement of workers programme.</P>
      <P>It is too early to evaluate the success of this development.  There are no plans to extend this initiative to countries outside the EC.  Specific details on the operation of the agreements concluded between FÁS and their Dutch and German counterparts are a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>
