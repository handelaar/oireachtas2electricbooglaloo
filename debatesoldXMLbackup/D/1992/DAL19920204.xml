      <P>It is intended to replicate the exhibit garden created for the International Garden and Greenery Exposition, 1990, at Osaka, Japan.  A monument to Lafcadio Hearn, an eminent Irish writer on Japanese culture, is planned in association with the replica garden.</P>
      <P>The co-ordinated design is not yet complete. Several sites in the Dublin area are under consideration.  The choice will in part depend on the completed design. Discussions are continuing with a view to providing for the garden by sponsorship and donation.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to the Taoiseach that, for all practical purposes, the design is complete, and that perhaps <Col N="754" /> the outstanding difficulty is funding the project?  Would the Taoiseach confirm that there are no more than two potential sites and that a signal from his office as to the ultimate location of the garden project would give the promoters some hope that the project would be implemented within this year?  In what may well be one of the remaining days within which the Taoiseach will answer questions within the cultural sphere in this House it would be my hope that he could make some firm announcement that this project would be proceeded with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The task force on employment which was established in June 1991, under the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> have met on 24 occasions and have submitted 11 reports to the Government.  Their work is on-going.  The combined views of employers, trade unions, Government Departments and State agencies provide a valuable input into initiatives to increase employment and reduce unemployment.</P>
      <P>A number of specific recommendations made by the task force are already being implemented.  The task force have been responsible for proposals which should take 25,000 persons off the live register over the next year.</P>
      <P>They recommended, with the agreement of employers and trade unions, an in-company training scheme whereby persons on the live register would be trained in a business environment for one year and receive a certificate at the end of the training period.</P>
      <P>The task force also considered various possibilities to create employment by subsidising new jobs for a period so as to encourage employers to take on new employees from the live register.</P>
      <P>Following discussions I had with President Delors, the European Social Fund will now provide special Social Fund assistance amounting to up to £60 million to support schemes on these lines.  Under the in-company training scheme, the Social Fund will provide 75 per cent and the employers 25 per cent of the training allowance for up to 10,000 persons to be drawn from the live register and trained for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the employment incentive scheme, employers will receive a weekly subsidy of £54 for 12 months in respect of new employees drawn from the live register, paid at the normal rate for the job and employed for at least 18 months. <Col N="756" /> This employment subsidy scheme will apply to up to 15,000 persons.</P>
    <P>Recommendations by the task force on the need for additional places in third level public and private educational institutions are being implemented.  It is estimated that there will be an additional 4,200 places by 1992-93 in public institutions. A number of private third level institutions have been accepted as designated institutions and have had certain courses approved for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>New possibilities for the production of parts and components for multinational companies are being pursued by the IDA and certain State commercial companies involving, <i>inter alia,</i> joint ventures with Irish companies and multinationals.  A phased expansion of the European Orientation Programme and a review of the special trading houses scheme, so as to increase its potential, will assist the business sector to increase employment.</P>
    <P>Task force recommendations to expedite the procedures in regard to planning applications and appeals have been taken into account in the Local Government (Planning and Develpment) Bill, 1991, and the Environmental Agency Bill, 1990, currently before the Dáil.  In addition, the Department of the Environment have circulated all local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, requesting their compliance with the streamlined procedures recomnmended by the task force.  Planning permissions for 11,000 houses were expedited in September 1991, at the initiative of the task force.</P>
    <P>The task force have made further recommendations in the areas of road construction, urban renewal and on improved statistical data on employment and unemployment which are being considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that we face a crisis of emergency proportions in regard to employment over the next eight to ten years in view of the fact that the numbers leaving school will exceed the numbers reaching retirement age, by approximately 25,000, <Col N="757" /> each year; that without emigration and no increase in employment that could entail a doubling of the present level of unemployment?  If the Taoiseach does agree with those demographic projections, would he further agree that the individual recommendations of the task force, while all valuable in themselves, bear no relationship to the extent of the employment crisis we face at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's overall outline of the position he suggested will emerge.  It is quite true that we have an underlying problem with regard to increasing our labour force annually which is unique in Europe.  I will say merely that the Government have embarked on a series of initiatives, programmes of one kind or another, to cope with the position.</P>
      <P>The encouraging thing is that in the scheme I have been talking about for the first time we have agreement from the Commission, as to the use of the European Social Fund, to help us in mitigating the levels of unemployment.  Another major approach will be the basis of the Culliton report.  That report sets out quite a number of areas to be looked at and the steps to be taken.  The principal recommendation was that the implementation of that report should be undertaken by a task force chaired by the Taoiseach.  We have accepted that recommendation.  That task force is now being set up.  I believe that that report is very practical, realistic and down to earth and, as a result of the implementation of its recommendations, the majority of which I believe the Government will accept, we can expect to make considerable inroads into the level of unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that to a large extent the Culliton report and the task force reports generally represent what could be regarded as common sense with regard to resolving our unemployment problems but there seems to be obstacles at various levels to implementing the recommendations of these reports?  Would he <Col N="758" /> agree that perhaps one way of trying to free up these obstacles would be to take up the proposal from the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed who are proposing a forum of the various agencies and people with responsibility for dealing with the problem?  It would seem to make common sense for people to work together in trying to solve this problem of unemployment.  In addition may I ask him &mdash; I do not think the Taoiseach referred to this in his reply &mdash; with regard to the original proposal of the task force which sought to replace the £1 billion of imported products and components what progress has been made in relation to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the latter I did refer to it in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear it, I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably one of the major recommendations made by the task force and it is well under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well under way because, as I said, the IDA are working with a number of commercial semi-State and private sector people to set about supplying that vast market for parts and components that exist to supply the multinationals.  That is a central recommendation by the task force and one which is being followed up very vigorously. I have no particular belief in the idea of a forum.  I do not think there is anything that can emerge from it that we do not already know.  I do think at this stage we are already mobilising in different ways all the forces in our economy that can make a contribution.  Briefly, I will go over them again.  There are the 12 pilot areas in the long term unemployment black spots.  That offers major possibilities because it does the sort of thing that Deputy De Rossa has been talking about, it brings together everybody in the region &mdash; trade unions, employers, social groups, Government <Col N="759" /> agencies &mdash; to combine their efforts to see what can be done to generate employment in these particular pilot areas.  If they can come up with a successful formula then, of course, that will be extended to cover the whole country. Another encouraging feature in that regard is that the Commission has now recognised that as a very important instrument for tackling unemployment and are giving it full support.  In fact &mdash; I am not sure if it is finally agreed &mdash; the Commission is almost certain to give us £8 million this year in support of those pilot areas.  Then there is the Culliton report which, I believe, offers great prospects too and the task force will continue its work.  I cannot see that there is much more energy or otherwise that anybody can contribute that is not being harnessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad The Workers' Party have joined Fine Gael in recognising the benefits of a jobs forum; they are welcome on board.  I am sorry the Taoiseach is not part of that band yet but now that he will have some time to reflect on his past mistakes perhaps he might reconsider the matter and influence some of his friends in the party.  Will the Taoiseach explain the relationship between the task force which he set up last summer and the one which was set up last week by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to oversee the implementation of the Culliton report?  It seems they will be doing almost the same task and that it would be better if the one task force did the work rather than having two task forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may say so, that is a good question and it is one which has been exercising our minds.  They would appear to be working in the same area but there is a difference in their methods. What we will have to do is to arrange that they work in parallel and not in any sort of infusion.  The new task force, chaired by the Taoiseach, will be a direct Government implementing body with direct access to Cabinet and all Government <Col N="760" /> Departments.  Under it there will be a very high level group consisting of some people from the private sector and the Secretaries of the key Departments.  I do not think one can get a much higher level group than that to set about the specific recommendations in the Culliton report which deal with various areas and suggest things that could be done, things that should be eliminated and so on.  The task force as such has a different sort of brief, it has a much more roaming remit.  It consists of people who are in the real world of companies, jobs and employment. They are pooling their wisdom and experience to make specific recommendations with regard to particular projects or things that can be done from their perspective.  At first sight it might seem that they are covering the same territory but I would think not; I think there is still a role for both.  The important thing is to make sure they are working in parallel and relating to each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach why the reports of the task force, to which this question refers, have not been published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no particular reason.  I cannot say why they have not been published, there is no particular reason why they should not be and it is something I will look into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that not only has the Culliton report been published but all the consultancy studies prepared in preparation for it have also been published?  It seems, therefore, rather anomalous.  If there have been 11 reports from this other task force, prepared at public expense, and if the Taoiseach is refusing to allow other Members to participate in any way in dealing with the jobs crisis through an all-party jobs forum, the least he could do is publish the reports that have been prepared at public expense so that other Members can see to what extent the Government are implementing them?</P>

      <P>There is no great ideological aspect to it.  The Culliton group was set up specifically to make a report.  It had a secretariat and so on and it has produced a report.  The other group is an ongoing group which meets regularly and consistently to examine ideas, suggestions and proposals from within their own knowledge of the situation and come up with recommendations.  There is no reason why the report should not be published.</P>

Given that the proposal emanates from the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, who seek to represent the interests of the unemployed and are virtually the only voice they have outside this House at this time, would the Taoiseach not agree that it would only be fair to give their proposal an adequate hearing?

      <P>Briefly and finally, there is absolutely no reason any suggestions, proposals or input from anybody would not be fully considered.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I put it to the Taoiseach that a very serious omission in the Culliton report, which is an otherwise excellent report, is the fact that it neither studied nor reported on the tourism industry.  May I ask the Taoiseach if he would ensure that the job creation capacity of the tourism industry would be part of the remit of the task force under the Taoiseach and, because the Culliton report is being referred to that task force, if he would add on the tourism industry to ensure that there is a group at the highest level responsible for the development of the tourism industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there is no particular problem with that.  A task force for the tourism industry, in which the banks will be involved, is now being established.  This task force will have the job of trying to identify prospects for commercial investment in the tourism industry.  As I say, the banks will be involved in it.  That should be a very effective way of developing the commercial possibilities of the tourism industry. I have no particular objection to the Culliton report also looking at the tourism industry.  In fact it would be unnatural if they did not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the statement I made on 22 January which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  I have nothing further to add.</P>
      <P>The following is the statement:</P>
      <P>The statements made by Senator Seán Doherty yesterday to the effect that he showed me transcripts of telephone conversations by two journalists whose telephones were tapped in 1982 are absolutely false.</P>
      <P>They are in stark contradiction with a number of statements made by Senator Doherty at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to state categorically that I was not aware at the time of the tapping of <Col N="765" /> these telephones and that I was not given and did not see any transcripts of the conversations.  I also wish to say that I have always abhorred the principle of phone-tapping except where absolutely necessary to prevent serious crime or subversion by paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>Senator Doherty subsequent to the revelation of the telephone tappings made a number of statements to the effect that I was not aware of his actions in tapping the telephones concerned, and was cross-examined on them at length on a radio interview and subsequently by an internal Fianna Fáil Commission of Inquiry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, when Senator Doherty seeks long afterwards to substitute for what he now claims to have been a premeditated blanket of lies, an entirely new version of events, the public have no means of judging the truthfulness of any of his statements by themselves.  It is perhaps significant that four years ago Mr. Doherty admitted to a journalist that his &ldquo;memory about that period is getting a bit hazy&rdquo; (<i>Sunday Tribune,</i> 24 May 1987).</P>
    <P>I also regard it as significant that Mr. Doherty, if he has an interest in telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, declined to be questioned by the press yesterday about the inconsistencies between his different versions of events.</P>
    <P>I wish to reaffirm the statements, which I made at the time, and to recall the background to these events.  Even before leaving office on 14 December 1982.  I was sufficiently concerned about some of the serious allegations about the conduct of Mr. Doherty as Minister for Justice and about political interference with the gardaí to set in train arrangements for the setting up of a judicial inquiry, which was the best means of independently and impartially ascertaining the truth.  This has been confirmed by the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> The first I learned of the suggestion that the phones of journalists had been tapped under my administration was from an article that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 18 December 1982.  I took the first opportunity in a radio interview the following day on 19 December to call publicly on my successors to formally establish the judicial inquiry which I had set in train. I also stated without equivocation on the principle of tapping two political correspondents that &ldquo;I would not countenance any such actions&rdquo; and that no politician should ever initiate such action, because that would be an abuse of a procedure, which was only justified to combat crime or subversion. It is hardly plausible to suggest that I would have called for such an inquiry, having forthrightly condemned the phone-tapping of journalists, if I had nevertheless approved of it in Government only a short time earlier.</P>
    <P>A few days subsequently I asked Mr. Doherty briefly after a dinner for ex-Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Administration on 21 December, about the revelations and received general assurances that there was nothing of any significance involved.</P>
    <P>Following a short cryptic statement by the new Government in the early hours of 19 January 1983 I went on radio to repeat the call of the Fianna Fáil Frontbench for a full scale judicial inquiry.  I stated: &ldquo;I want to make it crystal clear that the Government as such and I as Taoiseach, know absolutely nothing about any activities of this sort and would not countenance any such abuse&rdquo;.  The Government minutes and records of discussions at Cabinet contain no reference whatsoever to any phone-tapping: and persons who were members of the Government at the time have confirmed that they have no recollection of any reference to the subject.</P>
    <P>Shortly after this Mr. Doherty came to see me in the company of another <Col N="767" /> colleague and revealed to me his involvement in these events, of which he subsequently gave a detailed account on RTE's &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; on 23 January, and which were outlined in Minister Noonan's later statement on 20 January.</P>
    <P>His revelations came as a profound shock to me, as others are in a position to testify.  It was all the more of a shock as I had sought to leave affairs in as good order as was possible at that time to my successor, who on taking office had paid tribute to some aspects of our economic management in the Dáil on 14 December 1982.</P>
    <P>On 21 January, Mr. Doherty issued a first public statement in which he said: &ldquo;My actions as referred to were motivated solely by my concern for the security of my country and were not at any stage discussed by the Government or with the Taoiseach&rdquo;.  The truth of the first part of that statement relating to the Government has been confirmed by every member of it who has been asked, despite insidious claims by Mr. Doherty on the &ldquo;Nighthawks&rdquo; programme that &ldquo;people&rdquo; (in the plural) knew, and despite inspired leaks to the papers in recent days by sources close to him that at least two other members of the Cabinet knew what he was doing.  I confirm that the second part relating to me is equally true.</P>
    <P>If as he alleges he gave me transcripts, where are they now?  They are not, and never were in my office, nor were they seen by the members of my Department or by my personal staff, who handle my papers.  If he gave them to me, as he alleges, it is inconceivable that I would not have discussed such a very serious matter with at least one or two close colleagues.  There is no record of any such discussions and no colleague has any recollection of them. His statement also implies that he was given transcripts on an ongoing basis, rather than as other evidence suggests, <Col N="768" /> they were shown or given to him together at one particular time.</P>
    <P>It would appear that Mr. Doherty's choice of allegations relates far more to his own perceived political convenience at the present time and not to any exacting standard of truthfulness. I find the implication strange that he should claim that he would not wish to lie to the Senate, while having apparently been quite prepared to tell lies years ago to his collegues in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, and to allow those allegedly untruthful statements to stand at the time of the Supreme Court action taken by the two journalists in 1986-7.</P>
    <P>Mr. Doherty repeated under close cross-examination his two part statement in an RTE interview on 24 January 1983 that `the Government was not informed of what I was doing' and, that `Mr. Haughey did not know that I was tapping these journalists' phones'. The suggestion was made to Mr. Doherty in the course of that interview by Mr. Gerald Barry as to why he didn't ask the Taoiseach about it, and was it `because he would have stopped it'.  Mr. Doherty evaded the answer, by saying that he was totally convinced of the propriety of his actions.  The truth of the matter is that Mr. Doherty did not dare to inform me of what he had authorised, until his actions were on the point of being exposed by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government. The whole affair was shortly thereafter examined by an internal FF committee of inquiry, which concluded that I did not know of the phone-tappings. It can also be taken that the Coalition Government of the time conducted its own thorough investigation, with the opportunity to interview senior Garda officers, and despite every motive to do so was not in a position to contradict or impugn my statements denying any knowledge of the matter as Taoiseach.  The official statement dated 20 January 1983 issued by the Minister for Justice, Michael Noonan, after a very full and detailed inquiry into the whole affair contains <Col N="769" /> no reference to transcripts having been given to me or to my being aware of their existence.  Surely if there had been any scintilla of doubt about this at the time, this inquiry conducted by the Government which took over the administration a short time before would have adverted to it.</P>
    <P>When two years later in March 1984 transcripts of telephone conversations were leaked to the public, shortly after Mr. Doherty had called on the Minister for Justice to release them, they were a revelation to me.  However, despite some negative comments about some of the content, I reiterated that there were strict guidelines governing the use of telephone taps by the security forces and that I would always wish to see those guidelines adhered to.</P>
    <P>My position both with regard to the general principle of phone-tapping and with regard to my rejection of any suggestion of personal involvement in or particular use of it has been entirely consistent over my entire period of office, including my time as Minister for Justice.  This Government intend to proceed with legislation which the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition inexplicably failed to enact during their term of office to prevent any further abuses with regard to phone-tapping.  Is Mr. Doherty seriously now suggesting that the Government should have refrained from or delayed carrying out its clear public duty to protect the rights of the citizen, out of regard for his personal position as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad?  I have never felt beholden in any way to Mr. Doherty for statements that he made in 1983, nor have I ever acted as if I were.</P>
    <P>I also find it clearly ironic that Mr. Doherty who in what he claims was his desire to protect the Fianna Fáil Government and the Taoiseach of the time and in other actions singlehandedly did more than anyone else to damage the reputation of both, should now without any obvious compunction act in a manner calculated to inflict the maximum damage to the present Fianna Fáil led Government and the <Col N="770" /> Taoiseach out of transparent personal political motives.  There is to say the least a flagrant inconsistency between his stated motivation for phone tapping in 1982 and the intent of his actions today.  Is it not obvious to everyone that he has become obsessed with the belief that it is in his electoral interest to present himself to the people of Roscommon as an innocent victim or scapegoat, who was made to carry the can for others?  The truth of the matter, however, is that he was the author of his own downfall in 1982.  Having been given a position of high responsibility and the utmost sensitivity, requiring correct behaviour at all times, he engaged in a multiplicity of actions which when a full picture of them emerged at the end of the 1982 Administration he could not convincingly justify or explain and which no one else could defend.  With regard to the phonetapping affair, his actions have been duly censured by the Supreme Court in 1987, which would have been an obvious occasion to have put forward any defence in mitigation or to have corrected any inaccuracies in previous statements.</P>
    <P>The Government have an important job to do, and it is ridiculous to be raking over the events of 10 years ago, which are absolutely irrelevant to the problems of today.  I am forced to the conclusion that Mr. Doherty is attempting to bring down both the present Fianna Fail/Progressive Democrat Coalition Government and the Taoiseach for personal political gain, and perhaps for other political motives, regardless of the short or long term consequences for his party.  It is clear from the debate on the motion of confidence in me at the Parliamentary Party that renewed allegations of illegal phonetapping or surveillance are now regarded as the most effective means of achieving this objective, even though such allegations were unsubstantiated and untrue.  It is not true, as Mr. Doherty's statement seeks to imply, that he has not discussed the gist of what he has done with others.  I <Col N="771" /> have been informed that he has talked to several people about it, and indeed there is clear evidence of this in recent press articles.</P>
    <P>I would now like to summarise some of the other false statements in Mr. Doherty's statement yesterday.  It is quite clear, despite Mr. Doherty's claim to the contrary, that Mr. Ainsworth did not recommend the option of tapping the telephone of Mr. Bruce Arnold.  Mr. Ainsworth stated in the course of the investigation conducted by the new Government, and I quote: `He (the Minister Mr. Doherty) then said in the interests of the security of the State that we should have an intercept on Bruce Arnold's telephone'.  Far from being advised to do this, he was specifically advised against it.  His suggestion that a further tap should be put on Mr. Arnold's phone in October some months after it had been removed was rejected.</P>
    <P>Secondly, he claims that the transcripts were taken to me as Taoiseach over a period of months.  This is contradicted by all the evidence.  Mr. Ainsworth stated that he showed the intercepts to Mr. Doherty on a specific occasion.  The copies that Mr. Ainsworth gave to Mr. Doherty, were given back by him to Mr. Ainsworth, who shredded them.</P>
    <P>I would be quite happy, however, if there is any responsible public demand for it to institute a judicial or any other sort of inquiry into this affair.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is a total conflict between the version of events which he himself has given and the one Senator Doherty has given about these events? Given that he has indicated that he would be prepared to have a public inquiry into these matters and into the conflict between their positions and views does he intend to establish such an inquiry before he leaves office as Taoiseach?</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline (a) the recommendations made in the Garda Authorities' report on the Fraud Squad which have been implemented to date (b) the recommendations that remain to be implemented and (c) his views on whether the fraud squad are equipped to speedily and comprehensively investigate allegations of financial fraud; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my response to the priority question put down by Deputy Seán Barrett on 22 October 1991, the recommendations made by the Garda authorities in their review of the Garda Fraud Squad will be given effect.  Arrangements are already being made to implement those recommendations which are &ldquo;internal&rdquo; to the squad involving improvements in manpower, organisation and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other recommendations, such as the strengthening of links between the squad and external professional bodies, involve somewhat more difficult issues which require further consideration &mdash; for example, to assess precisely how these links may be effected and to what extent they may be influenced by the outcome of the Law Reform Commission's wide ranging review of the law on dishonesty. <Col N="780" /> For the avoidance of any doubt I should make it clear that I have accepted the principles underlying these recommendations also; it is simply a matter of assessing in consultation with the Garda and other interested parties how best to implement them.</P>
    <P>There are also, of course, the wider issues of the investigative powers that are required to deal with serious fraud cases, whether a complementary serious fraud investigation structure on the lines of the British Serious Fraud Office should be established and how the Garda plans, now in course of implementation, would affect or mesh with that concept.  These matters are currently the subject of examination in my Department.  Work is proceeding on this examination as quickly as possible but because it involves complex issues of law and structure it is not something which can be rushed.  I understand also that the Law Reform Commission's forthcoming report on dishonesty is likely to have recommendations to make on these issues and it would be very useful to have the commission's views before decisions are taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Garda authorities' recommendations on the fraud squad themselves, I am satisfied that the implementation of those recommendations, which is already in hand, together with the new legislative provisions being enacted in the Criminal Evidence Bill and the further legislation which will follow on the Law Reform Commission's report on dishonesty, will greatly strengthen the hand of the Garda Síochána in dealing with fraud offences.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response.  Deputy Seán Barrett tabled a question on 22 October 1991 and the Minister has, in effect, given the same response today as he did then.  The Minister has received a report and he says that its recommendations will be implemented.  When? Does he recognise that white collar fraud is endemic in our society, which is obvious to everybody?  Does he recognise that the squad in their present form are <Col N="781" /> totally incapable of handling that situation? When will the Minister make some move to restore public confidence in this most crucial area?  I want to ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Deputy's disappointment because, as I have said, recommendations have been made and have been acted on.  For <Col N="782" /> example, the Garda authorities recommended the appointment of additional Garda personnel to the fraud squad &mdash; that is under way &mdash; and the strengthening of the squad by the appointment of a full-time superintendent, two additional inspectors and four additional sergeants.  They have already been assigned to the Force, bringing their strength to 45.  The Garda also recommended the restructuring of the squad to allow for the establishment of special investigative teams to handle serious and complex cases; additional specialised training for members of the squad &mdash; which is under way; the establishment of computerised links with the Companies Office in the computerisation of Garda records of stolen cheques and credit cards, which is under way; the establishment of a panel of legal experts drawn from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is under way; and the establishment of a panel of accountants from which the Garda could draw expertise in the investigation of complex issues, which also is under way.  Every case is different and the Garda authorities would prefer to have a panel to which they could go for different specialities. All the recommendations have been taken on board.  I initiated the report to strengthen the squad and this is under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful to the House if I were to describe briefly the current mechanism for dealing with pay in the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>After long and detailed discussions some years back with the associations which represent the various ranks in the Garda Síochána, the present Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme was put in place.  The scheme provides for a Conciliation Council and an Arbitration Board which may deal with pay claims on behalf of members of all ranks up to and including the rank of chief superintendent. The scheme is similar to other schemes operating elsewhere in the public service and provides for the direct participation of representatives of the Minister for Finance in negotiations under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme works well and the associations have had marked success in pursuing pay claims under it.  Since I January 1988, the associations have secured pay increases for their members of the order of 23 per cent.  Over the same period, incidentally, the rise in the consumer price index was about 14.3 per cent.  Furthermore, the Government are committed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to conceding further pay increases to the Force of the order of 13 per cent between now and the end of 1993, including special increases totalling 6 per cent which were also negotiated by the associations on behalf of their members.  Between 1 January 1988 and the end of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> period <Col N="784" /> the cumulative increase in Garda pay will be nearly 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I see no need for a special commission to consider Garda pay and I do not propose to establish one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my information that the Garda are not entirely happy with the present situation.  They believe that the present conciliation and arbitration scheme is extremely cumbersome and slow and does not deal with many of the items about which they are concerned. Unlike other groups, they do not have the right to strike and they believe their pay and conditions are not on a par with other sectors of the public service.  While I accept that all their grievances may not stand up, I imagine the issue of certain allowances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on a recent comment made by the chairperson of the Free Legal Advice Centre that the free legal advice service will close early in 1992 unless they receive a substantial increase in funding; and if he will ensure that such a disastrous occurrence will not take place.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16, 17, 29, 31 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a letter from FLAC on 17 <Col N="786" /> December last drawing attention to their insufficiency of funding and saying that they required an immediate grant of £40,000 to enable them to carry on their work in 1992.</P>
    <P>I gave the request from FLAC very careful consideration and was impressed by the case they made for assistance, in their present difficult financial situation, from public funds for the valuable work which they are doing.  However, I was conscious also of the fact that it would not be appropriate for me to direct funds away from the Legal Aid Board in order to assist FLAC and for this reason I was unable at that stage to accede to their request.</P>
    <P>Since then I have received a further letter from FLAC and I have been seeking ways and means of providing them with financial assistance in a manner which would not involve diverting funds away from the Legal Aid Board and would not, in the current difficult budgetary situation, entail any increase in the overall provision being made for 1992 in the Justice Group of Votes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that I have been able to make special provision on this basis for a grant of £40,000 in 1992 to help FLAC continue in operation and my Department will make the necessary arrangements for payment of this grant as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Would he agree that this money, which will add a very important service to the existing Legal Aid Service, is money well spent?  Can he give an undertaking tha this Department in the future may consult with FLAC towards the end of each year to find out their budgetary position, and whether they require assistance on an ongoing basis? Does he accept that the current situation where FLAC have to lay off staff in the latter months of the year and go to his Department and elsewhere with the proverbial begging bowl pleading for funds, is not a satisfactory way to show our appreciation for the very good work they do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="787" />
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about this matter and this is why I took this decision.  I also had to be conscious of the civil legal aid scheme, the Government scheme.  I am very impressed with the work FLAC have undertaken.  I have received numerous representations and elaborations of their role and what they have been doing.  I am very pleased to have been in a position to allocate a grant of £40,000 to them for 1992.  Again, I share the Deputy's view that it should be a matter of rolling support. A new subhead will be opened in the Department of Justice Estimate so that funding will be provided on an ongoing basis.  Hopefully this will put an end to the ludicrous situation where press conferences are called and people are let go.</P>
      <P>The long term solution is that the Civil Legal Aid Board would be put on a statutory basis &mdash; the plans are going ahead for that &mdash; and that we would have an adequate number of legal aid centres around the country.  I am very proud that in the last two and a half years I have succeeded in securing considerable additional funds and have opened up new full-time and temporary offices around the country.  However, I would like to see the day when there would be at least one office in every major city and county, and that is the aim I have been working towards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Minister's reply in the sense that he has given a commitment to provide funding.  When you consider that a very large number of people in Ireland are denied basic constitutional rights such as access to legal advice and to the courts, this will in some way assist, but it will be only a small contribution to the work that needs to be done in order to provide proper legal aid and advice to citizens.  What is the earliest date that money will be made available for this purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that it will be made available as soon as possible, and the Deputy can be assured that there will be no undue delay in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the views expressed by the Minister in this regard and on behalf of FLAC I extend thanks to him for his support.  Is the Minister aware that the organisation seek funding from other quarters for research and other activities and an important source is the two arms of the private profession who make voluntary contributions? Would the Minister be disposed to writing to the two organisations, the Law Society and the Bar Council, expressing the view of this House that they should continue their voluntary support of FLAC as it is an important source of support to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a major step forward today in, for the first time, recognising in a subhead for the Department of Justice that a contribution will be made to FLAC.  That is a major step and is something for which FLAC have fought for many years.  The views of the Members will be well known as far as the Law Society and the Bar Council are concerned.  On that question, there should be greater involvement of private practitioners in the legal world by way of a back-up to the Civil Legal Aid Board which is very important.  Suggestions have been put forward by the Law Society and they are being examined.  It is vitally important that the taxpayers should not be asked to carry all the burden, and there is scope for involvement by the private sector to complement the work being done by the Civil Legal Aid Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>The applications are processed as quickly as possible, but by the nature of the documentation required unfortunately delays sometimes occur which none of us like to see.  However, more and more cases are being dealt with.  The changes in the political structure in Europe have resulted in a greater movement of people and there is movement also from the Far East and parts of Africa.  Throughout the European Community there is an increase in requests for asylum, naturalisation and documentation of some sort.  This matter is receiving ongoing attention from the personnel of my Department with a view to improving further the work in the aliens division.</P>

With <Col N="790" /> all the demands made on the Department of Justice in relation to the security of the State, the whole area of aliens and the changes throughout Europe, as well as demands in relation to Anglo-Irish talks, there is indeed a need for additional personnel to be appointed to the Department to complement the efforts of those who are there at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in response to previous questions of this nature, my responsibility for wandering or straying animals, including horses, is limited to providing for the impounding of such animals where necessary and to overseeing the law on civil liability for damage caused by animals.  These areas of the law were up-dated and improved by the Animals Act, 1985, and I am satisfied that, so far as my limited area of responsibility is concerned, an adequate legislative structure is in place.</P>
      <P>I do not have responsibility for issues such as the welfare, registration or control of animals.  Those issues should be taken up with the appropriate Departments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in relation to this problem which is experienced to a varying degree in every constituency.  As regards the implementation of the 1985 Act, the Garda are doing everything possible.  It is quite possible there is need for a review of this <Col N="791" /> matter but such a review would not be carried out by the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest difficulty for the Garda and indeed the personnel in charge of animal pounds is in tracing owners and making people responsible for seized animals.  Would the Minister accept that the only way to overcome that problem would be to introduce a system of marking and registration and that the most successful way to do this would be to freeze-mark rather than to ear-tag animals, in view of the information we are learning from a tribunal at another location in terms of the ease with which ear tags can be removed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in freeze-marking but I am no expert on this subject and I do not want to make judgements as to the best way forward. However, this is a matter that is worthy of examination.  The Department of Justice are implementing the provisions of the Act, and I acknowledge the Deputy's point, that one of the problems is knowing who owns some of these animals.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's complacency on the effect of the 1985 legislation.  Would the Minister not agree that a control of horses Bill should be introduced to control the sale of horses to young people in inner city areas?  Horses are running riot in the streets and apart from the damage and injury caused it is very cruel to the horses. Would the Minister say when he is going to address this problem?</P>

If the Deputy feels there is a need for changes in the Act, I suggest he asks the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 57 together.  The Garda investigations into illegal importations of arms on behalf of the Provisional IRA are continuing.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Barry's question, the position is that media sources reported last year that the Libyan Government had conveyed proposals to the British Government, including a proposal to provide details of arms shipments to the Provisional IRA.  As a result of these reports, I made inquiries of the British authorities.  I was informed that, while numerous messages had been received from Libya to the effect that they were willing to provide information in relation to the Provisional IRA, nothing positive has developed on foot of these communications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is widely believed that the Libyan Government have supplied arms to the IRA on many occasions.  As a result of his own inquiries, has the Minister any indication of the number of times this happened?  Has this information implications for our trade with Libya?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of trade with Libya, may I suggest the Deputy address his question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>However, on the question of the armaments I have given the Garda Síochána my full and active support in the task that confronts them.  The Garda Síochána, on occasion accompanied by members of the Defence Forces, carry out regular searches for arms and ammunition that may be hidden throughout the country. Since 1 January 1989, almost 400 firearms, 100,000 rounds of ammunition and 5,500 lbs of explosives were seized by the Garda Síochána in the course of searches. Each find, no matter how small, is important in itself and the Garda are committed to maintaining the momentum of the searches.</P>
      <P>These weapons and munitions are intended to cause death and injury as part of the continuing murderous campaign of the Provisional IRA.  The Garda have to be congratulated on the good work they are carrying out.  The Deputy can be assured that as far as I am personally concerned, everything that I and the Garda Síochána can do to defeat these murderous thugs will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Irish Government are actively engaged in trade talks with Libya on the meat industry can the Minister assure the House that the Government will seek a commitment from Libya, as a condition of the on-going relationship between the two countries, that Libya will never again assist in the delivery of arms to the IRA or to any other illegal organisation in this country? Second, in regard to the on-going Garda Síochána investigations, is it anticipated that further trials in relation to the importation of illegal arms on the <i>Eksund</i> will come before our courts?  In particular, will the accused who has recently returned to Ireland from prison in France stand trail in Ireland?  Will the Minister indicate the extent of weapons that remain to be recovered from the shipments of weapons to this country from Libya?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the response in the House of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who was questioned on 7 November about what assurances had been sought from the Libyan Government on ending arms supplies and renouncing support for the Provisional IRA.  The Minister outlined the details of bilateral meetings he had with the Libyan Foreign Minister in Brussels on 4 November when he spelled out the grave concern of the Government on the issue of Libyan support for the IRA and asked for assurances that Libya had renounced such support.  The Libyan Foreign Minister responded to the effect that Libya does not recognise, does not and will not deal with the IRA; that Libya does not supply the IRA with arms or money, does not develop contacts and has no relations with the IRA.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs welcomed these assurances on behalf of the Irish Government and we expect the Libyan authorities to adhere scrupulously to them.</P>
      <P>On the question of the munitions and material still available since the importations in 1985 and 1986, I am not in a position to give the Deputy the full details.  It is for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether to prosecute in the case mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to video tapes, the House will be aware that the Video Recordings Act, 1989, was enacted to control and regulate the supply and importation of video recordings.  This Act is being brought into operation in stages. Last year I made orders under that Act to enable the film censor to grant licences to wholesale and retail video dealers and to prohibit the supply of objectionable videos.  It is proposed to make a further order and regulations in the coming months to enable the film censor to examine all new videos intended for supply and also to commence the systematic examination of all videos already on the market.</P>
      <P>Turning to the matter of audio tapes, there is no specific legislation for the censorship of sound recordings, for the simple reason that there has not been a problem of pornographic or obscene records or tapes being put on the market. I am aware, however, that serious concern has been expressed about a recent recording by an American group which has come on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on record that I share that concern.  I would hope that the civic responsibility and good sense of the record retailers and distributors in this country will ensure that their recordings will be quickly taken off their shelves.</P>
      <P>I have, however, asked the Garda authorities to examine whether distribution or sale of such a recording may constitute a criminal offence and I have asked them to explore all avenues to see whether the sale of such material can be lawfully prevented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Notwithstanding that, would he not agree that appealing to the civic spirit of the public might not be sufficient in this case in that huge profits are likely to be made from the sale of audio or video tapes, and would he not now, as a matter of urgency, consider introducing legislation that would control that market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot just press a button and have legislation arrive.  The <Col N="797" /> issue is one to be examined but I do consider that the short term solution is to do as I have done; first, appeal to retailers to take the tapes off their shelves and, second, have the Garda authorities examine whether the distribution or sale of such a recording constitutes a criminal offence.  As I have said, I have asked the Garda authorities to examine all avenues to determine whether the sale of such material can be lawfully prevented.  If it cannot be prevented lawfully, then I assure the Deputy that the necessary legislation will be introduced.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister expect completion of the Film Censor's work on an overall view of films which are currently coming on stream but are already available in video shops?

      <P>The programme is very extensive, as Members could imagine, because of the number of videos available in shops already and the number of new videos coming on to the market all of the time.  There is a gap in the present legislation in relation to film censors.  It was my intention to immediately appoint a number of assistant film censors to help in the work and to speed it up as much as possible.  The vast number of videos involved makes it impossible for one man to do that work.  The out-turn has been that we are caught by the law.  Because of the legislation enacted in the 1920s <Col N="798" /> when censors were established, it is now necessary to change the legislation to allow for the employment of assistant film censors.  That legislation is nearly completed, it will be introduced and I know that the co-operation of all sides of the House will ensure its speedy passage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a wide range of alternatives to custody in operation in this country, including fines, probation, compensation orders, deferment of sentence, suspended sentence and community service orders.  The use of supervised alternative sanctions has been growing steadily in recent years to the point at which there are at present over 3,200 offenders serving community-based sanctions under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service.  That is about one and a half times the number of persons who are in custody.  For example, over 700 offenders are on community service orders and the number of such orders made by the courts has increased from 698 in 1985 to 1,349 at 30 November 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> I wholeheartedly endorse and encourage the use of alternatives to custody in appropriate cases and I have increased the staffing and resources of the Probation and Welfare Service so as to enable more offenders to be catered for by way of community-based supervision rather than imprisonment.  I have no doubt but that the public interest is best served when a range of effective alternatives to custody are employed to the full and prisons are used only as a last resort.  In this regard I would point out &mdash; and this is something that is not always generally recognised &mdash; that when persons are committed to custody for relatively less serious offences it is very often the case that they would already have had alternative sanctions imposed on them for previous offences but have persisted with offending.</P>
    <P>As far as experience with the use of alternatives in other European countries is concerned, my Department have close contacts through the Council of Europe and otherwise with European prison administrations and take account of all useful developments in this field.  Regular attendance at conferences and seminars, participation in expert groups and visits from time to time to observe and study non-custodial sanctions in other countries have assisted in the development of programmes here and we ourselves have shared the benefits of our experience with others.  Ireland will later this year host the General Assembly of the European Probation Conference, which is indicative of our involvement in and commitment to international exchanges of information and experience on these matters.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that despite the very welcome development in recent times that he has outlined Ireland still has one of the highest rates in the EC of people in custody, and what further mechanisms would he envisage employing to give restitution to the victims of crime rather <Col N="800" /> than simply having a punitive system that punishes the offender?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken initiatives in relation to support for victims of crime. I have increased the amount of money available to the Victims Support Group. I have tried to assist victims by making available a room in the Four Courts for victims of crime before they have to face the court.  I have been involved in ensuring that in the construction of all new centres or the extension of existing court houses there will be a place available for the victims of crime to meet in a more relaxed atmosphere before going into a court room.  The Deputy can be assured that as far as possible every alternative to imprisonment will be expanded and extra resources are being made available to the Probation and Welfare Service, as I have already outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time remaining I will endeavour to cover a few points of interest to me.  There have been major improvements in the area of taxation with particular emphasis on the PAYE sector which has laboured under a huge and inequitable load for so long.  The standard rate was reduced from 35 per cent in 1989 to the 27 per cent proposed in this budget.  It is a major step forward and it is to be welcomed.  This has to be jobs oriented.</P>
      <P>With regard to agriculture we are all aware the farming community are going through a difficult time and that morale is low.  Measures to improve the situation are being taken but more needs to be done.  There is a number of matters which are particularly close to my heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of £2 million towards headage payments this year. Incorporated in that is the undertaking to honour next year the delayed increase in headage rates in accordance with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> last year.  Agriculture must be perceived by those in power as a business. Modern business is totally dependent on budgeting and planning.  Farmers do not know when they will receive the payments due to them and, therefore, they cannot run their business efficiently by planning ahead.  These payments to which they are entitled must be made on time.  I appreciate that the incumbent at the Department of Agriculture and <Col N="885" /> Food, Deputy Woods, is well aware of this and that he is doing his best to deal with the matter in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly with regard to Department of Agriculture and Food forms.  A farmer may be an outdoor worker who is quite prepared to do his paper work and accounts, but if he makes an ordinary error on an application form the penalty is draconian.  Such an error is categorised as fraudulent practice.  It is acceptable that there should be some fine or punitive measure in the event of the incorrect completion of forms, but it is unacceptable that, because of a clerical error, a farmer should be deprived of what should be forthcoming for this year and the following year.  This issue must be addressed quickly.  I have spoken to the Minister about it and he realises the implications.  He dealt with many such anomalies while at the Department of Social Welfare and I have no doubt he will continue his <i>modus operandi</i> at the Department of Agriculture and Food and deal with any improper practices.</P>
    <P>I welcome the revitalisation of the Middle East market for beef and I compliment the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, on being so quick off the mark when Colonel Gadaffi made his announcement with regard to terrorism and terrorists.  It would appear that good progress is being made and that is vital to our agriculture business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of money for Teagasc and the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Woods, with regard to seeking European funding for that body.  The continuing education of our young farmers is essential, as are the other services provided by Teagasc.  The Minister has also taken steps to avoid the closure of certain Teagasc establishments.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Teagasc office at Baltinglass in my constituency.  This office provides a viable service and its closure would make no sense.  Baltinglass could be described as the main trading centre for west Wicklow.  It is a market town dependent for its existence on the farming hinterland which stretches into <Col N="886" /> the surrounding counties of Carlow and Kildare.  It would be a devastating blow to that area of my county if this office were to close.  The dependence of the farming and business communities and the general populace of west Wicklow on that service is beyond description.  Any question of closure is unacceptable.  I would not wear it and I want all concerned including my colleagues in Government, to bear witness to that.  It is a meritorious and vital service in that area.  Great strides are being made in rural development and it would be totally contradictory to the philosophy of rural development to endeavour to close such a facility in a rural area.  Rural development is a priority objective of the European Regional Development Fund and there is a great commitment to it by this Government and by the European Community.  The Leader programme has been established which will allow for pilot funding.  I am very pleased that Wicklow has been accepted into that scheme. During the next year or 18 months over £2 million will be forthcoming, to be matched pound for pound.  We must not defy and contradict that philosophy by closing down an important service provided by Teagasc in west Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Major efforts in regard to tourism have been made and are continuing to be made by this Government.  In 1987 the Taoiseach issued instructions and said he wanted tourism numbers doubled in five years.  I am pleased we are on target.  Our growth rate in tourism is 15 per cent, three times the world average of 5 per cent.  These budgetary provisions lean in the upward direction of assisting the promotion of that vital industry to our economy, one destined to become the largest industry worldwide before the end of this century.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that excise duties on beer and spirits have not been raised. I say that again particularly bearing in mind the tourist industry.  Indeed, this is the third consecutive year these duties have not been raised and will be an enormous attraction for visitors who usually travel here with their cars.  These budgetary provisions will ensure reasonable <Col N="887" /> petrol, beer and spirit prices for tourists. I welcome the hands-off attitude of the Minister and the Government on excise duties on beer and spirits and welcome the proposed reduction in the price of petrol.  The budgetary provisions to improve availability of car hire for tourists is to be welcomed.  It is a sensible measure.  We must continue to develop our tourism potential.  Tourism is the most important area within which jobs can be created.  We have the necessary infrastructure, back-up and training agency, CERT, turning out highly qualified young people in hotel mangement, chefs and so on.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the fact that tax relief on mortgage interest or health insurance premiums has not been reduced.  The construction industry is crucial to our economy and, when buoyant, the spin-off is much appreciated by all concerned.  Therefore, the retention of relief on mortgage interest payments will be welcomed by the construction industry generally.  In the same context perhaps the Minister might examine the grant for first-time purchasers of houses which has remained at £2,000 for some time.  Perhaps it should now be increased since its importance to the construction industry is obvious.</P>
      <P>I contend this budget does reflect realism on the part of its drafters.  Once again the social concern of the Minister and Government is obvious.  I welcome its provisions.  A balance has been struck in drawing it up which will be appreciated by the community generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As far back as September last the Taoiseach ventured the opinion that the 1992 budget would be the toughest in living memory.  It is plain <Col N="888" /> for all to see that, yet again, the Government fudged when it came to dealing with the problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> our public finances. The Minister began his Budget Statement by telling us of an opening deficit of £541 million and finished having raised that same budget deficit by £50 million.  For the first time in recent years the Exchequer borrowing requirement, as a percentage of gross national product, is set to increase.  That is hardly an indication of a tough budget or one seeking to address the serious problem we encounter <i>via-à-vis</i> our public finances.</P>
      <P>The budget purports to address the matter of tax reform.  Certain elements need to be present in any package of the tax reform.  Among the central elements of any such tax reform are a widening of the tax base by a more comprehensive definition of taxable income and the curtailment of reliefs and allowances.  Certainly, the Minister has not gone the full way in this regard and whether he has gone in the right direction remains to be seen.  Other elements are a reduction in marginal tax rates and in the number of taxpayers paying income tax above the standard rate, a reduction in the tax wedge &mdash; the difference between the cost to a company of hiring workers and their take-home pay.  Another element is an increase in the total tax accounted for by taxes other than personal taxes.  Yet another element is equivalent tax treatment of income from different sources, particularly between employees, the self-employed and farmers and lastly, there is the tackling of poverty traps created by the interaction of the taxation and social welfare codes.  I am grateful to Davy Stockbrokers who, in their commentary on the budget, highlighted those points. It appears that the budget does not in any way adequately tackle the matter of tax reform.  Indeed, I wonder whether any Government, not comprised of all the parties in this House, will ever be in a position to deal with tax reform.  Without the existence of a national economic accord I wonder whether it is possible to bring about real tax reform, a really fair tax system, jobs-orientated, fair in its application to all taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> This Parliament is no more than a gadfly at the periphery when it comes to dealing with this budget, our public finances, the creation of jobs, tax reform, indeed tackling most issues facing our society.  We have become irrelevant; Parliament has become no more than a rubber stamp.  Debates in this House have become a charade, something I very much regret since I aspired to being a parliamentarian from a very young age. It is time all of us on a cross-party basis, put a stop to this charade.  All Members know that this charade has continued for far too long.  At the very least what is needed is a national economic accord, drawn up by Government and Opposition parties with the social partners, the representatives of youth organisations and the unemployed.  I question whether even that would be sufficient.  I want to avail of this opportunity to pose the question whether what is really needed is not a national Government.  Seven years from the eve of the third millennium it is timely for us to examine the really difficult, underlying problems confronting us as a nation.  We were not elected to this Parliament to serve ourselves or any party; we should put our country first. More importantly, I contend that each public representative must put his or her family first.</P>
    <P>I remember from my old days as youth leader we were taught never to spend time serving the community if we had not spent time looking after our own family first.  There is no point in being a street angel and a house devil.  As a parent of four children I feel like all other parents of young children thinking of a future that appears hopeless, tweedledee and tweedledum, where one party is trying to shout that it has a better ism than the others, or trying to be more extreme or smart than the others, that it is time we called a halt now.</P>
    <P>The Constitution allows for a seven-year Dáil.  Is it not time that we at least gave consideration to an all-party agreement to tackle the real problems facing this country, in a seven-year Dáil which would bring us into the third millennium, to the 21st century.  There are now <Col N="890" /> 269,300 people registered as unemployed. That does not take into account the people who are really unemployed and who are on all sorts of schemes.  The Government are providing for 274,000 on average as being unemployed this year. They understated their provision last year.  Again, Davy and Company, Stockbrokers, suggest that the Government should provide for an average of 285,000. This country is heading for a potential unemployment number of 300,000 people by the end of this year, let alone what will happen at the end of the decade.  I believe we should at least give consideration &mdash; I cannot say it is a panacea or that I know it will work &mdash; to the idea of a national Government consisting of all those parties who are prepared to put their country before their party and to participate in such a Government.</P>
    <P>This could be done by putting the national interest before all sectional interests, which is not being done at present.  Who represented the unemployed at the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations?  It could be done by changing the tax base from an asset-owning incentive system to a production-based incentive system; it could be done by removing tax breaks from machines and dropping the taxation of employment by removing the pay-roll tax; it could be done by eliminating the poverty trap by treating certain social welfare payments as income; it could be done by abolishing the duplication of State agencies involved in industrial promotion by ensuring that income from EC sources is put to maximum productive effort and not handed out on a political expediency basis; it could be done by ensuring a fairer tax system with incentives to produce by ensuring productivity from our public service in return for fair play and, perhaps, by requiring national service &mdash; both military and non-military &mdash; in return for minimum State payments.</P>
    <P>People might say this is a very naive suggestion, perhaps it is.  It is a suggestion which is worthy of debate and consideration and one which many people in this House would like to see considered, <Col N="891" /> if not on a national economic accord basis then on a national Government basis, but we are terrified to suggest it.  We know we are presiding over a disaster &mdash; and a disaster requires emergency action.  It requires innovation, commitment and foresight now.  We should be looking to those seven and eight years ahead to the turn of the century and asking ourselves what will the needs of the country be at that time.</P>
    <P>The monarch of the day locked Stanley Baldwin and Ramsay MacDonald in a room and would not let them come out until they formed a national Government in 1937.  Some people fear that participation in a national Government would prevent the party system from operating.  I believe it would continue to operate.  Any party worth its salt would continue to operate.  After Churchill's national government during World War II was it not Attlee who won the election? People have nothing to fear about this. The trappings of power is not the objective. There would be certain downsides if there were to be a national Government: there would be downsides for people like myself because there would not be enough places for politicians.  If we were to consider this, democratic accountability would have to be copperfastened. This could be done through a modern parliamentary committee system.  At present we have a system whereby the social partners &mdash; who are really sectional interest groups &mdash; lock themselves away with the Government of the day, quite often civil servants of the day and they make a deal involving all sorts of things from condoms to public service pay and various others matters which really are the job of this House.  They make decisions but not on the basis of the national interest.  The Government of the day get a deal because it keeps the social partners happy: farmers go away because they can keep their members happy; the employers and the unions can say they got something out of it for their members. What about the number of unemployed, 260,000, growing to 300,000 and which perhaps will soon be 400,000?  Who was <Col N="892" /> at the Cabinet and social partners meeting to represent those people?  We represent those people and we will never get to the stage of neutralising sectional interests because they will play one of us off against the other unless somehow, at the very least through a national forum but I suggest we should consider going even further to a national Government, we consider tackling these problems.</P>
    <P>Democratic accountability in such a scenario would have to be copperfastened but this could be done through a modern parliamentary committee system.  In those circumstances, there would be a proper role for committee chairpersons which would go some of the way to compensate for lack of ministerial opportunities.  In those circumstances would it be too much to suggest that TDs should then be required to take an oath of office which would require us to put the national interest before all public duties, including our duty to our party.  I am fed up listening to: &ldquo;It is good for the party, it is good for my party, it is good for his party or their party&rdquo;.  We did not come in here to serve our parties, we came in here to serve our country.  We are not doing that because we are allowing ourselves to be played one against the other.</P>
    <P>It is possible, far from undermining a democracy, that a national Government, together with a much strengthened parliament, could return national affairs to a democratic forum and away from the undemocratic corporate state-type, mutually beneficial, back-slapping operation which we have seen recently.  It was all very well when the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> operated well but we can see that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> went wrong. The national interest may not always be served by that sort of arrangement.  If we were to look at other comparisons we would say to ourselves that we have not served the country to the best or our ability, we have not given it the best shot, we have not given it the maximum effort.</P>
    <P>Austria, a country of 7.6 million people has an unemployment rate of about 4 per cent even though that country sustains a <Col N="893" /> high immigrant population.  In the event of their joining the European Community, as is expected, it will be a net contributor to the EC.  This has been achieved from outside the EC and without the EC largesse which we have received.  We could argue that not being a central European power and not being at the centre of the marketplace Austria is not a good example.  Austria was an annexed country following the <i>Anschluss</i> before World War II.  At that stage Austria was no more than part of the greater Germany and were on the losing side so to speak.  We are talking only in terms of decades but for the last three decades we have been receiving money hand over fist from the European Community and we have been using it like drunken sailors. We have not been using it to the best advantage of this country in terms of need, employment, laying plans, telling vested interests where to get off and putting the national interest first.</P>
    <P>The spectacle of a British local authority purchasing a house here for returned emigrants is an indication of just how bad things have become and how necessary it is for us to become more self-reliant. Exporting our unemployed is no longer the soft option it once was.  A national concerted effort over a seven year period would ensure that every stone is turned.  The vista as we approach the 21st century is too grave for us to do anything else.</P>
    <P>There is a national emergency and we need a national response, I ask the House to bear in mind that the traditional budget speeches about the shillings spent here, the 5p there and the give and take elsewhere, are no longer on.  What we need is vision.  I want to know where my four children are going to be in the 21st century, in a little over seven years from now, and every parent wants to know the same thing, and whether I am in or out of politics, will not matter.  It is time that we, in this House got together to tackle this national problem on a national basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare touches the lives of everyone in Ireland in some way, whether it <Col N="894" /> be the elderly, families and children, workers, the unemployed, lone parents or the sick and disabled.  We have always given priority to the support and care of those who depend on social welfare payments.  In doing so, we identify and provide for the real needs of people.</P>
      <P>The social welfare improvements announced in the budget continue the progress that has been achieved since 1987.  They are further evidence of this Government's commitment to protecting the position of those dependent on social welfare as provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>The social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost £162 million in a full year and £85 million this year. Gross expenditure on social welfare schemes and services will, therefore, increase to almost £3.36 billion on a full year basis.  This is a huge amount of money by any standards.</P>
      <P>The main elements of this year's social welfare improvements are &mdash; a general 4 per cent increase in all weekly social welfare and health board payments; a special increase to £53 per week in all short term payments which is an increase of 6 per cent; further improvements in the family income supplement; the introduction on a phased basis starting this year of measures to give effect to an EC Court of Justice ruling on equal treatment; an increase of £10 per child in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance; the introduction of a new adoptive benefit scheme for women in employment; an extra £1 million for voluntary organisations to fight moneylending; an additional grant of £0.25 million to the Combat Poverty Agency; further improvements in the free travel scheme; a reduction to 55 in the qualifying age for pre-retirement allowance; a special increase in the adult dependant allowance payable with old age non-contributory pension in order to remove an anomaly; and the extension of the existing over 80 age allowance to those in receipt of invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with some of the <Col N="895" /> improvements in more detail.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> guarantees social welfare recipients protection against inflation.  We are honouring that commitment again this year; indeed, we are doing more than that.  The annual rate of inflation to November last was 3.6 per cent and it is anticipated that the average rate for 1992 will be 3.75 per cent.  In this context the 4 per cent general increase will ensure, for the fifth successive year, that social welfare payments will keep ahead of inflation.</P>
    <P>The 4 per cent increase will apply to all personal rates as well as adult dependant and child dependant allowances.  It will come into effect from the end of July and will benefit 1.4 million people, i.e., 774,000 recipients and their dependants. The cost of this increase is almost £120 million in a full year and £52 million this year.</P>
    <P>The policy adopted in previous years of giving extra increases to those on the lowest social welfare payments is being continued again this year.  I am delighted that, for the fifth consecutive year, extra money is being provided which will enable me to give an additional 2 per cent increase to those on weekly short term payments.  This is on top of the general 4 per cent increase and it will mean that the personal rate of short term benefits will rise from £50 to £53 per week.  This special increase in the short term payments will cost over £4 million in 1992 and almost £10 million in a full year.  The effect of these increases means a new personal rate of £53 per week for all short term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short term unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and carer's allowance and a new personal weekly rate of £57.20 for all long term payments such as old age pension, lone parent's allowance, long term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and disabled person's maintenance allowance.  Those on contributory old age or retirement pensions will have a higher personal weekly rate of £66.60.  In addition, increases to the personal rate for adult and child <Col N="896" /> dependants will also receive the general 4 per cent increases.  I have some examples which I intend to circulate as I will not be able to cover all of them.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully aware of the pressures that can often be placed on adoptive parents because of the lack of provision in the social welfare code to cover absences from employment during the initial adoption period.  I am particularly pleased, therefore, to introduce a new payment to adoptive mothers along the lines of the existing maternity benefit scheme.  These new arrangements will be introduced later this year and will operate for a period of ten weeks after the placing of the child with the adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>The back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme, which was introduced in 1990 and significantly improved last year, is designed to assist recipients of social welfare and health board payments in meeting the cost of childrens' school uniforms and footwear.  The existing allowance of £40 for each child at second level and £25 for each child at primary level represents a welcome boost to families faced with back-to-school expenses. Some improvements were made to the scheme in 1991 when the allowance was paid in respect of almost 220,000 children at a cost of about £6.2 million.</P>
    <P>The amount of this allowance is being increased this year to £35 for each child at primary level and £50 for each child at second level.  The increased allowances will greatly assist families dependent on social welfare and health board payments in meeting the costs associated with the return of children to school.  The improvement in the scheme will cost £2.2 million this year bringing overall expenditure on the scheme to £8.4 million.</P>
    <P>Voluntary and community groups play an important part in improving the quality of the lives of people dependent on social welfare payments.  Through their flexible, innovative and caring responses, these groups can help overcome the sense of helplessness and isolation that many disadvantaged people feel.</P>
    <P>Community development initiatives involve local communities coming <Col N="897" /> together to identify and tackle the problems facing them and can make a major impact in improving the quality of life especially for those living in disadvantaged areas.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to put on the record my personal appreciation of the invaluable work being carried out by voluntary and community groups throughout the country. Since my appointment as Minister for Social Welfare I have seen these groups at work at first hand and have been very impressed with their dedication and commitment and I am committed to supporting their work.  This year an extra £1 million is being provided for community groups.</P>
    <P>I recently had the opportunity to visit north Clondalkin, Tallaght and northwest Connemara to see some of the projects being undertaken.  I am very glad we will be able to continue to support this invaluable work and would like to avail of this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to all volunteers who are working tirelessly with the officials of my Department, other Government Departments, State agencies and bodies, trying to ensure that community activity is co-ordinated and developed in a responsible way and responsive to the needs of communities.</P>
    <P>In addition to maintaining the support I have already mentioned, we will make a number of once-off grants to voluntary organisations who are in need of special assistance or who have developed imaginative proposals for innovative services. We also propose to increase by £500,000 the amount available under the community development programme funded by my Department to enable that programme to be extended to a number of new areas.  This brings the overall allocation for the programme to £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>I also propose to introduce a pilot programme of advice and assistance to low income families to combat the problems associated with moneylending.  This issue came to light some years ago and many people at that time were very helpful in trying to deal effectively with it. <Col N="898" /> However, we still have a problem in specific areas which needs to be responded to and I hope that, by providing this assistance and by the establishment of these pilot projects in a number of key areas, we will come up with new initiatives to deal with this scourge which has created problems for many people, especially low income families.</P>
    <P>I also intend to make a number of once-off grants to voluntary organisations each year in the budget.  A sum of £360,000 had already been provided in the 1992 Estimates for this purpose and an additional £240,000 is now being made available which will bring the overall allocation for 1992 to £600,000.  I am pleased to announce the allocation will be used to provide grants for a number of organisations spread throughout the country as follows: three groups affiliated to the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped will receive a total of £90,000; £40,000 to Galway County Association for Mentally Handicapped; £25,000 to the Muscular Dystrophy Society; £25,000 to the Cheshire Foundation; £20,000 to the West Clare Mental Health Association; £20,000 to the Irish Deaf Society, and £10,000 to the Cystic Fibrosis Association; £30,000 to the Capuchin Centre for Homeless Men, in Dublin; £20,000 to Focus Point, and £20,000 to the Pioville Hostel, Fr. Matthew Quay, Cork; £30,000 to St. Canice's Housing for the Elderly in Kilkenny, and £25,000 to Dungarvan Care of the Aged; £50,000 to the Coolock Community Law Centre to resolve the centre's current financial difficulties; £25,000 to the Carers' Association, and £20,000 to Clarecare; £50,000 to the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council; £25,000 to Marriage Counselling Services; £25,000 to the Boyle Area Family Ministry Programme, and £10,000 to the Centre for Education, Counselling and Psychotherapy in Cork city.</P>
    <P>I am providing £115,000 to six innovative projects which have recently come to our attention: £40,000 to Energy Action, Pearse Street, Dublin, towards their work in insulating the homes of needy elderly and low income groups; <Col N="899" /> £20,000 to Barnardo's for the provision of a centralised administrative service for a number of small voluntary organisations; £20,000 towards the provision of a resource centre for the group, Vietnamese People Re-settled in Ireland; £15,000 to the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed towards the employment of a worker to co-ordinate the provision of advice and information to the unemployed; £10,000 to the Anna Liffey Drug Project in Dublin towards their work with the families of drug dependants, and £10,000 to the Irish Association of Social Workers to set up a resource centre for social workers working in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The amount of £500,000 has been provided for the very successful scheme of grants for locally based women's groups introduced in 1990.  The emphasis of this scheme is on wide-ranging, practical activities undertaken by local women in disadvantaged areas or working with disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>Last year core funding was provided to three major projects who each received funding of £11,000.  That funding is now being increased to £20,000 each.  The projects are: North Wall Women's Centre in Dublin's inner city; Ronanstown Self-Development Group in Clondalkin and Little Bray Family Resource and Development Centre in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>A grant of £20,000 is being given to the Family Resource Centre, Inchicore, in Dublin to assist in the development of programmes for women in the area.  A grant of £5,000 is being given to the Women's Development Project, O'Devaney Gardens, Marmion Court, Dublin, towards their start up costs, and a special once-off grant of £50,000 is being given to Aontas, the National Association of Adult Education, for a local and regional programme of activities aimed at women in the home in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the importance of community development initiatives in involving local people in tackling the problems faced by their communities. <Col N="900" /> An amount of £750,000 had been provided for this programme in the 1992 Estimates and I am extremely pleased that an additional £500,000 is being provided bringing the overall allocation to £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>There are currently 21 projects participating in the programme.  With the additional resources being made available this year, I intend to extend the programme to a number of new areas around the country and to make increased resources available to those projects who joined the programme late last year with limited funding.  The new areas in which I propose to set up new projects include: Dundalk, Galway city, west Clare and the Mountwood- Fitzgerald Park area of Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Arising from our increased involvement in supporting community development activity, it is evident that one of the major difficulties faced by local communities is finding suitably qualified people as development workers.  I have decided, therefore, to make £20,000 available this year for a special bursary scheme to be administered by Maynooth College, to enable a limited number of people to undertake formal training in this area.  It is very difficult to find suitably qualified people with the skills to undertake work like this and I am certain this new scheme will help to address the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the loan guarantee fund which is administered by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on behalf of my Department.  Based on our experience of the operation of the fund to date it is evident that a range of supports are needed to assist families on low incomes in financial difficulties.  Key features of any such supports include the provision of professional advice on money management and home budgeting so as to break the cycle of dependancy on money lending as a solution to long term problems.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £260,000 announced last week in the budget will be used to set up a number of pilot projects aimed at building new and more comprehensive <Col N="901" /> approaches to combating the problems of money lending.  These pilot projects will work closely with my Department through the new regional structure established last year.  I also intend that the projects will develop close links with the community welfare service, local community development projects funded by my Department and other relevant local voluntary organisations.  The areas in which pilot projects will be established include Limerick city, Waterford city, west Clare and Cork city.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency are widely recognised for the practical support they provide to community organisations and locally based groups.  An additional amount of £250,000 is being provided to the agency bringing their overall allocation for 1992 to £1.35 million.</P>
    <P>A major development in my Department's role in relation to voluntary activity in the current year will be in bringing to a conclusion the work already under way on the charter and White Paper on voluntary social services.  All the preliminary work necessary for the preparation of a White Paper has been undertaken by my Department.  I am currently finalising proposals for Government on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be familiar with the difficulties which have arisen as a consequence of the delay in implementing the 1979 equal treatment directive which provided for the implementation of equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.  The deadline for implementation of the directive was 23 December 1984 and the necessary provisions to introduce equality of treatment in accordance with the directive were provided for by way of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985.  The provisions of this Act were brought into force in two phases in May and November 1986.</P>
    <P>Following detailed consideration of the most recent decision of the European Court, the Government have decided to provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period of the delay in implementing the directive.  As announced by the Minister for Finance, <Col N="902" /> the necessary legal provisions will apply retrospectively from the deadline for implementation, 23 December 1984 to the actual dates of implementation in May and November 1986.  The precise details of the proposals are being finalised at present.  I can say at this stage, however, that the retrospective payments to the married women concerned will be made on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994.  Under the first phase, all married women who received a reduced rate of benefit during the period of delay will receive the higher amount in 1992.</P>
    <P>I have circulated to Deputies a brief on the various improvements in the social welfare area and I do not intend to go into these in any more detail at this stage.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to refer briefly to the Taoiseach's impending resignation from office.  Many tributes have already been paid to this man who has occupied a focal point in the public and parliamentary life of this country for many years.  I should like to be associated with those words of tribute.  The Taoiseach will leave behind him a formidable legacy of reforming social legislation. One quality which permeates that legacy, and which has remained consistent and ever-present during his 35 years in this House, is his understanding, concern, commitment and feeling for the less well off sections, the underprivileged and disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    <P>He was an energetic and law reforming Minister for Justice in the early sixties. He was an imaginative Minister for Finance and will always be remembered for the introduction of free travel and free electricity for pensioners in 1967.  He was an innovative Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare during the seventies.  Looking at his range of activities as Minister for Finance, Minister for Health, Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Justice, one can see the major improvements he introduced for the less well off members of our community: the occupational injury benefits scheme, free travel, free electricity, free television licences, invalidity pensions, death grants, retirement pensions, the deserted wife's allowance which was <Col N="903" /> introduced in the seventies, the supplementary welfare allowance, the living alone allowance, the free telephone rental allowance which was introduced in 1978 and the pay-related social insurance contributions which were introduced in 1979.</P>
    <P>As Taoiseach he has presided over the introduction of major improvements and developments in the social welfare system since 1987.  These include the extension of social welfare insurance to the self-employed in 1988, the introduction of many new schemes and services to meet emerging needs in the social welfare area, the introduction of social insurance coverage for part-time workers last year and specific commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to protect and maintain the position of those dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>It was a privilege for me to work with the Taoiseach in Government and to have been a Member of this House with him for so many years.  I wish to thank him for the confidence he showed in me by appointing me to various ministries.  On behalf of my constituents and on my own behalf I wish him every success and happiness in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the positive aspects of the budget, which include some of the improvements in the social welfare area outlined by the Minister. However, the role of Opposition is to examine with a more critical eye the other aspects of the budget.  The most significant thing about the budget is that it is one of two budgets that will bring us into line with the Single European Market which will come into operation on 1 January next year.  I understand there will be some leeway given whereby the Irish Government will be allowed to introduce a budget at the end of January next year which will enable us to catch up with the rest of the Community.  I am concerned about whether we will be in a budgetary position to meet all the objectives of the single market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to the two matters of deep concern to me.  The first <Col N="904" /> related to the proposed abolition of VAT at the point of entry which I understand, in terms of loss to the Exchequer in cash flow, will cost approximately £200 million.  This is a vast amount of money in any circumstances.  In his Budget Statement last week the Minister for Finance said he would refer again to this matter when he was dealing with the Finance Bill.  This is not satisfactory.  The sum of money involved is so large that the Minister needs to give a more detailed statement when he is replying to the debate on how exactly he proposes to bridge that obligatory gap.  I should also like him to give a much clearer indication of how he proposes to deal with the abolition of the DIRT tax.  Even though this is one of our principal taxes all we have had are vague aspirations in this regard. A principal tenet of the Single European Market is the free movement of goods, capital and labour.  If there is to be free movement of capital, there cannot be different taxes on savings throughout the Community.  I have no doubt that the Government will be unable to advise people to retain large sums on deposit in banks, while the DIRT tax remains in place.  Therefore, there is a credibility gap in this budget on how these items are to be dealt with.  Unlike the matter of excise duty on car tax &mdash; the Minister has said he will introduce a registration tax &mdash; no indication has been given in the budget as to how resources in relation to the abolition of VAT at the point of entry or the abolition of the DIRT tax will be financed.  We are dealing here with a sum in excess of £300 million.</P>
    <P>My second major concern about the budget relates to the position in which it leaves the 1993 budget.  As the House is aware, this budget marks an alteration from all other budgets since 1987 in so far as it does not lower further the Exchequer borrowing requirements.  The projected Exchequer borrowing requirements for 1992 is £592 million or 2.4 per cent of GNP.  For the first time, this figure is greater than the outturn for the previous year.  Because the borrowing requirement for last year was approximately £290 million, due to the sale of <Col N="905" /> Irish Life, this represents a significant easing of the pedal on restoring our public finances.  What is even more disturbing is the position in which this leaves the 1993 budget.  Not only will the Government have to recoup by extra taxation and cuts in expenditure the loss of VAT at point of entry and the loss of revenue from the DIRT tax but they will also have to meet many of the pay provisions which have been deferred until 1993.  The arithmetic problem in this year's budget has been solved simply by postponing even bigger problems to 1993.  It behoves the Minister for Finance to state explicitly what his budgetary objectives for 1993 are, because it will be a critical year when there is likely to be some pick-up in the international economy. However, sufficient attention has not been given in this budget to the 1992 outturn and the opening position for next year.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the proposed VAT changes in the context of EC harmonisation.  I understood that there would be a standard rate of VAT of 14 per cent and that this would give us an approximation to the VAT rates proposed in the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour, which, in terms of our land Border with Northern Ireland, is very significant.  It is proposed to increase the VAT rate on essential items such as clothing, footwear, telecommunications services and repair and personal services from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent.  I strongly believe that many of these services, such as car repairs, can often be done by people who operate in the black economy.  If the Government increase the rates of taxation in these areas it will give a greater incentive to people to operate in the black economy.  When Fine Gael were in Government there was a deliberate policy to bring down that rate of VAT which had got out of control because it suited people to undercut legitimate VAT-registered contractors as the VAT rate on personal and repair services was too high.</P>
    <P>We all acknowledge that the pace of change in personal taxation is being led by the Progressive Democrats who, in <Col N="906" /> their single issue agenda, wish to have two rates of tax, 25 per cent and 45 per cent.  I do not think there is strong evidence to support the view that this is a panacea.  It would be much more desirable to amend our tax structure in two other ways.  It is wrong that people should go from a zero rate of tax to a 35 per cent rate of tax on modest and low incomes. We need to introduce a new low rate of taxation of about 15 per cent.  Once your income is over a certain threshold, particularly in the case of single people, you go into the 27 per cent rate.  When you add to that the employee's rate of PRSI of 8.5 per cent you are talking about going from virtually no taxation to a rate of 35.5 per cent.  Therefore it would be much more desirable if, instead of reducing the top rate of taxation, with whatever reliefs are available, a new rate of taxation of 15 per cent was introduced, particularly for the low paid.</P>
    <P>There is a huge disincentive to work so far as parents of large families are concerned because the more children you have the more money you get by way of social welfare while there is no tax free allowance for children.  One can argue that in this budget the reduction in the rates from 29 to 27 per cent and from 52 to 48 per cent has not been funded by changing the personal allowances, but of greater significance is the fact that there is still no tax free allowance for children. One of the reasons it does not pay people with four children or more to work is that for every additional child, people get more money on disability benefit or on unemployment benefit, yet, apart from exemption allowances, there is no tax free allowance for children.  Its abolition some years ago was a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>There is not a very strong case for the super-rich to have the same rate of taxation as the middle income group.  I do not agree with the abolition of the top rate of tax.  Instead we should introduce, with whatever reliefs are available, a childrens' tax free allowance and, for the first time, a rate of tax for low paid workers of 15 per cent.  Let there be a multiplicity of tax bands but relief should not be <Col N="907" /> applied to the super-rich while people on very modest incomes have to pay PAYE, particularly married women whose husbands use up all their allowances and who only have a PAYE and PRSI allowance. These women find themselves paying income tax on income of about £27 per week, and that is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some specific points in the limited time available to me. I understand that a particular difficulty has arisen for the car industry whereby garage proprietors who have stock in hand and have paid excise duty at wholesale level are caught because the cars in stock are £300 or £400 out of line with new stock on which excise duty has been reduced.  In the case of vans the difference is about £1,000.  I understand that discussions are taking place between the SIMI and officials of the Department of Finance in an effort to resolve this problem. However, there is an urgent need to allow a rebate of the excise duty concession for the limited number of cars involved.  There is a precedent for such a step.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a few areas of expenditure that have been almost wilfully neglected by the Government since 1987 and where the crisis is continuing to deepen.  Housing is the first area I would like to address.  As a member of each of two local authorities I am well aware of the acute problems of lengthening housing lists.  The Programme for Social Housing as put forward by the former Minister for the Environment in 1991 falls far short of what is required to deal with the problem.  A regular feature of front page articles in my local newspaper is of families who are homeless, who have only a tent or a caravan or whose children cannot be discharged from hospital because the parents do not have proper accommodation for them.  This budget has done nothing for the homeless and it will do nothing to reactivate the construction programme that is necessary for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>There is huge under-funding in education in relation to remedial teaching and career guidance teaching, and that <Col N="908" /> problem has not been addressed in the budget.  In relation to social welfare 70,000 full-time carers are denied the carer's allowance, with only about 3,000 people availing of this scheme.  Some full-time carers who have given up jobs cannot get this allowance because of the rigorous nature of the means test. Greater flexibility needs to be introduced into this scheme so that genuine bona fide carers who provide care on a seven day week basis can get the allowance.</P>
    <P>In the health area there are still problems with regard to waiting lists.  There are acute problems with the transport service whereby ambulance cover is restricted at night in many provincial towns and people who do not have a car have great difficulty in getting to outpatient departments in hospitals and other health centres.  In the area of our dental care there is a stop-go service. Adult mentally handicapped people, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area, cannot be guaranteed residential care after their parents' death, and that is unacceptable.  The areas I have mentioned &mdash; the provision of local authority housing, waiting lists for health services generally, with specific reference to mental handicap residential places, and dental and transport services &mdash; should have been addressed in this budget.  Similarly remedial and career guidance services at primary and post primary level should have been addressed and the carer's allowance should have been up-dated.</P>
    <P>In relation to the economy generally and to employment I would like to say a few words about transport, my own portfolio, but I would first like to refer to the depression in the agricultural sector. The extra £1 million for Teagasc falls far short of what is required to maintain all the services the Minister has promised to maintain in the west not to mention those in my constituency such as Clonroche horticultural centre, Johnstown Castle and other advisory centres.  Some steps should have been taken in this budget to increase the threshold for capital acquisitions tax for young farmers inheriting land.  This is out of date and needs to be <Col N="909" /> brought into line to take account of milk quotas and other changes in the capital value of farms.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like the Minister to take up in the Finance Bill the question of depreciation of agricultural machinery <i>vis-à-vis</i> registered agricultural contractors. Since, obviously an agricultural contractor will use equipment at a much greater rate than an ordinary farmer he should be allowed claim in respect of depreciation of 50 per cent instead of being assessed in this respect in the same way as is a farmer who may use the same equipment over several years.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to transport, my own area of responsibility.  If there is any issue that will become increasingly important in the context of the Single Market in 1993 it is transport, simply because we are dependent on exports. We export more than 70 per cent of the goods we produce.  We are more dependent on exports than is Japan, and when you consider how much Japanese hi-fis, cars and televisions are an everyday feature of European and American life, you realise how vital our exports are.</P>
    <P>We have more complex transport requirements than have other countries in so far as we have an inadequate road infrastructure and one of the most inefficient port structures in Europe.  We must avail of sea transport which is costly or, alternatively, air transport though that accounts for only 0.2 per cent of cargo.  In those circumstances we must improve our transport in terms of frequency, cost and reliability and of efficiency of services.  We are getting money from the European Community on a once off basis to rectify the problem whereby our transport costs are twice the European average, representing over 9 per cent of export product value.</P>
    <P>The first thing we need to do is stop the practice of sea transport from the Republic using the northern corridor. One in three of all container loads that either originates from or is destined for the Republic of Ireland goes through or comes through Northern Ireland.  That happens for a number of reasons.  Port costs on the central and southern corridor <Col N="910" /> are three times higher than those in Northern Ireland.  One reason for this is that we have not given the same capital grants in aid to our ports as has Northern Ireland, and that needs to be rectified through EC funding of 75 per cent.  In the case of Dublin Port we need to remove the monopoly of stevedoring practices, and that can be done only by a generous redundancy package financed by the Government.  We need most of all to update the Harbours Act, 1946, so that our ports operate commercially rather than bureaucratically as is the case of local authorities.</P>
    <P>We need to update our national roads, which account for 6 per cent of our road network, to European standards.  If we continue at the present rate of improvement, it will be the year 2020 before they are brought into line.  We must remember that the Irish motoring public are paying £3.5 million per day in all taxes but they are not getting the roads they deserve. Delays due to inadequate roads are adding directly to our cost structure.  If we take the haulage sector, in particular, we will see examples of where we are out of line.  Excise duty on vehicles in the Republic is levied at 6.5 per cent but in the North it is zero.  The excise duty on oil is a great deal higher in the South than in the North.  VAT on diesel and on vehicles is levied at 21 per cent in the Republic but it is 15 per cent in Northern Ireland.  When one also adds higher insurance and labour costs, one can see how the Southern hauliers have lost out. We should have a common EC policy and we should have a common rate of VAT of 14 per cent on both diesel and vehicles for the haulage sector.  I welcome the Minister's decision to abolish the excise duty on road haulage vehicles but this is tempered by the savage increase of 35 per cent in road tax.</P>
    <P>We oppose the proposal to abolish duty free concessions at EC level and the proposition to introduce intra-Community VAT on transport.  The years 1992 and 1993 are inescapably crucial in putting a coherent transport policy in place, some of it is budgetary, some of it is policy and a great deal is EC related. <Col N="911" /> Unfortunately, I see no evidence of any Government programme to meet that objective.  There is no Government strategy to deal with the congestion problem in Dublin and there are no plans for a light rail transport system in the city. Such a system is required in the long term, to match the DART, right across the greater Dublin area, where 40 per cent of the population live.  Unless these proposals are approved by this House and then by Brussels we will not be competitive in terms of our transport costs.</P>
    <P>We have no real policy on how we will develop our rail service.  Fine Gael believe that the National Roads Authority should be a national roads and rail authority, because it is unfair that the cost of maintaining the railway track, which is about £45 million per year, should be paid for solely by the transport user, Irish Rail, unlike any other mode of transport. Last Wednesday the Sligo Chamber of Commerce led a deputation to try to maintain the rail service to Sligo.  The service to Sligo is getting slower and slower for safety reasons because of under-investment in the railway track.</P>
    <P>We have no systematic programme for developing our ports and we are still awaiting the report of the Harbour Review Committee.  This type of analysis and paralysis means that we are not in a position to convince our European partners that we have an integrated transport plan.</P>
    <P>The first thing the new Taoiseach &mdash; Deputy Albert Reynolds I presume &mdash; should do when appointing his Cabinet is to ensure that the first steps are taken to put a coherent transport policy in place by appointing a Minister with responsibility for transport.  At present the Minister for the Environment is responsible for roads, traffic and haulage issues, the Minister for Finance is responsible for budgetary matters, the Minister for the Marine is responsible for ports and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications is responsible for shipping and aviation.  It is totally fragmented and there is no interaction between Departments.  In most other European <Col N="912" /> countries, particularly Denmark, they have resolved the problem of the need for an integrated transport policy by making one Department responsible for all facets of transport policy.  I hope we will have a new transport ministry in the new Cabinet.</P>
    <P>We will be opposing this budget because while it has many innovative and new measures, it lacks the overall vision to give us the type of policies that will allow us in the competitive Single Market to create a greater market share for Ireland so as to increase the proportion of Irish goods and services sold abroad. Without this we will not resolve the unemployment crisis here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget is primarily a domestic measure but I wish to spend a few moments identifying features of the international context in which we live and trade.  In the present context the current administration could hardly have been confronted with a more difficult task than framing this year's budget.</P>
      <P>Over the last two years the international economy has turned decisively downwards after a seven year period of sustained and rapid expansion that spanned most of the eighties.  In particular, difficulties in the United Kingdom economy have posed a special threat for us.  Although there has been a significant shift away from dependence on the UK market over the past 30 years, it remains by a comfortable margin our largest export market.  Hence, the recession in Britain, now in train for almost two years, has caused very grave difficulties for that portion of Irish industry dependent on export markets for a significant portion of its sales.  The past year has been particularly disappointing in that the timing of the expected move out of recession by the major economies has been continuously pushed back.  This time last year it had been hoped that the UK economy would be on an upward trend again by the middle of last year, now many forecasters do not see the upturn coming much before the middle of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, in the United States many <Col N="913" /> indicators were suggesting that the economy was expanding again last summer, but those hopes have been conclusively dashed over the second half of the year. There is now overwhelming evidence available that the US economy ended 1991 on a very depressed note indeed and any recovery that may emerge in 1992 is likely to come later rather than sooner and will be slow and shallow when it does come.</P>
    <P>This combination of events in the international economy has been particularly unfortunate from the Irish point of view. For much of the boom years in the international economy during the eighties, the Irish economy was so financially stretched that it was not able to participate. It was only after Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1987, and the decisive action taken to correct the large budgetary imbalances they inherited, that the economy was in a position to benefit from the buoyancy of the bigger economies.  However, by this time the momentum was rapidly disappearing from the international boom and the Irish economy only participated in the very tail end.</P>
    <P>Judged against the international difficulties facing policy makers, last year in Ireland there was quite a creditable performance.  From the financial perspective, the economy remains very sound.  Despite the much weaker than anticipated external environment, overall borrowing figures for the last year turned out only marginally higher than budget.  That was in contrast to the almost hysterical fears of many commentators towards the middle of the year.  It also compares very favourable with the experience in other countries.  In Britain, for example, the budget has moved from a substantial surplus to a substantial deficit and in other European economies budget deficits have widened sharply. This year's target of £592 million will be the fourth year in a row in which the deficit is kept within the limit of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent of GNP.  That is sound financial management at its best.</P>
    <P>The economy also performed well under the general headings of inflation <Col N="914" /> and the balance of payments, the latter being the difference between what we sell to and buy from other countries.  Since Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1987 we have had a surplus on this account.  This year the surplus will be over 6 per cent of GNP and will be the highest in the entire OECD area &mdash; much higher than the financial powerhouses such as Japan, Germany and Switzerland.  Inflation remains well under control and is in line with what is required by our membership of the European monetary system.  This has enabled us to maintain our currency link with the Deutsche Mark and to continue to attract substantial flows of funds from international investors.  In this regard it is important to note that the successful partnership approach based on consensus between the Government, trade unions and employers has been an integral part of the success on the trade and inflation fronts.  Because of the provisions of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and its successor, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> Irish companies have been able to notch up substantial gains in competitiveness. This is now showing through in the export figures.  Despite the very poor shape of the UK economy, Irish exports to Britain were increasing again in the latter months of 1991 as Irish companies won market share from their UK counterparts.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that good financial ratios are an end in themselves.  A large balance of payments surplus and low inflation are no substitutes for the jobs and employment that are necessary for those who do not have them at present but they are a prerequisite if we are to achieve the growth in the economy necessary, if we are to create those jobs.  We would have no hope of generating such growth if we were to start from high inflation and large imbalances in the public finances and trade account.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the specifics of the budget.  I have already noted that holding the overall borrowing requirement to just 2.4 per cent of GNP in the current difficult economic climate represents a very substantial achievement <Col N="915" /> and compares very favourably with international experience.  There have been many interesting innovations in the budget, but they have not been achieved at the expense of overall financial targets. Prudent financial management has been a hallmark of this Government for the past five years and it has been continued in this year's budget.  The target set for the EBR in 1992 will provide the foundation for the achievement of the targets set in the Programme for Government agreed last summer.</P>
    <P>The success of financial management has not been at the expense of the poorer sections of the population.  Yet again, this year's budget provided for increases in social welfare rates comfortably ahead of the rate of inflation.  That has been the case for the past five years and will remain so for as long as this Administration remains in power.  Indeed, that caring and imaginative approach to the needs of the less well off has been characterised by the Taoiseach's behaviour and interest in the less well off during his entire public life.  This year again I can see the hand of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in the provisions for social welfare.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was feared that the adjustment of the Irish indirect tax system to a level that was consistent with the establishment of the Single Market in 1992 would cause serious difficulties for the Irish Exchequer.  Some suggested that the cost might be as high as £400 million to £500 million per annum.  The year 1992 was on the lips of everyone as if it were some kind of economic ogre that would herald our death knell.  Believe it or not, we are now in the so-called dreaded year and things do not seem nearly so catastrophic. The fact that this is so is testimony to the prudent planning of the previous two Governments.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of VAT has been reduced to 21 per cent and whatever further adjustments are required when the barriers come down completely next January can be accommodated without any undue strain on the budgetary arithmetic. Let us not forget that the standard VAT rate was as high as 25 per cent just a few <Col N="916" /> years ago and that many excise duties were way out of line with comparable rates in Northern Ireland &mdash; Border traders would testify to that fact without any undue provocation.  To make the adjustment that has been made would have been difficult enough in any circumstances; to do so at the same time as major financial imbalances were being corrected was a remarkable achievement.</P>
    <P>We have also witnessed again this year significant further progress in reforming the direct tax system.  The standard rate of tax is now down to 27 per cent and there is only one higher rate of 48 per cent.  That compares with the standard rate of 35 per cent and a higher rate of 65 per cent when Fianna Fáil began the process of 1987.  There has also been a sharp reduction in the proportion of taxpayers paying marginal rates above the standard rate, down from an unacceptable level of 45 per cent in 1986 to 31 per cent in 1991.</P>
    <P>Those reforms are an integral part of any comprehensive job creation programme. Recently we had the publication of one of the most comprehensive reviews of industrial policy and job creation in the history of the State, namely, the Culliton report.  I congratulate Mr. Culliton and his team on producing such a timely and comprehensive report.  The essential message in that report was that we must create the environment in which industry and jobs can flourish, rather than attempt to put in place a myriad of reliefs and grants in an effort to remedy serious basic disadvantages in the system.  In the past our industrial policy was often compared to a health system that responded to an outbreak of a virus by building more and more hospitals rather than tackling the basic source of the disease in the first place.  One of the more glaring anomalies in the previous system was that it subsidised capital and taxed labour.  That was an odd combination of incentives for an economy that had, and continues to have, such a ready supply of young and well-qualified entrants into the labour force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> As a result of the system we adopted, the gap between the cost to the employer of hiring a worker was well in excess of the take-home pay of the employee. Economists call that the tax wedge and it constituted a serious deterrent to increasing employment.  At the same time, Ireland was subsidising capital very significantly indeed.  Apart from low corporate tax rates, there were accelerated capital allowances, capital grants and section 24 loans.  This Government have not been shy when it comes to taking the tough decisions necessary to redress the imbalance between capital subsidies on the one hand and the cost of labour on the other.  Most of those reliefs and grants have been significantly curbed, and potential employers can now make a much more balanced judgment in the choice between employing labour and machines when they start up a new project.</P>
    <P>However, much remains to be done. Marginal tax rates which are effectively very high are still very much part of the system.  There has been some reduction in the tax wedge but it is still very high in an absolute sense.  We must make progress in the process of integrating the tax and social welfare codes and reducing the disincentives that remain in the system. In this context I should like to enter a plea for any further reform of the tax system that takes place.  Reducing rates of income tax is a plausible objective, but right now it is no longer the rates of tax that are the main problem.  A standard rate of 27 per cent and a top rate of 48 per cent are not excessively high by international or other standards.  The problem that should now be recognised is that average income earners reach the top rate too quickly.  Hence my plea: any further resources which are available for reform of the income tax code should be used to expand the standard rate band rather than reduce rates further still.  That was an important element of the Culliton proposals and I endorse it wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>There are also other areas of employment policy that can and need to be progressed independently of what is done <Col N="918" /> on the tax front.  In particular, the Culliton report identified current training and education policy as being inadequate for the needs of a modern and growing economy.  There is a need to de-emphasise the bias towards liberal arts and traditional professions &mdash; not; of course, to move away from them altogether &mdash; and to give higher priority to the acquisition of usable and marketable skills.  A high quality stream of technical and vocational education needs to be developed, and that will require attention at both second and third levels.</P>
    <P>Other parts of the environment and infrastructure also need to be developed. We must do something about the efficiency and cost of access travel, and in this regard I agree with the previous speaker, Deputy Yates.  Ports on the east coast have become uncompetitive and have lost significant market share to their Northern counterparts.</P>
    <P>In that context I wish to link the port issue on the east coast to Dún Laoghaire harbour, which is an important resource in my own constituency.  I state straightaway that without the ferry at Dún Laoghaire there will be no Dún Laoghaire harbour.  I strongly favour the retention of the ferry service, for which there are sound reasons.  Dún Laoghaire is Ireland's premier passenger port; twice as many passengers use Dún Laoghaire &mdash; 1.2 million passengers last year &mdash; as use Dublin Port.  Dún Laoghaire is 45 minutes closer to Holyhead by sea than Dublin Port.  Dún Laoghaire is a beautiful port of entry for tourists and commercial users alike.  Furthermore, it is visually attractive and adjacent to our biggest urban population of one million people.  The harbour provides alternative competition to Dublin and it has an excellent record of industrial relations and a tradition for more than 150 years of running on time.  While it is not envisaged that Dún Laoghaire would ever develop into a freight port only, nonetheless almost 5 per cent of the national exports now go through Dún Laoghaire.  The capacity for freight handling is needed in a port near Dublin.  The Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, <Col N="919" /> had indicated his support on several occasions, very recently in the Seanad, for the retention of the ferry service to Dún Laoghaire.  That is a matter of public record.</P>
    <P>At present the ferry is by far the major source of revenue for the harbour.  It is also quite clear that regardless of the other leisure type developments that may be undertaken in the harbour they will not generate sufficient revenue to maintain the harbour.  I reiterate the main point of my argument: without the ferry there would be no Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report identified areas that need attention in addition to the ports &mdash; the postal and telecommunications area, energy policy and prices to mention a few.  I welcome the Minister for Industry and Commerce's endorsement of the overall thrust of the Culliton report.  I also welcome the establishment of a committee of Ministers with the Taoiseach as chairman to progress the issues further.  Many of these measures will take time to implement and we must avoid the temptation of the &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some relief will come from the two new schemes announced on budget day &mdash; the employment subsidy scheme and the in-company training scheme.  Some 25,000 people will come off the live register as a result of these schemes which will be heavily assisted by the European Social Fund &mdash; 75 per cent &mdash; and the balance from employers.  Such assistance is a major achievement in gaining European recognition for the special needs of our economy and I congratulate the Government negotiators, the Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in particular, for gaining European recognition for the special needs of our economy.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on achieving a creditable balance between conflicting demands on him.  The budget has maintained the oveall thrust towards prudent financial management which has formed such an integral part of Fianna Fáil policy since 1987.  The budget has <Col N="920" /> continued the process of radical reform of the income tax code, although more needs to be done, as people reach the top rate too quickly.  The budget has changed the nature and structure of our indirect tax code to prepare us for the Single Market and it has overhauled the incentives in the corporation tax code.  At the same time the budget has yet again more than protected the living standards of those most in need and has laid the foundation for strong and sustainable growth in employment in the nineties.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dún Laoghaire harbour, central to the development plan is the retention of the ferry terminal.  In that context I will congratulate and commend the chairman of the interim harbour board, Professor Dermot McAleese, and his colleagues for their committed work in developing an imaginative and exciting plan for Dún Laoghaire harbour.  Without the ferry there would be no Dún Laoghaire harbour.  The case for the retention of the ferry is founded on the strongest possible logical arguments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this budget it is no harm to refer to the response of the Conference of the Major Religious Superiors with regard to the areas in which they have a demonstrably clear interest.  They say there is no redistribution of wealth to ensure that everyone has a minimal, adequate standard of living, that there has been a complete failure to close the gap between the poor and the better off and that, in fact, the gap has been widened.  They say there has been little attempt to tackle widespread rural poverty, there has been a totally inadequate programme to tackle unemployment, there has not been any significant action to tackle child poverty, or any significant changes which would make it easier for unemployed people to work towards developing themselves and their communities, seeing that the jobs are not available, and that there has not been a serious attempt to eliminate poverty traps.  They say also that there is no evidence that the emerging housing crisis will be tackled or that the Government recognise the need for an integrated <Col N="921" /> approach to tackling poverty in the social divisions.  I agree with their views on the redistribution of wealth and on the impact of this budget.  The budget does not cater for the most vulnerable sections of our community.  In most instances lower paid people will be worse off than they were before.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare clearly indicated Government policy in the area of social welfare with regard to disability and occupational injury benefits when he said the Government had decided that with effect from next April all weekly disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit payments would be treated as income for tax purposes, that the mechanism for implementing these arrangements was currently under urgent examination in the Department and that it was envisaged that it would include a combination of a statutory sick pay scheme under which, for an initial period of four weeks, responsibility for sickness payments would be transferred to the employer with an appropriate compensatory arrangement, and that for claims in excess of four weeks duration other arrangements to integrate disability benefit with employers' pay roll systems and with the taxation system generally, would be made.</P>
      <P>This is the wrong time to bring disability benefit and occupational injuries payments into the tax code.  Every insured worker knows that up to 1987 the insurance card gave full entitlement to free hospital services, but since 1987 that has changed and hospital day charges commencing at £10 per day were introduced. The charge has now been increased to £15 per day up to a maximum of ten days.  In a family of five it would not be unusual to have two members of a family in hospital for up to ten days in any one year.  This would impose a tax bill of £300 on that family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free drugs scheme has been dramatically altered and the insured worker has to spend £96 over three months before he can get any refund. With those new elements of taxation on the insured worker, this is not the time to introduce an assessment of disability <Col N="922" /> and occupational injuries benefit for tax purposes.  Occupational injuries benefit is a payment made to an insured worker who has suffered incapacity, perhaps the loss of a limb or an eye, or who might be confined to a wheelchair due to an accident at work.  To think that the Government have seen fit to make a decision to include that benefit for tax purposes is very serious.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, further changes have been made in the conditions for eligibility for disability benefit.  Having discussed this with insured workers and others, I am convinced that neither the Government nor the Minister are conscious of the implications of these altered conditions. Heretofore an insured worker, having a base minimum of 208 paid contributions, on unemployment assistance or on credit, retained his right of eligibility for disability benefit at any time he or she became ill.  All that has been changed by the decision of the Minister and the Government.  The Government statement says that contribution conditions for receipt of social welfare benefits require claimants to have, in the first instance, a certain minimum number of paid or credited contributions in a recent contribution year.  At present people can be entitled to short term social welfare payments mainly on the basis of credited contributions and without any recent record of paid contributions.  The statement goes on that the Government have decided that, in the interests of better targeting of benefits, entitlement to disability and treatment benefits will be subject to a minimum number of paid contributions in the previous year.</P>
    <P>There are 270,000 people unemployed for periods ranging up to seven years and more.  If such a person is hospitalised after 1 April next, his or her eligibility to draw disability benefit will be gone because there will not be a minimum number of paid contributions in the 1991 tax year.  The overwhelming majority of the unemployed have been insured workers and they are subsisting on unemployment assistance or on credit.  In accordance with existing legislation their <Col N="923" /> entitlement to that benefit should be continued. They are now to be ineligible for disability benefit during periods of illness or hospitalisation and they will not be able to draw unemployment benefit if they are not capable of working.  Who will support a worker and his family in such circumstances during the period of incapacity?  The State have opted out by introducing a disastrous new condition which will debar thousands of workers from receiving disability benefit.  Who will support these families and individuals? The health boards have been dealing with supplementary welfare but their budgets are not adequate to deal with the massive cost of subventing disability benefit.</P>
    <P>In line with the approach that schemes should be better targeted, the Government have decided that persons earning in excess of £25,000 will not be entitled to dental or optical treatment.  It may appear that people with such earnings could pay for their dental and optical treatment but the PRSI structure is pay-related and these people have paid for these benefits.  This is regarded by insured workers as the first step towards means testing the contributory record. There was never a means test previously.</P>
    <P>The Government have also stated that they are concerned with recent trends in relation to the claiming of unemployment benefit which is being used to top up voluntary severance payments and early retirement packages.  Measures to control this development are currently being worked out and details are to be announced in the Social Welfare Bill. Decisions with regard to redundancy or early retirement lie entirely in the hands of management.  The worker has no say. He accepts the loss of his job and whatever benefits his trade union may negotiate for him.  Since the introduction of redundancy legislation a period of 15 months on unemployment benefit was allowed, mainly aimed at giving that worker an opportunity to resettle in another job.  Details are skimpy but it would appear that the Government are determined that the lump sum should be <Col N="924" /> adequate compensation and it is unlikely that such people will qualify for unemployment benefit for the usual 15 months.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to cover the four main attacks on social welfare, and these are most serious.  People in the PAYE net make the greatest contribution in terms of taxes.  Now their income from benefits is to be assessible for income tax.  This represents double taxation.  The increase of 4 per cent for such people is unlikely to bring any financial gain.  It will not be payable until the last week in July, while the increases consequent on the budget are already in operation.  At this point the increase for a single person in receipt of social welfare will not purchase a package of 20 cigarettes a week.  The imposition of VAT at a higher rate on a variety of goods in everyday use will more than use up whatever benefits will accrue from the budget.</P>
    <P>In Kerry, there is a frightening volume of stress and trauma arising from the delay in gaining admission to hospital.  It was reported yesterday that the Southern Health Board will require to lay off possibly more than 150 people early this year. This will leave a vacuum.  Their duties and responsibilities will be transferred to other people who are already overburdened due to serious cutbacks and it will not be long before the organisations catering for these people will be forced to take action which nobody wants.  Their position is becoming desperate.  I have a letter from a constituent undergoing renal dialysis, who must travel from Dingle to Cork three days weekly, leaving at 5.30 in the morning and returning at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  I might add that the community in Kerry have subscribed £90,000 for the provision of a dialysis machine.  I implore the Minister to provide the remaining amount for the provision of this machine, thereby saving that man and 13 others the hardship of travelling so far for treatment.</P>
    <P>I shall deal briefly with education and the proposed means-testing of European Social Fund grants.  The excuse being given for the introduction of this means-testing is that many rich people, such as <Col N="925" /> self-employed large farmers and professional people benefit from the scheme. It should be remembered that European Social Fund grants cover certificate and diploma courses only and that, whenever possible, the well-off, to whom I have referred already funnel their children into the professions.  I might add that the duration of the degree courses would not attract the vast majority of European Social Fund course students whose parents are middle income or PAYE workers who generally cannot risk a four-year investment in a university degree course for their children.  For them the European Social Fund affords them a breathing space in that, if their children have proved themselves to diploma level, the parents will have had an opportunity to accumulate a few pounds, possibly paying for a further two years' education.</P>
    <P>The major source of public dissatisfaction with the present means-tested higher education grants is that rich people experience no problem in qualifying for State grants.  Rarely can their income be proven, unlike their PAYE counterparts, whose actual income appears on their form P.60 and who are then assessed on gross income, constituting a grave injustice.  If the self-employed and others experience little difficulty in being means-tested they will not be in any great hurry to avail of European Social Fund grants.  I appeal to the Minister to restore these grants to the category of persons for which they catered, that is the middle income PAYE workers' children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the new Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, on having introduced his first budget, the drafting of which must have been a difficult task since he had not long been in charge of that portfolio. It would appear that the community generally welcome its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget will be viewed, with the benefit of hindsight, as a landmark in economic development, being pro-work, pro-tax reform, socially caring and supportive of investment.  Indeed incentive to work is being restored as is the capacity <Col N="926" /> of employers to remunerate workers without jeopardising their businesses.  The disproportionate burden of taxation being borne by PAYE workers is being alleviated, the necessity for which will be appreciated by everybody.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Policy Review Group, chaired by Mr. Jim Culliton, about which Deputy Brian Hillery has already spoken, found that our pre-budget taxation system contained a multiplicity of reliefs and exemptions without any consistent logic, thereby encouraging nonproductive tax avoidance activities, holding back industrial progress.  The review group concluded that personal taxation was oppressive and unfair, going so far as to say that it stifled enterprise and eroded incentive to work.</P>
    <P>I contend these budgetary provisions are an immediate response to removing obstacles to work in enterprise in that the top rate of income tax has been dramatically reduced to 48 per cent, a full four percentage points lower than the rate prevailing last year.  Not only will it be those paying tax at the top rate who will benefit but also those paying at the standard rate, which has been reduced by two percentage points, with the tax bands being extensively widened so that henceforth we will have a much simpler tax code.  I predict few taxpayers will weep for those affected by the abolition of some tax avoidance schemes which had the effect of increasing the overall taxation burden on the lower and middle income PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that the road to real reform of our taxation system is a long one.  This budget is another positive step in that direction.  This Government have set about remedying the anomalies that have obtained to date.  The key issue in implementing tax reform is the reduction of the lower tax rate to the targeted 25 per cent level along with widening the standard rate income tax band.  I am particularly pleased the Minister did not yield to the pressures on him to reduce relief on mortgage interest payments and VHI premiums, because any such action would have penalised many middle and lower income families.  Everybody in this <Col N="927" /> House will appreciate and recognise the importance people place on owning their homes so that any change in or reduction of the relief for mortgage interest payments could only have led to increased numbers on local authority housing lists nationwide.  I am sure Deputy Dukes, who is present, will readily appreciate the Government's difficulty in endeavouring to house people.  For example, there are 10 houses being handed over today in the town of Kill in my constituency but there were almost 200 people on the waiting list for those houses, an example that will readily demonstrate the difficulties confronting the Government in endeavouring to house people.</P>
    <P>These budgetary provisions will benefit hundreds of thousands of workers, many of whom believed they were being treated unfairly under the tax code despite being in receipt of modest incomes.  The Minister should be congratulated on these provisions which in addition to being pro-work, are pro-employment. The employment subsidy scheme which will benefit 15,000 people and the in-company training scheme, which will benefit 10,000, will be launched very soon.  It should be remembered also that the European Social Fund is to contribute £24 million to the cost of implementation of these schemes.  Everybody recognises and appreciates our huge and persistent unemployment problem, to which there is no simple solution. Indeed its present level of almost 270,000 on the live register is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated much longer.  It is important that the Government create the right climate for the creation of the jobs so badly needed nationwide.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Policy Review Group also found that there were no unused cash reservoirs to be trapped to provide early sustainable jobs, something which, deep in our hearts, we all knew was the case.  As their chairman said, it is indeed time for change, to realise that Governments alone cannot provide permanent secure jobs and a growing standard of living; that borrowing for short term gain carries a huge price tag in terms of high <Col N="928" /> taxation in order to pay its attendant interest bill.  I am delighted that the Government have decided to establish a high level task force, reporting directly to the Taoiseach, to implement the many substantive proposals contained in the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group.  I know the mood is prevalent to take hard decisions in the interests of creating jobs and greater competition.  In this respect the members of that task force can rely on our full support.</P>
    <P>The creation of jobs must remain the Government's main priority.  While these budgetary provisions will directly or indirectly lead to the creation of thousands of jobs, the fact that the European Social Fund is to contribute £24 million to employment schemes must be welcomed also.  I hope that additional moneys from the European Social Fund will be forthcoming in the future, because we must accept that these budgetary provisions will provide only temporary relief for the ever-growing numbers of unemployed persons.  If we are to reduce that unacceptable figure a much more imaginative approach must be adopted.  When one looks at the more successful economies around the world it is obvious they are using their natural resources in a very efficient and effective manner.  In our own little island it is obvious we are not receiving the maximum benefit from our resources.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry, despite major investment in recent years, is largely underdeveloped.  In recent years governments have grant-aided certain industries where the market is saturated.  We have ploughed money into those areas and got very little in return.  Questions were raised in the recent past about our industrial policy and the fact that we are questioning that can only benefit the country in the long term.  We must try to identify the areas where there will be growth, get in early and reap the rewards.  There is a tendency to copy other countries and, unfortunately, when one takes that road it means we are years behind.  It is very difficult to overcome that disadvantage. The fact that all our exports must go by sea or air places additional costs on <Col N="929" /> exporters.  It is vital that we produce top class goods if we are to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>This budget is also a caring budget in that it will increase the spending power of most people on social welfare from July and protect all welfare recipients against inflation.  That is a good thing.  It is in line with the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the tradition of Fianna Fáil.  All social welfare payments have been increased for the fifth year in succession.</P>
    <P>A serious attempt has been made in the budget to reward work and effort. We must all be aware of the large number of people on low pay.  Indeed, the Government have acknowledged this by improving the family income supplement scheme.  Successive Governments have provided significant increases for those on social welfare.  In fact, during the last ten years the real value of long term payments has risen by over 18 per cent while during the same period the real value of dole payments for the long term unemployed has increased by 32 per cent. The Commission on Social Welfare recommended major increases in these areas and while they did not reach the levels recommended by the commission, nevertheless we must accept, when one takes into account the serious financial situation facing our country, the increases were very generous.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, these increases reflect very well the humanity of successive Governments.  However, on closer scrutiny one can see that a major problem is being created.  We are creating a system where some people drawing the dole have more disposable income than some low-paid workers.  If that is allowed to continue it will prove to be a disaster for the country.  It is vital that we restore the incentive to work.  The obvious way to resolve this problem is to cut the burden of tax for those on low pay.  It is bad enough to have to tell almost 270,000 people that there is no work for them but if we have to tell those on low pay that, financially speaking, they would be better off joining the dole queues it will not <Col N="930" /> be long before our unemployment figure reaches 300,000.</P>
    <P>I admit to being somewhat concerned at the slippage in the planned borrowing needs of the Exchequer, £592 million compared with £460 million in 1990.  We all accept that the Government have tackled our national debt in a serious manner.  Despite the economic miracle &mdash; which we on this side of the House tend to call it &mdash; that has occurred since 1987 if we look at the figures we will see that our national debt in 1987 was £23,694 million and in 1990 that figure had risen to over £25 billion.  While we can take great comfort in the fact that the debt is under control, nevertheless it is increasing. If we are to continue spending money at the same rate as we have done over the past few years we will no longer be able to contain the national debt.  The cost of servicing the national debt in 1991 was £2,353 million, and the projected figure for 1992 shows a slight increase. I would like to think that the serious approach we adopted in 1987 will continue. We have reduced borrowing in every budget since 1987 and there should be no weakening of our resolve to keep the national finances on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with some of the items in the budget.  The exemption threshold for capital gains tax has been halved to £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple.  I will be honest and say I was surprised to see this.  Coming from a gambling county like Kildare, I am of the opinion that many people, if they have a few thousand pounds to spare, like to gamble on the Stock Exchange.  This change will reduce the number of people who will be prepared to take such a gamble.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at that. VAT will be increased from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent on telecommunications charges, personal services, repair and maintenance services and adult clothing and footwear.  It may not create too great a burden on families, nevertheless it is an increase which will create difficulty in some quarters.</P>
    <P>In the last few months many people have referred to the various scandals.  I <Col N="931" /> am delighted to note that the Minister and the Government have learned from them and have brought forward measures in the budget to deal with them.  For example, tax relief on loans to buy shares in quoted companies has been abolished and the tax relief for company profit sharing schemes has also been abolished. Those changes are welcome.  There should not be any tears that these reliefs have been abolished.</P>
    <P>Road tax is being increased by 20 per cent.  I am sure the motor industry will not be too happy about that but the price reduction in petrol should offset that.  My profession &mdash; bookmakers &mdash; were not forgotten in the budget.  It may be more difficult for them in the future in that they will have to have a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners to state that their tax affairs are in order when renewing their licence.  The bookmakers are a very noble profession and that should not prove a problem for most of them.</P>
    <P>I expressed concern about our national debt and the way it has increased.  I am concerned also about the proposal to remove tax exemptions from agricultural co-ops.  While it is true that some of the bigger publicly quoted food companies are now little different from private companies the same cannot be said of the small to medium agricultural and fishing co-ops who provide the infrastructure for growth in rural Ireland.  Many of these co-ops estimate that the tax change will cost them the equivalent of 2p per gallon of milk.  It is clear that this will be passed back to farmers who are already under pressure from price cuts and quota reductions.  Many farmers had a difficult year and the future for them does not look very bright either.  Given the proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the fact that the GATT negotiations are ongoing, I am sure many farmers feel they are in a limbo.  This is an issue the Minister could look at again in preparing the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad, too, that the problems facing Teagasc have been recognised in the budget.  The extra £1 million will enable <Col N="932" /> them to put agricultural advisers to work directly with low income farmers who are not in a position to pay fees.  This band of low income farmers were in danger of being completely overlooked and left behind if Teagasc were forced to rely more and more on commercial farmers to collect direct revenue for their advisory services.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is a good, safe budget which has seen the most sweeping reform of the tax system since the introduction of PAYE and which will bring about greater equity and transparency in our society. As I said at the outset, given the commitments contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Minister and the Government did not have an easy job framing and bringing in the budget, but overall the Minister has managed to bring forward and take prudent measures.  While we would all like to see the tax system being reformed, as we can all appreciate this is not something that can be done overnight but rather has to be done gradually and I am delighted we are to continue along that road.</P>
    <P>As I outlined earlier, certain steps are being taken in the budget to restore the incentive to work, and it is vital that it be retained.  As I said, we have unacceptable levels of unemployment and if we fail to restore the incentive to work we will have little hope of reducing the escalating unemployment figure.  I welcome the budget and hope the Minister will be around to bring in many more in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the only Member who has had the experience of getting four budgets through the House.  With all the events on the other side of the House, I think I will hold that record for a good many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all that behind me, I am far from being as starry eyed about this budget as Deputy Power is, but I was glad to hear that he has some worries about it, particularly in relation to what is a very silly proposal on capital gains tax, that is, to remove the difference between long <Col N="933" /> term and short term capital gains, and to a very regressive and unnecessary proposal relating to the taxation of co-operatives. I hope Deputy Power has some success persuading the Minister to change his mind and I would be delighted, both as a constituency colleague and as somebody who shares his worries, to help him persuade the Minister to see the light.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If pressed enough, the Minister will talk about it in public; he seems to talk about everything else in public as well.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed but not surprised to see Deputy Hillery acting as if history began in 1987.  That is a popular canard circulated by Fianna Fáil Deputies, and perpetuated by our absent friends in the gallery who are all no doubt glued to their monitors &mdash; if their fried eggs are not getting in the way at this time of the evening.  I would like to remind Deputy Hillery and others on that side what happened before 1987.  They may have forgotten, for example, that by the end of 1982 inflation was running at 20 per cent, but by the end of 1986 it had been brought down to 3 per cent; by the end of 1982 the Exchequer borrowing requirement was heading for 21 per cent or one-fifth of GNP, but, again, by the end of 1986 it had been brought down to a still very worrying figure, but a much less disastrous one of around 13 per cent and heading down.  During that period, from 1982 to 1987, we saw the beginning of external surpluses which Deputy Hillery seems to think started in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are some grounds for feeling progress was made since 1987, it could not have been made without the action taken between 1982 and 1987.  This year's budget gives me no confidence that the Government have the understanding of the social and economic imperatives of public policy that is required to continue that process.  Neither does the budget give me any confidence that the Government are prepared or able to act in a way which responds adequately to the need <Col N="934" /> for enlightened policies which are the only way of liberating public policy for the large scale pre-emption involved in the level of foreign debt interest payments we now have to make.  There is nothing in the budget which gives me any confidence that progress will be made on that matter, in fact quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>The reactions of the major economic interest groups to this year's budget have been very interesting.  They have all had polite and positive things to say about some aspects of the budget but the interesting thing is &mdash; and they all have this in common &mdash; they all felt it necessary to add a rider &mdash; they are all worried that the Government have lost their commitment to restoring financial stability and fiscal commonsense.  They all see in this budget, after the experience of 1991, yet another loosening of the Government's grip on that necessary reality and an absence of any evidence that the Government have any concrete, not to speak of creative, approach to what is now a deeply worrying structural problem in the public finances.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding, the people who suffer most from serious structural problems in our public finances are not the economists, the gurus or the commentators Fianna Fáil and the press used love to hate but rather the people on social welfare, the children in overcrowded classrooms and the people waiting to get into hospital.  Those are the people who suffer and who will suffer as a result of the Government losing their grip on the need to maintain financial commonsense and stability.</P>
    <P>One firm of stockbrokers who are usually not given to very extravagant language published their budget newsletter which they called &ldquo;Budget 92 &mdash; Botched Tax Reform&rdquo;.  I have to agree with that.  I will not name the firm concerned because they might think I am singling them out for some particularly bad form of treatment but those who read about these matters will know about whom I am talking.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Major Religious Superiors &mdash; the organisation the Taoiseach likes to distrust; remember he said <Col N="935" /> he does not like organisations who have in their name the words &ldquo;major&rdquo; or &ldquo;superior&rdquo;, he thinks those adjectives ought to be reserved for himself &mdash; in recent years put a lot of work into thinking about public policy and making recommendations as to where the priorities should lie within the financial parameters. What did they say about this year's budget?  They said, and I quote from their budget reaction &ldquo;the 1992 budget fell well short of the structural reform needed; it was neither integrated nor comprehensive&rdquo;.  That is a fair and perhaps over-restrained comment on this year's budget.</P>
    <P>The 1991 budget which was introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, was a phoney.  That budget juggled with the delays in payments from EC funds, £110 million, and the proceeds from the Irish Life privatisation, £65 million.  By juggling with these figures, Deputy Reynolds partially concealed what was in fact a very substantial increase in the Exchequer borrowing requirement last year.  There are no two ways about it, he used these figures to conceal the fact that he was setting out, quite deliberately, to increase the Exchequer borrowing requirement over what it would have been if he had not taken any action.  He compounded the illusion by making the totally unjustifiable prediction that unemployment in 1991 would fall by 9,000.  We all know that that was not what happened.</P>
    <P>In mid-year the Government talked up a phoney crisis, letting us all feel that expenditure had got badly out of control and we had dark mutterings about the need for cutbacks and so on.  That was done as an excuse for a number of very timid steps to reduce an emerging overrun on the current defict and on the borrowing requirement.  It is a sad reflection on the quality of much of the political comment in our media that when the final outturn turned out to be only a little more awful than the budget projections, the media congratulated the Government on having saved us from a disaster.  That was <Col N="936" /> quite clever on the part of the Government, they talked up a crisis in the middle of the year, did a few little thing here and there to take the edge off it and were congratulated at the end because they brought the country into a disaster rather than a cataclysm.  The Government have had a substantial degree of success in getting across that kind of thing and I fault the media &mdash; and many commentators &mdash; for falling for this kind of trick-o-the-loop prestidigitation which has been practised in recent years.</P>
    <P>This year's budget is not one bit better. The much vaunted tax reform is nothing more than a failure to grasp the real issues of reform.  There is almost a bewildering array of measures dealing with the taxation of motor vehicles and motoring, one of the effects of which, for example, will be to make transport or our exports more expensive &mdash; indeed they will hinder our exporters in their efforts.  Last night a haulier told me that the effect of the budget measures will be to increase the road tax on each of his units by £250. I do not know what the Government think that will do for our exports; I know it will make services more expensive for people who are trying to provide employment.</P>
    <P>The Government have resorted again this year to the old expedient of putting off yet more pay increases to some future year in the vague and forlorn hope that something will turn up.  The budget leaves a whole series of expenditure issues unresolved, quite apart from the public pay issues.  For example, farmers are owed £12 million in headage payments, which is dealt with in the Minister's speech under the heading &ldquo;Aids to farmers in certain less favoured areas&rdquo;. Every farmer these days is in a less favoured area.  What do the Government propose to do in regard to the money owed to them?  They propose to give them £2 million this year as an initial instalment but there is no indication when they will get the rest.  It is a real case of live horse and get grass.</P>
    <P>Equal treatment of women in matters of social welfare is another area where decisions have been postponed.  There <Col N="937" /> are potentially 40,000 women who are entitled to payments on foot of recent court decisions; the Minister for Finance is making a provision of £22 million this year and my information is that that will cover 4,000 to 5,000 women to whom payments are outstanding.  He went on to say that further &ldquo;significant payments&rdquo; would be made in 1993 and 1994 but he did not say what those payments would be, nor did he say whether they will amount to the full total of what falls to be paid out.  If they do not amount to the full total, he has not given an indication of how long it will be before these full payments are made; it is another case of live horse and get grass.</P>
    <P>The Minister on budget day informed us, apparently without really understanding the gravity of what he was saying, that the ending of the payment of VAT at the point of entry on imports from other European Community member states next year will entail a cash flow loss to the Exchequer of £200 million. It is not just a cash flow loss, it is a loss of £200 million to the Exchequer and no matter how many amateur accountants like the Minister call it a cash flow loss, it is revenue which they will not have.  So far, the Minister tells us he has no idea how he will deal with this problem.  We can only await the announcement of details in the Finance Bill with some considerable trepidation. Here we see one of Fianna Fáil's desperate stratagems in March 1982 coming back to haunt us.  VAT at the point of entry was introduced in 1982 to avoid any difficult decisions in other areas of taxation.  As I said, it is now returning to haunt the Government, next year it will be a millstone round their necks and, even more important, it will be a millstone round the taxpayers' necks because measures will have to be taken next year to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It seems the Government have decided to charge the banks for cash escorts provided by the Garda and the Army.  The Government decided to do this in the interests of public security, the banks did not ask for it as they are insured. However, the Minister said he will get £2 <Col N="938" /> million from the banks this year; reading between the lines I gather that has not been agreed and if that is the case what will the Minister do about it?  If that contribution is not forthcoming, what will he do?  I wonder.  It is dishonest to put a figure &mdash; even though it is only £2 million &mdash; in the budget when the Minister does not know if he can deliver on it.  Mind you, that pales into insignificance beside the fictitious figure of £45 million which the Minister has built in for improved tax collection.  I will believe it when I see it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach presided over a phoney budget in 1981 which compounded the gross error made in 1977.  It seems that he will now hand over to the author of the phoney budget of 1991, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who, if we are to believe what we are told, has a sweetheart deal on a dream ticket with the author of the 1992 phoney budget.  It seems &mdash; I regret to say it &mdash; that the restoration of economic common sense which was in political terms, probably the main achievement of Deputy Garret FitzGerald's Government between 1982 and 1987 and which was carried on up to 1989 because of a very enlightened policy in Opposition by my party, is now rapidly being frittered away.  This abandonment of common sense, this retreat from reality, is now being supported by the Progressive Democrats whose only apparent reward from this year's budget is, in the words of very respectable stockbrokers, a botched tax reform which does precious little for families on low incomes and virtually nothing for young people in the early years of their working lives.</P>
    <P>I have looked through the budget to try to determine its effect on the pockets of ordinary people.  On the revenue side I have added up the income tax measures, the flat rate VAT refunds to farmers, excise reductions on cars and petrol and so on.  Then I added up the bewildering array of tax measures on the other side, all these things that are supposed to broaden the tax base but which do not. The net effect of the conglomeration of measures on the revenue and the expenditure sides means that the Government, by these decisions, are giving back this <Col N="939" /> year £68 million more than they are taking from people.  This amounts to approximately £20 per head of the population or approximately £60 per taxpayer. The Government can hardly expect that to have any fundamental effect on the economy.  When one looks at the expenditure commitments which have been postponed from this year to future years &mdash; the rest of the equal treatment cost, the rest of the headage payments for farmers, the rest of the public pay commitments, etc. &mdash; one can see that this year's budget will not make any difference whatever even in the short term to the course of Irish economic development or to the well-being of the Irish taxpayer or citizen.</P>
    <P>The changes in the income tax system have been very badly judged.  To put it at its simplest, the Government would have achieved a much more equitable change in our tax system, a much more equitable redistribution of the tax burden, if the money which is being used to reduce the higher rate this year was instead used to widen further the standard rate tax band.  This, of course, would have reduced the gain for top rate taxpayers but it would have improved the position for families on low incomes and single people.  There is no doubt in my mind where the priority lies between those two groups.  A few examples from the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> will show this.</P>
    <P>A single person on £5,500 a year &mdash; a modest enough income &mdash; will gain £46.28p under this budget whereas a single person who earns £25,000 a year &mdash; and I am glad to say there are some people who earn this amount &mdash; will gain £777.  A married couple without children, with both spouses earning, on a modest income of £11,000 a year between them will gain £92.56 under the budget whereas a couple earning £30,000 &mdash; and I am glad to say there are a number of these people &mdash; will gain £754.  It is clear that if the Government wanted to deal with the problem of the tax wedge where it really bites they should have done more for the people at the lower end of the <Col N="940" /> income tax scale.  That is what stockbrokers mean when they say this tax reform was botched.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to go into the VAT changes but I think it is enough to say that the Government have not used the changes in the VAT system this year to reduce the standard rate; rather it has been hijacked to give us this trick-o-the-loop reform of the income tax system. The Government have made the system more regressive.  Deputy Power should look again at the list of items which will be subject to the new 16.5 per cent tax rate.  If he does this he will find that they will bear more heavily on the lower income groups.  This is a regressive change in our VAT system.  I feel sorry for retailers because after a number of years &mdash; and I introduced budgets in the House for four of those years &mdash; when Fine Gael tried to simplify the system by reducing the number of rates the Government have added another rate this year. This will lead to more pain, worry and work for ordinary retailers who sell a wide range of products.</P>
    <P>On all of those counts and indeed others I regard this budget as a further retreat from economic and fiscal reality. It is a very depressing omen for the future.  Fianna Fail's dream ticket &mdash; the Taoiseach we are about to have and the Finance Minister we will continue to have, God help us &mdash; will turn out to be a nightmare for Irish people.  What it consists of is an unholy alliance of two spendthrift illusionists supported by a bunch of spineless moralisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes said that last year the Government talked the country into a crisis mid-year.  However, his party have been talking us into a crisis since 1987 and they actually put us in a crisis between 1982 and 1987.  In practically every budget debate in which he has spoken Deputy Dukes has accused this side of the House of starting their history in 1987.  The history of his party seems to stop at 1982 all the time.  I should like to point out that a number of problems, including a doubling of our <Col N="941" /> national debt, arose in the period 1982-87, a period during which he proudly claimed to have been Finance Minister for four years.  As I said, Deputy Dukes spoke today about the Government last year talking us into a crisis mid-year. During the budget debate last year and afterwards members of Fine Gael said we were in a crisis and that it was going to deepen.  Yet, when the Government started talking about difficulties that might arise mid-year, lo and behold Deputy Dukes started blaming the Government for talking about a crisis.</P>
      <P>I find it hard to accept his comment on the policy of &ldquo;live horse and get grass&rdquo;. He referred to the equality directive and the postponement by the Minister of a portion of the payments under that directive to 1993-94.  I need hardly remind the Deputy that the reason the payments have to be made now is because of the failure of his party when they were in Government between 1984 and 1986 to implement the equal treatment directive.</P>
      <P>I wish to make some general points.  I am still surprised at the number of people who refer to how little they get from the budget as if in the dim and distant past Governments handed our largesse in every budget.  I thought people would have realised by now that the days of handouts are long gone.  People have the impression &mdash; although I cannot remember it happening that often &mdash; that the Govenment handed out many goodies, so to speak, in budgets.  As I said, those days are long gone.  While people now have a more realistic attitude to the budget, as I said I am surprised at the number of people &mdash; some of whom are Members of this House &mdash; who expect the Government to hand out more money on budget day.  I think most people realise that the money given out by the Government is taxpayer's money, that the Government do not produce it from nowhere and hand it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think most people also realise there will be no extra money for anyone unless it comes from extra taxation, a reduction in expenditure in other areas or extra borrowing.  Those options have been narrowed down considerably during the past <Col N="942" /> number of years.  Most people accept that all the Government can do with the taxation system is to try to remove some of the anomalies, broaden the base a bit more and ensure that those who have wealth are not able to fiddle the system and thereby avoid paying their fair share of taxation.  The various measures announced by the Minister will go some of the way towards redressing the balance in favour of the ordinary PAYE worker who has no means of escape from the taxation system, the person whose tax is taken from him before he receives his pay packet.  This budget will be a first step towards ensuring that people who can well afford to pay and who avoid doing so pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation the one feature of the budget I welcome is that mortgage relief was left untouched.  Various changes were mentioned but would have sent out the wrong signals to young people. There would have been cries from all sides of the House that it was wrong and that it was another attack on young people.  It would be said that when the Government could not get rid of the people through emigration and could not provide jobs for them they were going to ensure that they would not be able to provide their own houses.  The effect of a reduction in mortgage relief would have been devastating for young people, particularly for the less well off who, over the last three years, as a result of Fianna Fáil's tenant purchase scheme, were able to purchase their houses at very reduced rates &mdash; the so-called sale of the century of a few years ago.  Commentators who say it is not equitable to have mortgage relief and that if people can afford to buy houses the Sate should not subsidise their mortgage repayments are out of touch with the ordinary people of the country who try to provide for themselves.  Our record of home ownership is one of which we should be very proud and one which every Government should endeavour to maintain, and mortgage relief is one of the major ways of doing that.</P>
    <P>I know there are financial arguments for altering or removing mortgage relief but the social reasons for maintaining it <Col N="943" /> and, if the economic climate was right, increasing it, are much stronger.  If Ireland was to be treated, as some commentators suggest, as a limited company trying to make a profit, and to hell with the social consequences, mortgage relief could be dispensed with and money could be saved, but luckily Governments and I include all Governments in this &mdash; have always been aware of the social dimensions of this policy, and I hope it will be maintained.  It is important for people who are willing to help themselves that the State should, particularly in an area of high expenditure such as this, put forward and maintain policies to help them to do so.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism that the higher rate of taxation was reduced by 4 per cent while the standard rate was reduced by only 2 per cent.  It is important to point out that the Government's targets in reducing income tax are for a higher rate of 44 per cent and a lower rate of 25 per cent.  The reduction this year of 4 per cent in the higher rate and 2 per cent in the lower rate goes half way towards achieving that aim within the lifetime of this Government.  The widening of the standard rate tax band is much more important than reducing the income tax rate by 2 per cent or 3 per cent as we have been doing, because it prevents people getting caught in the poverty trap about which we hear so much.  That is a move that should be continued in future budgets.</P>
    <P>In the mid-eighties a single person on an income of just over £10,000 paid tax at 65 per cent, but much has changed since.  The people who criticise the Government for reducing the higher rate of tax to 48 per cent would do well to remember that a huge percentage of single PAYE workers have to pay tax at that rate at a very early stage and it does not encourage savings, investments or house ownership.  The Government should continue along those lines in future years.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the reduction of the higher rate of tax is unjustified in that most of the reduction has been paid for <Col N="944" /> by removing tax reliefs, tax shelters and other means whereby people on higher incomes avoid paying tax and also by the reduction of the threshold for residential property tax.  The claims that many people on the higher rate of tax will be better off while the people on the lower rate will be only marginally better off do not hold water when you take account of the overall tax package and the changes in shelters and reliefs.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody was happy with the increase in the lower VAT rate of 16 per cent.  However the Minister deserves the thanks of everybody in this House for granting a VAT-free status to donated medical equipment.  All of us are aware of voluntary groups and organisations who have come together in various areas to raise money to purchase medical equipment for hospitals and health boards.  In my constituency of County Meath there are many fine examples of such organisations. Two of the best known, to whom I pay tribute, are the Committee for the Friends of Our Lady's Hospital who have purchased thousands of pounds worth of equipment for the hospital and have helped to provide machinery and equipment that probably would not have been provided for some time, and the ICA who a number of years ago set about purchasing equipment and persuading the health board to set up a mammography unit in the hospital in Navan. They raised £80,000 in three or four years towards that end, convinced the health board that the unit was necessary and had a relatively easy job convincing the then Minister for Health, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, to provide extra finance.  In all, about £100,000 was collected, and it is a pity that after making such voluntary efforts, at the end of the day tax had to be paid on this money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the non-pay elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in regard to education will be implemented fully. Recently the question of the pupil-teacher ratio, the provision of caretakers and secretarial assistants and the appointment of career guidance teachers arose and I am glad the commitments given in <Col N="945" /> regard to them will be honoured.  Indeed, this will be welcomed by all involved in education.  May I add that the recent Fine Gael statements on the provision of career guidance in our secondary schools were most welcome.  I am delighted they are taking up the calls I made over the last number of years.  I cannot help but remind them that in the early eighties they issued a policy document which underlined the importance of career guidance and counselling services in second level schools &mdash; a very important issue in this day and age &mdash; but when a Fine Gael Minister for Education got her hands on the finances she decimated the career guidance and counselling services in 1984 and 1985.  The services were wiped out in smaller schools.  Career guidance and counselling are most important.  Indeed, the counselling service needs to be emphasised as much as the career guidance service.  Some young people have to deal with the additional pressures of broken homes and problems in the marriage of their parents.  I hope the commitment given will be fully honoured by the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the measures affecting the family.  The family enjoys a special place in our Constitution.  We often pay lip-service to this in the House but do very little by way of introducing practical measures.  In this budget, however, as in previous budgets, some attempt has been made to put some measures into effect.  Provision has been made for short term social welfare increases, for FIS increases and to provide for leave for adoptive mothers.  This should be of benefit to families. However, I would like to see some special help being made available where one spouse, husband or wife, remains at home with young children.  It is ironic that we give a tax free and PRSI allowance for both spouses who go out to work but there is no recognition of the sacrifice made by the spouse who chooses to remain at home or the hardship that decision might entail.  I know that many go out to work by choice and they are entitled to do so but the parent who wishes to stay at home should also receive <Col N="946" /> some help and encouragement from the State.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his budget and, more particularly, on his appointment as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the £12 million promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to farmers in disadvantaged areas for 1991.  It will be a great disappointment that this money which was to be made available by way of increased headage payments was not disbursed in 1991.  According to the Budget Statement only £2 million of the £12 million will be distributed in 1992 with the remaining £10 million being deferred until 1993 and 1994.  Will it ever be paid?</P>
      <P>Implicit in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was the commitment that the £12 million would be paid in 1991.  Many people made plans on the basis of an increase in headage payments and, therefore, increased income.  They will not get the increase this year and they will only get a partial increase next year with a hope of getting the remainder in 1994.  We are well behind other EC countries when it comes to the level of headage payments.  It is unforgivable that the Government reneged on the promise given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on headage payments.</P>
      <P>I do not think urban dwellers realise the significance of headage payments, and other subsidies, to farmers.  It is not just the case that small farmers need the subsidy but medium sized farmers, and in some cases quite large farmers, need the subsidies to survive.  Farm income has deteriorated so seriously that headage payments and subsidies constitute a significant proportion of many farmers' income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a number of specific points with regard to the headage payments and subsidies.  First, they should be paid in a structured way.  The present hit and miss method is intolerable.  I know farmers who were virtually destitute &mdash; many were actually destitute coming up <Col N="947" /> to Christmas&mdash;awaiting payments which had been promised for months.  Repeatedly, we have to table questions to try to find out when they will be paid, if ever. Quite often, the payments are three and up to six months late.  How can any farmer run a business or organise a household when that is happening.</P>
    <P>These payments are similar to social welfare payments; they are the basic part of many farmers' incomes.  There should be a specific arrangement whereby recipients know when they will be paid and the amount.  I will go so far as to suggest that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, set up a monitoring committee, consisting of representatives of the main farm organisations and officials of their Departments to keep people informed. The feeling is that payments are being deliberately withheld in order to swell the coffers of the Exchequer.  It is not right that people should suffer because of maladministration or whatever.  It is not just good enough.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the beef premium which was introduced in 1987.  I was responsible for getting that concession from the EC. The Italians and the Greeks were being given that concession as a sop in very protracted negotiations and we demanded that Ireland get a similar type premium.  People are being disqualified left right and centre on technicalities. It is a damn disgrace that they are not receiving that premium.  It is no good saying the farmers are in breach of EC regulations.  I am sure the Italians, in particular, do not disqualify their farmers, they make arrangements where the forms that are submitted can be corrected. However, there seems to be no such mechanism in this country.  It is about time we set out to help people rather than injure, prosecute or discriminate against them.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy in terms of farm incomes, employment in associated industries and exports, totally rejects the proposals of the EC Commission on Agriculture which, if implemented, would seriously erode our benefits from the Common Agricultural Policy, and which, taken in conjunction with the trend of the GATT negotiations, would seriously damage the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>The political turmoil of recent months has taken the focus off the very major economic difficulties confronting the country.  Nowhere is this more evident than in agriculture.  We are facing the most critical period since our entry into the European Community in terms of the talks involving reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and of the GATT negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the Government have shown no leadership or initiative on these most serious of issues to the extent that the outgoing Taoiseach has not seen fit to raise our grave concern at the thrust of the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals at any of the EC Heads of State meetings since the reforms were first mooted, and that includes the Maastricht Summit.  By my estimation, there have been three summit meetings since the leaking of the Common Agricultural Policy proposals.  After much badgering by me in the House, the Taoiseach came <Col N="949" /> back and said he had raised the issue at the summit of June 1991.  There is no record in the minutes of the June summit of Heads of State that the issue was raised at all.  Far from making an issue of the Irish case, our dependence on agriculture and the importance of agriculture to the nation's economy, the issue has not been raised effectively at a summit meeting. If implemented, the proposals will devastate this country's economy.</P>
    <P>The present position is very different from that under Deputy Haughey's predecessor, Deputy Garret FitzGerald. When there was a lesser issue to debate, such as the milk quota, it was top of the agenda at a succession of EC summit meetings and as a result Ireland received major concessions.</P>
    <P>Now we face an issue that is fundamentally damaging to the structure of not only the agricultural economy but also the country's economy, and that issue is not even raised officially. Deputies asked repeatedly in the House that the matter be included on the agenda for successive summit meetings but, obviously, it was not included.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, peace and rest when he retires on Thursday, but I would be failing in my duty if I were not to say he has failed miserably to highlight our predicament. I say to the Taoiseach's successor and to the incoming Government that the issue must be highlighted: we are equal partners in Europe.  How could a man who can treat his contemporaries in his own party with such comtempt fail to take on the other Heads of State in Europe at summit meetings?  That question defies understanding, or perhaps it does not; perhaps there is a simple explanation. The Irish Government should have taken a stand on the issue at one or all of the most recent three summits.</P>
    <P>So far as support for the less well off countries is concerned &mdash; I think the word used is cohesion &mdash; the running in recent months has been made by the Spaniards, the Portuguese and the Greeks, all of whom have indicated that they will invoke the veto if the proposals put forward do not protect their vital national <Col N="950" /> interests.  What has Ireland been seen to do?  We have been seen to hang on to the coat-tails of those countries, although our interests and those of the other three countries I have mentioned are often diametrically opposite.  Ireland has not put down a marker that we will not accept fundamental changes in the Common Agricultural Policy that will damage our economy.  That is the essence of the matter.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Fine Gael Party demanded that the Government to be nominated on Thursday next put down that marker. We will not have a continuation of the present position.  By coincidence, Thursday happens to be the eve of the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, in which the protection of Ireland's rights as outlined in the Treaty of Rome is very indefinite.</P>
    <P>The best speech made in the House in 1991, irrespective of party affiliations, was by the leader of our party, Deputy John Bruton, on the outcome of the Maastricht Treaty but sad to relate, that speech was very poorly reported and commented on.  The whole matter was a little too complex for the pundits to understand, and it is a reflection on them that they could not grasp it.  The only commentator I know of who demonstrated his ability to grasp the issues involved, to realise their impact and to comment on them was Stephen Collins, the political correspondent of <i>The Sunday Press.</i>  Everyone else seemed to be interested only in catch cries, backbiting and mud-slinging.  A magnificently constructive speech that spelled out the dangers inherent in the Maastricht Summit was not reported in the manner it deserved.  That was alarming, and made me wonder whether all the Irish news media had become comparable with the tabloid press in Britain.  Our news reporting seemed to be based on sensationalism rather than facts.  It is particularly worrying that substance does not seem to matter any more.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the issue of the veto.  The Spaniards in particular were adamant in the run-up to the Maastricht Summit that if the eventual agreement &mdash; if it could be called an agreement, <Col N="951" /> because they would not agree with it &mdash; contained proposals with which they did not concur, they would use the veto.  The Portuguese and the Greeks also stated strongly that they would use the veto. When I questioned the Taoiseach in the House eight or nine months ago about the use of the veto on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, he had the audacity to reply that he did not think the veto had any relevance in this day and age, if it ever had.  The Taoiseach did not think the veto had any relevance, yet the Spaniards, the Greeks and the Porguguese were letting everyone know that if the proposals put forward at the Maastricht Summit were damaging to their national interests, they would use the veto.</P>
    <P>Our Taoiseach announced here publicly that he did not recognise any merit in the veto &mdash; what a way to negotiate, what a way to meet our counterparts in Europe.  The Taoiseach was showing the white feather before leaving this country's shores.  That is not the way to get concessions in Europe.  We have to fight our corner to the ultimate; to give away our negotiating stance by saying we will not invoke the veto is not good enough.  It is clear the eventual outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations will be tremendously damaging to this country unless there is a new urgency and emphasis on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Renationalisation of agriculture is the order of the day where many countries of northern Europe are concerned.  The Germans, French, British, Danes and the Dutch will financially assist their own farmers in producing the products we produce, such as milk and beef, to the detriment of our farmers and to the delight of the Mediterranean countries who will see more money for their producers becoming available.  The tragedy is that we are not in a financial position to subsidise our farmers in a realistic manner.  That is the grim reality. Renationalisation is slowly and surely taking place.  For those who do not understand the term &ldquo;renationalisation&rdquo; it <Col N="952" /> means that we will go back to the situation that existed before we joined the EC, and before the EC was created.  The countries with strong economies based on industrialisation can afford to subsidise their own farmers.  We cannot because we do not have that industrial base.</P>
    <P>The Germans in particular who have been the paymasters of the European Community prefer nowadays to finance their brothers from the former East Germany and their neighbours who have large ethnic German populations, for instance, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia, to name a few.  As we learn more about the Soviet republics we find there are German ethnic connections there as well.  The Germans will spread their money among their own.</P>
    <P>We had the benefit of membership of the EC and the financial gains that came with it for 19 years but we have not been particularly diligent in using the moneys we got from Europe.  Now we will find it difficult to exist unless we can make a stand where it counts, at the negotiating table whether in Brussels or more likely at the heads of state summits.  That is where we put down our marker, where we let them know what we want and that we will not take anything less than a fair deal.  We must get a fair deal.  If intervention and export refunds are eliminated or dramatically reduced over the next six or seven years there will be a massive drop in farm incomes here resulting in an enormous loss to the economy. Everybody will suffer, not just the farming community.  The associated industries who service the agricultural industry will suffer.  Every sector will feel the effects. We must ensure that the supports we have been used to are not removed overnight, that we are given a chance to build up our food industry and to ensure we can sell everything we can produce on the open market.</P>
    <P>The prices of milk products and beef are under serious attack through the weakening of the price support system, particularly intervention.  We must be given exemption from such cuts until we can diversify into production systems <Col N="953" /> where we can produce products that can be sold on the open market without subsidisation. The loss of our meat markets in the Middle East and in North Africa have seriously affected our agricultural economy as sales to those countries are aided by export refunds from the EC.  A most graphic illustration of this is seen in a report published yesterday by the National Food Council which shows a drop of £300 million in the value of our agricultural exports in 1990.  The report commented that that downward trend in the value of our agricultural exports was continuing in 1991.  These are the latest figures available.  Deputy Walsh as Minister for Food should be very concerned at that alarming report.  With such a drop in the value of our agricultural exports in 1990 what will happen if the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals come into being?  We are at the very beginning of the cuts.  They have been minor.  They are like flea bites.  Wait until they really take effect.  Of course, it is the job of Government to ensure that does not happen, that the cuts will not be allowed to be implemented where we are concerned.  Much of the fault lies with ourselves but two wrongs do not make a right.  We must be given a chance to put our house in order, to get away from our dependency on subsidies, whether intervention or export refunds.</P>
    <P>Commissioner MacSharry has been making a big issue out of payments of compensation to farmers who are forced to produce less and who are to be paid less for their produce.  The Commissioner has been constantly talking about compensation and has been backed up by MEPs Mark Killilea and Paddy Lane, <i>ad infinitum.</i>  They have said there will be no problem, that farmers will be better off with the compensation they receive. However, I have not heard much about that since a bombshell was dropped before Christmas and not many people here realise the implications of that bombshell.  It now transpires that the GATT negotiations which supersede the EC in importance in the world ranking can deem compensatory payments to be illegal, to constitute unfair competition. <Col N="954" /> What a calamity it would have been if the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals had been agreed on the basis of compensatory payments and then we found that compensatory payments were illegal.  We would end up with nothing. It is essential that the GATT negotiations be concluded before the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy takes place, otherwise we could be penalised on the double.  What I have said is probably an understatement &mdash; we could be devastated.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the GATT negotiations will conclude within the next few months, as people in Brussels, including Commissioner MacSharry, Commissioner Andriessen and the President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, are saying.  It is my view that the GATT negotiations will drag on until after the American presidential election in ten months' time.  President Bush two weeks ago made a fairly major speech indicating that he would demand that the EC abolish all their subsidies, particularly intervention and export refunds.  He is a politician like the rest of us and he is under serious threat.  Opinion polls indicate that he will have a very difficult job gaining re-election.  He is playing the farming lobby in the United States, which is not inconsiderable.  We can be sure that he will not allow negotiations which might make him look foolish and weak to conclude before the presidential election. If the GATT negotiations were to conclude before that election it would mean trouble for us.  If the outcome was good for the United States it would be pretty awful not just for the EC but for Ireland, the weak ones in he EC.  We are dealing in the same products, grain, beef and milk.</P>
    <P>Commissioner MacSharry needs to qualify his statements.  He and the two MEPs, Mr. Killilea and Mr. Lane, must not walk us into a trap which would cost us billions every year.  We were on the verge of it before the enlightened statement from Brussels just before Christmas.  Now it transpires that it may not be possible to pay compensatory <Col N="955" /> amounts because it might be in contravention of GATT trading rules.  Our objectives must be to become self-dependent and to sell everything we produce within the EC at the going rate.  We must not depend on subsidies and/or compensation. Our objective should be to get rid of our dependance on subsidies, be they intervention or export refunds, and to sell all our produce in the EC marketplace, which has a population of 320 million.  We have free access to a market of that size although we are a nation of only 3.5 million.</P>
    <P>An outsider looking at this objectively would be absolutely amazed that a country producing food of the highest quality could not sell into a market of 350 million people.  It defies understanding or explanation.  At present over 50 per cent of our milk products go into intervention storage and over 40 per cent of our beef production goes into cold storage intervention. Those products are held for a certain time, perhaps three years, based on the opinion of the experts as to their healthy lifetime, and are then sold off to the Russians or to countries in the Middle East or in the Caribbean and in Central and Southern America.  The price is usually 10p a pound and one is doing well to get 20p or 25p a pound.  The initial cost was 100p a pound and the storage cost 50p or 60p a pound.  It is an enormous drain on the Community's budget and we are largely responsible for that cost. Unless we show a willingness to change our methods and produce things we can sell, for example, soft cheese, we will not get much sympathy.  We must show resolve and determination to do things right, which we have not been doing for 19 years.</P>
    <P>We must not fool ourselves into thinking that getting rid of the EC food mountains in the form of food aid to Russia and third countries will solve the general problem of surpluses within the Community. It is an illusion we would be wise to rid ourselves of.  While it is a very laudable gesture to give all this food for nothing or for very little, it may well be a once-off occurrence.  In the long run <Col N="956" /> the former Communist countries will not be just self-sufficient but probably exporters of milk and beef products. Most if not all of those countries will become EC members and will be able to sell into the EC legally, rather than illegally as at present and distorting the market.  The present arrangement may look attractive.  We are giving them food because they are in dire straits, but within a few years the Russians and the East Europeans will be trading with the best. They are very resilient people.</P>
    <P>If the Middle East and North African markets for beef become available again, as I hope they do, there is no certainty that we will be able to compete even with the aid of export refunds.  My information is that the Australians and the South Americans, particularly the Brazilians and the Argentinians, are selling into those countries at extremely competitive rates.  I am told that even with the aid of EC export refunds we may find it extremely difficult to compete in those markets.  I do not wish to be alarmist by referring to a most unwelcome development in recent months.  It was reported at the weekend that we have had two further outbreaks of BSE in Kerry and Cork.  That type of occurrence is most unfortunate.  It is one of those freak incidences and nobody is to blame, but it could set back the date for reopening those valuable markets in Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Libya.</P>
    <P>We agree that the Common Agricultural Policy must be reformed and while we may suffer some hurt in the process we must determine to play a major role in shaping the manner of the reforms.  We cannot just be spectators taking a back seat and getting pushed around.  We must be there calling the shots.  We cannot allow abuses of the system and other anomalies to continue here or in the rest of the Community. The Common Agricultural Policy has a bad name because of abuses, some of which have occurred in this country and are probably being investigated.  Abuses have been going on since the foundation of the EC in much larger countries and to a much greater degree.  Fiddles in <Col N="957" /> places like Italy are beyond our comprehension but they are industries in themselves.  The bottom line is that we are equal partners of the European Community. Let us assert ourselves as never before.  Otherwise our agricultural industry and economy as a whole will have a terribly bleak future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the motion tabled by Deputy Deasy and compliment him on his excellent contribution which I hope will not have fallen on deaf ears. I welcome the presence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, his Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh, and Deputy Leonard.  Perhaps at long last the message about the depression obtaining within agriculture generally has been received or is it the case that they have been so preoccupied over the past two years with turmoil within their party that they have overlooked what has been taking place?  I hope the problems obtaining will be resolved once and for all and that the Government and Ministers will begin to deal with the mainstay of our economy, the agricultural industry, and its attendant problems.  Agriculture has a major role to play but it is in a desperate state at present with many farming families on the breadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that those sitting on the opposite benches also receive the type of telephone calls I and my colleagues here do from farmers and their wives, from single farmers who had expected to receive their headage payments within the calendar year ended 31 December last, whereas six weeks later they are given no idea when they will be paid.  Is this fair for people who had expected reasonably-sized cheques in order to settle their accounts, something most rural people like to do?  Those headage payments were to form part of their income for that year, something with which Deputy Deasy dealt earlier in his budgetary contribution.  It must be re-emphasised that the Government have reneged on their promise to our farmers of an increased headage payment to be made on the due date.  I might draw the attention of the House to the fact that if <Col N="958" /> payment is overdue on other aspects of revenue collection interest is charged. Surely what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?  Therefore, I recommend that, when making these headage payments in ensuing months, the Government pay interest theron.</P>
    <P>My information from headage grant offices is that the final payments will not be delivered for at least another two months, which is not acceptable.  After all it is an EC proposal, EC money, involving reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which was intended to help strengthen dwindling farm incomes brought about solely by the neglect of the people opposite, particularly on the part of the former Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I cannot blame the present Minister but, if he remains in that portfolio next week, he will have to pull up his socks and will have a tremendous amount of work to tackle.  It is not sufficient to give our farmers token aspirations at present because there is real work to be undertaken in the agricultural sphere generally.</P>
    <P>There was the policy statement of the much publicised Mr. Larry Goodman, with the Taoiseach at his shoulder, that our food industry was to be the engine room within which jobs were to be created.  We might well ask now: where does our food industry stand under their management?  The answer is, it is in tatters.  We have endeavoured to table parliamentary questions to ascertain the truth or justification of the many rumours rife when we were told we were out of order and were not allowed raise such questions.  Yet those questions are being answered at the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, which is costing millions of pounds and is of no benefit to anybody but merely dragging down the country's good name.  As Deputy Deasy pointed out, there is a European market of 350 million people anxious to purchase quality food products which we have the ability to produce.  We can overcome our recent bad image but will not do so if the approach to be taken is that which led to the establishment of that inquiry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> Before being elected to this House I was involved in the co-operative movement in my region and know what can be achieved by a good marketing board.  For example, An Bord Bainne had a number of excellent people, including Mr. Joe McGough and Mr. Tony O'Reilly, who penetrated world markets for our dairy produce, in particular advertising the brand name &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo;, recognised as being acceptable on tables worldwide. Why can we not do the same for our beef industry and many other food products we can produce which are second to none?  It all reverts to our attitude, which is wrong.  It is not the fault of farmers; they have done their job, but have been let down by the people leading them.  I have been appalled at the number of farmers who have telephoned me to ask: Is it true what I see proposed by Commissioner Ray MacSharry last week, as reported in bold print in the Farming Supplement of the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;&ldquo;the Ray MacSharry male calf disposal scheme&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>In the name of all that is honest and decent what is that man about, harking back to 1932 to the then economic war, when a farmer received five shillings for cutting a calf's throat at the back of a ditch.  Sixty years later are we to commemorate or repeat that outrage perpetrated by de Valera and the then Fianna Fáil Government, who contended they would starve the British and our farmers.  Sixty years later Commissioner MacSharry proposes the solution to the beef mountains here and in Europe &mdash; the Ray MacSharry male calf disposal scheme, £88 to be paid to a farmer when he cuts the calf's throat at birth.</P>
    <P>Are we serious about this proposal? What reply can the Minister give Commissioner MacSharry?  Commissioner MacSharry served as Minister for Finance and Minister for Agriculture.  Surely he is aware of the devastation this proposal will cause in farming circles?  Is this to be taken as the yardstick for his other proposals?  Will they be equally outrageous? It is just not acceptable.  It <Col N="960" /> cannot be allowed happen.  Commissioner MacSharry can forget about it. As soon as any such proposal is implemented there will be a campaign mounted that will drive not alone him but those who support him out of people's minds forever.  It is preposterous to ask farmers in the spring &mdash; with sheep lambing and cows calving and farmers and their wives up at night &mdash; to implement this proposal of his.  But Commissioner MacSharry says to them: take out the breadknife, cut the male calf's throat and I will give you £88.  I hope that message will sink in.  I did not hear either Mr. Paddy Lane or Mr. Mark Killilea, MEPs, make any comment on this proposal.  I look forward to their comments.  Indeed their silence in recent weeks has been notable <i>vis-á-vis</i> Government neglect to pay the proposed headage payments, cut by 10 per cent, on the due date.  We must remember the overall quota restrictions on small farmers producing 15,000, 20,000 and 25,000 gallons of milk.  Now there is talk of a beef, sheep and cereal quotas, when people were just getting off the ground.</P>
    <P>My party were to the forefront in supporting EC membership whereas Fianna Fáil reluctantly campaigned.  We are not ashamed to admit that we led the field. The reason people voted overwhelmingly in favour of entry was its potential benefits for our agricultural industry, seen then to be the cornerstone of our economy and remains such.  What has taken place between the years 1973 and 1992 which has led to so much depression within the agricultural world, with mismanagement, bad management.  Indeed deals fought hard for by former Ministers for Agriculture, Mr. Mark Clinton and Deputy Deasy in relation to our quota and the surplus we managed to obtain for this country have been eroded, calculated to have been reduced by 10 per cent over the past two years.  How much longer will this be allowed to continue before there is a public outcry to stop?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the new Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Woods, to begin to undo the damage perpetrated by his predecessor.  It would be my hope <Col N="961" /> that he will take his former colleague, Commissioner MacSharry, aside, and ask him whether he realises the devastation his proposals are causing our people, the people who sent him to Europe in the first place.  Indeed he has a duty to ensure fair play, which is all we seek.  After all, as a nation, we have not contributed to the beef and dairy produce mountains. Our contribution within the EC context has been minimal but we have a quality product that can be sold on the open market without resorting to the soft option of intervention for dairy produce and beef for which we are now paying.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I compliment Deputy Deasy in bringing forward this motion which I hope will have the support of every Member of the House.  Whether one is rural or an urban Deputy, everybody's income is affected at the end of the day because it is outside the farm gate the most telling blow will be struck if we do not say we are not accepting these proposals.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to secure an outcome from the current negotiations on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and in the GATT which responds to the needs of Irish farmers and the longer term development of our agriculture industry and to the overall needs of the economy.</P>
      <P>I am delighted Deputy Deasy put down the motion because it gives me an opportunity to give a report to the House at this critical time.  I thought the Deputy would recognise the fact that I have been fighting a very hard battle in Europe for Irish farmers.  This point is recognised by the farming organisations.  I meet them regularly on a consultative basis before each European meeting and I am aware of their requirements and of the needs of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity presented <Col N="962" /> by this debate to inform the House of the present situation in relation to both Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT negotiations.  It is important to take both together because they are currently running in parallel.  The Government are taking a firm line in these crucial negotiations.  I say &ldquo;crucial&rdquo; because of the major role which agriculture and the food sector play not only in the lives of farmers and those engaged in related activities but because of the vital contribution which the agriculture sector makes to our economy.  Agriculture is over three times as important in economic terms in Ireland as in the EC as a whole.  I never cease to emphasise to our colleagues in the Council that agriculture is vital to us, that it plays a dominant role in our economy and we must protect our agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Agriculture and food directly and indirectly account for 20 per cent of our GNP, 20 per cent of our employment, and contributes close to 40 per cent of our net foreign earnings.  The livestock sector accounts for 85 per cent of our agricultural output.  It is this sector together with arable crops which would mainly be affected by the Commission's proposals.  Agriculture is important not only in economic terms, it is also central to the stability and vitality of our rural communities.</P>
    <P>I will not accept decisions on Common Agricultural Policy reform or in the GATT that put at risk the economic or social contribution made by agriculture to Irish life.</P>
    <P>At a time when the creation and maintenance of employment and the expansion of exports is of prime national importance, the wellbeing and viability of our most important industry is essential. Whatever shape Common Agricultural Policy reform takes it will not be acceptable to me unless it secures the viability of family farms in Ireland and allows for the continued development of the vital commercial element of our agriculture. Both are equally important to us.  We will never lose sight of the importance of family farms but we must also provide a <Col N="963" /> future for the commercial aspect of our agriculture.</P>
    <P>Behind the hard statistics I have quoted lie the hard work and endeavour of the farming community and those working in related industries.  I am keenly aware of their concerns arising from the current negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT. Without doubt these negotiations are the most important in the field of agriculture since we joined the Community.  I can assure everyone involved that the Government fully recognise this fact. Our approach has been clear and unequivocal from the beginning of negotiations.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister last November I have made it clear to everyone &mdash; my colleagues in the Council, Commissioner MacSharry, farmers and workers employed in the agriculture industry &mdash; that the Commission's proposals for Common Agricultural Policy reform are unacceptable in their present form.  I have spelled this out clearly again and again.</P>
    <P>I recognise in common with informed opinion throughout Ireland and the Community that an unreformed Common Agricultural Policy is not a realistic alternative. Deputy Deasy made quite clear the difficulties that have arisen in recent times and the contribution we are making to those difficulties is substantial.  Notwithstanding that, if we had not had the intervention system over the last two years it would have been a disaster for agriculture in Ireland and for the economy as a whole.  We have to keep a balance between the two and that is what we plan to do.</P>
    <P>The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has been inevitable for some time.  Growing surpluses in several sectors, rapidly increasing expenditure and falling farm incomes have made reform necessary.  The changes in agriculture support arrangements in the community since the beginning of the eighties have all failed to secure the necessary responses other than for short periods.</P>
    <P>The present reform negotiations are <Col N="964" /> aimed at securing more fundamental change.  They aim to achieve a more market oriented agriculture and production control to bring markets back into balance.  We have to do the two things together; bring the markets back into balance and do what Deputy Deasy mentioned, that is develop the market oriented approach.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals have been spelled out in this House in the past. Essentially, the approach is based on a large reduction in the price of cereals, followed by related price reductions in the livestock sector together with output restrictions.  Direct income aids would be introduced or increased to compensate producers.  These income aids would be related to intensified farming practices and biased to a certain extent towards smaller to medium sized producers.</P>
    <P>The debate on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy proposals has been going on in the Council of Agriculture Ministers since last autumn.  All member states have acknowledged that reform is desirable but there has been little or no progress in the discussions. Views are extremely diverse on the form the revised agriculture support arrangements might take.  I should mention that there has been solidarity between the countries.  In the private discussions there is great solidarity between the nations on the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; first, on the need for some reform in the policy for the future and, second, on the interests of the different member states and how crucially they would be affected. However, that becomes a different question when it comes to the kind of changes that will emerge eventually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not happening at the moment.  I know there may be those who want to see that happen but I can assure the Deputy that solidarity across the membership of the Council is very strong.  It is one of the very heartening aspects of the Council of Ministers and of that whole system as it <Col N="965" /> operates, particularly in defence of small nations and nations who have, in particular circumstances, special problems and difficulties.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 27-28 January the new Portuguese Presidency presented a working document to Ministers outlining a number of possibilities for directing the reform debate in the coming months.  I met the Portuguese Minister shortly before that in Dublin when we had a long discussion on Ireland's needs in this regard.  I made sure that the Portuguese were fully aware of our position.  The Presidency recognised that the proposals needed discussion in greater depth if solutions are to be found.  This view was certainly confirmed in the contributions by all Ministers in the ensuing debate. The Council of Ministers will be returning to the Common Agricultural Policy reform discussions next week when a more detailed working paper is expected to be tabled by the Presidency.  There is no doubt that this is a crucial time.</P>
      <P>I have made clear my opposition to the reform proposals as they stand and I have been extremely hard hitting in putting Ireland's case.  I have left nobody in any doubt that I cannot accept the Commission's proposals as they stand.  As far as I am concerned major changes will have to be introduced in several areas before the proposals begin to approach acceptability.  I will go as far as is necessary to ensure that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stressed in the Council that price reductions should be less severe and phased in over a longer timescale. Effective market price support arrangements, including intervention, must be maintained to underpin the agreed price levels.  Compensation for reduced price support must be permanent and adequate.  Community financial resources must be guaranteed.  The premia proposals for both beef and milk are not acceptable and they will have to be adjusted to reflect the realistic requirements of family farms.  The comparative position of grass-based production must be maintained.  I emphasised again and again our special and unique position in <Col N="966" /> Ireland where there is extensive grass-based production.  This is one of our great advantages in that natural produce is a selling point in Europe.  It is crucial, having regard to the developments taking place, that our unique position in this regard be fully recognised.  Community preference must be maintained and effective import controls must underpin the market.  The reforms must ensure sufficient flexibility to accommodate the needs of suitably qualified young farmers who wish to enter farming.  The proposed milk quota cut is not acceptable given the current state of the dairy market and, in the absence of reciprocal action at international level, the reforms must dovetail with the outcome of the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>The permanence of compensatory payments, and the assurance of adequate and durable Community financial resources to underpin these payments, are vital requirements for me.  It is essential that farmers, and the agriculture sector, continue to have the same security in a revised Common Agricultural Policy as under the more normal price support system.  Common Agricultural Policy reform will not be acceptable without these assurances.</P>
    <P>The need to maintain the competitiveness of our traditional grass-based livestock production systems is another critical area for me.  I am demanding that premia be paid to extensive grass-based producers in a way which fully conpensates them for any price reductions. I am asking that the scope of the premium system be widened; that premia be paid in such a way as to ensure that producers generally benefit in full and that more realistic stocking rate criteria and farm limits be provided for.</P>
    <P>The stocking limits envisaged in the proposals are a major concern for me. They do not take realistic account of what is required to maintain the economic basis of modern family farms.  The low limit proposed for disadvantaged areas will be especially damaging and will have to be changed.  We have made this point again and again and will continue to do so because it is of crucial importance to <Col N="967" /> our farming sector.  I believe that farmers in disadvantaged areas should be regarded as meeting the stocking rate criteria.  In other words, since they will have to comply with other criteria they should be regarded as meeting the stocking rate criteria to do away with bureaucracy from Brussels which is causing endless difficulties in those areas.  The stance I am taking is that farmers in disadvantaged areas should <i>de facto</i> be regarded as meeting the stocking rate criteria.  The low limit proposed for disadvantaged areas will be especially damaging and will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>I do not in principle object to a partial switch from market measures to direct payments but returns from the market should continue to form the main source of farmers' incomes.  I do not want to see us reach a point where farmers are only in receipt of hand-outs.  Even though compensation must be permanent and long-term returns from the market should form the bulk of farmers' incomes.  That is the responsibility of the Community irrespective of what talks or discussions are taking place.</P>
    <P>It is essential that agreed price levels are maintained and that the necessary effective price support arrangements are in place to ensure this.  I have in mind particularly support arrangements such as intervention which must be retained in a format which continues to underpin prices.  Other essential supports must include the maintenance of adequate border protection and ensuring that we can exploit new export markets.  We must continue to have that freedom.  These latter points in particular will be influenced by the outcome of the GATT Uruguay Round, the other vital element to which I will now turn.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that the GATT negotiations have entered the concluding phase.  This follows the presentation of a draft final Act in late December covering all aspects of the negotiations.  The text on agriculture was drawn up by the director general of GATT, Mr. Dunkel in the absence of a negotiated agreement <Col N="968" /> among the major trading partners.  Following the much publicised high level meeting between the Community and the United States in early November it seemed that both parties could reach an agreement in the agriculture sector.  In the end the differences proved too difficult to surmount.</P>
    <P>I will outline briefly the main elements of the Dunkel paper.  The proposal is to reduce over six years 1986-88 internal support levels by 20 per cent; tariff and tariff equivalents, resulting from the conversion of variable levies and other border measures, by 36 per cent for products, 15 per cent for each tariff line and 1986-90 budgetary expenditure and volumes exported with direct export subsidies by 36 per cent and 24 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>The proposals also provide for the maintenance of average 1986-88 access levels, minimum access of 3 per cent rising to 5 per cent and a very restricted green box &mdash; Common Agricultural Policy compensatory payments and most likely existing payments to disadvantaged areas would be excluded.  In other words, as a result of not being included in the green box they would be subject to the disciplines of GATT and, therefore, reduced.  They would be consistently reduced over time which would be disastrous from Ireland's point of view.</P>
    <P>I have made it very clear that this is not a basis for negotiating a final outcome. It ignores completely the Community's fundamental requirements.  It is biased in favour of other participants.  In particular there is no coherence between the separate undertakings.  It does not exempt Common Agricultural Policy reform compensation or disadvantaged areas payments from reduction commitments, the green box, a critical point for the Community.  I should say in this respect that the Commissioner is <i>ad idem</i> with us and is totally committed to seeking a comprehensive green box which would protect those elements which are of crucial importance to us.</P>
    <P>The tariffication methodology, minimum access provisions and the volume limitations on the direct subsidised <Col N="969" /> exports would, if accepted, result in greatly increased import levels into &mdash; and much reduced export volumes from &mdash; Community markets.  As much as one million tonnes of meat and 300,000 tonnes of milk could be left on the Community market with consequential implications for producers and prices.  The impact of these concessions would be to fundamentally undermine European agricultural support systems while other producers took an ever-increasing share of Community markets.  Many countries, including the US, would have to do very little &mdash; or nothing &mdash; and could take advantage of community cutbacks to develop their own agricultural sectors.</P>
    <P>The Community has always accepted that the negotiations would result in some support reductions and greater competition on the internal market.  This is something which the Community has accepted in the past and still accepts.  We are very anxious to have increased world trade.  Ireland wants openness to the world market but not at the expense of devastating our agricultural economy. Even if it means no GATT, that is how it will have to be.  However, participation in the negotiations has always been on the clear understanding that the burden of redressing existing imbalances would be shared equitably by all who contributed to them; there would be a balanced outcome across all sectors involved and the Community would be able to support and protect the agricultural sector and rural economies generally. The Dunkel approval meets none of these basic criteria and would represent a completely unbalanced outcome for the sector.  The text has been considered by the Council on a number of occasions. On each occasion I have outlined in detail my fundamental objections to it.  I have clearly stated that it is not an acceptable basis for reaching a conclusion in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that this view has been endorsed by the overall Council.  It has declared that, as the text calls into question the foundation of the Community's agricultural policy, it is not <Col N="970" /> acceptable and will have to be modified. Our trading partners are in no doubt that the Community's interests must be accommodated if there is to be a GATT round.  In the period leading up to last Christmas I know that there was an attempt to get the Community to agree to this paper, on 23 December.  We ensured that at this meeting of Trade Ministers, an Agriculture Minister sat beside every Trade Minister.  That was the decision of the Government regarding which the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I were totally in agreement.  We sat side by side and we made certain that there would be no breach in our national policy and no quick slipping through of any paper which might be presented.  That was very effective, we got a very appropriate decision from that meeting and when a further meeting took place we got similar support from the Council as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that this view has been endorsed by the overall Council who declared that, as the text calls into question the foundation of the Community's agricultural policy, it is not acceptable and will have to be modified. Our trading partners, therefore, are in no doubt about our views at this time.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dunkel has set a timeframe of mid-April for the conclusion of the talks. It is not certain that this deadline can be met.  The Community has fundamental difficulties with the Dunkel text and the US position is hardening in the face of difficulties in its domestic economy and the campaign for presidential elections in November.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear at EC level that the Community must not be pressured into an agreement.  We have made a good offer and we have a legitimate interest to protect what is critical for the survival of rural communities.  Negotiations between the Commission and the US will continue over the next few weeks with a view to finding an acceptable alternative solution.</P>
    <P>A stable trading environment is in the interest of all of us but this cannot be achieved at the expense of the livelihoods of those in Irish or European agriculture. <Col N="971" /> If we in the Community cannot secure the necessary improvements it is seeking then it would be better to have no agreement at all.  I am not prepared to undermine the livelihoods of a major portion of our workforce in agriculture and the agri-food industry.  I will not accept agreement at any cost.  It is essential that Agriculture Ministers in the Community continue to be involved in the negotiating process.  I intend to ensure that they are.</P>
    <P>The outcomes of the negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform and in the GATT will have a critical bearing on the development of agriculture to the end of the decade and beyond, but the industry can do much itself to influence the situation.  Ireland has many advantages when it comes to producing food. Our relatively mild climate, good soil and high level of husbandry enable us to produce high quality food at favourable economic cost.  Our clean environment and &ldquo;green&rdquo; image mean that consumers have a favourable perception of the wholesomeness and goodness of Irish food products.</P>
    <P>We must make better use of exploiting these assets.  Irish agriculture and the food industry must develop to the full and maximise their vital role in our economic life.  The Common Agricultural Policy and GATT reforms should encourage us to exploit the undoubted market opportunities which exist, particularly in the Community, for consistent supplies of high quality food products.</P>
    <P>Nobody is in any doubt about the importance of agriculture and food to the Irish economy.  It is far and away our biggest sector and is central to our social and economic development prospects. None of us wishes to see the sector endangered or its long term development impaired.  All in the House have repeatedly confirmed that view.  It is long past argument.</P>
    <P>What is perhaps not yet past argument is how it can be protected and sustained in these negotiations.  We have been major net beneficiaries under the Common Agricultural Policy which has for almost two decades underpinned our <Col N="972" /> agriculture and food sector.  Without a viable Common Agricultural Policy we are in severe difficulties and aspects of the present Common Agricultural Policy operations are threatening its viability. Therefore, we simply cannot afford to take up the ostrich position suggested in the motion and refuse to look at some reform proposals.  The important issue is to get the balance of the reform right.</P>
    <P>I refuse to approach the issue of Common Agricultural Policy reform in a negative manner.  A positive stance, based on a clear recognition that the opportunity exists to adapt the policy in a sensible way, presents us with a unique opportunity to make a major contribution to the shape of the Common Agricultural Policy into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>It is our task to secure the amendments we need to safeguard the position of Irish farmers and of the whole agri-food sector &mdash; a task to which I am fully committed.  I am confident that when the negotiations reach a conclusion the decisions taken will be the right ones from Ireland's point of view.</P>
    <P>Our approach to Common Agricultural Policy reform is a reasonable one and I am certain from numerous bilateral contacts with my colleagues in the Council that we can rely on their understanding based on the principle of Community solidarity.  We will ensure that the balance of policy adjustments agreed will not seriously disadvantage any region, particularly the more vulnerable regions of the Community like Ireland where dependence on agriculture is at its greatest, and will allow us at long last to develop a modern, efficient and market oriented food industry, the kind of market to which Deputy Deasy referred.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will stand firm on these issues during the negotiations. I have the support of the farming organisations for my position and it would help me enormously if I could have the unanimous support of this House. The House can underline that support tomorrow by supporting my amendment which I unreservedly recommend to all Deputies and which can help to settle the <Col N="973" /> argument about how best to protect our interests in the current Common Agricultural Policy and GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion as it gives us an opportunity to discuss the GATT negotiations and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy at this time.  However, I appeal to Members on the opposite side of the House to be positive, constructive and helpful in their approach.  I can assure them the Government recognise the critical and vital importance of these difficult discussions.</P>

      <P>The Commission proposals on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which have been known to the Government since December 1990 will have major implications for farmers, the food processing sector and our economy generally.  The challenge posed by the changes to EC farm policy and GATT is of fundamental importance to us as it threatens the future viability of Irish family farms.</P>
      <P>It would have been far more preferable if this debate had taken place in the context of a motion which would have enabled the House to express a concerted view on the entire issue.  Surely it should be possible, given a reasonable degree of goodwill, for the Dáil to agree a motion which would have the unanimous support of all sides.  This would strengthen the hand of the Government and the Minister at the negotiations on the MacSharry proposals in Brussels.  However, as things stand, the Fine Gael motion will probably be defeated tomorrow night and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats amendment which calls on us to support the Minister in his negotiations will be adopted.  I should like to remind the House that on 20th March last year the Minister of State, whom I am glad to see in the House tonight, tabled an amendment to a similar motion on Common Agricultural Policy reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened to the promises made by the former Minister for Agriculture and Food?  He told everyone he was going to Brussels to bang on the table on behalf of the Irish farmers and the agricultural sector.  His efforts to ensure that the views of Irish farmers were heard must have been very weak as there has not <Col N="975" /> been much reference to Irish interests in the proposals which have been emanating from Brussels since last march.  While there has been a change of Minister, I hope we do not have a continuation of his policies.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the goals he wishes to achieve.  These are somewhat similar to proposals we have heard in the past.  I hope the present Minister for Agriculture and Food has a stronger personality than the previous Minister and that he will put forward the views of the Irish agricultural sector loudly and clearly in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party want the Minister to secure a specific commitment on linkage between reform of the Common Agricultural Policy as proposed by the Commission and the Council of Ministers on a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis of agreed transfer payments to ensure that all farmers who wish to remain in farming can do so and to ensure the long term viability of rural communities.  We want to secure a commitment from the Minister that any revision of national commodity production quotas, which will facilitate the development of employment in Irish agriculture and Irish agri-business, will be a fundamental requirement for acceptance of any Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals.  In the event of such a commitment not being secured we want him to ensure that the vital national interest provisions of the EC treaties are invoked and any Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals, similar to these we have had in the past, will be vetoed. The Minister assured us tonight that he will go to the furthest lengths to secure these commitments.  If this is so, he must accept that the most important issue is our vital national interest.  He must see to it that EC treaties make allowances for this and ensure that any proposals which are not in our interests can be vetoed at Community level.  Agriculture, our largest industry is of such vital importance to this country that we can ask for nothing less from the Minister in the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> Since these proposals became known 14 months ago Members on these benches have been putting forward their views on them.  I believe they are worth restating here tonight.  The first realistic test which must be applied to the so-called MacSharry plan is whether it will work.  In the Irish context this means, will it strengthen Irish agriculture or weaken it?  Will poverty be eradicated on the family farm?  Will agriculture continue to play a central role in the economy?  Will our agri-business continue to be viable? On a first reading of Commissioner MacSharry's proposals, the immediate answer to all these questions must be couched in the negative.  This plan is aimed at getting farmers out of farming as painlessly as possible from the point of view of the European Community. Essentially, the plan will ask milk producers to produce less milk, ask beef producers to produce less beef and ask cereal growers to grow less cereal.  If the plan is implemented in full, Irish agricultural output will be significantly lower than it is at present.  According to the plan, the main reason for this will be that without the reforms proposed by the Commissioner, and adopted by the Commission annual surplus production will be well in excess of foreseeable export outlets.  In other words, there will not be enough markets and intervention cannot be tolerated any longer; therefore, farmers must get out of farming.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to see the logic of this approach when it is looked at from a purely European perspective.  However, from an Irish point of view the long term implications of this plan are potentially horrific.  These implications must be examined without giving undue weight to the compensatory arrangements built into the plan which are essentially transitory.</P>
    <P>If this plan goes through in its present form Irish farmers will produce less beef, milk and cereals than they do now, there will be fewer farms and the average farm incomes will be significantly lower than they are now.  In addition, the balance of trade will be much worse for the country as a whole, with all that implies for a <Col N="977" /> small, open trading economy like ours. If we produce fewer products there will be less to process and the unemployment knock-on effect will be substantial &mdash; perhaps as many as 5,000 in the vital growing processing industry.</P>
    <P>The food industry in Ireland employs one in every five manufacturing jobs compared with one in 12 in the Community as a whole.  It is worth noting that there are no proposals in the MacSharry plan to deal with the wreckage that the plan will leave behind throughout the agri-business sector.  Clearly, it is difficult to get an objective assessment of the overall damage this plan will do.  The most independent estimates come from the ESRI who forecast a decline in agricultural output of £429 million, or 17 per cent and a decline in farm incomes of £200 million.  The knock-on effects in industry and services would amount to 5,000 jobs.  In addition, ICOS estimate that ultimately the plan will lead to a decline in the number of farmers of 22,500, coupled with an increase in family farm poverty.</P>
    <P>The social consequences of these estimates, while impossible to quantify, would clearly be devastating.  Therefore, the plan will not work for Ireland, and its publication represents a major crisis for us.  It will not work because Ireland is much more dependent on agriculture than every other economy in Europe. The last thing we need in Ireland is a redundancy package for our largest industry.  The last thing we need here is a complacent Minister for Agriculture and Food; content to utter soothing words of concern while at the same time taking no action to ensure that Irish concerns are highlighted while the plan is in its formative stages.  On several occasions last year the then Minister for Agriculture and Food was warned by the Labour Party, among others, of impending developments in relation to European approaches to agriculture.  For example, he was warned by me of the impending farm price package.  On each of those occasions the then Minister insisted that it was not his place to respond to leaks or to act until after a decision was made. <Col N="978" /> Perhaps he felt it was safe to rely on the notion that old friends are best in his dealings with Commissioner MacSharry. We now know how wrong he was, as can be seen by the details which have emanated from that plan.</P>
    <P>Farmers will not need to have long memories to remember the promises made by the Taoiseach just before the last local elections that he was going to bang the table at the Luxembourg Summit to ensure that our concerns about the future of our largest industry were known and understood at the highest level in Europe.  Farmers, and everybody else, will not need reminding about how the Taoiseach clapped himself on the back on his return from the Summit, telling us that the issue had been put firmly on the European agenda and that Heads of State and Governments were fully apprised of the centrality of agriculture in our concerns.  Obviously, they were not sufficiently concerned to pass on the Taoiseach's interest in the matter to the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not even mentioned in the minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be more true to say that on that occasion the Taoiseach was motivated more by the embarrassment of the leaks of the MacSharry proposals and the damage it would do to his party during the local elections.  Such performances which are aimed entirely at domestic political audiences seldom carry much weight in Europe, and the Taoiseach surely knows that now.  Indeed, it did not carry much weight in the local elections either.  We must recognise that the essential reason for the reform proposed is that pressure is being brought to bear from the United States of America in the GATT talks. While a case can be made for reform on its merits there can be no case for capitulating to this pressure if it is to cost the future of our most important industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue here is a moral issue. The Commission is proposing to spend £4 billion a year in order to produce less <Col N="979" /> at a time when Third World countries are starving.  At the same time the Commission talks about export markets not being readily available.  How can a policy be justified that pays farmers to remain idle and lays off perhaps one-third of the workforce in the food manufacturing industry when there are millions of people crying out not only to be fed but also to be helped towards self-sufficiency in the future?  While it is clear that some of the products we manufacture and produce are unsuitable as exports to the Third World, particularly butter, it is morally unacceptable that there are huge mountains of skim milk powder and cereals held at considerable expense all over Europe at a time when virtually the entire top half of Africa is hungry and with many parts of the Continent facing famine.  It is totally unacceptable that the only Community response of substance to that crisis is to put forward a plan for putting food producers out of business. The £4 billion extra per annum the Commission is proposing to spend would virtually solve the famine problem if it was channelled into diverting surplus production into those countries where it is most urgently needed.</P>
    <P>When he spoke here last July on a motion on the Common Agricultural Policy the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring said:</P>
    <P>Because I believe that there must be total solidarity with the industry in the interests of a rational and sustainable future I want to put forward a proposal here.  I am calling on the Minister and the Government to establish a forum which would enable the political and industry interests that are vitally concerned in this debate to come together to develop an agreed, united and cohesive strategy for the future.  It is not too late for us to avert the threat implicit in these proposals as they are presently structured but it will soon be too late.  I am calling on the Government to work with the rest of us, not in isolation, to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>Tonight I repeat that proposal from the <Col N="980" /> Leader of the Labour Party.  It is obvious from what the Minister said in his speech, and from Members from all sides of this House, that everybody is agreed beyond doubt that the proposals in the MacSharry plan on Common Agricultural Policy reform, will have a disastrous effect on the agriculture industry.  The ESRI in their medium-term economic review estimated that we will be required to make alternative expenditure reductions to make up for the £700 million which will be required by 1995.  The Common Agricultural Policy concessions to the US which are now probable will be made in the current GATT negotiations. This country cannot afford extreme expenditure losses, the loss of employment and the devastation of family farms.</P>
    <P>There is no need for the Government to bring in a Minister to repeat the promises that were made to this House as far back as March of last year.  We do not need a Minister to come in here and say he is doing his very best.  We want the Minister to go forward with the united support of Dáil Éireann and, I am sure, of Seanad Éireann, and propose that, if necessary, he will use the veto in order to protect our vital interests.  The Minister has said he is prepared to go as far as he can, which should mean using the veto if he does not get full satisfaction.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Gabhaim buíochas leat, a Cheann Comhairle, gur thug tú deis dom an cheist seo a phlé.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire ag éisteacht go géar agus go mbeidh toradh tairbheach as an méid a déarfaidh mé.</P>
      <P>First, may I emphasise that the carer's allowance is an excellent scheme but because of the standards laid down it is difficult for people to qualify for it.  I hope that when drawing up the Social Welfare Bill the Minister will consider some of the points I make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> I wish to highlight the case of a Carlow housewife who is looking after two members of her family, both of whom are mentally handicapped, and in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  However, one of them is severely handicapped and in need of special care.  In theory a person is entitled to the carer's allowance for looking after one person and one would therefore imagine that in practice she would be guaranteed the full allowance for looking after both people.  However if that had happened I would not be raising this question tonight.</P>
    <P>Because her husband works and earns approximately £140 per week she is automatically regarded as having an income of half that amount and therefore her means exceed the limit of £50 which she is allowed to earn under this scheme.</P>
    <P>This person looks after two people who would need institutional care if she was not so kind as to care for them at home, and she is saving the nation a great deal of money.  I suggest that in this case the income limit should be doubled and that she would be allowed to earn £100 a week before being disqualified on means.  Let us remember her income is only nominal because this person is a full-time carer and is not earning any money.  If this were so it would go some way towards qualifying her for a carer's allowance. The situation where a person looks after two mentally handicapped people will not arise very often.  She is not pretending that they are in need of care because the health board have acknowledged that position by giving them a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  It is a question of adjusting the rules to show some justice.  I am not looking for a double allowance but one payment for this person who looks after two people who are genuinely in need of constant care. The State should recognise the dedicated work of such carers.  Theory is not adequate in such cases; actions speak louder than words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the carer's allowance <Col N="982" /> is a means-tested payment for persons who are providing elderly or incapacitated social welfare pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose income falls below certain limits.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of the carer's allowance requires that the person being cared for be in receipt of a social welfare pension.  With effect from last July, the scheme was extended to include the carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>The person in question applied for a carer's allowance in January 1991 in respect of her sister who was in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance. That claim was refused in February on the grounds that recipients of DPMA did not qualify under the scheme.  She wrote to my Department appealing against this decision and pointed out that in addition to her sister she was also caring for her brother who was in receipt of DPMA.  However, following review, she was informed that DPMA recipients did not qualify under the scheme and that therefore her claim could not be allowed.</P>
      <P>A repeat claim was received in August 1991 following the extension of the carer's allowance to DPMA recipients. However, that claim was refused on the grounds that the claimant's means exceeded the limit.  Her husband's earnings from employment were taken into account in determining the claimant's means.  Where a claimant is married and living with their spouse, the application of the means test requires that half of the spouse's earnings are assessed against the claimant.  On the basis of her husband's earnings which were confirmed by his employer, the claimant was assessed with means of £68.99 per week.  This amount exceeds the means limit of £52.50 per week which applies in her case.  Consequently, a carer's allowance is not payable to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that under the present scheme, only one carer's allowance is payable irrespective of the number of persons being cared for.  I am aware that the application of the current means test has the effect that persons with moderate <Col N="983" /> incomes sometimes do not qualify or receive a reduced allowance only.  I have already indicated in the House last week that I intend to review the scheme during the coming year.  This review will take into account all aspects of the scheme, including circumstances of the kind raised by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the serious concern and fear being shown and expressed by parents in Cork city and county, I take this opportunity on the Adjournment to request the Minister for Health to intervene immediately in the present outbreak of meningitis which is affecting children in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>Some commentators have indicated there is no crisis but I use the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; advisedly because it is a crisis for every child who contracts meningitis.  A recent report by the Southern Health Board states that 15 cases have been identified in the past month.  Nine cases were identified in the Blarney area and this necessitated the closure of schools in the area.  Another five cases have been identified in the city and a report no later than this evening states that two children are seriously ill with meningitis in hospital.  The report states that while 15 cases have been identified there have been no deaths as yet.</P>
      <P>The present situation is completely unacceptable.  Do we have to wait until a child dies before urgent action is taken? While some schools have closed in the Blarney area, the health board admit they are finding it difficult to get information across to parents due to the current RTE dispute.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to cause unnecessary anxiety for parents but I know that the local radio station and the local press in Cork are being beseiged by anxious parents seeking information and being critical of the Southern Health Board for the way they are handling the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also very serious when one takes <Col N="984" /> into consideration the bed complement in Cork city.  Cork Regional Hospital advertised recently in the local press that they would be only taking in emergency cases due to the health cutbacks.  The South Infirmary Victoria Hospital and the Mercy Hospital are in the same position with long waiting lists.  I shudder to think what the situation would be if meningitis became rampant throughout the city and county.  At present it is practically impossible to get an elderly person admitted to hospital.  With no let-up in the cutbacks in health since 1987, and with medical and nursing staff stretched to breaking point trying to provide the necessary services, a burden such as a major epidemic would make it impossible for staff to cope with additional admissions.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, meningitis is a lethal disease that can cause death or brain damage.  It is only natural that parents are seriously concerned with the situation. While the 15 cases identified so far may not be a great number at this time, it is also a fact that this is a highly contagious disease which can be passed on very quickly from one child to another. And 15 cases at present are 15 cases too many.</P>
    <P>The disease can also cause complications such as temporary blindness, and deafness, which may become permanent. It is also a fact that loss of hearing in small children may result in their becoming deaf mutes.</P>
    <P>I believe that the situation in Cork city and county needs immediate ministerial intervention so that appropriate action can be taken by the health board.  If that action necessitates the closure of all schools in the area as a preventative measure, so be it.</P>
    <P>But what is also urgently needed now, Minister, is that the fears and concerns of the parents are put at rest and assurances given that all measures will be taken to curb this serious outbreak of meningitis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that during 1991 there were 38 cases of suspected meningo coccal meningitis in <Col N="985" /> Cork city and the south Cork community care area.  They were scattered sporadically and the majority occurred in the first quarter of 1991.</P>
      <P>The health board have informed the Department that since 1 January this year there have been 15 suspected cases; five in Cork city, nine in the greater Blarney area and one in Glanmire.  The age range is from nine months to 16 years and in three of the 15 cases girls were affected. No deaths have been reported.</P>
      <P>My Department are liaising with the Southern Health Board regarding these cases and the Health Board are taking the appropriate action to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Three schools in Blarney have been closed.  The pupils were issued with information leaflets on the condition and its early symptoms as treatment in the initial stage is essential to achieve maximum results.  General practitioners in Cork were issued an update on the situation.  A press statement was issued by the health board to the national papers on Wednesday, 29 January in which they emphasised the need to itemise the early symptoms.</P>
      <P>Close liaison with hospitals, general practitioners and schools is being maintained by the health board, and the public have been advised that they can contact the local director of community care or the medical officer of health for information.</P>
      <P>Meningococcal meningitis is one of the three main types of bacterial meningitis. At a national level the Department of Health monitor the incidence of bacterial meningitis in two ways: first, through the weekly reporting of cases by general practitioners to the local director of community care or medical officer of health who, in turn, reports the cases to the Department; second, reports on individual cases of bacterial meningitis are submitted by the local director of community care or medical officer of health to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These reports in recent years have not indicated any major outbreak, a clustering of cases or particular possible sources of infection.  The pattern of infection <Col N="986" /> has been of sporadic cases occuring in various parts of the country.  However, in view of the need to be vigilant in reporting cases, the deputy chief medical officer of my Department has written to each director of community care or medical officer of health informing them of this and asking them to liaise with general practitioners to ensure that there is a high awareness of the disease among general practitioners and that appropriate control and management measures are undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Department operate a control programme in conjunction with the health boards and with primary care doctors. The appearance of a case of bacterial meningitis indicates to the local health service the presence of infection in the area.  The director of community care or the medical officer of health then liaises with local general practitioners to create a more clinical awareness of the presence of the infection.  That is important because in the more pernicious types of infection the prognosis will depend on early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Prophylactic therapy is also initiated for the family and immediate contacts of cases.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Southern Health Board are taking the appropriate steps in relation to the cases occurring in the Cork area and will continue to do so until the infection has been cleared.</P>

    <P>For the past 25 years, since the new vocational school was sanctioned but cancelled, staff and students at Carrick-on-Shannon vocational school have been forced to work under appalling, grossly inadequate and unhealthy conditions.</P>
    <P>The original school, built in 1935, had five classrooms and was situated on a quarter acre site.  Enrolment during the past 12 years has grown from 161 to about 330.  At present Carrick-on-Shannon vocational school is scattered over 13 separate buildings on six independent sites, most of them rented.  If the headmaster wished to visit all of the classrooms he would have to go outdoors 13 times and walk approximately two miles.  Pupils are continually on the move and may be forced to change classrooms four or five times a day.  In bad weather, therefore, each student will get wet several times a day.  There is no shelter apart from classrooms.  The prefabricated classrooms are now almost 25 years old. They are falling to pieces.  Despite continuing maintenance and expenditure they are now completely unsuitable.</P>
    <P>The TUI recently submitted a list of demands for improvements and have given strike notice to Leitrim vocational education committee.  They are seeking a shelter for students, proper toilet facilities and a staffroom.</P>
    <P>I visited the school recently and found the conditions there deplorable.  This House enacted the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act in 1989.  I consider it scandalous that resources have not been made available to schools such as that at Carrick-on-Shannon in order to enable them to comply with the minimum requirements of that legislation.</P>
    <P>I know that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was to make provision of £4 million in 1992 to upgrade unsatisfactory school buildings.  I ask the Minister to urgently consider the making of an allocation from that source as a stop-gap measure to alleviate the more <Col N="988" /> serious problems and avert the threatened TUI strike.  I know that a large number of primary and post primary schools would wish to draw from the same well, but there is no doubt in my mind that Carrick-on-Shannon vocational school has an exceptional case.</P>
    <P>It is clear from consideration of the public capital programme that the level of expenditure proposed for post-primary building is completely inadequate. During the past three years expenditure on school buildings at second level has fallen from £27 million per year to £11 million per year.  In view of the number of areas where rationalisation has been agreed and having regard to the substandard nature of the buildings in hundreds of post-primary schools, I consider the proposed level of expenditure on school buildings in 1992 to be grossly inadequate.</P>
    <P>For more than 20 years the Department of Education have been in favour of providing a new community school in Carrick-on-Shannon.  The Marist Sisters who operated Marymount college have been in agreement with this policy since 1975 but county Leitrim vocational education committee did not agree to that development until 1989.  The former Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, met a delegation from County Leitrim vocational education committee on 4 May 1989 during which she indicated a three year time scale for a new community school in Carrick-on-Shannon if the vocational education committee would accept the proposal.  The committee members who were present at that meeting brought back to Carrick-on-Shannon the message that a new community school would be built within three years.  County Leitrim vocational education committee own a valuable site in Carrick-on-Shannon which was bought to accommodate the vocational school project approved 25 years ago.  The vocational education committee agreed to transfer that site free of charge to the Minister on the understanding that the building of the new community school would commence <Col N="989" /> within the three year time scale indicated by Minister O'Rourke.</P>
    <P>Sadly, despite the urgency of the situation in Carrick-on-Shannon, progress to date has been disappointing and a number of major stages, such as the bill of quantities, working drawings, preparation of tender documents and so on, have still to be completed.  It would be not too far off the mark to state that the Department of Education are allowing planning to proceed only at a snail's pace. Progress to date is not consistent with a three year time scale.  There is an urgent necessity to proceed immediately with the construction of the new community school in Carrick-on-Shannon and I would ask the Minister and the Government to give priority to the development and make the required resources available immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education who is grateful for the opportunity to respond to the matter raised by Deputy Reynolds with regard to the vocational school in Carrick-on-Shannon. The Minister is aware of the condition of the existing school buildings in Carrick-on-Shannon and is fully committed to having the proposed new community school building provided as soon as possible in order to alleviate the accommodation problems in both schools in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to clarify the position I will give some brief details on the background to this project.  The reorganisation of second level facilities in the town, involving Carrick-on-Shannon vocational school and Marymount College, has been an issue for a number of years.  Following agreement at local level the planning of a new community school was initiated in 1989 on the basis of providing 550 pupil places in the new building.  An education work sheet was completed by the school authorities and a schedule of accommodation was drawn up for the school. However, as with all such major projects in planning, it was necessary in 1990 to carry out a detailed review of the proposals in view of declining demographic <Col N="990" /> trends which have become evident throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A review of the figures by the Department of Education suggested that the capacity of the school be reduced to 500 and that planning proceed on that basis. Subsequently it was decided that the original enrolment capacity of 550 should stand to ensure pupil places for a six year cycle and VPTP courses.  Accordingly, a revised schedule of accommodation for 550 pupils issued to the design team in November 1990.  The new building will be located on the site which is owned by the vocational education committee. Transfer of this site to the Minister for Education will be necessary.</P>
    <P>The document on the first stage of planning was submitted to the Department of Education by the design team in November 1990 and was examined by departmental technical and professional advisers.  Following discussions with the design team, approval was given to proceed to the next stage of planning in July 1991.  The submission on this stage is expected from the design team fairly soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister fully appreciates the difficulties currently affecting Carrick-on-Shannon vocational school and the anxieties expressed by teachers and parents of pupils attending the school.  The Minister is satisfied that the most practical and feasible way to deal with the problem is to ensure that no effort will be spared in providing the community school to cater for all the pupils of the Carrick-on-Shannon area at the earliest possible time.  The Department of Education will be pressing ahead with this project.</P>
    <P>Carrick-on-Shannon is a beautiful town and I hope they will be able to get a school appropriate to the needs of that very attractive town.</P>

      <P>The House will hear two minute statements on matters <Col N="991" /> appropriate to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I propose to call on Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Deasy in respect of matters to be put to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and Deputy Gerry Reynolds in respect of a matter to be raised with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Each Deputy is entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and each statement will be followed immediately by a two minute reply from the appropriate Minister or Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the dispute between ERAD and the vets, the majority of herds were not tested during the normal round of testing in 1991.  This has resulted in a major problem for farmers who want to sell off cattle now as they are required by the Department to undergo a full herd test before selling. This is causing major hardship for farmers in the middle of the calving season. In many cases pregnant cows have to be pinned and needled on the same day they calve.  This results in the loss of calves and is causing major disruption in farmyards. Because of this requirement many farmers are waiting for cows to calve before they sell off cattle and this results in serious financial problems for many farmers and a loss of income at a crucial period.</P>
      <P>Farmers in intensive dairying areas like North Kerry are particularly affected. The Minister should allow farmers to carry out private testing on the cattle they wish to sell and the remainder of the herd could have the compulsory test in May. This is a very unfair imposition on farmers.  They paid over £30 million in levies in 1991 for the disease eradication scheme.  The blame for the breakdown in testing in 1991 does not rest with the farmers.  The Minister and ERAD must share the major portion of the blame.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene in this matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="992" /> thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>In the first instance I refute the suggestion that there is any hardship caused to farmers by the current interim testing arrangements which require that herd owners wishing to dispose of stock must have a full herd test unless their herd has been tested within the previous 12 months.  This herd test which is, of course, free of charge to the herd owner, was first introduced last year to provide farmers with the opportunity to retain their clear herd status.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a full round of testing in 1991 because of ongoing discussions with the Irish Veterinary Union in regard to meeting the conditions set by the Commission for EC funding, a number of herds have not had a test within the previous 12 months.  In accordance with EC health and trade requirements and in the best interests of the agricultural economy, ERAD could not approve movement from such herds without a full herd test.</P>
      <P>I also understand that, on veterinary grounds, there is no evidence to support suggestions of hardship to heavy or pregnant animals being tested at this time of the year.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the present ERAD arrangements are due to end in April.  In line with the Governments <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> I am at present having discussions with the leaders of the farming and veterinary organisations to evaluate the operation of ERAD since its inception in 1988 and with a view to designing the shape and scope of future eradication programmes.  I am very much encouraged by the response of the various interests concerned and I am optimistic that a consensus can be reached on the type of programme to be put in place for the next four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inquire about the Leader Programme.  This is a very worthy series of projects funded primarily by the EC and designed to provide badly needed jobs in rural Ireland.  This programme <Col N="993" /> was to be set in train in 1991 and a number of communities got together and put forward a series of projects.  I understand that the total number of schemes forwarded to the Department of Agriculure and Food was about 34 and initially we were led to believe that ten or 12 would be grant aided partially by the EC and partially by the Government.  The final list of successful applicants has yet to be published.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to enlighten me tonight as to what has happened.  I understand that some countries, such as Portugal and Greece, may not have taken up their full allocation of funds, the extra moneys may have become available for Ireland and that instead of a list of ten or 12 being deemed eligible, the number may have been as high as 17.</P>
      <P>Waterford Foods co-ordinated the project for Waterford and the bulk of the individual projects were based in west Waterford. which is such a well known unemployment black spot that it was included in the pilot scheme instigated last year by the Department of Labour. Has that list been vetted, finalised and forwarded to Brussels by the Department? Has the Waterford project been included?  If not, is there any prospect of its being included?  There are over 200 jobs involved.</P>

      <P>Leader is the EC Commission's initiative on rural development.  It is an excellent scheme, not least because it backs and supports local initiative and comes in behind what local co-operative groups and voluntary bodies think is best for deprived areas.  There was a most encouraging response to the programme and it was not possible for all applicant groups to be selected for funding in the first tranch.  Of the 34 plans submitted to the Commission, 17 are being approved for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently my colleague, Minister Woods, made a point of meeting representatives of the non-selected groups, including Waterford, and urged them to <Col N="994" /> remain in existence and to explore sources of funding for some at least of their projects through existing programmes or schemes.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, depending on the success of the first initiative, there will be a successor to Leader in which the latter groups will have a further opportunity of seeking funding for their business plans. I assure Deputy Deasy that I will continue to press for the inclusion of a full number of groups and for a positive response in relation to groups with viable projects submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of insurance costs for young drivers has been raised on many occasions.  The Government have failed dismally in trying to provide adequate employment for our young and well educated work force.  Many people are forced to emigrate, but those who stay are penalised by a brutally unfair system of motor insurance.  I live ten miles from Northern Ireland and have seen on Ulster Television advertisements by garages selling cars offering free comprehensive insurance cover for 12 months.  The average cost of comprehensive insurance in Northern Ireland is between £200 and £500.  The average cost in the Republic is between £1,500 and £2,000 for the same cover.  The latest publicised case of our unrealistic system of insurance was last week when Andrew Strong was quoted the incredible price of £10,000 for insurance on a Porsche car which was given to him by his record company.  That was some commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about keeping our young people at home but if Andrew Strong, or anybody like him, needed an incentive to leave this country, the prohibitive and penal cost of motor insurance would certainly be a factor all on its own.  The Government have commissioned a report on the motor insurance industry and the cost to young drivers.  I would like to ask the Minister when this report will be made public and what immediate plans he and his Department have to try to establish fair and equitable motor <Col N="995" /> insurance cover for the young people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised here many times.  The fact that there is a problem has been acknowledged and the reasons given many times. The fundamental causes of high insurance costs for motorists, including young drivers, should be well known and they have been discussed on frequent occasions in this House.  I would particularly refer the Deputy to the contributions which both the Minister for the Environment and I made here on 2 and 3 July last.  These contributions included a comprehensive list of measures to improve the environment for motor insurance, including insurance for young drivers, identified by the inter-ministerial group on motor insurance and subsequently endorsed by Government.</P>
      <P>The measures, announced but not yet implemented, including the introduction of the necessary legislation by the Ministers for the Environment and Justice, are being given priority attention.  The Deputy will appreciate that questions about road traffic legislation and legislation in relation to the courts are properly addressed to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The measures identified by the inter-ministerial group on motor insurance have the objective of improving the environment for insurance, particularly motor insurance.  The extent to which this objective is achieved will depend on the timing and the scope of their implementation and the impact which implemented measures will have on the frequency and cost of insurance claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any market the price of motor insurance is substantially determined by the cost of claims and level of claims.  An EC-wide survey carried out by a French research company in 1990, based on a selection of family cars, found that Ireland had the highest third party motor insurance rates in the EC, whilst Irish comprehensive rates were the third <Col N="996" /> highest in the EC.  In both instances the survey indicated that the Irish rates were substantially in excess of the EC average. In addition research by my Department suggests that the average cost of motor insurance claims in Ireland is considerably higher than most of the other EC member states.  I have recently reconstituted the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and I have asked them to carry out an up-to-date survey on comparisons between premium and claims rates per registered vehicle in Ireland and those obtaining in other European countries.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years insurers have suffered large underwriting losses on their motor accounts.  In 1988 insurers sustained underwriting losses of £48 million. These losses increased to £116 million in 1989 and to £130 million in 1990. Confronted with these losses, and in order to maintain their viability, insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premium in line with their claims experienced and to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken. The cost of these claims can only be met by an insurer if an appropriate premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved.</P>
    <P>I would point out that unless and until the claims experience, including the claims frequency and levels of compensation paid to victims of road accidents, in Ireland matches that obtaining in other European countries there will be divergencies between motor insurance premia in Ireland and those applying in other countries.</P>
    <P>That is the root of the problem.  We insist through our legal system on paying ourselves many times what would be paid in another country for a similar injury and as a result we have premiums which are many times what they are in other countries.  When we cure the legal problems and the problems associated with the award system, we will cure the problems of which the Deputy rightly complains.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 February 1992.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the reply I gave to Questions Nos. 88 and 89 on 28 May last in which I indicated that I had been informed by the Garda authorities that the incidence of drinking in public places was not such as to give rise to serious concern and that I had no proposals to amend the law to prohibit drinking in public places as the existing laws on public order were considered adequate to deal effectively with any particular difficulties that might arise <Col N="801" /> because of persons drinking to excess. That remains the position.</P>
      <P>I would add that prior to the introduction of the 1988 Intoxicating Liquor Act, problems were experienced with regard to drinking by under-aged persons in public places.  The Act contains new and quite specific provisions to deal with that matter and I understand from the Garda authorities that those measures are having a beneficial effect.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question may relate to drinking and associated problems in public parks, I would direct the Deputy's attention to the reply by the Minister for the Environment on 23 October 1991 last outlining a specific provision in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, increasing penalties for public health nuisances and breaches of bye-laws made by local authorities.</P>

      <P>The security arrangements in operation at cash holding centres are the subject of constant review by the banks in consultation with the Garda Síochána. However, following the Waterford robbery, in which £2.75 million approximately was taken, I asked the Garda authorities to ensure that a further review of these arrangements was carried out as a matter of urgency.  As a result, a special meeting was held of representatives of the main banking groups, the Central Bank and the Garda authorities at which the levels of security, including the security of buildings, were discussed.  The Garda authorities will continue to discuss with the bank what further action might be taken.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy McCartan's question concerning the Garda investigation of the crime, the position is that it has never been the practice for Ministers for Justice to report to the House on the progress of specific Garda investigations and I do not intend to depart from that practice.  All I will say is that the investigation is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy O'Shea's question, I am informed by the Garda authorities that media reports to the effect that the Garda were aware in advance of a plot to rob the cash holding centre at Waterford are incorrect.  Therefore, the question of special surveillance measures being taken in relation to the centre last <Col N="804" /> year, or accordingly of any such surveillance having been withdrawn, did not arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 51, 126 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons but legislation will be required to enable it to be ratified.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to achieving the basic humanitarian purpose of the Convention.  A major difficulty so far as this country is concerned is the potential imbalance between the numbers who might seek transfer into this country and the number who might seek transfer out.  It is estimated that there are up to 1,000 Irish nationals in foreign prisons, of which there are up to 500 in prisons on the British mainland, who could qualify for transfer to this country under the Convention.  On the other hand there are no more than 40 or so prisoners in this country who could qualify for transfer out.  While it is impossible to predict accurately the number of Irish nationals in prison abroad who would wish to return here, even low levels of transfer would pose a substantial problem for us because of the lack of spare prison accommodation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that an arrangement should be made to meet the more urgent and deserving cases and my intention, therefore, is to propose that we would ratify the Convention on a basis which would limit the excess of inward over outward transfers to small proportions.  I understand that ratification of the Convention on such a basis should be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department already have a very long list of priority legislation on hands and while I am conscious of the need for urgency, and intend to give ratification of the Convention as much priority as possible, I cannot at this stage say when <Col N="806" /> the required draft legislation will be finalised.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the 1992 Law Enforcement Package which I published in December 1991 and in which I outlined the approach and the measures that would be taken this year in preserving law and order and protecting the community against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, in relation to urban crime I announced that there would be an increased emphasis by all the agencies under my aegis, but in particular the Garda, on practical measures to deal with crime problems being experienced in certain urban areas.  I also mentioned that a multi-disciplinary approach will be taken to the underlying problems of certain areas under particular pressure and that this approach will be based in part on the <Col N="807" /> advice of a recently established interdepartmental group of senior officials and gardaí which has already commenced its examination of the issues involved.  In addition, the Garda assessment of policing requirements in areas of greatest difficulty will be updated on a continuing basis so that effective response can be provided as and when required.</P>
    <P>Practical policing measures being taken by the Garda authorities to deal with the situation in Dublin involve closer co-ordination and use of foot and mobile patrols and checkpoints, greater deployment of plainclothes surveillance units and increased targeting of Garda resources to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas.</P>
    <P>The role to be played by the community is of course vital also.  In this respect the Garda authorities have informed me that they are continuing to promote the neighbourhood watch programme which encourages the community to be vigilant to the danger of crime, to work closely with the Garda and to take appropriate measures to protect their homes and their property.  There are now 801 neighbourhood watch schemes involving 166,975 households in the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the situation in Dublin as elsewhere is being kept under constant review by the Garda authorities and all appropriate action is being taken by them to effectively tackle crime in this country.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current costs of services provided by the Garda Síochána for the security of bank moneys are not readily available and I am of the view that to ask the Garda authorities to specially compile them would require the expenditure of Garda time to an extent that could not be warranted. It was the practice some years ago to compile what was described as &ldquo;approximate figures&rdquo; for costs for cash shipments for banks or other privately-owned financial institutions and I can inform the Deputy that the last such figure &mdash; complied in 1986 &mdash; suggests that the total cost, at the time, was something in excess of £1 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now, the costs of these services have been met from public funds. However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Finance announced in his recent Budget Statement that he proposed to seek a contribution from the <Col N="809" /> banks towards the costs to the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces of providing these services and that he was making a provision of £2 million in 1992 for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I have already announced that it is my intention to reconstitute the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds as a semi-State body.  This will give the Registries a commercial orientation and will enable them to provide the type of fast and <Col N="810" /> efficient service which the public are entitled to expect.</P>
      <P>Increased investment in the registries will be essential to the attainment of this enhanced level of service to the public. Substantial additional finance is being provided for the registries this year for a programme of computerisation of procedures and to recruit extra staff to tackle arrears.  The Land Registration (Fees) Order, 1991, to which the Deputy refers, is a vital element in this process, in that it will ensure that the finance necessary will be available for the computerisation programme, the elimination of arrears and the other measures necessary to enhance the service provided by the registries.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, it is the first increase in fees chargeable by the Land Registry since 1984.  Over that period the consumer price index rose by some 36 per cent and the new order provides for an approximate overall increase of 25 per cent in fees, with effect from 1 April 1992.</P>
      <P>Already services are improving.  For example, in the case of dealings, the main business of the Land Registry, I am informed by the registrar that the arrears of uncompleted dealings in the Land Registry have been reduced by 7 per cent over the last two years and that the average delay in completion of dealings has been reduced from 8.5 months to 6.4 months over the same period.  A further improvement of the situation with regard to arrears and delays at the registry can be expected at the end of this year arising from the new programme of arrears clearance which is under way at the registry.</P>

      <P>I should like, first, to make the point that, with rare exceptions, releases before the expiry dates of sentences are by way of temporary release under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  Such releases are always subject to conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temporary release may be granted for a variety of reasons.  It may be granted on compassionate grounds, for example, at Christmas and for family occasions.  It may also be granted for resocialisation purposes or to enable a prisoner to take up employment or to attend an educational or training course and so on. From time to time the pressure on prison accommodation is such as to require recourse to temporary release but statistical information is not kept in such a <Col N="812" /> form as to facilitate identification of cases where this was a factor.</P>
    <P>All decisions to grant temporary release are made with due regard to the length of sentence, the nature of the offence, the length of time served, behaviour while in custody and the safety of the public.  Temporary releases are conditional on good behaviour and may be subject to conditions related to supervision by the probation and welfare service or reporting to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The total number of persons granted periods of temporary release was in the region of 4,000 for each of the years 1988 to 1990.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to assure the Deputy that there are no circumstances in which pressure on accommodation will be allowed to affect the ability of the prisons to retain in custody persons convicted of serious offences who could, if released, be a danger to the community.</P>

      <P>The wealth of an individual making an application for naturalisation is not a consideration, except in the context that it may be considered that a wealthy person is less likely to become a burden on the State than somebody who demonstrably cannot support himself.  The statutory conditions which must be complied with by an applicant for naturalisation relate to the character of the applicant, residence here etc. and are set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956-86.  Compliance with these conditions does not confer an entitlement to naturalisation, the grant of which is, under the legislation, at the absolute discretion of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Regulations under section 5 of the Act, specifying in detail the procedures to be followed by the Garda Síochána in the taking of samples for forensic testing, are needed before a commencement order is <Col N="815" /> made to bring the Act into operation. The regulations are in the process of being prepared and will shortly be made by me together with the commencement order.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I wish to repudiate the suggestion which seems to be implied in the question that the fact that the Act is not in operation has prevented the Garda from making use of the genetic fingerprinting test.  The test has been carried out in the course of Garda investigations where the person did not object to the taking of the sample.  The purpose of the Act, which of course deals with the taking of bodily samples for all forensic testing, including genetic fingerprinting, is to regulate the procedures for the taking of these samples and to allow inferences to be drawn by a court in subsequent proceedings from a refusal to allow a bodily sample to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Garda crime statistics are not maintained in a way which would show the proportion of criminal cases in which the victims were women and consequently it is not possible to say whether the proportion of such cases is increasing or decreasing.</P>
      <P>What can be said, however, is that there is, worldwide, a discernible increase in awareness that the incidence of criminal attacks on women &mdash; simply because they are women &mdash; is a problem of significant proportions.  Side by side with the increased awareness of the problem is a growing determination on the part of law enforcement agencies &mdash; including the Garda Síochána &mdash; to tackle it with every means at their disposal.</P>
      <P>An essential step in dealing with the issue is that it be brought out into the open and discussed.  I have already announced, as part of my Law Enforcement Package for 1992, that violence against women will be the subject of specific attention by law enforcement agencies this year and, as part of this endeavour, I have arranged that a national conference on the subject will be held later in the year which will be addressed by experts from this country and elsewhere.  This, I expect, will make a significant contribution to enlightened debate on the matter and improved understanding of what we need to do, as a society, in order to deal effectively with it.</P>
      <P>I have also of course had the opportunity of introducing some very important legislative measures in this field such as the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 and, more recently, the Criminal Evidence Bill.  The Bill sets out to protect the victims of domestic violence by clearly establishing the circumstances in which the spouse of an accused is competent or compelled to give evidence.  For example, a wife will be obliged to give evidence for the prosecution if her husband is accused of violence against her or of violence or a sexual offence against a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to attacks on the elderly, I am pleased to say that the measures <Col N="817" /> taken by the Garda authorities to deal with the problem have proved to be very effective in that there was a 90 per cent decrease in the level of such attacks recorded in the period 1984-90.  While 1991 figures are not yet available the indications are that there has been no change in this situation.  There is no such thing of course as an acceptable level of attacks on the elderly and the Garda are taking every possible measure to prevent these crimes occurring and to detect and apprehend those responsible for such acts.  The Garda authorities, in conjunction with Muintir na Tíre, are continuing to promote the community alert scheme which is the rural equivalent of neighbourhood watch and which involves local people maintaining contact with elderly people and bringing any suspicious circumstances to the notice of the Garda.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are now 357 community alert schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In addition the successful community policing scheme, which was put into place in 100 rural stations last September, has enabled the Garda to spend more time on operational duties including in particular visits to the elderly.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the problem of attacks on the elderly is being effectively tackled.  Fully recognising, as they do, however, that there are no grounds for complacency, the situation must be and will be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>Finally with regard to overall crime detection rates for the years 1986-90 the position is as follows:</P>

      <P>The question of possible harmonisation of areas of the criminal law applying in this State and Northern Ireland, which might with benefit be harmonised, has been discussed within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.  Harmonisation of the criminal law, of course, raises complex issues requiring detailed consideration and can only be achieved over time.  One area, in which progress has already been achieved recently is the law on criminal damage.  The Criminal Damage Act, 1991, has closely aligned the law on criminal damage to tangible property with that applicable in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Further progress towards greater harmonisation will be made as appropriate as the Government's programme of law reform &mdash; which includes a number of proposals to update the criminal law &mdash; is given effect.</P>

    <P>The number of certificates issued in 1990 for income tax is low compared to the numbers for the other years because the initiation of enforcement in relation to the 1989-90 tax year was deferred until examination of tax returns for that tax year was completed by inspectors of taxes in 1991.  The change to a current year basis of assessment for income tax from tax year 1990-91 onwards reinforced this shift in timing.</P>

      <P>This House has a right to a wide range of information about the activities of the Revenue Commissioners and I would wish to respect this right to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to my knowledge, this House has never overturned the established practice that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about an individual or company's tax affairs, other than where the Deputy <Col N="823" /> asking the question was acting on behalf of the taxpayer.  It is my understanding that this is not the case in the present instance.  In the circumstances, therefore, I regret that I must accept the advice of the Revenue Commissioners that the specific information sought should not be divulged.</P>
    <P>I will say, however, that I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the normal taxation procedures which they would apply in such cases are being applied in this particular instance.</P>

      <P>My direct responsibility for recruitment relates to the Civil Service only.  Open competitions for the Civil Service are held by the Civil Service Commission and are advertised by them in the national daily newspapers.  Of course these newspapers are available not only in Ireland but also in some parts of the UK, the USA and elsewhere.  Certain professional and technical vacancies are also advertised in periodicals which circulate abroad.  The commission do not advertise in newspapers published abroad as a general practice and they consider that such a practice would have major cost and administrative implications.  However they receive many applications from emigrants in response to their advertisements for vacancies in the national newspapers as illustrated in the following table which shows the number of candidates who applied to sit in centres outside the State in recent competitions for administrative officer-third secretary.</P>

A prohibition order was made, in accordance with normal practice at the time, to prevent felling unless a licence was issued.  The county council was notified in the normal manner and kept fully informed of the position in relation to the application.</P>
      <P>The powers available to the Minister under the Forestry Acts are aimed at encouraging forestry and the application of sound silvicultural practices in the establishment, management and exploitation of forests and woodlands.  In accordance with these provisions the Minister carefully examined the application for a felling licence.  The trees identified for felling are approximately 250 years old and generally are no longer considered vigorous and would not for the future be regarded as an essential component of a viable and sustainable woodland.  Removal of over mature trees is also essential for further growth and development of the younger understory of hardwood trees which along with new planting will form the next generation of mature woodland.  Sufficient large trees will be retained to enhance the appearance and landscape value of the woodland.</P>
      <P>After extensive discussions between my Department's professional advisers and the applicant and consultation with Wicklow County Council, a programme was devised which would permit, on a phased basis and subject to strict conditions, the felling of specific trees, together with work which will lead to the rejuvenation and regeneration of the Tomnafinnoge area of Coolattin Woods without undue disruption of landscape and amenity value and ensure a viable native woodland for the benefit of future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> In accordance with this programme, on 13 December 1991 I issued a licence for the felling of 323 trees to be carried out over at least one year, subject to replanting and other conditions.  The prohibition on felling the remaining trees without a licence remains.  The issue of a further licence will be subject to satisfactory compliance with the work programme and conditions attached to the current licence, including retention of all immature trees, clearing of undergrowth and, where necessary, replanting with hardwood species.</P>
    <P>The preservation of woodlands or individual trees for amenity or landscape purposes is the responsibility of the relevant local authority, in this case, Wicklow County Council.  The tree preservation order issued by Wicklow County Council applies to the trees subject to the felling licence as well as to other trees so that it is a matter for Wicklow County Council to take a decision in relation to its own order whether felling can go ahead.</P>
    <P>It is not normal practice to make any felling licence generally available and in the circumstances, I am not prepared to make this licence available to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The safety and welfare of both our Garda and military contingents serving with the United Nations in Angola is a matter to which the Government attach considerable importance.  As I indicated in my contribution to the Adjournment debate on 27 November 1991, the Department of Foreign Affairs have pressed the case at the UN in New York for improved living and working conditions for UNAVEM personnel, and senior officials from my Department and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence have met the Under Secretary General of the UN in Dublin to impress on him the need for immediate action to bring about the necessary improvements.</P>

      <Col N="842" /> The Garda surgeon visited Angola at the end of November and the issues raised in his report, such as the need to upgrade UN provision for medical care, have been taken up specifically with the United Nations.  Even though the consensus among contributing countries to the UNAVEM mission is that conditions in Angola have improved in recent months, the Department of Foreign Affairs are continuing to highlight the need for further improvement in mission conditions as identified by Irish personnel.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in hand for a senior Garda officer to visit Irish personnel in Angola this month and report on these conditions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>At present, there is no recognised training course in chiropody provided by any approved third level, or other, educational institution within the State.  The question of providing such a course was examined in broad principle some years ago and my Department have recently been in contact with the Department of Education with a view to both Departments undertaking an updated review of this matter along with the Higher Education Authority.  There is a school of chiropody in Belfast which is recognised by the United Kingdom Department of Health and by the national health service.</P>
      <P>Health boards do provide chiropody services for patients with full eligibility and such services are largely provided by self employed chiropodists who act as contractors to the health board by way of providing sessions, and so on on an agency basis.  There is a listing of chiropodists who have been approved, in respect of provision of such services to health boards, by the assessment and advisory committee on chiropody, established in 1975 with the approval of the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>I am at the moment looking at the question of the establishment of an assessment board which would assess those who have not attended a formal recognised training course in the UK or an equivalent course elsewhere and who wish to undertake work for health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the European <Col N="860" /> Community would prohibit the granting of preference to Irish nationals, or to persons trained within the State, as regards either appointments to posts under health boards or access to provision of services on an agency basis.</P>

      <P>The provision of hospital services and general practitioner services for eligible patients in this area is a matter for the Midland Health Board in the first instance.  I have made inquiries in the matter and it appears that the position is that the general hospital in Tullamore has undergone a major expansion of its <Col N="862" /> services in recent times.  No provision was made or a commensurate increase in the secretarial services normally associated with the level of service now being provided. This resulted in the build up of arrears of work in the latter half of last year in the secretarial area, particularly in relation to the letters and notes to which the Deputy's question refers.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the Midland Health Board have taken action to remedy the situation in this case by redeploying staff from other areas.  The revised arrangments came into being on 6 January 1992 and the position now is that current work is up-to-date and the board expect that arrears which had built up prior to 6 January will be cleared shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>I regard the HIPE scheme as crucial for effective management and planning of health services.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the quality of data collected is good and this has been confirmed in independent studies.</P>
      <P>Of a total of 63 acute public hospitals 49 are currently supplying HIPE data and a further three are being prepared for entry into the scheme and will be supplying data shortly.  Perinatal data from the six maternity hospitals are collected separately by the perinatal reporting system and gynaecological data will be collected on HIPE this year.  Therefore, only five hospitals, all of which are small units, are not participating and it is planned to bring these hospitals into the scheme in the course of this year.</P>
      <P>I recognise that there are problems in relation to the comprehensiveness of coverage.  Many hospitals, including some of the large health board regional hospitals, are supplying complete data on all their discharges, which, I am satisfied, clearly demonstrates the technical capability of the scheme to collect and process large volumes of data where there is full co-operation from hospitals.  I wish to make it clear that I expect full co-operation from all hospitals in view of the importance of the data in question for future decision-making in our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clinical advisory group on HIPE is preparing a report for me on additional measures which can be taken to improve <Col N="864" /> the scheme and to encourage greater use of the data, and I will act on the report without delay immediately I receive it.</P>

      <P>The alternative proposals submitted by the parents action committee to accommodate the boys of St. Patricks and St. Fintans national schools in Bandon, County Cork have been examined and costed by my Department.

      <Quest>his views on the accuracy of the reported strength of the FCÁ; if any test or unannounced check is ever conducted to validate the returns; whether he considers that the present system of funding for units does not encourage the marking up of non-effective members and thereby prevent recruitment of active personnel; and if he considers that this practice leads to demoralisation among the active FCÁ personnel.</Quest>

      <P>At FCÁ unit level the strength of units is recorded in prescribed roll books which are inspected and checked by command FCÁ headquarters' staff at intermittent intervals throughout the year.  Further checks are undertaken by the Department in connection with the issue of grants to unit funds.  The manner in which members may be declared non-effective and struck off the effective strength is set out in Defence Force Regulations.</P>
      <P>Grants are payable annually to unit funds subject to certain maximum amounts prescribed in Defence Force Regulations.  The strength position of units is taken into account in determining the grant payable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>Defence Force Regulations A.7 makes the following provisions in regard to the examination of complaints by members of the Defence Forces:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Complaints by officers and men &mdash; transmission of.</P>
      <P>11A. (1)  A commanding officer who receives a complaint from an officer addressed to the Minister shall acknowledge its receipt in writing and shall forward it, through the normal military channels, to the Adjutant-General who shall transmit it to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> (2)  A commanding officer who receives a complaint from a man addressed to the Adjutant-General shall forward it, through the normal military channels, to the Adjutant-General.</P>
    <P>(3)  When forwarding a complaint from an officer or man in accordance with subparagraph (1) or (2) hereof, a commanding officer shall attach to such complaint a report on any investigations carried out by him in regard to the matter complained of and shall indicate in such report the reasons he did not deal with the complaint to the satisfaction of the complainant.  He shall attach to such report any documents relevant to the complaint.</P>
    <P>(4)  Each authority above a commanding officer through whom a complaint is forwarded in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall, if satisfied as to the justice of the complaint, take, without delay, such steps as lie within his power and as may be necessary for giving full redress to the complainant in the matter complained of.  Where such authority is forwarding a complaint to the next highest authority, he shall attach thereto a statement of his views on the matter and of the steps, if any, taken by him towards having redress given to the complainant.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every complaint made pursuant to section 114 of the Act shall be dealt with at every stage with the utmost despatch.</P>
    <P>Notification of outcome of complaints.</P>
    <P>11B. (1)  In every case where a complaint is made to a company commander, a commanding officer or the Adjutant-General, the complainant shall be informed of the action taken by such company commander, commanding officer or the Adjutant-General in regard to the matter complained of.  If the complainant so requests, such information shall be conveyed to him in writing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> (2)  In every case where a complaint has been made to the Minister, the complainant shall be informed of the Minister's decision in regard to the matter complained of.  If the complainant so requests, such information shall be conveyed to him in writing by his commanding officer.</P>
    <P>(3)  The decision of the Minister on any complaint shall be final.</P>
    <P>The procedures described provide for a thorough investigation of complaints through a number of levels and the time taken to complete the process is dependent on the complexity of the matters raised and the option of the complainant to invoke the various steps involved.  Personnel who process applications for redress of wrongs appreciate the need for expedition consistent with the fullest investigation of complaints.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 39 of 4 December 1991 I am at present reviewing the procedures dealing with redress of wrongs.  Any proposed changes will be discussed with the representative associations.</P>

      <P>In 1985 the remit of the Ombudsman was extended to cover complaints relating to Telecom Éireann.  He is the appropriate authority to receive and investigate any complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, significant numbers of complaints are not made to the Department or Minister.  Any complaints received are passed on either to Telecom <Col N="879" /> Éireann or to the Ombudsman as appropriate. Details of the complaints made to the Ombudsman each year are published by him in his annual report.</P>
