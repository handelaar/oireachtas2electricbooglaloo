      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6 to 53, inclusive, 59, 60 and A1, and that A1 shall be taken at 3.45 p.m. today.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal that Nos. 6 to 53, inclusive, shall be decided by one question and that A1 shall be decided without debate agreed? Agreed. Are the arrangements for dealing with Second Stages of Nos. 59 and 60 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the Committee Stage of this legislation should be taken in one and a quarter hours. More time should be given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the proposal is agreed, with Deputy Roger Garland dissenting. Agreed. Are the proposals for dealing with the remaining Stages of Nos. 59 and 60 agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. (3) refers to the Committee and remaining Stages of Nos. 59 and 60 which are two very important matters with which the House is dealing. I would remind the House that when we were dealing with the SEA we had a day to deal with the Committee and remaining Stages; that in 1983 we also had a day to deal with the Committee and remaining Stages of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. We have been repeatedly told in this House that the amendment to the Constitution with which we are dealing now is the most important since we adopted an amendment to our Constitution to enable us to join the Community in 1972. It is grossly inadequate to allow 75 minutes to debate the substantive issues that arise from the nine amendments I have already put down to this Bill. I do not know whether any other party have put down amendments. So far the debate on Second Stage, as is normal, has dealt with the principles of entry to the European Union. This House not only has a right <Col N="615" /> but an obligation to examine the details of what is being proposed. This morning there has been circulated to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy. I must dissuade you from making a speech. An indication of opposition is quite sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be regarded as sufficient by the Chair but the fact is we are being asked to deal with two Bills one of which seeks to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has allowed the Deputy some discretion in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one final point to make, a Cheann Comhairle. There was this morning delivered to us a supplement to the White Paper on the Treaty on European Union relating to the Patents Bill &mdash; this single sheet of paper I am holding up &mdash; which explains Government thinking in relation to the Patents Bill. Apart from the fact that it is a grossly inept way of dealing with these serious matters, it is not good enough to allow 75 minutes to debate its content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is opposing the proposal. I am now putting the proposal to the House.</P>
      <P>The question is: &ldquo;That the proposals for dealing with the remaining Stages of Items Nos. 59 and 60 be agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Finally, on the Order of Business I must ask if the proposals for tomorrow's sitting, including the proposal for dealing with statements, is agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach when it is intended to take the Second Stage of the Family Planning Bill, which was published last September, nine months ago, and promised to be taken in the House last October, eight months ago? May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that the delays in taking this legislation cast doubt on any promises made by the Government to deal at any particular time with difficult social questions? If the Government wish their statements on other social questions to be believed they must show willingness to face this issue quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy will be dealt with by the Government in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that we are talking here about legislation which has already been published and in the possession of the House and that it is simply a question of the Government allowing the House time to deal with it? This matter does not require a Government meeting. May I ask the Taoiseach why the Government will not allow the House to deal with that legislation which they published nine months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few months the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications has announced that she will make a decision on the Shannon stopover issue. I notice that in today's newspapers she says she will make this decision shortly. May I ask the Taoiseach if the Government have made a decision on this matter and when an announcement will be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is clearly not appropriate to the Order of Business unless the Deputy can convince me that legislation is promised in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. May I ask the Taoiseach or some member of the Government to give an explanation why the supplement on the Patents Convention was overlooked in the original White Paper on Maastricht as published? Will the Taoiseach indicate whether voters will be given the opportunity of having a separate say on that convention on 18 June or whether only one vote will be sought?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

      <P>Protocol 17 was put into the Maastricht Treaty at the request of the Irish side with the express intention of giving an added assurance to Irish voters that Europe could not impose legalised abortion in Ireland in contravention of Article 40.3.3º of our Constitution. Subsequent to the signing of the Treaty on 7 February this year, the events of the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case caused confusion in relation to Irish law on these matters and it remains the responsibility of this House to legislate for whatever changes in Irish law it deems necessary to deal with the situation. These measures could have been introduced prior to or subsequent on the holding of the Maastricht referendum. Because of the time required to agree on legislative proposals which would cover all the issues which had arisen in connection with the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case the Government decided to proceed with the <Col N="633" /> Maastricht referendum first and to come forward with their legislative proposals to deal with the issues arising from the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case in the autumn, prior to the coming into force of the Treaty on 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Parliamentary Party fully support the decision made by the Government to proceed with the Maastricht Treaty referendum before dealing with the unsatisfactory situation that has arisen following the court's decision in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case. Furthermore, we are firmly of the view that it is now imperative that the full attention be focused on the merits and implications of voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for Maastricht on 18 June. The Government have made their decision in this matter and will have the support of a majority of the Members of this House for that decision if there is any division on the matter. Along with our Coalition partners we will diligently apply ourselves to establishing the best legislative means available to deal in a compassionate way with the issues that need to be resolved. The parties in Government are jointly committed to bringing forward agreed proposals for decision in the next Dáil session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agenda is set. Our people must decide on 18 June whether we continue to participate fully as a nation in the building of a stronger united European Community, whether we want to continue in a Europe which will be united in economic, social, political and monetary objectives and whether we want to continue in a Europe where we can be full partners with equal European citizenship rights. If we do, we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The alternative is to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to all this progress. If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; we will allow our economy to stagnate in isolation and our people to lose all hope of ever overcoming our major difficulty of unemployment, of improving their standard of living or of attaining greater equality and social justice and of living a more contented, satisfying and poverty-free life. A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will be a vote for optimism <Col N="634" /> and progress. A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote will be a vote for despondency and stagnation.</P>
    <P>It is almost 20 years to the very day since the Irish people voted by referendum to join the European Economic Community. That referendum was held on 10 June 1972 and the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; margin then was 80 per cent. I am confidently expecting a similar percentage to support the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June next.</P>
    <P>Of course, critics of our Community membership can rightly claim that not all the expectations and advances proclaimed as flowing from Community entry have been fully realised. However, nobody can deny that this country has made enormous social and economic advances, which extend also to the welfare of those who are unemployed and disadvantaged in our society. Nor would this have been achieved without the boost in national wealth and income which we directly enjoy through our membership of the Community, and the various legislative changes brought into our own domestic code as a result of the adoption here of Community Law Directives.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats see the 18 June referendum on Maastricht Treaty as something that will deepen and intensify the union of the 12 member states. It will create from January next a single market facilitating the free movement of people, goods, capital and services, and will, I believe, be a more significant milestone development for this country than our initial decision to join the Community in 1972.</P>
    <P>At this stage of our country's development we are inextricably wedded to the European integration process, compared with 1972. Any interruption or disruption of our Community role and participation would have very serious economic consequences for this country. For that, and indeed many other reasons, the Progressive Democrats are enthusiastic advocates of the Maastricht Treaty and deeper European integration. As my Cabinet colleague and our party leader, Deputy Des O'Malley, made clear at our national conference in Waterford last weekend, the Progressive Democrats are a European liberal party and we advocate <Col N="635" /> an open, confident, even generous approach to Europe rather than a begrudging, book-keepers' approach. Moreover our annual conference placed particular emphasis on the vital importance of Maastricht, devoting a very great portion of our deliberations to Europe, and we were also very pleased and honoured that the European Commission Vice-President, Martin Bangemann, took the time to be with us and to address our conference. I believe that his contribution, facilitated by national television coverage, will have brought home very dramatically and positively how the European ideal is genuinely uniting the peoples of the various member states and overcoming cultural, racial and national boundaries. It is enabling us to fulfil the vision of a Community of peoples running from the Aran Islands to the Adriatic and further east.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the amount of confusion, exaggeration and deliberately misleading comment, whether to do with issues like abortion or neutrality in relation to what Maastricht really means, is to be greatly deplored. It certainly is not helping the Irish public to come to a clear understanding of the issues involved in the proposed Treaty, or the objective economic and social merits attaching to it.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats do not claim that the Maastricht Union picture is all rosy. There are undoubted risks and challenges which will face this country after 1 January next, largely arising from our very peripherality, but we are absolutely convinced that the balance of advantage undoutedly lies with our continued and deepening integration as part of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Our dependence as a small island economy on exports of goods and services is almost unique &mdash; 70 per cent of all our exports now go to the other Community member states. That underlines the outstanding significance to this country of monetary union and a single currency which is at the core of what the Maastricht Treaty is all about.</P>
    <P>The removal of all trade barriers giving us direct access to the European market <Col N="636" /> of 340 million, is of inestimable importance. European Monetary Union will eliminate the exchange risk in all our trade with the other EC countries and it will bring huge savings to Irish business. From an investment point of view it is also likely that Irish interest rates will fall towards the lower EC norm over time. This would be good for business, farming and personal borrowers. Put simply our trade with the rest of the Community is Ireland's bread and butter.</P>
    <P>It is undeniable, therefore that our continued full and equal access to the Single Market that will be created from 1 January next, on the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty, is an essential precondition for the continued economic success which we have achieved in this country, and the greater economic growth so essential to tackling the unemployment crisis and the other social problems in our society. There is simply no argument about it. No matter what reservations we might have about Ireland's future within the new European Union, our future within the Community will be undoubtedly much better than any conceivable alternative arrangement if we were left behind in a second division of the Community, or forced to withdraw from it entirely.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that Europe has been the stimulus for very important advances in many social and economic fields here, other than trade and commerce. Greater equality of rights in the workplace and the home between men and women extending to areas like welfare entitlements, equal pay and social security, has come as a direct result of the adoption here of various EC directives. This process will get greater impetus still from the adoption of the proposed Social Charter which forms part of the Maastricht Union Treaty.</P>
    <P>The absolute importance of Community membership for the development of Irish farming is irrefutable, not-withstanding the painful process of adjustment to, and the uncertainty of, the Common Agricultural Policy changes. Whereas 20 years ago, prior to our entry, Ireland depended on Britain <Col N="637" /> for over half our exports, and suffered directly from that country's cheap food policy &mdash; by contrast only 17 per cent of our exports at that time went to the other Community states &mdash; now our exports to Britain constitute just 27 per cent of our total exports, and the other Community countries are taking 42 per cent of our total exports, and that figure is growing every year.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats regard the enhanced sovereignty which Ireland has achieved since our membership in 1973 as being just as important as the social and economic benefits of our membership. Formerly we were too dominated by Britain and our inevitable colonial links with that country. Changes in the British sterling rate automatically affected prices in Ireland and our very economic welfare, but we were not consulted about these changes. We had no such right. We were simply aggrieved bystanders. That is why I simply cannot accept the argument of those critics of European Community membership who claim that Irish sovereignty has been diminished as a consequence of our membership. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Since our entry to the Community in 1973, and more importantly our break with sterling in 1979, allied to the fact that Ireland sits as a co-equal around the table of the 12 member states, Ireland's role, its economic security, and its influence is of immeasurable and enhanced value compared to our position in Europe prior to 1973.</P>
    <P>So what are the economic downsides of Maastricht? The danger that economic power, wealth and industrialisation will concentrate more and more in the Community's richer mainland regions is a matter of serious concern. That is why the development of top-class speedy and efficient transport networks within our own country, and between Ireland and the major European marketplaces is so important. That, of course, too is where the proposed doubled Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund are of enormous significance. The current phase of Structural Funding, likely to total £3 billion <Col N="638" /> by the end of next year, is of enormous importance in helping to improve vital infrastructural links and services in this country. Naturally we look forward to seeing those funds doubled along with the extra assistance of the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are also deeply concerned about the necessity to ensure greater popular accountability within the Community. To that end we want to see greater powers accorded to the Community's only directly elected institution, the European Parliament. We believe that is essential, as more and more powers come to be centered in the Community's executive, namely the Commission, in Brussels, and as the Community deepens in integration terms, that it becomes more democratic and accountable. The European Parliament must be the vehicle for achieving those standards and qualities of accoutability.</P>
    <P>I realise too that many people are concerned about the implications for Ireland's traditional policy of neutrality of any possible role we might be called on to play in any pan-European defence arrangements. As I said earlier, the Progressive Democrats' attitude is not a take-all-and-give-nothing approach. That would grossly undervalue the enormous contribution we can make in virtually every field of Community activity, not least security and defence arrangements for the new Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland is already playing an outstanding role in peace-keeping in some of the world's most notorious trouble spots, like Lebanon and Yugoslavia. We believe, therefore, that it is essential that Ireland be willing to play its part, in time, in the formulation of and any eventual common security and defence arrangements for the new Europe of 1993 and thereafter. But those developments are a long way off, if they happen at all.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable, therefore, that there is so much misleading propaganda, undoubtedly aimed at inciting fear among the electorate, that adoption of the European Union will lead to the creation of a European army and possible <Col N="639" /> conscription in Ireland. This is simply untrue, and there are no such proposals in the Maastricht Treaty. There is no European army and there are no plans to create one within the Treaty. Nor does the Treaty set up a common European defence treaty.</P>
    <P>All decisions on foreign and security policy must be unanimous so Ireland cannot be out-voted. It is intended to hold a further Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 to consider any developments that might arise in the meantime in the area of common defence arrangements, and that will, in turn, require a further referendum here. So there is no question of Ireland now tying its hands in relation to the European security and foreign policy question. It is quite obvious, therefore, in seeking to draw up the inevitable balance sheet on membership, and deepening our integration within Europe from next January, that Ireland's future social and economic welfare is inextricably bound up with Europe.</P>
    <P>The case for our involvement in the new European Union is simply overwhelming, and that is why the Progressive Democrats regret the extent to which the focus on the real economic and social issues underpinning Maastricht has become clouded by what is essentially a domestic controversy about abortion which we must settle ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have already launched a very vigorous pro-Maastricht and pro-Europe campaign. Not only did we make it a major focus of our annual conference in Waterford last weekend, but we have already appointed our MEP Mr. Pat Cox, to direct a national campaign. He has already held a series of public meetings to explain Maastricht in major locations around the country, including my own city of Galway. Further meetings are being arranged by the party all over the country, and we will also be conducting an intensive door-to-door leaflet campaign to get across to the people the vital importance of voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Maastricht on 18 June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party have <Col N="640" /> been unequivocal in this House in their support for the Maastricht Treaty. Since the early years of the European Community and our joining it, Fine Gael have had a coherent and consistent approach to our involvement in this great European adventure and to the role this country should play as part of Europe.</P>
      <P>We have no doubt that our decision to join the EC in 1972 was the correct decision and substantial economic and political advantages have been secured for our people by the decision. We did not, like the Labour Party, lost in irrelevant Marxist rhetoric, oppose our original entry to the European Community. We have at no stage played cynical political games with our involvement in Europe, such as those played by the Fianna Fáil Party in this House on the Single European Act.</P>
      <P>We see the Maastricht Treaty as a further step on the road to achieving a truly federal Europe which will open up new opportunities for our people. The original founders of the European Community saw it as laying down the economic and political foundations for a lasting peace in Europe. It was a response by European democracies to the horrors experienced during the Second World War and a political initiative intended to ensure that this could not be repeated. The continuing evolution of the European Community which came about through the Single European Act, and now through Maastricht, should be seen as the building bricks constructed on the foundations that we originally laid when the Community was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased economic and political co-operation between member states of the European Community has ensured a level of economic and political stability which would not have otherwise come about. The troubles that now beset so many parts of Eastern Europe, which have resulted in the fragmentation of states and the resurgence of ethnic, religious and national rivalries, causing widespread bloodshed and localised wars, are a stark illustration of the type of disaster with which we in Western Europe could have been confronted <Col N="641" /> were it not for the idealism and vision of the founding fathers of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in this House about the direct financial benefits to this State of our continued membership of the Community both prior to and after Maastricht. Particular emphasis has been laid by the Government on the Cohesion and Structural Funds and the Taoiseach's expectation that the country could benefit to the tune of £6 billion in the period 1994-98. Emphasis has also been placed on the value to us of the financial transfers arising under the Common Agricultural Policy and from other areas.</P>
    <P>Too frequently this country's role in Europe is portrayed as that of the beggar holding out the begging bowl to richer states. It must be recognised that in tackling our own domestic economic problems and our jobs crisis the merits of our being involved in Maastricht do not derive solely from financial transfers. They derive from the structures that will endure and ensure continued economic and political stability in Europe and which will provide Irish entrepreneurs easy and ready access to a huge and growing market. It is not good enough for the Government, with a begging bowl mentality, simply to urge support for the Maastricht Treaty. It is not good enough to simply talk of the financial transfers from which this State may benefit post-Maastricht. Indeed, in the light of recent developments in Germany, it might be particularly unwise to put the emphasis on this aspect of the Treaty. Coherent and comprehensive Government policies must be put in place to ensure that the monetary benefits that we do derive are not squandered. If we are to achieve cohesion with the rest of Europe and not to languish among the poorer member states of the European Community, we must undertake radical action to tackle the structural difficulties which have created and exacerbated our jobs crisis.</P>
    <P>We have in this country almost 300,000 unemployed, that is, 21 per cent of the workforce. We have the worst unemployment record in Europe. It is not the fault of the rest of Europe that we have <Col N="642" /> this difficulty. It is our own fault. We have lacked the vision, competence and commitment to confront this huge problem. Joblessness or emigration have touched practically every family in this State. Whilst this Government, and their Fianna Fáil predecessor, commissioned endless reports on the nature of the problem, sadly the Government have shown no capacity to take any of the tough decisions that are required to confront it. Their sole initiative this year has been to establish a Dáil committee which will, I predict, be nothing more than a talking shop and which will still be sitting talking when the numbers unemployed exceed 300,000.</P>
    <P>We will not truly and fully benefit from European political and monetary union until we have a Government prepared to make the domestic decisions necessary to address those aspects of policy which fall within our own domestic political competence. The lack of serious intent on the part of the Government in tackling the unemployment problem is clearly seen in the snide backhanded instant sound-bite response from a so-called &ldquo;Government spokesperson&rdquo; to the Fine Gael policy document <i>The Jobs Economy</i> published last Monday and which sets out a number of substantial initiatives that could be taken by Government towards tackling the jobs crisis.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the defence and security provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. The Taoiseach made a virtue of the fact that the defence provisions pose no immediate threat to our so-called traditional policy of neutrality. He appeared to be responding to those who advocate a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote on the grounds that we should not contribute to or participate in the defence of Europe. I would pose the question, if we are part of Europe what political or high moral principle demands that we opt out of European defence issues? Would it not be better that we participate in the decision-making process than abdicate to others the power to make decisions which in the modern world will inevitably touch our lives? What high moral principle during and <Col N="643" /> after World War II required this State to be neutral on Auschwitz?</P>
    <P>The concept of neutrality, on which we have relied in the past, has been based on no high moral principle but on a political pragmatism and expediency born of an anti-British sentiment and carried on by left-wing politicians into the Cold War era. In the Europe of the nineties this politically redundant and outdated concept of neutrality has and should not have any relevance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the benefits that have accured to women from membership of the European Community. It is correct that Community law ensured equal rights of pay to women, equal opportunities, equal treatment with regard to access to employment and equal treatment under social welfare legislation. The Taoiseach went on to take a rather foolish side-swipe at the former Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government with regard to equality of treatment under a social welfare directive. The Taoiseach should be aware that it was the rather foolish play-acting by Fianna Fáil in Opposition in 1986 which created substantial difficulties for the then Government in applying the equal treatment provision. Instead of focusing on the desirability of providing equal treatment for women, the Fianna Fáil Party, true to form, tried to exploit the issue by suggesting that men would lose out if equal treatment was provided and, effectively, politically blackmailed that Government into providing additional financial payments to men at a time when equal treatment was to be provided to women.</P>
    <P>I should say I am familiar with this area and I should make a declaration of interest, as it is my law firm that has represented hundreds of women since 1986 who rightly claimed that the additional payments which were made to unemployed men at that time should also have been extended to them.</P>
    <P>It has taken a period of five and a half years, and a series of court cases, before the European Court, the High Court and our Supreme Court, for this Government, <Col N="644" /> and their Fianna Fáil predecessor, to finally accept the validity of these claims and to recognise that the action the Fianna Fáil Party took in Opposition in the autumn of 1986 on this issue was contrary to European Community law and turned the principle of equal treatment for women in the social welfare area on its head. In so far as the charge of hypocrisy on this issue can be made, this charge truly rests on the shoulders of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The most extraordinary aspect of the Taoiseach's speech to this House was the absence of a single mention of the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty. The Taoiseach told those present at a press conference on Wednesday week last that he was now taking a vow of silence on the issue. The vow of silence is understandable considering the fact that both he and his Government have been utterly confused and have been talking total nonsense on this issue for some weeks. I regret to say that my constituency colleague, Deputy Kitt, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, continued the trend yesterday in his contribution.</P>
    <P>Protocol 17 should never have been included in the Maastricht Treaty. There was never any possibility that abortion on demand could be imposed upon this State under the European Community Treaties or under the Maastricht Treaty. Nevertheless, the Government, locked into a 1983 political and legal time warp, insisted on its inclusion on the basis that it would ensure that &ldquo;the abortion issue&rdquo; did not become entangled in the referendum campaign. Never has the judgment of a Government on a single issue been proved so wrong so quickly. It is the very existence of this Protocol which has inextricably entangled the abortion issue in the Maastricht referendum. If the Government had not sought the inclusion of such a Protocol the difficulties it has experienced with Maastricht in recent weeks, and the public confusion that has arisen, would never have happened.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has promised that there will be a referendum on the travel and <Col N="645" /> information issues next November and he has, to the alarm of many women, indicated the possibility of a referendum on the substantive issue, that is the termination within this State of a pregnancy where a mother's life is at real and substantial risk. Moreover, the Taoiseach has stated that if the Maastricht referendum is successful, no further injunctions on travel will be sought by the Attorney General. Such injunctions will be sought apparently if it is unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Conflicting legal opinions and views expressed about the implications of the Protocol have totally confused the vast majority of people and, perhaps, this confusion is all part of the Government's plan. A sometime conciliatory and sometime threatening approach and the now silent approach by the Taoiseach to this issue is fuelling peoples' suspicions as to the true commitment of the Government to address these issues and as to the nature of the proposal it may bring forward next November. If the Taoiseach wishes to truly unravel the abortion issues from the Maastricht Treaty he should accept the amendment tabled by Fine Gael to this Bill and publish a Government Bill to deal with the travel and information issues before Second Stage is complete.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's failure to mention this issue in his speech &mdash; his vow of silence &mdash; is extraordinary having regard to the fact that the letter from him contained on the first two pages of the simple leaflet it is intended to distribute to every house in the State in relation to Maastricht gives one half of its content to this issue. It is a typical Fianna Fáil nod and wink communication which attempts to indicate to all shades of opinion that all the issues will be addressed by the Government after Maastricht without saying what particular proposals of substance will be made.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made by the Government of the Solemn Declaration which must be put in context. In the European Court, last October, the Attorney General, on behalf of the State, successfully argued that under the Eighth <Col N="646" /> Amendment to the Constitution the State was entitled to prohibit information. In the recent High Court and Supreme Court case the State's right to restrict travel was also upheld.</P>
    <P>The statement in the Solemn Declaration that the State never intended to rely on Article 40.3.3º or the Protocol to restrict travel or information is, in these circumstances, not only legally absurd but patently untrue. It is of no validity as a guide to the future interpretation of the Protocol by any court and to state, as the Taoiseach did previously in this House, that Article 31 of the Vienna Convention would result in the interpretation contained in the Solemn Declaration being adopted is not, in these circumstances, correct.</P>
    <P>It is also noteworthy that following the Minister for Foreign Affairs failing to obtain agreement from other EC states to an amendment of the Protocol, upon his return to Ireland he stated that a solemn declaration would be of little legal value. The Government are now attributing substantial legal value to the same declaration.</P>
    <P>Moreover, contrary to what the Taoiseach stated, if the Maastricht referendum is successful, as the Treaty cannot become law until 1 January 1993, its success acts as no barrier either to the Government, the Attorney General or a private group or individual seeking further injunctions on the travel or information issue. Its success, however, does mean that if before 1 January 1993, the Government do not by way of referendum address the travel and information issues and if such referendum is not successful not only will the Attorney General in the future be able to seek injunctions and ban women from travelling to other EC states but women will find that their current right to refer such court cases to the European Court is cut off by the Protocol.</P>
    <P>I would hope that at the very minimum the Government would agree to publish the wording of a proposed amendment to be made to the Constitution to deal with the travel and information issues before the vote takes place on the Maastrich <Col N="647" /> Treaty. The Government can also indicate their good faith in this context by telling the House what steps, if any, they intend to take with regard to the case that is due to be heard on 17 July next in the High Court.</P>
    <P>On that date, the case of SPUC v. Grogan will be dealt with. It is in this case that the Attorney General in the European Court, last October, successfully argued that the European Court could not intervene to prevent injunctions being granted to stop students distributing information. The Taoiseach should state whether the Attorney General will intervene in these court proceedings to ask the High Court to remove existing injunctions on the giving of information or whether the Attorney General will support the making of these injunctions permanent. If the Taoiseach is promising no further injunctions after the Maastricht vote, if it is successful he should have little difficulty in clarifying the Government's approach to this court case.</P>
    <P>I have already remarked that the Government's approach on this issue, over the past few weeks, has been confused and contradictory but that that confusion may have been deliberate. It can, I think, be best summed up by a quotation from George Orwell's extraordinary book <i>1984</i> in that it clearly falls within the concept of what Orwell described as &ldquo;double think&rdquo;. He stated that:</P>
    <P>Double think means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and accepting both of them. The party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of double think he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. The process has to be conscious or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and a sense of guilt</P>
    <P>. . . . . The essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while <Col N="648" /> retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while generally believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies &mdash; all this is indispensibly necessary. Even in using the word &ldquo;double think&rdquo; it is necessary to exercise double think. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with realities; by a fresh act of double think, one erases this knowledge...Ultimately, it is by means of double think that the party has been able &mdash; and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years &mdash; to arrest the course of history.</P>
    <P>The party Orwell was speaking of was not, of course, the Fianna Fáil Party. It would be difficult, however, on this or any other issue to find a better statement of political philosophy that so simply and comprehensively describes the approach of Fianna Fáil to substantial and difficult issues of major importance. I have said enough on the issue of the Protocol. If the Government will not deal with this issue properly in advance of the Maastricht referendum, it will be the duty of Members of this House to do everything within their constitutional power to ensure that the Government keep their commitment to address these issues properly in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I would finally on this issue sound a warning specifically to Fianna Fáil that they should not again attempt to politically exploit this issue and mislead the Irish people as they did in 1982 and 1983. The overwhelming majority of people want a constitutional and legislative solution, reached by political consensus and based on the social realities of our current problems. If Fianna Fáil seek to expediently exploit the abortion issue in the context of a general election the people will exact retribution on that party and they will be thrown out of office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> At all times it has been the wish of Fine Gael to address these issues by consensus and not by confrontation. In so far as there has been confrontation it has been caused by the bizarre and contradictory pronouncements and poses adopted by the parties in Government. Unlike Fianna Fáil in 1983, we have not been hiding in the long grass seeking an opportunity to politically ambush the Government. At all times we have sought to constructively resolve the real difficulties arising from the Supreme Court case and the dilemma created by the Protocol for so many people. Indeed a dilemma has been created for many women in this country who recognise the benefits of the European Community and who are committed to the European ideal and who have grave concerns about voting for Maastricht while the Protocol remains part and parcel of the Treaty process and while the Government remain silent on the substantive detail of the proposal they intend to bring before the people in November next.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by reiterating my party's and my own personal support for the Maastricht Treaty. I also want to sound a final warning to the Taoiseach. If the Maastricht referendum is successful, as I hope it will be, let it not be misinterpreted by the Taoiseach, by the Fianna Fáil Party or by political commentators as some sort of personal political victory for Deputy Albert Reynolds as Leader of Fianna Fáil. If the Maastricht referendum succeeds it will not be because of the Taoiseach but despite him. If it succeeds it will be because Fine Gael have given strong public support to it and have not sought to exploit the fear and confusion that has arisen from the inclusion of the ill-considered Protocol or the Government's failure to address the issues arising under the Protocol prior to the referendum on European Political Union. If it succeeds it will also be because Irish people over the years through membership of the EC have made a commitment to the European ideal and will not be distracted from their commitment to it by Government incompetence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): Twenty years ago the people of this nation voted by a four to one majority to join the European Economic Community. Over those 20 years great strides have been made both economically and socially. Of course there has been a down side and the charge has often been made that certain sectors of our community have benefited more than others. This may be so, but on balance I would contend that Ireland and its people have gained enormously by being members of the EC. The Treaty on European Union is the engine which will drive the European Community for for foreseeable future. If we reject that driving force we will at best stand still, while in all probability our European partners will move ahead without us. We have been part of the European Community for almost 20 years. We have derived enormous benefits from our membership. If we say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the Maastricht Treaty these benefits will increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is clearly a number of wide ranging aspects of our commitment to the future of the EC but I propose to concentrate on those areas which are generally within my own area of responsibility, that is agriculture and food. When people talk of the benefits to Irish agriculture from Community membership they tend to talk in terms of direct monetary transfers from Brussels. While these have been substantial, they are only part of the advantages which we enjoy. We are a trading nation; we have to export some 70 per cent of our agricultural output. Membership of the EC gives us access to a relatively high priced market of 340 million people. In addition, as a member of the largest trading bloc in the world we receive assistance from Community funds which allows us to compete more effectively on world markets while providing a reasonable return to our farmers. If we drop out of the EC or become a partial member, we can no longer expect to derive comparable benefits or to influence policy direction either internally or internationally <Col N="651" /> in negotiations such as those which are ongoing in the GATT. Despite the complaints we frequently hear about the inadequacy of Community support for our agriculture, the position of farming and the economy as a whole would have been far worse if we had not been in there at the negotiating table.</P>
    <P>The agriculture and food industry plays a major role in our economy, accounting directly for 10 per cent of our GNP. Agriculture and its associated upstream and downstream industries provide employment for over 160,000 people. This is almost 20 per cent of total employment in the country. Of our net foreign earnings over 40 per cent comes from the agriculture, food and drinks sectors.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is the primary framework through which Community support is provided to agriculture. In addition, support from the EC Structural Funds &mdash; through headage payments, farm improvements measures, rural development initiatives and so on &mdash; has also made a significant contribution to agriculture and rural areas and support for the latter in particular will increase significantly in a post-Masstricht situation.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy was the first common policy adopted by the original Community of Six. The objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy are set out in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome and are to increase agricultural productivity, ensure a fair standard of living for farmers, stabilise agricultural markets, guarantee regular supplies of food, and ensure reasonable prices for consumers. That Article also provides that in working out and applying the Common Agricultural Policy account has to be taken of the structural and national disparities between the various agricultural regions and the fact that agriculture constitutes a sector linked to the economy as a whole. We must also bear in mind the importance of agriculture to Ireland. Those latter requirements are more strongly reaffirmed in the cohesion provisions of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> The Common Agricultural Policy is based on three principles: single market, Community preference and financial solidarity. It is worth dwelling on what is meant by these principles and how they apply to Ireland. The Single Market ensures that commodities, including agricultural products, are able to move freely between member states. I have already mentioned how access to the vast Community market helps us. It is worth considering what would have happened if we did not have access to that market. This aspect is particularly important in relation to assertions from certain quarters that Ireland has derived no benefits from EC membership and that we would have fared just as well if we had not joined. At the time of our entry into the EC we were very dependent on the low priced UK food market for outlets for our agricultural goods. If at that time the UK had joined and we had not, the second principle of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; Community preference &mdash; would have operated. Under this, priority would have been given to EC produce over that of countries outside the Community because EC markets are protected from the excessive effects of imports by means of levies and other mechanisms. Effectively then, if we had not joined the EC, our access to the UK market would have been severely restricted. By joining the Community we not only maintained our access to an improved UK market but also gained access to markets in other member states thereby reducing our reliance on the UK outlet.</P>
    <P>If since 1973 we had to trade outside the Community with extremely limited access to Community markets we would have been trading effectively at world prices. I will give some examples of the differences between world and EC prices. In the case of beef the world price is about £1,800 per tonne while the EC price is over twice that level. The EC support price for butter is almost £3,500 per tonne whereas the world price is just one third of that. In the case of wheat the EC price is twice that of the world price. In addition we would not have had any <Col N="653" /> guarantee that even at the lower world prices we could have found markets for all our products because we would have had to compete on third country markets in competition with subsidised exports from the Community and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that if we had been operating in that environment for the past 20 years, Irish agriculture and our agriculture based industries would not be making their current contribution to our economy. While the drift from the land, which is happening throughout the world, has continued since our membership of the Community, there is no doubt that it would have been a total deluge if we had remained on the outside.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated so far on those benefits of membership which are not always immediately obvious, or at least which seem to get less attention than the large inflow of funds from the Community. That inflow of funds results mainly from the third principle of the Common Agricultural Policy, that is, financial solidarity. Under this principle the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy is borne by the Community rather than by individual member states. The main costs of the policy arise from the guaranteed prices system for all the major commodities of importance to Ireland &mdash; in particular beef, milk and cereals &mdash; with intervention purchases of those commodities in surplus supply and export supports for disposal of products on to the lower priced world markets. Supports for agricultural prices together with the structural supports for agriculture and food have resulted in a huge inflow of Community funds since our accession &mdash; some £18 billion in today's money terms. Market price supports from Community funds have averaged £800 million per annum and it is obvious that an economy such as ours could not have afforded supports for Irish agriculture of that level or to have funds of that nature available if we were outside the EC.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to outline the major benefits which agriculture has enjoyed by virtue of our membership of the EC. But what of the future? Will those benefits be maintained? As is well known, the new <Col N="654" /> Treaty will not change the provisions relating to the Common Agricultural Policy or alter the way in which decisions are taken. But, separately, the future of agricultural support in the Community is under discussion at present in the Council of Agriculture Ministers. It must be admitted that while the Common Agricultural Policy has been a very successful policy for the greater part of its existence, its mechanisms are now in need of reform for a number of reasons. Structural imbalances exist in all the major sectors, which in turn have increased the cost of financing the Common Agricultural Policy and pushed expenditure very close to the ceiling of the agricultural budget. Despite considerably increased expenditure in recent years, farmers' incomes have not been maintained. It is also worth noting that for the Community as a whole some 80 per cent of Common Agricultural Policy expenditure is going to 20 per cent of producers, which is not acceptable. It is clear that these developments have to be addressed and for this reason we in Ireland accept that reforms are inevitable. In any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy we must ensure that the livelihood of family farms is protected in future.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Commission has already proposed major reforms of the support arrangements for all the major products of interest to Ireland. The aims of these reforms are: to bring markets into balance by means of production controls, price policy and extensification of production methods; to keep a sufficient number of farmers on the land; to give an enhanced role to farmers as protectors of the environment as well as producers of food; to achieve a more effective distribution of support; and to maintain the position of the Community as a major player in world agricultural trade.</P>
    <P>While we did not have any difficulty with the stated aims of the Commission, we had major problems with the way the Commission sought to meet them. But we have participated in the negotiations and arising from these negotiations, the Portuguese Presidency has proposed substantial <Col N="655" /> amendments to the original proposal. Some of these changes are helpful although others are not.</P>
    <P>We, in particular, welcome the relaxation of the stocking rate criteria for the disadvantaged areas for all premia, the improvements provided for in relation to the level of the suckler cow premium, the amended payment arrangements for the male beef premium and the retention of the current ceiling for ewe premium payments in the disadvantaged areas. We also welcome the moderation of the proposed price cut for cereals and the proposed full compensation for cereal producers for income losses.</P>
    <P>These changes do not go far enough to meet our demands and indeed some aspects of what the Presidency has proposed create even further problems for us. We will continue to participate in the negotiations to seek solutions to our remaining difficulties and we will oppose those which are not acceptable to our farmers and the economy. We will continue to oppose the proposed milk quota cuts and to seek improved premia arrangements in the beef sector. We will also have to ensure that the beef intervention arrangements will effectively underpin the new price level. We also must have measures introduced to tackle our seasonality problems and secure further improvements in the stocking rates and ceilings proposed for the various premia and, of course, we will have to secure assurances that adequate Community resources will be provided on a permanent basis to finance the reforms. This is a vital point for Ireland.</P>
    <P>While there has been some movement in the negotiations to date to meet our needs, more is needed. However, I am fully confident that Minister, Deputy Walsh will secure an agreement on Common Agricultural Policy reform which will carry Irish agriculture forward in a confident and prosperous manner, not just for the remainder of this century but well into the third millennium.</P>
    <P>Even if we secure what we want in the Common Agricultural Policy reform discussions, supplementary aid will be <Col N="656" /> necessary to maintain the viability of our rural regions. While some progress has been made in strengthening economic and social cohesion under the present round of Structural Funds, differences in the levels of development in the member states continue to be considerable. The need, therefore, to continue along the economic and social cohesion path mapped out in the 1988 reform of the Structural Funds is further recognised and strengthened in the Maastricht Treaty. Following on from Maastricht the President of the EC Commission, Mr. Delors, has already tabled proposals which provide for a doubling of structural funding, including the cohesion element, to be made available to Objective 1 regions under the next round of the Structural Funds. Ireland, as an Objective 1 region, clearly expects to get an equitable share of these new funds, which should be agreed later in the year. Ireland has and is continuing to benefit substantially from the Structural Fund doubling put in place by the Community in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Community Support Framework, under which Ireland's plans to take up the increased Structural Funds in the period 1989-93 are set out, provided for a total investment of £1,500 million in the agriculture area over the five year period, of which some £550 million comes from the EC. The measures covered by the framework include specific programmes for Ireland in such areas as rural development, control of farmyard pollution and the Western Package. In addition, Community-wide schemes on headage payments, farm improvement and processing and marketing were revised and updated and increased funding was provided.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Rural Development was approved in December 1990. The programme involves over £100 million public funds, of which £60 million are provided by the EC. It supports a scheme of aid for farm diversification, small and community enterprises, rural infrastructure, research and development and marketing in the food industry and training. The programme has created significant opportunities for both on-farm diversification <Col N="657" /> and off-farm income and employment possibilities. There has been a tremendous response to this programme and this only serves to underline the importance to the wider rural community of the new emphasis on rural development in the context of the reformed funds.</P>
    <P>Approximately £94 million is being spent under the Operational Programme for Control of Farmyard Pollution, which provides aid for waste storage and animal buildings; 70 per cent of the cost is met by the Structural Funds; 25,000 applications have been approved to carry out vital work which will reduce pollution and protect the environment. There is still considerable unsatisfied demand for this scheme and the new Structural Funds will be essential in enabling us to continue this important work.</P>
    <P>The headage schemes have continued to play a major role in helping to maintain farming and the rural infrastructure in our less favoured areas. Following the decision of the EC Commission in 1991, some 72 per cent of Ireland is now classified as disadvantaged and the value of headage payments now runs at about £100 million annually of which 65 per cent is met by the EC.</P>
    <P>Aid in the processing and marketing area has helped to modernise and improve the efficiency of our agri-food sector while also contributing to improved product quality. Under the present Community Support Framework investment of £230 million in the processing and marketing area has been provided for. Most of this allocation has already been used up. In the food area I would contend that we have a quality product produced in a green, friendly environment. We must develop value-added products and exploit the potential of the EC market of 340 million people.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme is getting underway and will be of major benefit to rural Ireland. We can continue to play an influential role in the development of the Common Agricultural Policy and other Community policies but only if we are full members of the club. There are of course, demands as well as benefits from membership but in my view the latter far <Col N="658" /> outweigh the former. I would, therefore, urge all Deputies to support the motion put down by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I would also ask the people of Ireland at large to vote yes in the Maastricht referendum on 18 June and thereby secure the future of Ireland and its people. In agriculture in particular we have a major opportunity to develop further. I strongly recommend that the people should vote yes on 18 June.</P>

      <P>I regret that this debate has tended to get bogged down in the irrelevant issue of abortion and in the economic issues of grants and all the rest. The abortion issue is one which was most unfortunately dragged in by the previous Administration in response to certain pressures on them. It has nothing to do with Maastricht. The Community's competences do not extend to abortion and the damage done to our reputation abroad and to our capacity to decide these issues which are important to us at home has been very considerable. On the other side there is the debate about the £6 billion and the various funds. The dreary steeples of Tyrone and Fermanagh that Churchill spoke of have now been replaced by the dreary grants, funds and programmes of the European Community. That is not what it is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say briefly what Europe means to me. The Europe to which we belong is the Europe of the Indo-European culture from which almost all our languages in this Continent derive. It is the Europe in which different branches of that culture matured in Greece and Rome, later absorbing and developing the Christianity that had found its roots in Palestinian Judaism. It is the Europe that created Western Christendom with its unique achievements in art, literature and music and with its philosophical and scientific discovery and technological achievement. It is the Europe whose <Col N="659" /> people's unique cultural interaction gave all this to the world, an interaction which was both fruitful and destructive. It was the way the different cultures interacted with each other that created the vitality that gave us so much of what is now the world's culture. That interaction was at times over-competitive, dangerous and in this century carried to the point of virtual self-destruction as far as our Continent was concerned. But for our generations of the second half of this century, those represented in this House and our children, the Europe with which we are concerned is the Europe that incredibly, magnificently, belatedly faced down the disintegrative forces that threatened to destroy it and created from this chaos the new ideals that in the century to come will, I believe, transform the world.</P>
    <P>We do not advert enough to what these ideals are. Think of the revolutions that have taken place in the past half century in the way people are beginning to think of their world. The first revolution, chronologically, was that which made human rights into something that transcends national sovereignty. It was inconceivable 50 years ago yet today it is routine for somebody who in this or any other State feels that their own judicial system does not cater for them properly and is in some way being unjust to go to Europe, to Strasbourg, to put their case and to have their own Government overruled so that their rights can be vindicated. Something that nobody could have conceived possible 50 years ago is the norm for us today. That is a revolution in world history without compare, but it is only one of a number that have taken place in Europe in the past half century.</P>
    <P>There has been that revolution that has banished war as an instrument of policy in settling disputes between states within our part of this Continent. Conflict of that kind is inconceivable for this purpose, yet 50 years ago war was not merely accepted as a last resort but was the preferred policy of states in certain circumstances. If they thought they could win it was a more secure way of securing their objective <Col N="660" /> than negotiation. That has gone. Nobody could conceive of acting in that way. That mood of peace, created in western Europe by the intellectual force and dynamism of some remarkable people in the aftermath of the last war has spread beyond these issues of internecine quarrels. In continental Europe in many countries there is a great reluctance even to contemplate war in the face of external aggression. There was a marked lack of enthusiasm in many European countries for the Gulf War. They sent naval and air forces but no more. This was regarded in macho America and Britain as an act of cowardice but it seems to me that at last people are waking up to the fact that war is something one should be very slow about indeed. That has come from Europe and it is an infection that will spread. Already it has spread to north western Europe. I do not think Poland, Czechoslovakia or Hungary are countries that could be conceived as possibly using war again as an instrument of policy. Hungary, with all its grievances about Romania and its fears and concerns about what the Serbs are doing to Hungarians and with their history of past conflict and pride, has not thought of resorting to war or violence in defence of its interests. That infection has spread.</P>
    <P>Then there is the third revolution, that which has replaced colonial exploitation within half a century by the opposite concept, not of extracting wealth from the poor to feed the rich but of transferring wealth from the rich to help the poor. It is inadequate and not always well motivated or well directed but nevertheless the accepted wisdom now is that this is the way transfers go. Nobody thinks any longer of the developing countries as ones from which we draw wealth to support us. We feel we have a duty to help them. We may not do it sufficiently but that is the direction in which the flow goes. That is a total reversal of everything that has happened in history in that area.</P>
    <P>Fourth, there is the environmental revolution and the acceptance that global action is required to preserve our world environment. All these revolutions are <Col N="661" /> European in inspiration and origin. Even at this moment, where is the drive coming from to make the Rio conference a success? It is not coming from Japan or from the old countries of the CIS with their appalling pollution. It is not coming from the US, which is being pushed by Europe grudgingly to accept that they must make some contribution. This is where the dynamism comes from. Aid to the developing world does not come from the United States. Their aid is nearly as poor as ours as it has been reduced under this Government. What there is of it goes mainly in military form. The Soviet Union never gave much aid and what it did give was military. Aid has begun to come from Japan but only very recently. That stimulus came from Europe and the whole concept is a European one to redress the damage done by colonialism in the past.</P>
    <P>Then there is the gentler European form of capitalism and the concept of society in which the poor are seen as victims, not failures, where social security is seen as favourable to rather than damaging economic growth and where the gap between rich and poor is progressively narrowed by State action instead of widened as in America and Britain and where conspicuous consumption is discouraged rather than glorified. This is the form of capitalism which exists in many countries in western Europe, as was pointed our recently by a visitor to our shores who has written a book on the subject, Michel Albert, in contrast to the neo-American capitalism which is concerned with `get rich quick' financial deals in the Stock Exchange rather than investment by banks. That is the kind of society that is building up in Europe and it is much closer to our ideals.</P>
    <P>These are the real issues &mdash; what kind of Europe there is to be and can we strengthen our confidence sufficiently to preserve and extend these ideals so that they will spread worldwide or are they to be eroded by the mass culture coming across the Atlantic? That is what this is about, not about grants, programmes or loans and certainly not about neutrality.</P>
    <P>This is the Europe that the liberated <Col N="662" /> countries of the East wish to join, the Europe that the neutral states of Scandanavia and central Europe are being drawn to. This new European Union, in the aftermath of the Cold War, is seen by them as a force for peace.</P>
    <P>But what do we hear from the so-called left wing in this country? They talk as if the Cold War were still in progress, they talk in meaningless terms. They want Ireland to opt out of that into which the neutral countries of Europe wish to become members. The president of Switzerland recently announced his country's proposal to seek membership. The attitude that Ireland is so pure that we must not tarnish our hands by working with the Swiss, the Swedes, the Austrians, the Finns, the Dutch and the Danes to transform European foreign policy into a force for peace in the world &mdash; no, we must keep away from that &mdash; is not what the Maastricht Treaty is about. Ireland must join in and share in what is being done in Europe. It is our Europe, we belong to it and we have the right and the duty to participate.</P>
    <P>Instead of asking all the time what we might get from the European Community &mdash; in this House we hear of nothing other than the benefits that might accrue to Ireland &mdash; do we ever ask ourselves what we have contributed to the Community? The first time I met Chancellor Schmidt in a bilateral meeting he asked me: &ldquo;Dr. FitzGerald, I know what the Community is doing for Ireland but could you tell me what Ireland is doing for the Community?&rdquo; That was a fair question and it required some presence of mind to produce a quick answer.</P>
    <P>At that time we were committed to the concept of European economic and political integration. The contrast between our stance and that of Britain and Denmark, the other two new member states, was striking. Ireland was committed to the protection of the role of Community institutions against the great powers and in those years we did succeed in heading off the threat of a European directorate and protecting the role of the Commission, so important to us and to <Col N="663" /> the future of Europe. We were playing an active part, with others, inside the system in trying to ensure the Community's success and its preservation.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much of that goes on today. If anything has been done by this Government, it has been done with remarkable secrecy. One hears of nothing but what the Government are doing to get money for this country from Europe. The figure of £6 billion is all that is talked about, a figure that I would not use because we are not certain that we will get that amount.</P>
    <P>Certainly, there will be very substantial sums available, but that is not the important thing. The important thing is not the sums that we will get in grants &mdash; although they will help to increase our growth rate &mdash; but the Europe we are joining, what it will be about, the way in which we can contribute to it and what role we can play in it. We have benefited greatly from Europe although we have not yet given that much in return. It is Europe that, after all, transfers to Ireland some 6 per cent in addition to our resources every year. Europe has given us access to its markets, a measure that has stimulated Ireland's exports to grow faster than those of any other member state and has, therefore, stimulated a growth in output.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been able to catch up with its northern neighbours, so that today the output per worker in Ireland is at the same level and holds the same purchasing power as the output per worker in Britain or Denmark, the other two member states who joined the Community with us, and Ireland was well behind in that regard when joining the Community 20 years ago. That achievement is often not realised because in the same period Ireland had, because of its birth rate, a huge increase in the dependent population and children. The extra resources per worker had to be spread among a growing number of dependants. Our living standards have not increased any more rapidly than those of the rest of Western Europe but they would have declined very considerably had our growth rate merely been the same as <Col N="664" /> theirs, as the number of our dependants was growing and theirs was shrinking. Because we achieved an increased growth rate so much faster than the rest of Europe the advantages we secured from that have enabled us to provide for the hugely increased number of people in this country an increase in living standards to match that offered by the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>Although no one recognises it, we have also had a growth in non-agricultural employment at one of the fastest levels in Europe, bettered only by Portugal and Greece. That growth has not been sufficient to cope with the consequences of our past birth rate. Having the birth rate peak in 1980, decades after every other country, at a very high level, meant that problems were bound to come up. How much worse would those problems have been had Ireland not had a rapid growth in non-agricultural employment and a slightly slower decrease in agricultural employment than that experienced in the rest of Europe, things which happened as a result of our membership of the Community?</P>
    <P>Now the last obstacle to our access to this great market is to be swept away in the abolition of the multiplicities of currencies. The crucial point about the Maastricht Treaty is that we are to secure a share in that hitherto most jealously guarded sovereignty of our partners, including even the most powerful partner, Germany, the sovereignty over fiscal and monetary policy. The use of that sovereignty by major powers for national purposes, often without adequate regard for the interests of others, has in the past &mdash; and could so easily do again in the future &mdash; damaged the interests of a small state such as Ireland. We now have the opportunity to share in that sovereignty. Instead of a state such as Germany taking a unilateral decision that suits its particular interests in regard to issues such as interest rates, such a decision will be taken by the whole of Europe, us included. We will play our part. As a result, because of the co-ordination of policies that that will entail and involve, the growth rate of Europe might resume, <Col N="665" /> because it has been held back by the high interest rates, which are in part at least a consequence of the way in which macro-economic policy has been directed by states in their own interests and not in the interests of the whole of Europe. That and the opportunity to join in making Europe a powerful force for peace in the world are the things that the Maastricht Treaty is about; those are the things we should be debating and discussing in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael have always been a pro-European party. In the late sixties the Fine Gael Party recognised the importance of becoming part of the European Community and in the 1972 campaign our party were very much to the fore. At that time Deputy FitzGerald was one of the prime campaigners on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to ensure support for the European Community. At the same time, the Labour Party were very strongly campaigning against entry into Europe. Indeed, my former lecturer in political science, now the Labour Party spokesman on foreign affairs, was actively involved in that campaign. It is unfortunate that today there are still some in this country who believe that to go that further step towards European integration is unwise.</P>
      <P>We are greatly indebted to the founding fathers of the European Community. One needs only to look back on history to realise the devastation, destruction and torture that existed in Europe after the Second World War. If it were not for those very fine-minded people, we could now be facing into a further war within Europe, the ingredients for which are very much evident right across Europe. We in Ireland, on the periphery of Europe, should recognise the importance to us of peace in Europe. Right now we should recognise the dangers arising in Yugoslavia and in the broken apart former USSR. There is a great instability in the whole of Eastern Europe and we, as a member state, have an obligation to be very much part of efforts to ensure that a major crisis does not arise there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> It is disappointing that some people have taken a scaremongering stance in the campaign, particularly in relation to our defence position. The Maastricht Treaty very clearly defines that it does not have anything to do with commitment to a defence union. It is also clearly in the agreement that the common foreign and security policy will be a matter for member states to deal with and that the issue of defence will be discussed in 1996 at an intergovernmental conference. It is stated that all decisions taken between now and 1996 in relation to any defence element would have to be unanimous. That is important. It is imperative that Irish parents who are at the moment concerned that their sons or daughters may be conscripted into a European army have that fear put aside because it is completely untrue and is without foundation within the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government, in the course of decisions in the lead up to the Maastricht Treaty, did not take a much stronger line in relation to greater involvement in the issue of defence. It is unfortunate that the Government handed over to the nine member states who are members of the Western European Union certain authorities and controls in relation to defence. That has been done in this Treaty. The Government were not prepared to par-take fully in what was going on. It would have been much more proper for the Government to engage themselves in promoting an ideal in which the 12 member states combined would form part of a defence union. It would have been better for the Government to promote that idea rather than hand over certain authorities to the Western European Union. I believe that to be a weakness in the Maastricht agreement. Undoubtedly, we will eventually have to partake fully in a defence union. It is only right and proper that we should.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is timely for us to examine our history in relation to neutrality. Records which have been published recently show that our neutrality was not based on any serious moral standing but that it was a tactical approach adopted <Col N="667" /> by the Government at the time. Privately the Government supported the Allies. We could have a long academic debate on how real our neutrality is. With the type of weapons used in modern warfare, neutrality is a non-issue. As members of the European Community we should recognise that we are in a position to bring peace to Europe, to negotiate disarmament and to ensure that some of our member states who at the moment sell arms to Third World countries will be restricted in that activity.</P>
    <P>This Government and future Governments, looking at the lead-up to the Maastricht debate, should realise that the Government should never ignore Dáil Éireann on a matter of serious national importance. Matters of national importance should be discussed openly and constructively in this House before Ministers go to Europe. Having regard to the unfortunate insertion of Protocol 17, it was most unfortunate that the Government had not the honesty to come into this House first to have the matter debated. If that had been done we would not be in the difficulty in which we find ourselves today. I would urge the Government and the Taoiseach to publish a Bill with regard to the right to travel and information prior to the referendum on Maastricht on 18 June. It is unfair to ask the women of Ireland, and all decent voters, to vote on this issue without having the matter fully clarified first. As the law stands, women of child bearing age are not free to leave the country but could be subject to injunctions. If a woman is pregnant she would have to prove that she was not travelling for an abortion and if she was not pregnant she would have to prove it. A basic civil right is being put at risk. Many people feel that by voting for Maastricht that civil right will be further interfered with. There is an onus on the Government to ensure that the matter is fully clarified. The Government have their own wording for the proposed amendment to the Protocol and they have the Fine Gael wording. I would ask them to please put them in the form of a Bill to be put before the House. <Col N="668" /> The Government should not jeopardise the passing of the Treaty by their inaction on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Without taking from anything Deputy Taylor said, I always love to hear Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, who has been a European for many decades. The Deputy gave a very clear explanation of some of the issues. It is heartening to hear him put so clearly what this is really about.</P>
      <P>By now Deputies have had an opportunity to examine the White Paper on European Union and many have contributed to the discussions which have followed its publication. I do not propose to take up the time of the House with a further summary of the shape of the proposed Economic and Monetary Union. Instead I should like to focus on some of the critical comment which has been made both within this House and without so as to lay to rest unfounded arguments which have been advanced.</P>
      <P>There have been claims that the Treaty provisions on European Monetary Union commit Ireland to a decade of deflation as we strive to maintain our currency as strong as the Deutsche Mark as a precondition for replacing it by the single currency in the third stage of European Monetary Union. Indeed, a number of Deputies, including Deputies De Rossa, Higgins and Spring, made reference during the debate to this possibility. Implicit in this argument is the idea that in European Monetary Union we will be following a course which is radically different to that which we have been pursuing to date. Those who advance this argument seem to ignore the facts of our membership of the European Monetary System, our total acceptance of the disciplines which that has imposed on us, our success in establishing ourselves as one of the core countries within that system and our success in bringing our public finances under control in the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like in particular to examine the four conditions which must be met if a member state is to participate in the third stage of European Monetary Union as it <Col N="669" /> is this aspect of the Treaty which appears to be exciting most fear of deflation. The three criteria which are most readily quantifiable are as follows. Firstly, an inflation performance that does not exceed by more than 1.5 per cent that of the three best-performing member states in terms of price stability. The simple fact is that we already meet their criterion, being indeed one of the best performers. Secondly, an average nominal interest rate on long term Government bonds that does not exceed by more than 2 percentage points that of the three best-performing member states in terms of price stability. Again, this is a criterion which we meet today. Thirdly, a two-year observance of the 2.25 per cent band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS without experiencing severe tensions and without a devaluation on its own initiative. Again, this is a criterion which we meet comfortably. For us, therefore, the point at issue in these three criteria is not that of striving towards some impossibly difficult goal but that of aiming to maintain the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>It is the fourth and final criterion, namely, that relating to the avoidance of excessive budget deficits, which is less susceptible to immediate judgment as to whether or not it is being satisfied. That is because the specific figures mentioned &mdash; namely, a deficit of 3 per cent of GDP and a debt/GDP ratio of 60 per cent &mdash; do not have the same absolute character as those contained in the other criteria. It is also because the whole process is geared towards allowing for the exercise of political judgment at the conclusive stage of the assessment. A member state will not have to have a debt/GDP ratio of 60 per cent before it can qualify for the final stage of European Monetary Union. What is of relevance is the trend in that ratio and the speed with which it is coming down. Who would deny that it is not a desirable aim for us to reduce our debt ratio from its present high level? We have already secured a considerable reduction in it &mdash; from 117 per cent in 1987 to 95 per cent in 1991. It is the Government's firm intention to continue on the course which we had already charted <Col N="670" /> long before this matter was relevant to our participation in the final stage of European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>Our budget deficit is already below 3 per cent of GDP and the Government intend to keep it below 3 per cent. This will automatically result in the debt/GDP ratio continuing to fall from its present level. Thus the European Monetary Union requirements do not require us to do anything other than what we had already intended to do. It is noteworthy that, following a recent review of the Irish economy by ECO/FIN, the Finance Ministers concluded that Ireland at present meets all the criteria for entry to Stage III.</P>
    <P>Some opponents of European Monetary Union have criticised the criteria for budgetary discipline but they have not indicated a plausible structure in their place. It has been suggested, for instance, that there is some magic solution such as refusing to service our national debt or otherwise avoiding our contractual obligations. These are not options: they are recipes for disaster. A great deal of international investment which comes our way nowadays represents the combined savings of foreign pension funds and insurance companies. Any attempt on the part of the Government to avoid their debt-servicing obligations would have such a traumatic effect on the confidence of such investors in the Irish economy that it would more than blot out any beneficial effects of the initial action. Moreover, the consequences for the cost of refinancing debt in future would be catastrophic. This realisation is the real reason why this approach is totally ruled out by responsible governments everywhere. This approach is not generally discussed by governments because discussing it could give it a credibility which it simply does not warrant.</P>
    <P>I have spent some time on the criteria for entry into the third stage of European Monetary Union because they are central to many of the criticisms which have been levelled against the European Monetary Union section of the Treaty. However, we need to stand back and take a calm look at just what is being criticised &mdash;<Col N="671" /> low inflation, low interest rates, exchange rate stability and a sound budgetary position. These are the canons of good financial management which should be pursued for the tangible benefits they will yield in their own right.</P>
    <P>With all other member states acting in accordance with these principles of sound management, the burden which budget deficits place on monetary policy today will be lifted. That will allow scope for generalised reductions in interest rates and will boost business and consumer confidence throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>Lower interest rates have a particular significance for those countries with high levels of debt. It is a matter of fact that even a one percentage point reduction in EC interest rates would be of great direct benefit to the Exchequer, the large State bodies and private sector borrowers in general. A reduction in interest rates would be clearly visible in a reduction in the cost of servicing the national debt. Indirectly it would stimulate investment and economic activity. It is ridiculous to suggest that a reduction in interest rates is not of immediate value either to people struggling to service a mortagage or to a business carrying a large debt. There is no doubt that a reduction in interest rates is the one development which feeds through immediately to ease the pressures on both Government, mortgage holder and the business person. In addition, by reducing the cost of capital, it encourages new investment.</P>
    <P>Lower interest rates and the improved confidence stemming from budgetary discipline by all member states should combine with the dynamic of the Single Market and European Monetary Union to raise growth in the Community. In fact, the overall result is likely to be a long period of sustained non-inflationary economic expansion and not the decade of deflation which the prophets of doom would have us believe.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled at the alleged lack of balance between the economic sections of the Treaty and the monetary sections. Specifically, comments have been made concerning the apparent <Col N="672" /> inequality between the European Central Bank, a single body in charge of monetary policy, and the more diffuse structure represented by the economic authority which is ECO/FIN. Fears have been expressed, in emotive terms, of a Europe run by central bankers.</P>
    <P>There are two elements I should like to address in dealing with this issue. The first concerns the procedures designed to facilitate interaction between the European Central Bank, ECO/FIN, the Commission and the European Parliament. The second concerns the way in which economic policy itself will operate within European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>The Treaty provides for a range of checks and balances which are designed to regulate the relationship between the ECB and ECO/FIN in particular. The president of ECO/FIN and a member of the Commission will attend, as of right, all meetings of the ECB and will be able to participate actively in those meetings. In this way, the political input into the bank's deliberation will be considerable. In turn, the president of the Governing Council of the bank will be entitled to attend all meetings of ECO/FIN where matters bearing upon the function of the bank are under discussion. The president of ECO/FIN will also be entitled to submit a motion for discussion by the Governing Council of the bank. In this way, matters which are of concern to the political authorities will be brought immediately to the attention of the bank. Transparency in the ECB's reporting arrangements will also mean that the European Parliament will have the opportunity, at least once a year, to debate in full the monetary policy stance of the Community.</P>
    <P>While the Treaty does not purport to set up an EC super Ministry of Finance, it does provide for a significant deepening of co-ordinating among Finance Ministers on the ECO/FIN Council beyond what exists at the moment. In particular, the new Treaty allows for a progressive approach to economic policy making which will allow the Community's competence in this area to develop gradually over time. Already, through the instrument <Col N="673" /> of multilateral surveillance, the Community has taken its first decisive steps in the direction of a more integrated approach to economic policy making. In this context, the Community has begun its examination of the convergence programmes of member states, including that of Ireland last February. This brings a Community dimension to policy making which enables national programmes to be measured against common Community values and for inconsistencies and tensions to be discussed and resolved at a Community level.</P>
    <P>The framework offered by this increased co-ordination provides Ireland, and other member states, with the opportunity to tackle the unemployment problem at both national and Community levels. It is not true to say that unemployment is overlooked in the Treaty. On the contrary, the need to promote a high level of employment is clearly identified as a major task of the Community. I would go so far as to say what the economic policy co-ordination envisaged would be meaningless if it did not have as a fundamental aim the reduction of our present high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the economic policy provisions in the Treaty are backed up by three specific rules in the economic area. Briefly they are: no monetary financing; no bail-outs and the avoidance of excessive budget deficits. I do not intend to discuss these in detail on this occasion, but the sanctions aspect of the budget deficit rule is one on which I should like to focus since there has been some misunderstanding as to its significance. Deputies will recall that sanctions such as financial penalties and fines will come into play in the excessive deficit procedure during the third stage of European Monetary Union. I would like to emphasise that these sanctions are intended for use as a last resort when all else has failed. As indicated in the White Paper, the entire procedure in this area is predicated upon the presumption of good budgetary behaviour. It is only in the most extreme cases, where the recklessness <Col N="674" /> of a member state was undermining the stability of the union, that sanctions would be imposed.</P>
    <P>I would also like to state firmly that derogation from the budgetary rules of European Monetary Union is simply not an option. If any member state were to seek such a derogation it would be a clear signal to all economic agents that it intended to abandon any commitment it had to budgetary discipline. It would also be telling its partners that it was not interested in proceeding to European Monetary Union. I need hardly spell out the economic and budgetary consequences for Ireland of such a step.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has been raised is that of sovereignty and, specifically, the loss to our sovereignty which European Monetary Union will bring about. When we joined the EMS we did so in the appreciation that adherence to a strong currency group would bring with it certain tangible benefits. These benefits justified the sacrifice of much of our autonomy in the monetary area. European Monetary Union goes a step beyond this. Instead of a system dominated by the Monetary policy and currency of a particular member state, with all that implies in terms of influence and control, a single monetary policy and currency representing the interests of all member states will be created. Their implementation and management will be a matter for the European Central Bank, on whose main decision-making council Ireland will have an equal voice with those of the central bank governors from other member states.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the economic area, we are pooling our sovereignty rather than yielding it up. But that is a factor which will rebound considerably to Ireland's benefit. The greater co-ordination of economic policy-making will create for us a more certain and stable external environment which will, moreover, be conducive to economic growth. It is in such circumstances in the past that Ireland has recorded its best economic performances.</P>
    <P>It is easy to criticise the new Treaty provision on European Monetary Union <Col N="675" /> because they do not provide for certain things. What I have in mind here is the criticism which has been levelled at the fact that no provision has been made for fiscal transfer mechanisms of the kind which are current in existing federations. However, the Treaty on European Union, as such, does not seek to establish a federation. In the absence of the political solidarity which such a federation would signify it is unreal to bemoan the absence of automatic transfer mechanisms.</P>
    <P>Ireland's achievements in the Treaty negotiations were substantial and should not be diminished. We succeeded in securing improved cohesion policies for the immediate future, particularly a new Cohesion Fund. We also got a framework which will enable the Community to develop new cohesion mechanisms in line with its future evolution. Indeed, this framework would allow at some future date for automatic transfers.</P>
    <P>On the subject of cohesion, the existing Structural Funds have strengthened our economy by boosting our growth per annum by about ¼ per cent to ½ per cent higher than would otherwise have been the case. The funds have also resulted in higher employment than we would have attained without their assistance. Last year, there was a net transfer of more than £1,850 million from the EC budget to Ireland. In the five-year period 1989-93, Ireland will obtain more than £3,000 million from the Structural Funds. In the medium to long term, the Structural Funds are enabling Ireland to make significant progress on building up the infrastructure necessary for economic development in sectors such as roads, access transport and sanitary services. They are also contributing to productive investment in industry, tourism and agriculture and to the development of human resources through training and education. Without the Structural Funds, the unemployment position here would undoubtedly be much worse. They have not only helped to create many new jobs already, but the investments which they have assisted will also provide a sound <Col N="676" /> basis on which further jobs will emerge once economic growth resumes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan alleged that the Structural Funds were not being distributed evenly within the country. However, the Government have been scrupulous in taking the steps needed to ensure that the benefits of the increased investment are indeed distributed throughout the country. In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to the breakdown of expenditure by sub-region which is shown at page 45 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future of the funds, the Commission has indicated that it will be looking for 11 billion ECU to finance the additional expenditure arising from the priority which the new Treaty assigns to economic and social cohesion. This includes a substantial allocation for the new Cohesion Fund so that, on the basis of Commission proposals, funding in support of the four poorest member states taken together could be doubled.</P>
    <P>At this point, it is desirable to confront the assertions of those who say that we have not benefited from Community membership and that we would be better off outside of the Community. This is utter nonsense. It ignores the facts and ducks the realities of international trade in agricultural products and the factors that determine international flows of investment. What are the facts? Since joining the Community from 1972 to 1990: real output, as measured by gross domestic product, has grown by over 87 per cent, or 3.6 per cent per annum, over 1 per cent per annum greater than the EC average; non-agricultural <i>per capita</i> remuneration increased by 2 per cent per annum in real terms; manufacturing output has increased by 194 per cent; non-agricultural employment has increased by almost 180,000 despite a decline of 45,000 in the early to mid-eighties and our population has increased by an estimated half a million persons.</P>
    <P>These are not the signs of an economy that has failed to prosper. Anyone who has been travelling around this country over the past 20 years will have seen the positive signs of our increased prosperity multiply over the period &mdash; be it in the <Col N="677" /> quality of our housing stock, the elegance and sophistication of many of our cities, towns and villages, the improved quality of our hotels and restaurants, the quality of our infrastructure and the increased self-confidence of our people. This is not to imply that all the improvements have come from our Community membership, but they have played an important part. Neither is it to imply that all is well and that there is nothing more to be done. We all know that there is much scope for improvement on all fronts. Just as the achievements of the past 20 years have been in part a product of our EC membership, the attainment of further improvements will be enhanced by our membership of a more integrated Europe.</P>
    <P>In this respect I have already stated my conviction that European Monetary Union will benefit the Community as a whole by boosting growth and employment and lowering inflation. It is up to ourselves, with the assistance of the Community's cohesion mechanisms, to ensure that we distil the maximum advantage from it.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Treaty underpins our existing commitments and goals in the area of economic policy. Furthermore, by pooling our sovereignty in this area we can combine with our Community partners to create the climate for low inflation allied with sustained, employment-creating growth. This will offer us a sound basis for boosting our employment level and living standards.</P>
    <P>A single monetary policy for the Community will see the Irish pound replaced eventually by the ECU. An important consequence of this for intra-Community trade will be the elimination both of transaction costs and of the exchange risk, which will be of special benefit to a small trading country such as Ireland. In addition, given our need for inward investment, the liberal regime which the Treaty prescribes for capital movements is one which is likely to serve our needs well.</P>
    <P>All in all, we stand to lose much more than we would gain if we reject the opportunity <Col N="678" /> which is now being offered to us to participate in full European Monetary Union. Our stature in the Community has grown considerably in recent years, not least because of our positive contribution to the evolution of the Community and because of our exemplary results in getting our economy back into shape. We would jeopardise that standing, our status in the financial markets and our attractiveness as a location for investment if we fail to give the new phase of deepening integration our overwhelming endorsement and support.</P>

      <P>After very serious internal debate and discussion, the Labour Party have called for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to the Maastricht Treaty. However, in calling for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote we will not be campaigning for an uncritical endorsement of the Treaty. We believe that this country will face huge challenges after Maastricht. For the Government to state otherwise is false and untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the specific issues about which the Labour Party are particularly concerned is the lack of democracy and accountability in relation to the European institutions as defined in the Maastricht Treaty. I note that in his speech on Maastricht the Taoiseach made no reference to the democratisation of the European institutions. The Government's lack of position with regard to democratisation of the common European institutions calls for clarification. The Labour Party believe that the Maastricht Treaty does not go far enough in opening up and democratising the decision-making process of the Community, particularly by refusing to give increased powers to the European Parliament. The Labour Party maintain that it is necessary to enter reservations in the broader area of democratising the common institutions of the Community <Col N="679" /> and the new Union. The failure to enlarge the powers of the European Parliament or ECOSOC to any significant extent is a major shortcoming, as is the refusal to open the proceedings of the various Councils of Ministers to public scrutiny and, therefore, accountability.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the issues involved in the division of powers between the Parliament and the Council in its various forms are complex and have received too little attention, not least in this country. Nevertheless, a more concrete blueprint for the future could have been expected from the Treaty, given that it is the first venture in the task of creating political union. Maastricht has failed to resolve key problems relating to democracy. This is a serious defect.</P>
    <P>The central issue is the balance between the powers of the Council of Ministers and those of the European Parliament, as well as the role of the Commission. The explanatory memorandum accompanying these conclusions notes that the Treaty does not meet the Parliament's demands in offsetting the perceived democratic deficit in the Community, despite the introduction of co-decision making in the 12 policy areas and the Parliament's new role in approving the appointment of the Commission.</P>
    <P>There are strong arguments that the European Parliament should be given genuine powers of co-decision in all areas with the right to initiate legislation. It is regrettable that the official Irish position on this point seems to be weak. It might be worth nothing that the Fianna Fáil Party are allied to a small and inconsequential political group within the European Parliament while five of the Irish members of the European Parliament are allied to groups which account for 60 per cent of the representation in the Parliament &mdash; the four Fine Gael members belong to the European People's Party and the Labour Party members belong to the Socialist Group. These two groups are basically the great power in the European Parliament. It is sad to think that the remaining ten Irish members belong to a two country group who have little or no <Col N="680" /> influence in the decision making process of the European Parliament. The remaining Irish members of the European Parliament are members of small groups such as the Rainbow Coalition and the Liberals. We will be faced with a dilemma when seeking more powers in the European Parliament, the only democratic institution in the Community, when our voice is fractured, so to speak, in this way.</P>
    <P>As powers are transferred from national governments to the Community and as more countries join the Community the influence of the Irish members in the Parliament will undoubtedly be diluted. I have no doubt that, as national powers are transferred to Community institutions, the democratic countries who make up the membership of the Community will demand a much stronger voice for the European Parliament, which, as I said, is the only democratic institution in the EC. This issue has been dealt with very lightly by the Taoiseach in his speech and in the debate on Maastricht. As I said, as time goes by there will be a far bigger demand for more democracy in the European Parliament. I compliment Fine Gael on their suggestion that a second chamber, along the lines of the American Senate, should be established. Smaller countries could have one representative in this senate while larger countries could have two representatives. This suggestion has merit and should be considered in the future.</P>
    <P>The German Socialist Party are strongly in favour of the extension of powers for the Parliament. The Labour Party believe that this point should be carefully assessed. We will adopt a policy stance on the interrelationship between various institutions with the objective of ensuring maximum democracy and accountability. The question of democracy within the European institutions is left as unfinished business at Maastricht and could arise again in the context of the Delors II package, future enlargement or the next ICG in 1996. In that regard the Labour Party will devote considerable time and resources to devolving our views on these questions in preparation for any <Col N="681" /> further stage in the integration process, preferably in common with our sister socialist parties. I do not have adequate time to develop this argument but I wish to say it is very important that this issue be dealt with properly in the debate on the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>It is important that all parties in this House realise that when the Maastricht Treaty is accepted &mdash; I believe it will be &mdash; there will be a demand for more democracy. The Irish voice, rather than becoming weaker in the European Parliament, will be heard more loudly. Being a country on the periphery it is important that our voice is not drowned by the other members &mdash; of the 513 members of that Parliament we have only 15. Our position should be clearly and constantly heard within the democratic institution of the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>Little is known publicly yet about the Maastricht Treaty. I presume it can be described as a follow-up to the Single European Act, dealing with economic and political union, monetary union, common currency, defence and security commitments and co-operation in justice and home affairs. What must be clarified is that it was agreed before the Treaty was signed by each country in February that to come into effect the Treaty must be ratified by all 12 countries &mdash; if one country failed to ratify the Treaty it would not come into effect. This position was clearly understood by all 12 countries, and by all political parties here, including the Government parties. That was made clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, as recently as 8 April in the Dáil when he said that if Ireland or any other state should decide not to ratify the Treaty, the Treaty will not come into effect for any state. He added that existing EC Treaties would remain in force and current policies such as Common Agricultural Policy and Structural Funds would remain in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in the last couple of weeks that a new line has been peddled by the Government in an effort to strike terror into voters. They said that if we vote no <Col N="682" /> we would be cast into exterior darkness and that the other 11 member states would go ahead without us. This line has been supported by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats as well as by the Foreign Affairs Minister in Denmark. Of course, the Danes, who are holding a referendum on this matter, are very strongly opposed to the Treaty and their Government are also only too glad to strike terror into their voters.</P>
    <P>The position has been clarified once again by the pro-European newspaper, <i>The European</i>, which examined the position that would arise if the Treaty was rejected by the Irish or the Danes, the only two countries that are holding a referendum on the matter. The legal position as outlined by them was that:</P>
    <P>The immediate effect of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would be that Maastricht becomes null and void for all 12 countries. What happens next is anyone's guess, but we would go back to the existing Treaties.</P>
    <P>Naturally, any decisions made afterwards would be made by all 12 member states of the EC. We would still be a member of the EC and, therefore, we would be part of whatever negotiations take place.</P>
    <P>While The Workers' Party opposed entry to the EC originally on grounds of huge industrial closures and job losses, which have proved to be only too true, nevertheless we have now committed ourselves to membership of the European Community and have called in recent years for expansion of the Community to include all countries of Europe. This is now becoming a distinct possibility and opens up a very exciting prospect for all of us in the future. However, we are most dissatisfied with the Treaty on European Union negotiated by our Government. The Government did a very bad job in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Social Charter, originally one of the main incentives for Ireland joining the European Community, is not part of the Treaty because of British opposition. I know that there is a separate agreement among the other 11 member states but the Social Charter is not part of the Treaty. New Cohesion Funds and <Col N="683" /> improved Structural Funds are purely aspirational and the so-called £6 billion does not exist. There is no mention of that in the Treaty and every day we hear more evidence that it will not be forthcoming from either the Germans or the British.</P>
    <P>The issue on which I want to spend my remaining time is the common foreign and security policy, which states in Article J4:</P>
    <P>The Common Foreign and Security Policy shall include all questions related to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a Common Defence Policy which might in time lead to common defence.</P>
    <P>If we vote yes this will clearly commit us to the framing of a common defence policy. Once the policy is framed, naturally the word &ldquo;might&rdquo; will be of little significance in the phrase as the organisation of common defence will proceed from the policy. However, common defence is already organised even before the policy is framed, as Article J2 reads:</P>
    <P>The Union requests the Western European Union, which is an integral part of the development of the Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. The Council shall, in agreement with the institutions of the Western European Union, adopt the necessary practical arrangements.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be simpler or clearer than this; there is no ambiguity. The Western European Union is an integral part of the development of the European Union. Our Government were quite clear on the meaning of this at the time and they objected to these words being inserted in the Treaty. However, those objections were overruled and the Government did nothing further about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Government also objected to Article J4.4 which states:</P>
    <P>The policy of the Union in accordance with the present Article shall not <Col N="684" /> prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States under the North Atlantic Alliance Treaty and be compatible with the Common Security and Defence Policy established within that framework.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Union, therefore, must be compatible with the common security and defence policy established under NATO.</P>
    <P>The text circulated by the EC Presidency at the Summit in December 1991 setting out the views of the Irish delegation on the Treaty &mdash; I am indebted to John Maguire and Joe Noonan for this information which was published in their book &mdash; states:</P>
    <P>It [the Irish delegation] has misgivings about wordings in the current text which establish a direct link between the provisions of the Treaty and the Union and the Security and Defence Policy conducted in the Atlantic Alliance.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we would never have known of the existence of this text but for the fact that Joe Noonan and John Maguire received it from, not an Irish MEP or from any Government source but from a British MEP. Naturally, the objections of the Irish Government were overruled but the Government did nothing further about the matter. They were fully aware that by signing these articles they were signing away our neutrality. If they had any desire to protect our neutrality they could have negotiated a Protocol allowing us to opt out of any security and defence commitments just as Britain opted out of the Social Charter commitments. This would allow the other 11 member states to make whatever provision they wished for security and defence arrangements outside of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>The Government are lying through their teeth on the issue of neutrality. They are supported by Fine Gael who have made it quite clear that they want to dump neutrality as an outdated policy. The Labour Party have accepted the <Col N="685" /> Government line that neutrality does not become an issue until 1996, but that is not true. By saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Maastricht, we are saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to neutrality as a policy. We would be tied to the Western European Union, which is the European army of NATO, and would be committed to defend what are called the fundamental interests of European union against Third World countries. Jacques Delors referred to resource wars because the major resources of the world required by western Europe are in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>In the face of what is clearly written in the Treaty, to which the Government objected, how can the Taoiseach say, as he said here on Tuesday, that neutrality is not an issue. He said that no decisions are required under the Treaty by participation in the common defence policy, but that is clearly untrue. It is a grossly dishonest attempt to mislead this House and the Irish people who will be voting on the issue. We are clearly committed in this Treaty to framing a common defence policy.</P>
    <P>The Western European Union is an integral part of the union. The Western European Union states retain its nuclear weapons and the policy of the union is to present the obligations of certain member states in NATO and will be compatible with the common security and defence policy of NATO. I am afraid, Taoiseach, that they have you tied up. There will be nothing to have a referendum on in 1996 as we already will have lost our neutrality. We will have lost our international respect. Our role in the United Nations will gradually fade as we become an integral part of what is becoming, in the words of President Jacques Delors, &ldquo;the European exploiting force&rdquo;. Who will trust us in our role as a peacekeeping force? In fact, it is clear in Yugoslavia at present that the EC is not trusted by either side, and the monitoring team had to leave the area. Only the UN is trusted as a peacekeeping force.</P>
    <P>We were very badly served by the Government team negotiating this Treaty. Apart from a promise of money, they got no specific protection for any of <Col N="686" /> Ireland's fundamental interests. In fact they sought to insert this disastrous Protocol on abortion, which is now causing such an unholy mess and is an embarrassment. It is damaging our credibility as a mature nation.</P>
    <P>We must try to regain our self-respect by voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; and renegotiating some aspects of the Treaty? We must show we are not for sale to the highest bidder. We must also question why there is a great rush to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. Is it because the EFTA countries have applied to join the Community? These countries have very strong economies, they have a strong independent spirit and a tradition of neutrality. Finland have made it clear that they want to retain their neutrality. In fact Ireland's neutrality within the EC was one of the main attractions for these countries to join the Community. They will find that we have let them down before they had the chance to join the Community as we will have sold out on our neutrality by ratifying this Treaty. We have done this for the promise of EC gold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this matter before we come to the close of this debate. Members do not need to be reminded that the ideals of the European Community were strongly endorsed by the people of Ireland in 1973 when we agreed to Ireland becoming a member of the EC and again in 1987 when we agreed to ratify the Single European Act. This voting support was given twice, not just in recognition of the financial and economic gains which we knew would ensue, but, I believe, from the conviction that politically, socially and psychologically we wanted to be part of the European ideal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The referendum on the Treaty of the European Union on 18 June will provide an opportunity for the Irish people to reaffirm our commitment to those ideals while making one of the most important and fundamental decisions since the foundation of the State. I am confident that there will be a substantial majority <Col N="687" /> in favour of the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; not because of any spirit of complacency but because it will be clear to the innate good sense of the Irish people that this country should, and must, be part of a progressive and outward looking Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland has gained immeasurably in political, social and economic terms since we joined the European Community in 1973. It would be inconceivable for this country not to want to play a full part in the historic developments now being put into place to build a Europe which will not alone be better able to provide improved living standards for its own people but a Europe that will also be a focus for stability, strength and peace in the new international political order which is now evolving from the profound changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Republics. Ireland as a nation long sought and put up a fight for democracy. We want now to play a positive role in its emergence in other lands.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Trade and Marketing I am very aware that the achievements of recent years, which brought our economy back from the brink of economic chaos, would not have been possible without the significant support made available by the Community. Direct financial transfers from the Community amounted to almost £2 billion last year alone in net terms, or almost 6 per cent of our total national income. For every £ 1 we contributed to the budget of the Community we received £6 in return. In addition, the Single Market programme, which will remove trade barriers between the member states of the Community and which will be completed by the end of this year, has already attracted significant investment in manufacturing enterprises in Ireland, particularly from countries such as the United States and Japan, to take advantage of the opportunities which the Single Market will provide across Europe. This investment has been an important factor in the more than 55,000 increase in employment achieved in the non-agricultural sector over the past five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> In the industrial development area, for example, not only has significant support been provided for the direct employment creating promotional activities of the IDA and SFADCo but the Structural Fund has enabled a major impetus to be given to the development of the marketing competence of Irish firms and to industry-related science and technology programmes. These are areas of recognised weakness in Irish industry which successive analyses of industrial policy over the years have identified for special attention.</P>
    <P>Free trade is Ireland's life blood. The small size of the Irish domestic market means that employment and living standards in this country are highly dependent on our success in international trade. We already have one of the most open trading economies in Europe. Exports of our goods and services account for over 70 per cent of our GNP and Irish exports are now found in over 120 countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Our most important trading links are with our European Community partners. In 1991 over £11 billion of our total exports of £15 billion were to markets in the European Community. In fact, I think it is instructive to look at our export portfolio before we joined the European Community. In 1972 the United Kingdom accounted for some 62 per cent of our exports with other EC countries, buying 17 per cent of our overseas sales. Twenty years later we have seen a dramatic shift in that balance.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom now accounts for just 32 per cent of our exports whereas other EC states take 42 per cent. Exports to the United Kingdom since we joined the European Community have increased by a factor of 12 whereas exports to other member states have increased by a factor of 56. Normally I do not go in for statistics as they are very dry but these statistics are very telling. They show the success we have achieved over the past 20 years in dramatically broadening our export base. From being a country which relied almost solely on exporting to our nearest neighbour, we <Col N="689" /> are now exporting our goods throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the value of our exports to the Community grew by 5 per cent to £15 billion &mdash; the highest ever. There is no point in patting ourselves on the back and then sitting back and saying &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; because there is no room for complacency. Nobody owes us a living and competition for markets will intensify in the future. This is why under the Industry Operational Programme, which is funded by the EC Structural Fund, the Government highlighted the need to improve the marketing capability of Irish industry. Structural Fund support underpins the ability of the Government to get behind and support the marketing efforts of Irish industry. Since 1989 Exchequer funding for marketing programmes has increased by some 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Community is, therefore, opening up enlarged and more accessible markets and providing us with financial support which helps our firms to break into those markets. We must trade to survive and the movement towards even closer economic and political union can only assist us in these efforts.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty underlines the importance of research in strengthening the competitive position of European industry. The EC already provides considerable support for research in Ireland &mdash; about £35 million per annum under the Structural Fund &mdash; with further support available under the £4 billion Third Framework Programme for Research and Development. The Delors II financial package for the years 1993-97 proposes a 70 per cent increase in EC funding for research between now and 1997. Our ability to avail of such increased research funds is dependent on Ireland continuing to commit itself fully to the creation of a European Union.</P>
    <P>The significant increases in expenditure on measures to improve the marketing performance of Irish industry and on industry-related S &amp; T measures could not have been contemplated within available public sector financial resources without the co-financing available under the Structural Fund which allows the <Col N="690" /> recovery from the Community of 75 per cent of the direct State expenditure involved. The returns from this expenditure will come not just from an immediately welcome, if modest, direct employment effect but more significantly, by building the foundations in marketing and technological competence within Irish industry and its supporting infrastructure which will provide a sound basis for sustainable job creation in future years.</P>
    <P>The Community's commitment to the development of less-developed countries, such as Ireland, is strengthened under the Maastricht Treaty. The role of the Structural Fund as a principal instrument for transfering resources from richer to poor areas of the Community is re-affirmed and greater flexibility in using those funds for development purposes has been provided for &mdash; in the area of educational facilities, for example.</P>
    <P>By participating fully in the process now leading to economic and monetary union we will send out a clear signal of economic stability and discipline to potential investors of both domestic and overseas origin in the Irish economy. Exchange rate uncertainties will be removed with a resultant downward pressure on interest rates. That, too, will help us in our business developments particularly in the manufacturing sector. The eventual emergence of a single currency will remove transaction costs for Irish Trade within a community.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, another issue on which the people of Ireland are being asked to decide in the context of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution and which the Taoiseach referred to in his address to the House is the ratification of the Agreement on a Community Patent. I want to try to put the agreement into perspective and, to do so, I must first refer to another, completely separate, patent convention called the European Patent Convention.</P>
    <P>The European Convention was concluded in Munich in October in 1973 and signed by a number of European <Col N="691" /> Countries, Ireland included, some of whom were members states of the EC and others who are mainly EFTA countries. This convention entered into force in 1977 and the European Patent Office, which was established by that convention, has been functioning since 1978 and granting European patents which have the same effect as national patents in the countries which have ratified that Convention.</P>
    <P>The agreement relating to Community patents is, in fact, rooted in the European Patent Convention and ratification of the European Convention, is therefore, a necessary prerequisite for ratification of the agreement. The agreement was established at Luxembourg in December 1989 amongst the member states of the EC. Its purpose is to establish a system for the grant of Community patents, that is, a unitary supranational patent valid throughout the entire area of EC internal market. This patent, will have uniform legal character throughout the whole area of the Community, transcending the boundaries of and independent of the individual national laws of the 12 member states.</P>
    <P>It is the European Patent Office which will actually perform the grant of Community patents as well as continuing to perform its existing function of granting European patents. Administrative procedures in connection with the obtaining of a Community patent will be somewhat less cumbersome for inventors and they will also be able to maintain their Community patents in force by one single annual payment instead of 12 different sets of national renewal fees. The agreement also creates a centralised litigation procedure for Community patents under the common system of law set down in the agreement.</P>
    <P>With the completion of the internal market, it is obvious that the Community patent is an important element in the process of completion of the market and provides an important measure of protection for inventions by one uniform patent covering the entirety of the internal market. I should mention that <Col N="692" /> Ireland's ratification of the European Patent Convention has already been made possible by the recent enactment of the Patents Act, 1992, and our ratification of that convention will be effective in a few months time. Thus, we have already taken the first step to enable us to ratify the Community patent agreement. That in itself will be seen as progressive.</P>
    <P>The logical next step, therefore, is for us to join with our partners in the ratification, in due course, of the agreement. That step, however, poses a constitutional problem which the Bill, presently before the House, seeks to address. I should say too, that Denmark have a problem in relation to the voting strength needed to see that matter through but I understand they are making progress. The agreement is not an instrument made under the legal framework of the European Community Treaties. It provides for the setting up of a supranational Community patent appeal court with jurisdiction to determine certain matters concerning Community patents raised on appeal from decisions of national courts. Moreover, jurisdiction is also conferred on the Court of Justice in relation to preliminary rulings on questions concerning interpretation of the EC Treaty. Ireland's adherence to the agreement is not necessitated by our membership of the Communities and thus the jurisdictions of the bodies referred to are not covered by the exemption for which the Third Amendment of the Constitution provides.</P>
    <P>The approval of the House to the proposed constitutional amendment in this area will enhance our reputation and will be seen as a positive and progressive step. It makes eminent common sense as to how we do our business apart from wishing to be approved of. I would not go along with the idea that we always want this benign approval. We are going along with this as well because it is a commitment we have already entered into and also because it makes economic and business sense. On 18 June voters will be asked to ratify this as well within the total framework of what they are approving.</P>
    <P>Matters were raised by Deputy Garland <Col N="693" /> in this House which perhaps he did not quite understand. I should like to clear up those points because they are quite serious and if they gained currency could leave people worried about certain matters. Rather than have the hare skip all over the country I want to have the hare sit. He raised the possibility that patents may be granted in respect of human beings or in respect of human genes because, as he said, the European Patent Office had granted a patent in respect of a transgenic mouse. This may be something which, on an initial hearing, raises a smile but, in fact, it is a serious matter and he was right to raise it.</P>
    <P>In the time which remains I do not think I can read the briefing document which has been given to me but I can inform Deputy Garland that that particular patent was granted because the development of this matter is an important test model in seeking a cure for cancer. One would wish that such usage was not necessary but if there are to be developments in the search for cures &mdash; there is ongoing research and development in that area &mdash; for cancer, it is obvious that tests of one kind or another must be carried out. That was the reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason that particular mouse was used. I understand that the European Patent Office decision to grant a patent in respect of this particular genetically engineered mouse was taken after very careful consideration of a number of issues. It does not mean that other patents will be granted in the future for transgenic animals on a routine basis. I understand that was one of the points put forward by Deputy Garland. The policy is that all applications for patents in this area will be individually and <Col N="694" /> rigorously scrutinised. I am informed that another patent application in respect of a different mouse has been refused by the European officer on the basis that the objective underlying the research was not considered sufficiently meritorious to mankind. Therefore, the principle underlying such usage is clearly identified for research and development and hopefully it will result in the cure of various diseases &mdash; in this case the research was for a cure for a particular form of cancer.</P>
      <P>Fears will be allayed in this area if I mentioned that the EC has submitted a draft Directive on the legal protection of biotechnology inventions. It has gone through much technical discussion and is being considered by the European Parliament. Following their views I understand there will be a provision prohibiting the grant of patents in respect of human beings or parts of the human body. I understand furthermore there is absolutely no question of the European Patent Office granting patents in respect of genes in the human body. I want to put that confirmation very clearly on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>I accept that Deputy Garland raised this in a serious way. Sometimes issues that appear trivial become important. Naturally people are worried about research and development later to be defined were this European patent matter to be pursued. But that is not the way the matter will develop. We have firm confirmation of that and I would like Deputy Garland, the House and the wider community to accept the bona fides in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provisions laid out relating to consumer protection in the Maastricht Treaty. These commit the Communities to contributing to a high level of consumer protection through measures adopted for the completion of the internal market by the development of specific directives which support and supplement action by member states to protect the health, safety and economic interests of consumers and the provision of improved information for them. The interests of consumers are guarded in the Communities' <Col N="695" /> policies as laid out in the three year plan for consumer policy. Priority for the further development of consumer policy have now been set. Measures to improve consumer representation and consumer information are being actively considered.</P>
    <P>I now want to address one particular aspect of our membership of the European Community, one that is of prime importance to me and to the women of the country. That is, the position of Irish women after almost 20 years of Community membership. At the most basic level the EC has been central in redressing the inequality of opportunity between women and men. Measures have been taken to provide for equal treatment with regard to pay, access to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions and for improving the conditions applying to women in the area of social security. Work is continuing in this last area and is ongoing too with regard to the protection at work of pregnant women, the provision of parental leave and the status of women in society generally.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in advancing the position of Irish women, advances which, I have no doubt, would not have taken place, or at least not to the same extent, if Ireland had not been a member of the EC. When national governments were inclined to drag their feet the EC stepped in. In the seventies those of us who were in the workforce were trying to get equal pay and the then Commissioner pushed it at that time. Much still remains to be done and there is no room for complacency.</P>
    <P>The EC is not only committed to the principal of equality for women, it also honours and works to fulfil that commitment. I am proud to be an Irish woman and also to be a woman of Europe. The adoption of the Maastricht Treaty will result in the reinforcement and enhancement of what has been achieved to date and I am confident that Irish women, whether working within or outside their home, will stand with me on June 18 and vote for the Eleventh <Col N="696" /> Amendment of the Constitution and give Maastricht a resounding yes.</P>

      <P>The Irish people have no real alternative to voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June next and we should not feel despondent about doing so. For Ireland great opportunities will arise, but there are huge potential hazards in the new integrated Europe. Between the restrictions placed upon us by the new European Union in regard to how we manage our own economy and the opportunities that will exist in the free trade area of over 340 million people our prospects are largely in our own hands. Let nobody think for a moment that there will be any free lunches here. Europe, like the US and Japan, must adopt the &ldquo;lean and mean&rdquo; approach, as the Americans say, to the creation of industrial jobs and be competitive on the world scene. What we all must realise is that a thriving, prosperous industrial Europe with a razor edged competitive structure is the only way to reduce the dole queues Community wide. A prosperous Europe is the only hope peripheral areas like Ireland have of raising a sustained consumer spending regime, and the most heavily populated areas of the new union will be the greatest boost we could get as an exporting nation. In relative terms few other countries would gain to the same degree as we would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is no shortage of problems. West Germany is going through a tortuous time domestically at the moment. Many opponents of the Maastricht Treaty tried to sell the line that our national identity would be submerged and somehow we will become common Europeans. West Germany illustrated that blood is thicker than water when 24 million of its own brothers and sisters in East Germany needed financial assistance after the Berlin Wall collapsed. West Germany clearly showed its commitment <Col N="697" /> to national unity, and rightly so. I have no doubt that as a result of what happened in West Germany, which I always regard as the Paymaster General within the EC, there are many small farmers in the West who will receive fewer headage cheques. However, history provides an excellent indication of what Germany can do economically and I believe they will ride this storm also.</P>
    <P>If the European Union is anything it is a mechanism to facilitate different backgrounds and different national aspirations to proceed down a charted planned course of togetherness on specific issues while at the same time giving sufficient space to states and ethnic groups within states to live their lives their way. Surely nobody is suggesting that there will be fewer people in Croke Park for next year's All Ireland Final just because 12 European countries are more integrated. I believe next year's All Ireland Fleadh Ceoil is unlikely to be cancelled as a result of European Union. I also believe that, despite the Government's messing with the abortion issue, Ireland can frame its own laws in relation to the abortion issue and other related matters without any interference from our partners.</P>
    <P>Because I represent a constituency in the West of Ireland, naturally I have certain reservations about the Maastricht Treaty which I intend to put on the record of the House today. I want to speak about the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund for a moment. As everybody knows, we are the net beneficiaries of EC funds to the tune of the ratio of 6.5:1. This has undoubtedly meant that many of the projects that are to be seen all over Ireland would not be there were it not for our involvement in Europe. However, it is also true that much of the investment is substitution investment for what we should have been able to fund from our own resources had we managed our economy properly over the last 15 years. The mind boggles at what we would have been able to do if we did not have to meet a bill of £2.5 billion in interest every year to service our national debt. When put into the context of the so-called £6 billion Structural Fund which <Col N="698" /> we are supposed to get, it gives one a very clear indication of just how bad our economy is.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that the £6 billion is there. I believe it depends largely on how well the European economy performs over the next few years. However, I believe that the aspiration to provide the money by the major states is of huge importance to us. I also believe that the Cohesion Fund will be very important, and there are just a few things that I want to say quickly about it. The poorer countries &mdash; Greece, Portugal, Spain and ourselves &mdash; will be the only people who will be financed from this. It is vital that this fund when in place will acknowledge the difficulty of poor, remote rural areas in finding the matching own resources to attract such investment. I refer to the level of resources that would have to be made available locally in order to qualify for grant aid schemes under the Cohesion Fund. Let me give the example of the headage schemes in the severely handicapped areas over the past number of years. Until quite recently we were funded on a pound for pound basis. Unfortunately, as the noose tightened because of our poor economic circumstances, it was more difficult to get our pound in the last few years than it was to find the pound in Brussels. That is a major problem.</P>
    <P>I believe that circumstances will arise in the very remote, peripheral areas of this country where money from the Cohesion Fund will have to be transferred on the basis of not much more than 10 per cent of our own resources being necessary to qualify. I want to outline briefly why it is important for those funds to be earmarked specifically for peripheral areas like the west. As statistics show, people are regularly leaving the west, we lost people in Connacht and Ulster even in the good times in the seventies and it is now acknowledged that many areas in those provinces have gone beyond the stage of helping themselves because the working population aged from 25 to 50 is almost entirely missing in some parishes. The problem is that we have a huge number of students at <Col N="699" /> colleges and schools at one end of the scale and huge numbers of elderly people drawing their old age pensions at the other end of the scale. In between, there is almost a missing generation. If cohesion in Europe means anything it will have to redress this population imbalance. I am more afraid of our own Government and Civil Service mentality than I am of anything which might happen in Europe. A great proportion of funds which were specifically earmarked for the peripheral areas over the past 20 years did not get here and there is ample evidence to show that they were hijacked to boost the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There is now an overwhelming case for regionalisation. Well researched, integrated plans in regions which share common problems must be the basis for funding from the Cohesion Fund. I wish to compare the very real problems which exist in Ballymun, Dublin, with those facing communities in places like Clifden, County Galway. Of course direct comparison is not the answer. I accept that it will be necessary for the Department of Finance to be involved, that is normal, but a case cannot be made on grounds of economic priority to put a community in Clifden, Belmullet or Dingle, in direct competition with a city or town, which is happening at present. There are fewer representatives from those areas and they have less clout because they are on the periphery of the periphery. That is why, if the Cohesion Fund means anything, it will have to be written into the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland has one chance left to genuinely plan ahead for the peripheral areas. Funding must be earmarked specifically in such cases and I strongly make the case that it must be part and parcel of the Cohesion Fund, otherwise areas such as those I represent will get nothing. I wanted to refer to many other areas, including agriculture, but I just have time to say that I will be delighted to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on 18 June. I hope that everybody else will do the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the House for allowing Deputy Connaughton <Col N="700" /> to share his time with me. On the foundation of this State 70 years ago could it have been envisaged that Ireland would, in such a short period, have a seat at the governing table of the single biggest political and economic bloc in the world? Not only has that been attained but Ireland has had the Presidency of the European Community four times since joining in 1973.</P>
      <P>Critics say that Ireland has suffered economically because of our membership of the EC. Yet, in the past 20 years, the growth rate of our gross domestic product exceeded that of the rest of the EC by 25 per cent. This could not have been achieved from outside the Community. There has been a problem in relation to employment with larger numbers coming on to the labour market because of the high rate of population growth in recent decades and because of rampant State policies where the State spent 65 per cent of GNP and did not do so efficiently. More than likely, it was higher than in any other European country. Our tax system is asset based rather than an incentive to production and the high numbers of a certain age group have all contributed to the current high level of unemployment. If we had been outside the EC it is possible that we would have had slightly lower levels of unemployment, albeit people being paid Third World wages. We certainly would not have been able to pay the level of social security we pay to those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed.</P>
      <P>Unemployment remains a cancer in our society and must be at the top of our agenda. The promotion of employment is one of the main objectives of the Treaty's social policy provisions. The Protocol on social policies sets out the following objectives: the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions, proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of social exclusion.</P>
      <P>Already our membership of the EC has allowed us to diversify our trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> Before we joined the EC, almost two-thirds of our total exports went to the UK, now only about one-third of our exports go to the UK, while over 40 per cent go to other EC states. This strengthens our sovereignty and independence.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the EC has brought social progress. The EC Commitment to equal pay and equal opportunities has considerably improved the rights of Irish women. This is something which I would like to see copperfastened by a full constitutional amendment here to give equal rights to all citizens without distinction of sex.</P>
    <P>The Treaty on European Union which contains seven titles or sections and 17 Protocols &mdash; which I understand are binding &mdash; together with 33 declarations, is a positive evolution from the 1957 Treaty of Rome which gave us the European Economic Community, the 1987 Single European Act which gave us the European Community and this third Treaty which will bring about European Union.</P>
    <P>As part of the co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs, I would like to see the setting up of a drugs enforcement agency to combat the inflow and distribution of illegal, lethal and addictive drugs throughout the European Community, especially within these islands. This should be possible under the third pillar of the Treaty. I should like this agency to lead a diplomatic offensive of the EC against countries which are exporting these death drugs to our community. In the time available it is not possible to deal with all these headings in detail but I should like to make a general reference to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>In relation to the existing Community framework and declaration 21 on the Court of Auditors contained in the Maastricht Treaty, I should like to raise the question of value for money for the European taxpayer, including the Irish taxpayer. For too long the European Community has been seen as a legitimate target for fraud by a variety of member states and citizens within those states. The European Community can no longer afford to be seen as a soft touch. The strengthening of the role of the Court <Col N="702" /> of Auditors would assist in combating fraud. In this regard national parliaments should review annually the report of the Court of Auditors and members of the EC Court of Auditors should be asked to appear before the audit committees &mdash; such as the Public Accounts Committee &mdash; of the Parliaments of the member states. This should be in addition to their relationship with the EC Budget Committee and its sub-committee and not a substitute for that relationship.</P>
    <P>This would help to some extent in addressing the question of the democratic deficit and would help to concentrate minds on cleaning up our act in relation to mis-spending of taxpayer's money at European level, fraud and maladministration.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a meeting of Budget Committees of National Parliaments of the EC together with the Budget Committee of the European Parliament. It was clear from that meeting that Germany in particular is concerned about the democratic deficit. The transfer of certain economic decisions to a central body further weakens the role of the elected politician. This is of concern particularly to the Germans but it should also be of concern to us. It is time to consider an elected European Senate on US model which should be given the role of protecting smaller member states. This, with a democratically accountable Government of Europe, elected directly by a Lower House of the European Parliament, would be a far more evolutionary and revolutionary move to consider than the way we have allowed our parliamentary institutions to develop in the recent past.</P>
    <P>The role of this European Government and Parliament could be distinguished from those of national governments and parliaments in a European constitution. The present democratic deficit and overlap of national responsibilities with European responsibilities is cumbersome and may be inefficient. If we are to have a real European Union should we have a real European Government and a real European Parliament?</P>
    <P>The European Community, and the <Col N="703" /> European Union which is now evolving, is concerned with peace as much as with prosperity. Much has been made by the Taoiseach of the alleged £6 billion which he says will be coming our way from the new structural and cohesion funds. Leaving aside what we will gain financially from European Union, is it not to our benefit to be in a Europe at peace and which can hope to influence the peaceful evolution of the world?</P>
    <P>The European Coal and Steel Community was a pooling of resources in order to prevent a recurrence of World War II. It was from this that the European Community as we know it today grew. Much is being made by those who oppose the Treaty of Irelands' neutrality and our surrender of sovereignty. First of all, we are not surrendering sovereignty; we are pooling sovereignty. We are being given a say in the economies of our neighbours. Indeed it can be argued that we are more sovereign since we are not completely dependent on the UK for our exports, and by having a representative on the European Central Bank we will have a say in monetary policy instead of being linked effectively to the Deutsche Mark without any say as to exchange rates.</P>
    <P>Those who condemn our membership of the EC on the basis that it affects our neutrality are often among the front runners in eulogising our membership of the United Nations. Yet our membership of the United Nations compels us to facilitate directives from the Security Council to make available our ports, for example, where the Security Council has sanctioned direct action against a country.</P>
    <P>In the event that a European Defence Community revolves &mdash; and this is not for decision until 1996 although the Community has genuflected in that direction &mdash; Ireland should be a full member. This is not Albania. We cannot leave the United Nations or leave the European Community. It is disingenous to say that we should distance ourselves from the EC and then embrace the United Nations. The Fifth and Thirteenth Hague <Col N="704" /> Conventions, which set down the definition of a neutral state, require such a state to deny access equally to all belligerents in times of war. We did not do that during the Gulf War and could not do so under the terms of the United Nations Charter while remaining a member. We have obligations internationally to the UN and EC. If the EC develops a defence policy we should be part of it. If it is worth being a member of the Community then it is worth defending that Community. It is hypocritical of the Government to run away from this issue. Maastricht is about peace, not war. It was the Europe of nation states that gave us a series of wars culminating in the Second World War.</P>
    <P>In relation to cohesion and the funds to be made available for infrastructure, I would make a special plea that the Irish Government seek funding for the refurbishment of inner city flats. This can be justified on the basis that within our inner cities we already have infrastructure such as roads, churches, schools, shops, sewerage etc. We also have in Dublin city some of the poorest housing conditions in western Europe. Of the 16,000 Dublin Corporation flats in Dublin city about 10,000 are, in my view, unfit as decent places to live. The standard by which I judge this is that no Member of this House would aspire to live there or for our children to live there. Yet we compel our citizens to live in these flats. If the flats could be refurbished &mdash; and this could be financed for between £10 million and £20 million per year &mdash; it would mean that the rest of our infrastructure would be put to full use and we might not have to build roads out to green field sites around the city together with the expense of new sewerage systems etc. In turn it would help to keep the city a living city.</P>
    <P>I urge support for the Maastricht Treaty. Fine Gael is not a slightly European party; we are a fully committed European party and will be campaigning vigorously in the interests of this country that people support the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to this important debate on European Union. The referendum on the Treaty which takes place in June is as important to the economy of this country, and for generations to come, as the referendum which took place when we became members of the Community close on 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>I have been criticised for allegedly jeopardising the vote for European Union because I have continually asked for assurances on the abortion issue in advance of the referendum. I make no apology for my position. It is not I but the Government who are placing this historical vote in jeopardy. And I warn them once again that they must clear the doubts on the abortion question now or face an embarrassing and unnecessarily small majority in favour of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>What I have called for all along, and call for again today, is a clear and unequivocal commitment from the Government that the important issues, such as the right to travel, the right to information and the copperfastening of our laws against abortion under any circumstances, will be faced and dealt with as a matter of urgency, ideally before 18 June.</P>
      <P>It is not just my own concern that I am expressing here. It is the concern of a huge number of Irish people from my party and from many parties in this House; and the Government who refuse to listen to such concern do so at their peril.</P>
      <P>It is unbecoming of a Government or their leader to make cheap jibes about someone who expresses a contrary opinion. This is a vital moral issue that transcends petty politics or sour grapes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such is the delay of the Government in producing the promised text on the right to travel and the right to information that I must question if there is a <Col N="706" /> hidden agenda somewhere. Is it a case of the liberal wing in the Cabinet pushing a bit too far for the conservative element within it?</P>
    <P>If the political will is there, it should be possible to agree a formula of words today rather than in three months' time on such a basic but admittedly complex matter. So what is the delay? The House deserves an answer.</P>
    <P>Having made my position clear on the abortion question, which is unfortunately linked to this great national debate, I want to make if equally clear that I am strongly supportive of European Union. If this Treaty is not approved by the people it will be a national tragedy.</P>
    <P>I would now like to concentrate and focus on the economic and monetary aspects of the Treaty, which are at its central core, and more specifically on how it affects our basic industry of agriculture and food. I would like to compliment the authors of the short guide to the Treaty. It is quite readable to the ordinary man in the street and luckily will be circulated to all the people. This is not to find fault with the contents of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>There has been so much spoken and written about this Treaty including a lot of hot air, that its basic purpose &mdash; economic and monetary union and its considerable advantages to Ireland's economic sector &mdash; might easily not be fully realised throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote are overwhelming and I have no doubt that Irish intelligence will see it that way. So much attention and time has been devoted to words and their meaning that there is a real danger of our neglecting the measures necessary to exploit the economic advantages of the new situation. Attention should not be diverted from taking these measures while there is still time and there is not much time left. We will have full economic and monetary union by 1999 at the latest.</P>
    <P>As was the case in the 1972 referendum for entry to Europe, the economic arguments must focus strongly on the future of the sheet anchor of Ireland's national <Col N="707" /> economy &mdash; the agricultural and food sector.</P>
    <P>As the White Paper reminds us, the agricultural and food sector accounts for more than 40 per cent of net foreign earnings, and 70 per cent of agricultural output must find an export market. The capacity to find that market at the best possible prices lies at the very heart of the future well-being of Irish farming and all who depend on it.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has been very beneficial but the Common Agricultural Policy has changed, is changing, and will undergo further change in the future. This process is acknowledged in paragraphs 3.12 and 3.14 of the White Paper. Radical changes are already being considered at the level of the Council of Ministers. These include: price reduction in cereals, lower milk quotas and alterations in the beef intervention system. While a staunch battle is being waged on Ireland's behalf, it must be remembered that the overall situation makes it difficult for our farmers.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, now in progress, will definitely result in some reduction of market support and easier access to European markets by produce from outside the Community.</P>
    <P>These are not forces that might emerge in the distant future. They are already upon us.</P>
    <P>Further pressure is coming also from Central and Eastern European countries hoping ultimately to become members. A number of factors will bring about their increasing involvement in trade in agriculture and agricultural products. While there is no point in being pessimistic, we must be realistic.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in paragraph 2.19 of the White Paper, price stability is the only sound basis for sustainable economic growth. This is particularly true in the case of agriculture, but at what level of price, for what quantity and at what margin over costs?</P>
    <P>If Irish agriculture is to exploit the advantages of economic and monetary union, it must improve its competitive <Col N="708" /> position, especially in continential markets. The key factors are obvious; efficiency of production and processing of the raw material, unassailable high quality of the food product and marketing capability.</P>
    <P>As to production of the raw material, Irish farmers have been going through a rough time recently. But they have always responded to reasonably favourable conditions, especially price. They are now more than ever before dependent on the processing sector, as recent happenings in the beef enterprise have demonstrated. In turn, both are affected by marketing performance.</P>
    <P>We will be successful on export markets only if we supply a premium product and on time. This calls for more effective co-ordination of effort between all stages than exists today. The proceedings at the beef tribunal have highlighted the extraordinary multiplicity of agencies, public and private, involved in selling a single product. Surely it can be made more cost efficient through effective co-ordination and rationalisation. One need only look at the success of the dairy, poultry and mushroom industries to appreciate the benefits of integrating the different stages in the chain.</P>
    <P>These aspirations will be achieved only by enterprising individuals and efficient organisations or structures. Are existing organisations the right ones for the changing conditions? How long, for instance, must farmers suffer until bovine TB is eliminated? So far all attempts have failed. Let us be practical and do something about it &mdash; make whatever changes are needed but make them now.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the White Paper, in paragraph 3.25, places particular emphasis on support for the marketing function. This is of extreme importance. Central to it is education and training.</P>
    <P>On farmer training we have another example of the age-old Irish disease. Is Teagasc, for example, serving the Irish farmer as intended? The Minister should ask himself &mdash; and ask himself now &mdash; whether there is something inherently wrong with its structure.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that in the new <Col N="709" /> areas for Community action under the Treaty, education is a priority for Ireland. This is contained in paragraph 6.14. A sustained all-out effort must be made to develop competence if not fluency in modern European languages. It is to be hoped that there will be the very maximum possible participation in the Community actions outlined in Articles 126 and 127 of the Treaty on developing competence in European languages and encouraging mobility of students and teachers, particularly young people. I earnestly hope for the fullest participation in the Lingua programme.</P>
    <P>Again, is there need for rationalisation in the many public agencies involved in the field of education and training? Much has been written and talked about integrated rural development and, no doubt, the Community support framework, ESF, is well designed. But for many years to come, integrated rural development will succeed or fail around the farm family. The members of that family have their own aspirations, standards and potential. These are best understood and nurtured by their local kin. While I agree with the principle of the subregional review committees, I would welcome still more active local consultation and a greater input of local knowledge. Excessive centralisation would be their death knell.</P>
    <P>The message is clear. The future of this country is in being part of the European Union. There is no alternative. The Government must provide clarity. The campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote demands leadership. It requires an honest and courageous approach from the Government to this crucial matter to ensure a massive and positive response from the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>I thank the Deputy for sharing his time with me. I believe that the Treaty on European Union will provide the House with the most fundamental debate so far in the 26th Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before commencing the few remarks I should like to make in relation to that Treaty, I should like to indicate that I join the Government in efforts to clarify <Col N="710" /> that it is not about abortion. We must always be conscious of the confusion among the public about this matter. Recently a woman in my constituency asked me whether Maastricht was the Dutch word for abortion. Possibly, the fault for some of the confusion lies with politicians because we continually refer to the word &ldquo;Maastricht&rdquo; instead of talking about the Treaty on European Union. I consider that we should refer to the Treaty as the debate continues. We should not underestimate the degree of public confusion about the distinction between the issues. This confusion has dominated public and political life for the past four months. While we might assume that at this stage everybody could easily identify that distinction, that is not an assumption we should make.</P>
    <P>What the Treaty does establish in relation to abortion is that the issue must be dealt with here. We must deal with this issue through our Constitution and laws as a clearly separate issue from the many important issues contained in the Treaty. From this week on, the debate must go into the specific issues as they relate to our country. I am not satisfied that we will not be taking any chances in agreeing to the Treaty. We should appreciate that we are handing over to the European Union most of our ability to undertake unilateral independent action and that we are in essence tying our hopes and aspirations to a dream of developing co-operation and access. On balance, Ireland has benefited tremendously over the past 20 years of membership of the EC. We must strongly recommend the continuation of those benefits, through the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Those who point to our uneven economic performance in the last 20 years should try to concentrate on what it would be like if we had been outside the European Community. How would we have been able to attract foreign investment and maintain our agricultural industry or do anything about our infrastructure? We have benefited from our membership and we should recognise that.</P>
    <P>Through European Monetary Union <Col N="711" /> Ireland and other less developed countries have given up much. The ability of member states to influence their own economies through unilateral fiscal moves has been effectively removed. This affects larger states less because they are well off and the fiscal limits are sufficient for them to cope with the normal ups and downs of an economic cycle. In addition, they have larger industries which are better able to dominate the Single Market. Less developed countries need an assurance of extra assistance from outside the domestic budget. This is where the Cohesion Fund plays a role and where it is crucial to Ireland.</P>
    <P>To those who claim that our neutrality has been done away with by this Treaty I would point to the fact that the Treaty explicitly states that we cannot be forced to accept anything. Voting must be unanimous and the European Court may not be used to enforce compliance. While we are committed to consensus we have reserved the right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. This is the ultimate protection of our neutrality and it is a right which members of NATO do not have. My support of the common foreign and security policies is based on the presumption that we will be able to say no when we disagree on fundamental issues and that the declaration on voting in the field of foreign and security policy will not achieve an overriding importance.</P>
    <P>I support the social policy, particularly the fact that the Treaty gives force to the Social Charter. We must welcome its explicit commitment to intensified action to ensure the implementation of the principle of equality. We should remember that when countries are vying for investment and business there is a temptation to ignore poor conditions and exploitation. The social dimension of the Treaty is central in trying to overcome this and the Social Charter is central to the advancement of women in the workforce.</P>
    <P>I welcome the institutional changes proposed which I hope will start to reduce the legendary waste of the Community. While I welcome the new procedure of <Col N="712" /> increasing the influence of the European Parliament, I hope the revised decision-making process will not become an impediment to efficient and speedy action. I strongly welcome the Treaty apart from the specific reservations to which I have referred I strongly support the Bill and I am happy to join the many speakers who have recommended the European Treaty to the people. I hope the people will give the Treaty their enthusiastic backing in the referendum.</P>

      <P>On benefits of the Community, we sometimes forget the extent to which the European Community and the development of European Union has become a part of our lives. We have played our part in its development over the last two decades and it has come to occupy a significant place in Irish life. Its impact has been extensive. Agriculture, our most important industry, is now an integral part of European agriculture through the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy. Our industry depends on the Community market for its trade. In our foreign policy, we use our position as a member state to enhance our role in influencing developments on the international scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are elements of Community activity which we may take for granted. The Community provides funds which help to improve our roads. It plays an important part in funding third level education in the regional technical colleges. It has brought higher standards of environmental protection to Ireland &mdash; standards we might not have attained had we remained outside. In the workplace norms for health and safety have been reinforced by Community action. Women's rights to equality of treatment are underpinned by Community legislation &mdash;<Col N="713" /> again reaching standards which might not have been attained had we stayed outside.</P>
    <P>The Treaty will reinforce those achievements and bring Community action into areas of benefit to the individual citizen. The capacity to act in the environment has been increased. Consumer affairs is now the subject of a special chapter. So are education and health. The citizen's rights are recognised in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>These benefits exist apart from the wider benefits which economic and monetary union and the improvements in the cohesion dimension will bring. Education, health, the environment and culture are of vital and immediate significance to the individual citizen. We should consider these aspects when we assess the balance sheet of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom trácht anois ar Alt tábhachtach don saoránach sa gComhphobal. Is é sin an tAlt faoin gcultúr.</P>
    <P>Is trí eolas a chur ar chultúir eile a chuireann muid eolas orainn féin. Tá Alt a bhaineann le cultúr amháin sa gConradh ar an Aontas Eorpach. Bhí sé seo ar cheann d'aidhmeanna an Rialtais le linn na hidirbheartaíochta. Treisíonn an tAlt seo leis an urraim a thugann an Comhphobal don éagsúlacht chultúrtha idir na ballstáit agus taobh istigh de na ballstáit, agus ag an am céanna leagann sé béim ar an gcúlra cultúrtha amháin atá ag muintir na hEorpa trí chéile. De réir an Ailt caithfidh an Comhphobal cúrsaí cultúir a chur san áireamh nuair a bhíonn gníomhaíochtaí á mbeartú faoin gConradh.</P>
    <P>Tugann an tAlt nua seo maidir le cultúr dúshlán na hÉireann, agus na mballstát ar fad, aitheantas a thabhairt ina gcuid gníomhaíochtaí d'éagsúlacht agus do shaibhreas chultúrtha an Chomhphobail. Is léir uaidh, gurb é is mian leis an gComhphobal, go mairfeadh an éagsúlacht sin, agus gur mó an t-eolas a chuirfeadh muintir na hEorpa ar a gcultúir féin agus ar chultúir a chéile.</P>
    <P>D'iarr an Teachta Michael D. Higgins orm an mbeadh leagan Gaeilge den Pháipéar Bán le fáil. Ní bheidh an Páipéar <Col N="714" /> Bán le fáil mar is gnáth, ach beidh leagan den Treoirleabhar Gairid le fáil i gceann tamaill.</P>
    <P>In 1972, and again in 1987, the Irish people in voting in favour of the Treaties of the European Community and the Single European Act accepted the objective of closer European Union. Furthermore, we accepted that the Community was a dynamic and evolving instrument for economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>Since we joined there has been a series of major steps into new areas. The social policy has been considerably expanded. In 1973 the Community did not have a regional policy. It now has a wide range of regional development instruments and these are further improved in the new Treaty. When we joined, the Community did not have an environment policy. Such a policy is now in place and playing a major part in raising awareness of the environment, especially here in Ireland. I could give many other examples, such as the evolution of the Community's development aid policy and its activities in the area of research.</P>
    <P>The development of the Community's Treaties and policies has not been a mere academic exercise. It has not been the plaything of idealistic politicians or lawyers. Ideas and imagination have been central to the process but that process is a response to the needs and requirements of Europe in the 41 year period since the Coal and Steel Community was established. It is a credit to the vision and foresight of the founding fathers that the Community has evolved so successfully on the bedrock of their work.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond to a number of serious allegations which have been made as regards my party's attitude to women's rights. Fianna Fáil are and have always been committed to full equality of women in Irish society. The record shows that over the last 30 years Fianna Fáil can point to a solid record of achievement. In 1965 the Succession Act rectified discrimination against women in respect of succession rights. In 1970, Fianna Fáil appointed the first Commission on the <Col N="715" /> Status of Women whose work was seminal in the advancement of reforms in the following decade. In 1979, the introduction of free legal aid gave support to battered wives in seeking protection from the courts. The 1980 budget gave full equality to women in taxation matters. Virtually every Fianna Fáil Government since 1979 have included a woman Cabinet Minister. Since 1987 Fianna Fáil have appointed women in increased numbers to State boards, extended treatment benefits to the spouses of insured persons, enacted comprehensive legislation on rape and will introduce excellent legislation in that regard in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Let me touch now on the issue of non-ratification. Ireland can vote against ratification and the Union Treaty will not come into force. However the other member states are most unlikely to put aside more than a year of hard negotiation so easily. For all of the signatories the Treaty represents a hard-won compromise. It does not entirely satisfy everyone's ambitions but it is the best that can be attained at this stage and is an important step forward on the road to closer European union.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in our absence the Eleven will find a way to proceed with the Treaty. The agreement between the Eleven on social policy provides a very clear precedent. The Protocol on Social Policy which is an integral part of the Treaty authorises the Eleven member states, apart from the UK, and I quote:</P>
    <P>to have recourse to the initiatives, procedures and mechanisms of the Treaty for the purpose of taking among themselves and applying as far as they are concerned the acts and decisions required to give effect to the . . . Agreement.</P>
    <P>In other words, it creates a social Community going further than the basic Treaty but using all of the Treaty's facilities. Here is a precedent for a union of the Eleven to implement the new Treaty. This is a union likely to be joined in the <Col N="716" /> fairly near future by other countries such as Sweden, Austria and Finland.</P>
    <P>Ireland has made an important contribution to the development of the Community. We should not sacrifice that contribution. We have been able to contribute to the development of an agriculture policy which takes account of the interests of procedures on the Community's periphery. We have been able to ensure the evolution of a cohesion policy which takes account of the interests of the peripheral regions. We have contributed significantly to the evolution of the position of the Twelve on issues such as South Africa and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Non-ratification would sacrifice Ireland's contribution. It would throw away twenty years of effort by successive Irish Governments and the commitment of the Irish people over that period. Without even considering what we would lose by not having access to the benefits of the new Treaty, it is clear that we would put at serious risk the achievement of two decades.</P>
    <P>I would offer one final comment on the issue of non-ratification. What if Britain ratifies and we do not? What will be the impact on our links with the North which have grown closer since we joined the Community? Do we really want to create a situation which will deepen the divisions between the two parts of the island?</P>
    <P>Amendments to the motion for the Second Reading have been tabled by the Deputies of the Democratic Left and by Deputies O'Keeffe and Mitchell. Some of the points raised in the amendments have been answered in the course of contributions from the Government side.</P>
    <P>I am unable to accept Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment which would in effect suspend progress on ratification pending publication of proposals to deal with travel and information rights. The Government wish to proceed with the European Union Treaty.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would refer to Deputy Howlin's Private Members' Bill on the subject. We have no great difficulty with the general thrust of what Deputy Howlin <Col N="717" /> suggests. However, as the Taoiseach has indicated, this should not be taken to indicate agreement with the specifics of the wording Deputy Howlin proposes.</P>
    <P>The issues involved in the Supreme Court's judgment are complex. The Government have decided to await the outcome of the deliberations of the Cabinet Committee examining the issues involved. I appreciate the time and effort that Deputy Howlin has devoted to the issue. However, I would urge him to hold back from proceeding further at this time.</P>
    <P>The question of the deletion of Protocol 17 has arisen. The Democratic Left motion is wide-ranging in that regard. Deputy De Rossa argued that Protocol 17 should be deleted. I should like to avail of this opportunity to deal with this issue &mdash; I hope, once and for all. I am sure that is a pious hope but nevertheless it constitutes an effort on my part to deal with this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, hope springs eternal. I will endeavour to deal with the issue once and for all, if I can. Our advice from the legal service of the Council of Ministers, obtained shortly after the judgments in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case were delivered, was that deletion of the Protocol would involve convening of an Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>When I asked our partners to consider an amendment to the Protocol at the Council on 6 April I found that, while all accepted the substance of our case, the majority would not agree to convene a new conference. They feared that a new conference would put them under pressure to reopen other aspects of the new Treaty. Thus the objection of partners was not to the substance of our request but to the dangers which a new intergovernmental conference would present to the Maastricht package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We put forward one method of solving <Col N="718" /> the dilemma; they suggested another. I regret that Deputy De Rossa and others appear to attach no value to the Solemn Declaration. I do not know how he can reject a document which has been accepted by all of the signatories to the Treaty. It seems to me that many commentators in Ireland have dismissed the Declaration without giving its value any serious consideration. I think that they are wrong in taking this view.</P>
    <P>The Solemn Declaration has been accepted by all of our partners and was agreed by the Foreign Ministers last week. It has a legal and political value and has passed the scrutiny of the legal departments of all of the member states and of the institutions involved. I understand that the second edition of the new Treaty which will be published shortly by the Council and the Commission will contain the text of the Declaration &mdash; a clear recognition of its importance.</P>
    <P>Moving to other points I am confident that we will be able to negotiate substantial funding in the context of the current Delors package. I note that on this and other issues Deputy De Rossa quotes spokesmen for other member states. I regret that he finds their views so convincing. We are engaged in a negotiation &mdash; member states are setting out their opening positions. A hard negotiation lies ahead on the Delors Plan, as there was on its predecessor. However, I am confident that in the end we will get the outcome we want.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has dealt with the issue of budgetary limits and convergence. I do not believe we should derogate from the provisions of European Monetary Union. They are in line with our budgetary policy over the last five years.</P>
    <P>Industrial policy has been raised by a number of Deputies, especially in the context of employment. As regards a common industrial policy, the Industry chapter in the Treaty represents a compromise between those who would wish for very direct intervention in the economy and those who prefer a liberal approach. It is an important chapter. It would be our intention that, in applying <Col N="719" /> industrial policy, full regard would be paid to the provisions of Article 2 of the EC Treaty which sets a &ldquo;high level of employment and of social protection as a task of the Community&rdquo;. This provision and a similar provision in the agreement on Social Policy was inserted at our request.</P>
    <P>The Democratic Left motion calls for increased democratic accountability. The democratic deficit was a major issue in the negotiations which produced the new Treaty.</P>
    <P>Despite reservations on the Treaty I have no doubt that MEPs will ensure that co-decision makes a real impact. After all, under the existing co-operation procedure, which is considerably weaker, more than half of Parliament's amendments to commission proposals were accepted by the Council.</P>
    <P>The Democratic Left mentioned specifically the need for democratic accountability in areas such as foreign and security policy, justice issues and central banking. I would make two points on this: first, the democratically elected and accountable members of the Council of Ministers play a major role in decisions in these areas. Ministers are accountable to their Parliaments for their actions at community level. We should not forget that democratic accountability applies at national level. This is recognised in two declarations on the role of the National Parliaments attached to the Treaties; second, the Treaty breaks new ground in enabling the European Parliament to monitor developments in these areas to a far greater extent than at present. The power of the European Parliament has increased in stages. Ten years ago, before the Single Act and the new Treaty, it was hard to envisage a European Parliament with real powers to influence legislation in a substantial way. Now it not only influences legislation; it can block it. Further steps to increase democratic accountability are likely in 1996 when the scope of the co-decision procedure is reviewed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins and others raised the question of the &ldquo;competent <Col N="720" /> bodies under the Treaties establishing the Communities&rdquo; in subsection 5 of the draft amendment. The competent bodies are the European Central Bank and the European Monetary Institute which is to be established at the beginning of the second stage of European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>As is made clear in the explanatory memorandum, the words of the amendment do not relate to the provisions dealing with common foreign and security policy. They do not apply to the Western European Union, as some Deputies have suggested.</P>
    <P>The Democratic Left wants the provisions on common foreign and security policy amended in order to abandon what they call &ldquo;superpower aspirations&rdquo;. Frankly I believe this represents a misreading of the Treaty. The Community and the European Union have their roots in the search for peace after two dreadful wars which devastated Europe. We sometimes forget that the movement towards European integration has a broad political aim &mdash; to prevent war in Europe by bringing former enemies together and joining their political and economic interests. If history has taught us anything it has taught us that we cannot take a peaceful Europe for granted. It must be worked for. This is the essential aim of the common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>The objectives outlined in the Treaty reflect this: to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests and independence of the Union; to strengthen the security of the Union and its member states; to preserve peace and strengthen international security in accordance with the UN Charter and the CSCE; to promote international co-operation and to develop and consolidate democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</P>
    <P>These objectives are worth working for. A peaceful and stable Europe is essential to underpin the economic and social aims of the Treaty. A moment's reflection on the likely impact on Ireland's welfare and prosperity of another major European conflict will show what I mean. The means to achieve the <Col N="721" /> Treaty's objectives are peaceful means &mdash; strengthened co-operation between the member states and joint political, diplomatic and economic action on international issues.</P>
    <P>Europe has an unprecedented opportunity to build new structures based on the instruments of co-operation instead of the instruments of war. The barriers which have divided our continent for almost 50 years have come down. New forms of dialogue and co-operation are being developed between countries which a few years ago faced each other in two hostile and deadly alliances. I believe that Ireland has a duty to itself and to Europe to engage fully in building the structures for European peace. We cannot stand aside or opt out of the most important challenge facing our generation. Other European countries which have applied for membership, such as Austria, Sweden and Finland, see the common foreign and security policy in this way and are prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>Up to now Ireland has played a full part in the development of the Community's foreign policy. By working with our European partners we have been able to further our policies on such issues as disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, human rights and development. Acting together the Twelve have had a greater impact on world affairs than any state acting alone. From Yugoslavia to the Middle East, to South Africa, to Central America the Community has been a force for good and it is seen as such by the peoples in these areas. Because co-operation takes place within a framework of agreed rules and by unanimity, we do not compromise our basic principles or approaches. Deputy Spring in his comprehensive and thoughtful analysis on Wednesday brought out a number of <Col N="722" /> these points. This statement in this regard is worth studying.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by opponents of European Union that the Maastricht Treaty establishes a common defence policy and a European army, obliges us to join a military alliance, will result in conscription, does away with the veto on foreign and security policy and provides for joint action on military matters. None of this is true. A reading of the Treaty and the Government's White Paper will show how misleading these allegations are.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies asked about the future framing of a common defence policy. I wish to make it clear that a common defence policy would require another negotiation; and there is provision in the Treaty for another intergovernmental conference in 1996 to negotiate any amendments to the Treaties that might be necessary. Any such amendments would, as the Taoiseach pointed out on Wednesday, require to be ratified here by referendum of the Irish people. This will remain the situation after ratification of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>In voting for the Treaty on European Union I want the Irish people to vote for what is in the Treaty, for a vision of Europe that is at peace, that works for peace and that operates through discussion and agreement. As a small country Ireland has a fundamental interest in international co-operation based on the rule of law. We promote this through the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and other international organisations, and we can do so through the Treaty on European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already taken the opportunity this week at the conference of the Garda Representative Association to publicly congratulate the Garda Síochána on the recent very significant finds of arms and ammunition in Counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick. I am sure that all Members of this House will be glad to join with me in extending our collective congratulations <Col N="729" /> to the Garda Commissioner and the Force on their success to date and wish them well in their continuing search operations.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House I want to say that in the course of &ldquo;Operation Silo&rdquo; the Garda Síochána have so far unearthed arms, ammunitions and arms bunkers on a total of 14 dates since mid-February 1992. The largest and most significant find was made on Saturday last, 2 May 1992 at a farm at New-market, County Cork. On that occasion 51 rifles, two machine guns and roughly 20,000 rounds of ammunition were recovered from an underground bunker. Charges are currently pending against four persons &mdash; three from Limerick and one from Cork &mdash; in connection with the various finds.</P>
      <P>The finding of such volumes of weapons and munitions is a reminder once again &mdash; not that we need reminding &mdash; of the extent of the threat posed to our communities by the men of violence. &ldquo;Operation Silo&rdquo; has taken very substantial quantities of arms and ammunition out of the hands of subversives &mdash; arms which could and would have been used to take the lives of people on this island. The searches for arms hidden in our countryside must be relentlessly pursued and I can assure this House that the Garda Síochána are being provided with all the necessary resources they require to carry out searches, undertake surveillance and implement any further measures as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The recent significant finds of arms are testimony to the ability and competence of the Garda Síochána in recovering these hidden arms dumps. Searches for arms will continue with determination and vigour until whatever further arms there may be are located and taken into safe custody. The general public can play a most important part in helping the Garda effort by passing on any information or suspicions they may have on these arms dumps. I would appeal to anyone who can help in this way not to hesitate in doing so.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for <Col N="730" /> his reply. The reason for phrasing the question in this way was that it was the only way we could have the question promptly on the Order Paper. Let me ask the Minister to express to the Garda and Garda Commissioner the congratulations of Fine Gael and of all Members of this House on the extraordinary work they have done in recent weeks in the very substantial arms finds that have taken place. Will the Minister express to them our full support in the continuation of that work? Will the Minister agree that it is regrettable that the good words the Minister spoke on this issue at the Garda Representative Association Conference were lost among the furore that he created by other rather foolish comments that antagonised the Garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the nature of our involvement in Europol and the new measures being put in force to ensure full security is maintained in relation to subversive activities following the ending of border frontiers at the end of 1992.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to establish a European Police Office (Europol) was taken by the European Council at its <Col N="731" /> meeting in Maastricht on 9 and 10 December 1991 on the basis of a report submitted to the Council by TREVI Ministers. The European Council also decided that Europol's initial function will be to organise the exchange of information on drugs among the Community's 12 member states. The establishment of Europol is, of course, also envisaged by the Treaty on European Union. The Treaty and the Declaration on Police Co-operation it contains will provide the framework for the development on Europol in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>At their Maastricht meeting the European Council instructed TREVI Ministers, in collaboration with the European Commission, to take the necessary steps to allow Europol to be set up at an early date. The detailed work necessary to achieve that objective is now proceeding within the TREVI framework. Both my Department and the Garda Síochána are participating fully in that work, as they did in the preparation of the report on which the decision to establish Europol was based. It is also my intention that Ireland will participate fully in Europol once it has been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Europol represent only one of a number of compensatory measures which are being considered at the level of the Twelve in the context of the creation of a Europe without internal frontiers. It has been recognised for some time now that international terrorism and organised crime will seek to exploit the opportunities offered by greater freedom of movement for ends inimical to the rights and freedoms of citizens of the Community at large. The Twelve have responded to that challenge by seeking to promote closer co-operation among their police forces within the TREVI framework. The programme of action on the re-inforcement of police co-operation to combat terrorism and other forms of organised crime, adopted by TREVI Ministers in Dublin in June 1990 during the Irish Presidency, has provided the framework in which a number of practical measures designed to reinforce and build on existing co-operation among the <Col N="732" /> police forces of the Twelve have been agreed in the run up to the creation of the Single Market. Those measures include a number specifically directed at combatting terrorism. Compensatory measures of this kind are, of course, an integral part of the free movement issue.</P>
    <P>The co-operation that is already taking place within the TREVI frame work will now be largely superseded by the new arrangements for co-operation in the field of justice and home affairs provided for in the Treaty on European Union. I am confident that, when adopted, the new framework for such co-operation which the Treaty provides will allow the development of even closer co-operation among the police forces of the Twelve in meeting the challenges which terrorism and organised crime pose for the Community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister envisage that Europol will actually be established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that the first phase of it will be up and running before the end of this year. At that stage we will build on the work that has already been undertaken by TREVI &mdash; that is the framework in connection with the establishment of the European drugs intelligence unit, for instance &mdash; and that will lead to the European drugs unit by the end of 1992. Its function will be the exchange and development of information and intelligence and there will also be considerable co-operation in the fight against drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>The second phase will deal with money laundering and organised crime leading to drug trafficking. That will be a little later down the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is of vital interest to this State to ensure that Europol is functioning in the information area at the earliest available opportunity so as to ensure that the good work and the results that have been achieved in the arms finds in recent weeks is not set aside by the opening of borders resulting in further arms coming into this <Col N="733" /> country at the hands of subversive organisations and will the Minister indicate if it is envisaged that Europol will go beyond simply information gathering and information sharing but will ultimately involve joint police action in the fight against subversion and terrorism and in tackling the drugs problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is intended. There has been a declaration on police co-operation in this matter and this was much enhanced by the decisions taken in June 1990 here in Dublin. It is all about dealing with transnational crime, particularly drug trafficking. The declaration on that police co-operation is attached to the Treaty on Political Union and it is interesting to put on the record the type of functions that will be considered by Europol as it gets underway. Phase one will be up and running by the end of this year and later the other phases. It will be involved in support for national criminal investigations and security authorities, particularly in the co-ordination of investigation and search operations and the creation of data bases. There will be some interfacing between the information that will be available in the 12 members states, central analysis and assessment of information in order to take stock of the situation and identify investigative approaches and the collection and analysis of national prevention programmes for forwarding to member states and the drawing up of Europewide prevention stragegies. I think that particularly is what the Deputy would wish to see, that there would be cross-frontier strategies and measures relating to training, research, forensic matters and criminal records departments in all of the 12 countries. All of that would be on a shared basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate whether the location of the Europol office itself has yet been decided? In which of the European countries or capitals will it be established? Could the Minister indicate if it is intended that each of the police forces of the member states will second people to Europol itself and <Col N="734" /> what direct involvement would the Garda have in that? Finally, the Minister should be aware that there is substantial and growing concern about Ireland being used as an open door to Europe in the context of drug importation by sea through the southern part of this country, resulting in drugs going into the United Kingdom and then into the European mainland. Does the Minister envisage Europol being involved in attacking that problem? Will he agree that it is matter of urgency to deal with this problem and the growing worries in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any information concerning the possible location of Europol but, as I said, Ireland will be involved in all aspects of setting up this body. We would like to be in at the start for the reasons the Deputy mentioned. Obviously, the movement of drugs and drug trafficking will be at the top of the agenda in so far as the initial stage in phase I of Europol is concerned. They are being set up to allow co-operation and exchange of information which will enable us to tackle the problem more effectively, particularly drug trafficking by sea.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the steps, if any, he intends taking in regard to, (a) the chronic overcrowding in our prisons and (b) the lack of detention centres for juveniles.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at the moment about 2,200 persons in custody in our prisons. Prisoner numbers of this order create ongoing pressure on available custodial accommodation. At present there are about 230 cells originally designed for single occupancy which are being used to accommodate two prisoners and 20 cells designed to accommodate three prisoners which are being used to house four prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, continuing progress is being made on a programme to provide <Col N="735" /> additional accommodation. In recent years a new institution, which accommodates 320 persons, was provided at Wheatfield and work is currently in progress on the provision of a new health care unit at Mountjoy which will provide accommodation for 57 offenders. The Government also recently approved the take-over of the military detention barracks in the Curragh for use as a civilian prison for disruptive prisoners. This new prison will have accommodation for more than 40 prisoners and it is expected that it will be operational later this year. Since 1985 there has been an investment exceeding £85 million on the prison building programme which is a clear indication of continuing commitment to investment in prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>The need for extra prison accommodation is being reviewed at present. Last week, at the annual conference of the Prison Officers' Association, I announced my intention to draw up a comprehensive document that will update the overall aims and objectives for the prison system and set out a strategy to meet them. The document will take account of recent developments and current thinking in relation to both custodial and non-custodial sanctions and will, of course, take account of accommodation difficulties. I will be consulting all interested parties in due course. Even at this stage, however, I have no doubt but that the public interest is best served when a range of effective alternatives to custody are employed to the full, and prisons are used only as a last resort. At any one time there are 3,200 offenders on supervision of one sort or another as an alternative to custody, including 750 on community service orders. The search for even more alternatives will continue without let-up.</P>
    <P>My Department cater for the detention of male offenders aged 16 years and over and female offenders aged 17 years and over. Offenders under that age cannot be sent to the prisons or places of detention operated by my Department except in the very special circumstances specified in sections 97 and 102 of the Children <Col N="736" /> Act, 1908, where the court certifies that the young person is of so unruly or depraved a character that he or she cannot be detained in a special school.</P>
    <P>Young offenders between the ages of 12 and 17 may be committed to special schools which are the responsibility of the Minister for Education. I understand that the former Scoil Árd Mhuire premises in Lusk have been refurbished to provide an additional 36 places for boys and eight places for girls, of these 14 additional places for boys and four additional places for girls were brought into operation in September 1991. A further eight places for boys and a further four places for girls were brought on stream in recent weeks. I understand that the remaining places will be operational in the next two months or so. In addition, plans are advanced for the construction of a new centre to hold up to 20 young female offenders at Finglas. This facility is scheduled for completion in the latter half of 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is widespread concern in the general public and the Garda Síochána at the substantial increase in crime, which was in the region of 8 per cent last year and which stands at 8 per cent so far this year? There is a belief that the increase is being fuelled by the failure of the Government to provide the necessary prison and detention centre places for those convicted of crime. Is the Minister aware that the revolving door syndrome, resulting in the Garda arresting people, bring them before the courts who have nowhere to send them and releasing them back to the community, is fuelling the rise in crime? What assurance can the Minister give the public that the problem will be resolved this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that the problem of crime will ever be resolved in any particular year. However, we are making every effort to reduce the level of crime and there have been significant successes over the years in relation to drugs, crimes in regard to elderly people, joy-riding &mdash; which is a misnomer &mdash;<Col N="737" /> which should not be forgotten. Of course, the Deputy is right in saying that there was an increase in crime last year. The figures have not yet been finalised. Everything possible is being done by the Garda to address the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the revolving door syndrome, it is our way of temporary release and our answer to the parole system which is a feature of the penal system throughout the world. Indeed, our system is mentioned favourably in other jurisdictions; it is only activated in very strict circumstances. Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, the Minister may authorise the release of offenders in particular circumstances. All temporary releases are on the condition that the offender will keep the peace, be of good behaviour and sober habits. In certain circumstances people on temporary release must report to the Garda daily. Sometimes they are supervised by the probation or welfare officer and it can be indicated that they must reside at a named hostel. Before a release is considered, the nature of the offence and the offender's previous criminal history are taken into consideration. More particularly, the attitude of the offender while he or she has been in custody &mdash; and the length of the sentence &mdash; is taken into consideration. There is always an assessment of the risk of allowing somebody out on temporary release to the community. The overriding concern in assessing these cases is the protection of the public. It must always be borne in mind that very serious offenders do not benefit from this temporary release arrangement.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the problems in relation to the juvenile justice area are seen as very great by many people? The Garda have expressed the view that many juveniles are constantly involved in crime and feel immune from punishment due to the inability of <Col N="738" /> the courts to send them to a place of detention if they are convicted. Will the Minister agree that the absence of places of detention for juvenile offenders is exacerbating the crime problem and that it is contributed to by the fragmentation of ministerial responsibility in this area? Will the Minister also agree that the responsibility for providing detention centres for juveniles sentenced by the courts should rest with the Department of Justice and not be dispersed throughout the Departments of Justice, Education and Health?</P>

      <P>It is a separate question but it is related and there is something in what the Deputy says. It is the subject matter of another question to which I have a longer response. On the over view, there always seems to be a pulling between Education and Justice. We try to act in the best interests of the young offender and there has been reasonably good co-operation in that regard. If the Deputy has a point of view to make regarding that area, I will be happy to hear it. The 1908 Act is currently under review and I should like to introduce the necessary Juvenile Bill before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 17, 23, 26, 29, 34, 39, 43, and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area of the law is complex and involves a wide range of interests, some <Col N="743" /> conflicting. The Government are aware of the concerns of the farming community in relation to claims for compensation by persons who are injured while on their property and that the State itself, local authorities and other interests may be vulnerable to similar claims. As I have already indicated in my reply to Question No. 159 of 24 March 1992, the Attorney General has decided to refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission for examination and report. That is a desirable first step towards the formulation of new legislation in this area because of the many interests involved who need to be consulted and have their views taken into account. In accordance with normal practice, no time limit has been set for completion of the commission's work in the matter by the Attorney General, but I would not expect their report to be long delayed.</P>
    <P>The Government made it known last January that they intend to bring forward any legislation that may be required on the subject during the lifetime of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> that is, before the end of 1993. I reiterated that promise at a recent seminar organised by the IFA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the enormous anxiety felt by farmers and landowners concerning their liability in the event of accidents occurring to a vast range of people, gun club and hunt club members and others who pass over their lands and subsequent possible claims arising from such accidents? Will the Minister comment on the widely held perception that, irrespective of whether permission was given by the farmer to such outsiders, liability rests with the landowner? That is most important. I am very disappointed to find there is no deadline for the report of the Law Reform Commission. Obviously, no legislative measures will be introduced until that report has been received. I hope the issue will not drag on for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right that it would not be wise to pursue the matter <Col N="744" /> until the report of the Law Reform Commission has been received. I have asked that the report be treated as a matter of urgency, and I indicated that to the organisation referred to in the reply. I regard this matter as important. There are also many side issues attached to the matter, some of which the Deputy mentioned. I should like the matter to be pursued. The Deputy may rest assured that, as a countryman like Deputy Connaughton, I am anxious to give some assurance to landowners. We depend on them to further the tourist industry and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that the law is concerned with the duty of care which an occupier of property must observe towards entrants on his or her property. Those can range from contractual entrants to the trespasser, who may be a person on the property without permission and without any malicious intent.</P>
      <P>It should not be forgotten that we are talking about an insurable risk. I understand some attention has been given to that aspect by farming organisations and insurance companies. Insurance is not always the answer. As I said at the seminar, no matter what happens, no Government could give the farmers complete immunity from liability. I got the impression from those at the seminar that that was understood.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It means putting on the record the occupier's liability understanding as we now know it. The term refers to the rules of law that govern the imposition of liability for injuries that occur to people when they are on the property of another. Apart from the Hotel Proprietors Act, 1963, and particular provisions in the Civil Liability Act, 1961, those rules are contained in the common law as opposed to statute law and they are judge made originating in the middle of the last century. Since the decision of the Supreme Court in 1974 the law in this regard has been in a state of transition. The case for having the law in the matter accessible and stated in statutory law is now accepted. We are taking the advice of the Law Reform Commission because of that change and the complexities attached to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>We have become so litigation conscious here that it would be wrong to regard this as a rural issue exclusively. I am sure the Minister will agree with me on that. While certainly the issue affects the farming community, it has to be made a national issue that involves urban communities. If one trips on a mat or in the yard of another person's property the same issue is at stake. Would the Minister agree, having regard to the encouragement given to agri-tourism and so on nowadays, that we need a deterrent in relation to this vexatious issue. Would he assure the House he will ask the Law Reform Commission to move with haste to expedite the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy stated the reason for taking the matter to the Law Reform Commission and, as he said, the issue is complex and does not concern only farmers. In fairness to farmers, they are the people who are keeping up the pressure in this regard in that the issue affects their lives. They are concerned that they might find themselves in some way seriously disadvantaged if pursued. Farmers are put in the position of inhibiting <Col N="746" /> access to their lands, when we would like them and the majority of them are willing to do so, to accomodate the new trends in agri-tourism and permit the people pursuing leisure activities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to cross their lands. I have to say, to judge by the reaction at the seminar I attended, that landowners feel somewhat exposed to liability. It is for that reason they want the matter sorted out. They are willing to accept that that should be done statutorily. They are also willing to await the result of the examination by the Law Reform Commission, because that will give them the opportunity to consult the Commission. I invited them to do that and I think they will take up that offer at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not wish to take away from the anxiety of farming interests in relation to this issue, I ask the Minister whether he agrees that the issue should also be looked at from the point of view of the person who has enjoyed the general right of cross over for centuries. That tradition in Ireland is very important and should be protected. Does he agree that whatever scheme is ultimately put in place it should be one that will avoid the construction of fences or obstacles, that it should help to maintain a very laudible tradition that has existed for centuries? By and large, landowners welcome the general public not to abuse but simply to cross through their lands. In that regard, does the Minister consider that the Law Reform Commission might have regard to a proposal contained in the report on the legal profession by the Fair Trade Commission to introduce a no-fault liability national scheme? However the issue is dealt with, insurance will inevitably prove costly. A scheme based on a Government bank, no-fault system, is perhaps the only real way the issue might be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be making the point made by Deputy Connor. The issue is complex. The cross <Col N="747" /> over element arises. In fairness to the farming community represented at the seminar to which I referred &mdash; and many views were expressed there &mdash; I have to say that that was understood. The farmers did not wish traditional understandings to be set aside and were most reluctant to erect fences to keep people out from places they knew full well the public would like to enjoy. Landowners just want some level of statutory protection.</P>
      <P>There is an enormous cost attached to a no-fault liability scheme, as the Deputy knows. However, if the Deputy wishes that matter to be considered by the Law Reform Commission it certainly will.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>At present I am considering the report of the inquiry into the incident in Limerick Prison on 9 April 1992 and I will be making a decision shortly on what further action, if any, should be taken. In addition to this internal inquiry, which I initiated, a Garda investigation is also being conducted into the events in question.</P>
      <P>The new disciplinary code for prison officers, which was agreed with the Prison Officers' Association, will become a statutory instrument within the next few months.</P>

      <P>Who initiated the Garda investigation? Was it at the complaint of one side or were there complaints from both sides? While my Question No. 7 refers to one prisoner, I understand that two prisoners were seriously injured in this incident. Does the investigation relate not only to assaults on prison officers but also to assaults on prisoners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On considering the report from the internal inquiry, if it warrants it would the Minister agree to send his file to the Director of Public Prosecutions? Extraordinary injuries seem to have been suffered by two prisoners and a prison oficer at the hands of prison officers. Would the Minister confirm that the allegations involve injury to a prison officer at the hands of other prison <Col N="749" /> officers? Would the Minister confirm that one of the two prisoners is in a padded cell in Mountjoy Prison, having subsequently attempted suicide, and will the Minister undertake to ensure that that prisoner will not be returned to Limerick because of the clear antagonisms that exist between him and the prison officers?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am restricted in this matter. The inspector has finalised his business and has returned to the Department but the report is not yet ready. It is in its final stages of preparation and I expect to have it tomorrow. When I have the report I will take a decision as to what appropriate action should be taken. The reason I could not answer specifically with regard to the previous question is because the Garda are carrying out an investigation into an allegation of criminal assault on a prisoner. I cannot go beyond this until I see what the report says. Some prisoners have been transferred.</P>

Will the Minister agree that it is in the public interest that the report should be published in the light of the unfortunate events that took place, the publicity those events have received and the injuries that have occurred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not publish the report, but it might be necessary for me to make a statement. The normal procedure in cases such as this is that if the facts are established then the normal disciplinary procedures come into operation. If following those procedures a case warrants dismissal, the matter, as the Deputies know, has to go to Government. There is quite a procedure laid down and it is well understood by all sides in this matter. Until I see the report I <Col N="750" /> cannot do anything.

    <Col N="751" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the first part of the Deputy's question, I have no plans to establish a general commission of inquiry into the criminal justice system. We have had many and varied committees and commissions which have reported in the recent past on or are currently examining individual aspects of the criminal justice system. Included among these are the Whitaker Committee, which examined the prisons system; the Walsh Committee, which looked at Garda training; the Law Reform Commission, which carries out an ongoing review of our laws; the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, the Martin Committee on certain aspects of criminal procedure, the Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control, the interdepartmental group on the administration of justice, the interdepartmental group on urban crime and the Dáil Select Committee on Crime, which has the widest terms of reference of all committees in the justice area and to which the Garda Representative Associations have full access.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply to the speech mentioned in the question, my approach to updating the criminal law is to deal with the matter on a systematic basis, affording priority to these areas most in need of review. In line with this approach, I have announced the setting up of a broadly based advisory group on the investigation and prosecution of serious fraud.</P>
      <P>The very many criminal law measures enacted in recent years and the other proposals announced for implementation in the Programme for Government, together with other initiatives taken, give clear evidence of consistent progress in this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Garda promotions, following extensive negotiations at the Garda Conciliation Council, at which the Garda Representative Bodies were represented, a new set of Garda Síochána (Promotion) Regulations were introduced in 1987. These regulations provide for a Promotion Advisory Council, on which the Garda associations are represented. This council was given the functions of reviewing and advising the <Col N="752" /> Commissioner in relation to promotions, competitions for promotions and the systems and procedures for promotions. I would have thought that these regulations meet the reasonable expectations of the members of the force as regards such systems and procedures. In any event, the provisions of the regulations enable the associations to propose further changes which they consider desirable.</P>
    <P>I reject out of hand any suggestion that personnel are selected for promotion on the basis of political considerations rather than on ability and suitability for the higher post. Promotions to ranks in the force below Assistant Commissioner are based on internal competitions in which neither I nor my Department play any part. These competitions are conducted in accordance with the terms of the 1987 regulations to which I have already referred. In the case of promotion to the Assistance Commissioner rank, the Garda Commissioner, following procedures prescribed in those regulations which involve formal consultations with the Deputy and Assistance Commissioner at a meeting specially convened for the purpose, puts forward a name which is then sent to Government for approval and invariably receives Government approval. Promotions to Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner rank are made by the Government. With the exception of a few instances in the distant past, all promotions to Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner have been made from within the Commissioner ranks and following consultations between the Minister and the current Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of my question, I put it to the Minister that the views of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors echo very much those of the primary State officer dealing with the criminal justice system, namely, the Director of Public Prosecutions, that there is need for a fundamental review of the organisation of our criminal justice system and its <Col N="753" /> operation? Would the Minister agree that it is time we examined the fundamental way in which we order our justice system rather than merely have a point by point reform of certain aspects of the law? Furthermore, would the Minister accept that recent surveys have shown there is widespread public dissatisfaction, if not disquiet, at the way in which our courts systems operate, which is linked directly to the inability of the justice system as at present organised to respond meaningfully to the crimes being perpetrated within the community? Would the Minister agree to reconsider the importance of this idea given the level of support on the part of people with a direct, active involvement in the system, namely senior Garda on the one hand and, on the other, the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose in an ideal world a Minister might like to accommodate that kind of thinking but in the circumstances in which I find myself I want to get on with the business. I am reluctant to tie up enormous numbers of staff in what is really a consolidation process &mdash; which is one element of it &mdash; which would involve an enormous amount of time. Indeed, I asked deliberately about that. I was involved in the passage of a consolidation Bill as Minister for the Environment; it involved a huge effort but it was worth it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be worth it here too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in principle but we have much to do before we become involved in that. In the immediate preceding few years quite a number of Acts have been amended and brought to bear in the criminal law area. For example, the Deputy will remember the legislation on incitement to hatred, receiving of stolen property, firearms, abolition of the death penalty, rape and sexual assault, forensic testing and criminal damage to property. Two other Bills have been published dealing with criminal evidence and telephone tapping, <Col N="754" /> one is before this House and the other before the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I have some proposals I am very anxious to get on with, quite a number of Bills which I am sure the Deputy would welcome also. I am sure the Deputy would agree with me that resources should be fully utilised in the areas where we would achieve the best results. For example, I am giving confiscation of the proceeds of crime high priority on my list, an Extradition Bill, another on juvenile justice &mdash; about which we spoke here and which I am very anxious to get on the Statute Book. In addition, there will be legislation on criminal insanity, suicide and the miscarriage of justice. Therefore, the Deputy will realise there is a great deal of legislation pending. I am endeavouring to manage the resources in the law section as best I can. When much of this work has been completed then the matter about which the Deputy spoke can be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other point of political interference, would the Minister not accept that so long as the appointments of the Commissioner and Assistance Commissioner of the Garda Síochána are made by Government, the Government are leaving themselves open to accusation of political considerations being involved? Would the Minister not accept that the proposals in the earlier part of my question and suggested at the recent conference, that the establishment of a policy authority independent of the Department, with its own budget, with the Commissioner and Assistance Commissioner &mdash; as is the case with other public servants &mdash; being appointed by an independent commission of appointment should be considered? Would he agree that until such time as they are in place it will be all too easy for people to make the accusation that there are overriding political considerations in the appointments to these very important offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>One sometimes hears such comments. I should like to put it on the record &mdash; I think it is accepted by everybody both inside and outside this House <Col N="755" />&mdash; that there is no political interference in the promotion regime as far as the Garda Síochána are concerned. For example, the Commissioner sets up the interview boards for all ranks up to superintendent and chief superintendent. There is no nominee of the Minister or of the Department of Justice on those interview boards. In fact sometimes we do not even know when these things take place. The Commissioner conducts his business; the names of candidates for promotion are accepted up to a certain level in the ranks and so far as superintendents and chief superintendents are concerned their names come to me by way of recommendation from the Commissioner. I, or the Minister concerned, go to Government to have them ratified. For example, if a candidate's name appears fourteenth on the list, the Deputy can bet the preceding 13 have already been appointed. That is the way it is and I am stating it here publicly. Therefore, I promise the Deputy that there is no political interference. As far as the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is concerned, yes, the Government appoint him and the Deputy Commissioner but, over the years that I have been associated with business here, those candidates have come from the ranks of Assistant Commissioner. It is very important that the State should be in a position to nominate the Commissioner of the Garda Siochána, thereby providing that very important link between the security of the State and the Executive.</P>

      <Col N="792" /> Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 basically propose that the electorate should address the question of the Maastricht Treaty by way of three questions. Amendment No. 3 proposes that the Bill before us should be amended to read the Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. The idea behind the amendments is to separate the issues involved in the referendum. First, they seek to separate the question of ratifying the Treaty and endeavour to ensure that a clear decision is made by the people about whether they want to be part of the new European Union. Second, it seeks to separate the effect this might have on the Constitution and the way in which the laws, actions and acts taken by the Community would be interpreted by the Constitution. If the people were agreeable to those steps being taken then obviously that question would be carried. Third, they seek to separate the provision for the Patent Convention, which is also attached to the Maastricht Treaty, for the purpose of amending our Constitution. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to these amendments.</P>

      <P>While I understand and appreciate what the proposer of the amendments is seeking to do, I should say, with the greatest respect, that they will make for considerable confusion. The Government could not agree to separate subsections 4º and 5º as both are necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the Treaty and take on the obligations of membership. The fundamental point here is that they are inextricably interlinked and we cannot pass one subsection without the other. For example, what would happen if people said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the ratification of the Treaty and &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the way in which it is implemented to take on the obligations of membership? This does not bear close scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government see no need to separate the questions relating to the European Union Treaty from the Patents Convention. Although the agreement is an intergovernmental one, it involves Community issues and is part of the Internal Market programme. Given its relevance to the completion of the Internal Market under the EC Treaty, it is appropriate in a referendum in which the people are asked to confirm their commitment to the European Union that this matter should also be addressed. The proposals in the amendments are confusing. It is not my intention to diminish in any way the intention behind the amendments, but if we ratified the Treaty only we would not be in a position to take on the obligations of membership; or, conversely, we would be taking on our obligations of membership without ratifying the Treaty. While I accept the Deputy's genuine intentions, if the amendments are examined <i>inter alia</i> instead of <i>seriatim</i> one would find that the <Col N="794" /> whole operation would lead to a certain confusion, if not complete confusion.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the points made by Deputy Garland on the Patents Convention during the course of his Second Stage speech. The agreement relating to Community Patents will create a centralised litigation procedure for Community Patents. The common Patents Appeal Court to be set up under the agreement will have jurisdiction to determine certain matters concerning Community patents raised on appeal from decisions of national courts in domestic litigation concerning such patents.</P>
    <P>Without the agreement relating to Community patents, patents would be subject to different legal regimes in the member states. That is fundamentally the reason for that. It is to bring a clarity and a cohesiveness into the whole question of patents, patent agreements and their operability as between one member state and another. I am not certain that that is helpful to the Deputy but if he has any other questions in this regard I would be glad to assist in so far as I practically can.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the views expressed by Deputy De Rossa and the response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to see exactly where we stand on the issues. I am trying to consider dispassionately and objectively the points raised. It seems that there might conceivably be an arguable case for having the patents agreement as a separate article. I notice from the explanatory memorandum that even though this matter was negotiated outside the legal framework of the Community it is closely related to the achievement of the Single European Market.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that ratification of the Treaty and its implementation can be separated. I do not see how one could provide for ratification while separately providing for implementation, which might not go through, thereby leaving us in a totally anomalous position. I am trying to consider the matter objectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> I see no case for the separation of those two provisions. On balance it is probably as well, to avoid confusion, that the patents agreement be part of the same article because of its relationship to the achievement of the Single European Market. On that basis I support the Government position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the Minister's position on this proposal. Clearly, it is much easier for the Government to argue the position that if we do not adopt everything in total we will be in dire circumstances, whereas if we offer separate questions to the people to decide, they can make a distinction between what they want and what they do not want to accept &mdash; obviously, I am not talking about the detail of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the patent issue &mdash; of which I must quite honestly tell the Minister I have very little knowledge but which should have been brought forward much earlier for debate on the issues involved &mdash; if the people were offered a choice of question as between ratifying the Treaty &mdash; being the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution &mdash; and implementing it &mdash; being the Twelfth Amendment &mdash; those like myself who are very much in favour of a political union of the European Community could very easily and quite logically vote for the Eleventh Amendment while registering our protest with regard to specific aspects of the Treaty by voting against the Twelfth Amendment. If the latter amendment was then defeated it would be a clear signal to our partners in the European Community that we are very much in favour of the development but that we have concerns about particular aspects of it. It would strengthen the hand of the Government in negotiating whatever aspects need to be negotiated arising from the debate over the next four to five weeks. It is in a sense an attempt to reduce the heat in relation to this debate by various people on one side or the other screaming that if we reject Maastricht we will be frozen out of the Community, while if we accept Maastricht we will all be conscripted into a <Col N="796" /> European army. Both positions are extreme and do not enhance the capacity of the people to make a rational decision about the issues that are being placed before them.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister, in his closing speech earlier today, re-echoed this doomsday approach to the debate, acknowledging as he did again on this amendment, the bone fides of those of us who have reservations about Maastricht. It is in that spirit that the separation of the issues is being offered. It is not in any way to create an anomalous position but simply to give a choice to people which does not leave them choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea. They should have a real choice to make and could deliver a message to the Government and to our partners in the European Community which does not indicate that we are in any way being bloody-minded, that we want to be out of the European Community or that we do not want to make our contribution to its development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's view on this issue. I am very pleased that our spokesperson has taken a similar line to that taken by the Minister. What is happening here could be damaging to what is probably the most important decision that will be taken in this country for many years to come, affecting the lives and the future of our young people. We should in no way confuse what is involved here. What concerns me is that the public will not be adequately informed of this matter. It is most important that the public be adequately informed of what is in this Treaty and what it means and that they have a total and utter commitment to Europe at the end of the debate and not be confused when they go into the polling booth on polling day. I respect people's views which are opposite to mine in relation to the whole European question. I believe that the future of this country lies in a united Europe and the sooner we bring about monetary, political and economic union the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only when you attend meetings in <Col N="797" /> Europe that you relaise how important is our membership of the European Community. We should not make commitments to the public and tell them that the reason they should vote for Maastricht is that we will get an extra £6 billion. That is a terrible attitude to adopt in relation to the whole question of European Union and being committed to a united Europe. It is misleading to tell people that it is a simple question of throwing £6 billion away. There is more to this Treaty than £6 billion.</P>
    <P>Having attended a meeting in Lisbon in the last couple of days with the EC Committee and having listened to the German representatives of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, I very much question whether the Germans are committed to raising the funds to provide the £6 billion for the Delors II package. We have a duty to inform the public of the full facts and to tell them that the future of this country and of its people is in a united Europe.</P>
    <P>We should not adopt a begging bowl mentality and be seen only to be taking from Europe. I am delighted that the Minister is being very direct. If after a proper and informed debate people do not want to support the Maastricht Treaty, they would state so in the polling booth. When they go to the polling booth they should not be confronted with a list of questions to which they answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but the simple question of whether they are for or against the Maastricht Treaty. What is most important is the debate leading up to polling day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are prepared to lead opinion on being Europeans. We want to ensure that people know what they are voting for because at the end of the day we do not want to hear people say &ldquo;I did not realise this is what it was all about&rdquo;. When the people have been fully informed they should make up their minds and vote. I sincerely hope they will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; indeed I will be encouraging everyone to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. We are in a position of genuine difficulty. I do not think there is any point in imagining that there are not difficulties at this stage of the Bill or with the use of the mechanism of the Bill as an instrument to facilitate a referendum. Let us contrast the procedure adopted in the Belgian Parliament with the procedure taken in the Irish Parliament. In the case of the Belgian Parliament's discussion of the main component of the Treaty on European Union the matter was broken down into five separate position papers, each of which was noted after discussion in the Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great respect for the people who put down these amendments because they are addressing a situation which is genuinely complex. What has happened in Ireland is that the process of negotiation was not open to public scrutiny in this House. Indeed, within that process &mdash; and the Second Stage debate has not given us satisfactory answers &mdash; there is the question which will arise on amendment <Col N="799" /> No. 4 as to how Protocol 17 was initiated, where it came from and how it became attached to the Treaty and for what purpose. It is not simply a case that we can sit back and say that the entire complex Treaty can be voted on with a simple question of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. You might argue from that position if the Protocol referred to in amendment No. 4 had been debated in advance, or if we had had a debate on the separate components of economic union, monetary union and political union. What is being pushed now is the text as it stands without elaboration, because, while we had some valuable points raised, we did not get answers to some very fundamental questions on Second Stage. This is an issue for the citizens who will vote on the Treaty.</P>
    <P>As a democrat I am not interested in putting any obstacles, real or by way of confusion, before the electorate in deciding on any matter that amends our Constitution. However, we cannot reduce the question and simply say &ldquo;Do not confuse the people; just ask a question with a simple `yes' or `no' answer&rdquo;. The fact is that if Protocol 17 were removed, a great many people would find it easier to make up their minds. We propose to tell the public that the Protocol, which refers to Article 40.3.3. of the Constitution, will be given content later in the year and our partners in Europe have given us a solemn declaration that they will take seriously any proposals we have to give Article 40.3.3. content later in the year. As a parliamentarian I find it hard to justify this procedure to the public.</P>
    <P>The preparations in the run up to this referendum have created all the difficulties. There is a difficulty as to what is the right of Parliament to subject a Bill to scrutiny in preparation for a referendum where there has been an appalling sleight of hand in relation to the Protocol. We will discuss this in more substance when we come to deal with amendment No. 4.</P>

      <P>We are democrats on this side of the House. We actually listen to people and we allow people freedom of speech, which is something which the Deputy has not always done.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the proposition put forward by Deputy De Rossa, which strikes me as totally illogical and unworkable. If anything could heap more confusion &mdash; and I take the point that there is a degree of confusion among the public &mdash; it would be this type of bifurcated approach to a referendum. The reality is that people will be asked to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a package of elements on the particular day. Good, bad or indifferent, that unfortunately is the way in which referenda work. Where you seek to consult the public on a variety of options all you can do is get something akin to an opinion poll. Deputy S. Barrett make some very sensible points. Our responsibility is to try as far as possible &mdash; I take Deputy Higgins' point on the Second Stage debate &mdash; to put across to the people as far as possible in a value free way, the details of this extraordinarly complex document called the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> I do not think that the proposition put forward by Deputy De Rossa would assist that process. The reality is that the Irish people will have to vote on a matter that is far greater, as Deputy Barrett quite rightly said, than the right to go with a begging bowl to Europe. It is part of a process that started in the immediate aftermath of a horrific war which destroyed Europe.</P>
    <P>This process is a natural progression and it would be very unwise for us to adopt the approach suggested by Deputy De Rossa to introduce additional and extraneous confusion. It would be far better for us to allow the Irish people in as free and uncluttered a way as possible &mdash; it is important, as Deputy Mac Giolla said, that the people get as much information as possible &mdash; to go to the polls and vote yea or nay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a final comment on this matter. Unfortunately, we will not be able to reach the Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1992, which would give rise to the debate about whether the Government are presenting the information in a value free way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guide which has been produced is not value free, apart from the cost; I am referring to the manner in which the issues are presented. Offering a choice to people in relation to what is an extremely complex document, a document impossible to understand, is pointless unless you read other Treaties. For most people, and even for most politicians, that is not a job we relish. It would be interesting to know how many Deputies in this House have actually read the Treaty of Rome, the Single European Act or the Maastricht Treaty. I am sure the Deputies before me have read it assiduously, but for most people it is a document which would be incomprehensible. I believe we need a means which offers the public a choice &mdash; to declare, yes, we are in favour of the European Treaty, in favour of its expansion, in favour of its democratisation; but no, we are not happy with all aspects of the Treaty. They could therefore vote as they chose against the <Col N="802" /> second amendment which I proposed concerning its implementation.</P>
    <P>The development of the European Community is seen as a response to the Second World War. That is fine, no one will argue with that approach as to how the Community developed. However, it is not the only thing that gave rise to the development of the European Community, but we do not have the time to dwell on the detail of it.</P>

      <P>I would point out that there is a whole range of ways in which the European Community could develop. A particular compromise thrashed out in a fairly rushed way at inter-governmental conferences in relation to European Monetary Union, political union and security and foreign affairs is not essentially the best way forward. The Dutch Presidency produced a draft treaty which offered a more federal approach to the development of the community and which brought all of the competencies being offered in the current Treaty under the control of the institutions. The Treaty before us does not have them all under the control of the institutions of the European Community. There are choices as to how the European Community could develop. It is too simplistic to say the Irish people must choose in a black and white, yes or no way to what is being offered at this time.</P>

      <P>The Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill seeks clarity. To those who suggest that the amendment proposed by Deputy De Rossa would in some way improve the public perception of what they are being asked to vote on, I would say, with the greatest of respect, that it would lead to great confusion. I take the points made by Deputies Barrett, De Rossa and M. Higgins that what we seek in this debate from now on is to bring an understanding, as clear as possible, to the attention and knowledge of the people. I also accept the point made by Deputy Barrett that <Col N="803" /> we should not highlight the £6 billion element &mdash; very important in itself &mdash; because it has the character of the begging bowl syndrome.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the amendment before the House the truth of the matter is that it would be pointless to ratify a Treaty which could not be implemented. What standing would we have in international affairs in those circumstances? I see no point to it. It would lead to unnecessary confusion; and as the Government have presented their proposal there is an interlinkage which is so necessary for clarity and understanding. I think our proposal would be understood more clearly by those who intend to vote on the proposal rather than the proposal produced by Deputy De Rossa.</P>

I would be glad if those proposals had come through rather than those which finally emerged. It is altogether confusing at this stage to suggest that we have the option of writing or rewriting the Treaty, because it was the result of negotiation and the final negotiation ended in Maastricht. In that context it is confusing to talk about the further things we would wish to have in the Treaty. What we have to talk about is the future evolution of the Community. Certainly, the views contained in the Dutch Presidency document are those which I will be talking about again, but in the context of 18 June they are not and cannot be before the people.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to preclude other people from speaking to their amendments because of the time within which we are obliged to operate. Unfortunately, my own party and some Independent Deputies are the only ones who opposed this guillotine Committee Stage of this debate. Let me say that it is unfortunate that the House is not enabled to let its voice be heard with regard to the deletion of this Protocol. From its inception it was a misbegotten idea and whatever means that can be found should be found to have that Protocol deleted, preferably before 18 June.</P>

    <P>In respect of my amendment, I would just like everyone in this House to ask what state of affairs we find ourselves in. The big sell-out is on. There are barely nine Members in the Chamber to oversee this sale, the &ldquo;sale of the century&rdquo; without any doubt. The issues in this debate are crucial to the whole future of this country, as significant as the Act of Union in 1800 which, as we know, was followed by a famine.</P>
    <P>As crucial as the issues in the Treaty itself are, I believe that we are now faced with a more important issue relating to the character of this amendment to our Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>I have entered this fundamental change to the proposed amendment to the Constitution on the basis of advice I have been receiving concerning its unnecessarily wide scope. As I indicated last night, what we have here is a subtle piece of treachery. Rather than face any more referenda on the European Union, or any more Raymond Crotty's the Government, presumably advised by those blind Europhiles in the Department of Foreign Affairs, are proposing an amendment which gives a blank cheque&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are people of the very highest integrity who do their work on behalf of this country in a very willing and able fashion. I strongly reject the suggestion that the Department of Foreign Affairs is populated by such people as the Deputy suggests. I have been in the Department for only a short time and I can speak with the highest respect for all of those people.

      <P>Anything that may reasonably be interpreted to fall within the very vague objectives of the union will be immune now to legal challenge <Col N="809" /> and therefore will not need a further referendum. This makes nonsense out of the Government claim that we will have to have a referendum on defence aspects in 1996. Furthermore, the union will be able to evolve new labour laws, emigration rules, extradition treaties, cross-Border hot pursuit, European identification systems and so on without reference to the Irish people. Frankly, it alarms me that the Government would propose such a form of national harakiri. I can only assume that the State class are absolutely desperate to pass the buck in the absence of any positive answers to our undoubtedly worsening situation.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was quite clearly aware of these possibilities yesterday when he said: &ldquo;the form of the amendment is the same as in 1987&rdquo;. He went on to list some minor exceptions. It is not the same. The areas of the union which are intergovernmental and not subject to the European Court of Justice, mainly security and justice, are being removed from the ambit of the Irish courts as well by virtue of this amendment. Are we to be without legal redress in these areas? Is this an indication of the kind of European Union we are being bludgeoned into by this lily-livered Government and the sheepish Opposition? The Taoiseach's reassurances concerning the point that the Western European Union will not qualify as one of the bodies competent, referred to elsewhere in the amendment, seems rather hollow in the light of what I have already said about the scope of the amendment. In fact, his reassurances are very misleading.</P>

      <P>Sílim go bhfuil antábhacht ag baint leis an dá leasú seo de <Col N="810" /> barr an bhaint atá acu leis an mBunreacht. These are rather important to discuss in the very short time we have because of the possibility of future referenda. We would like to know from the Minister the specific reason these words are put in. Táimid ag lorg sa Sceideal, Cuid I, go scriosfar na focail &ldquo;den aontas Eorpach&rdquo; agus go bhfágfaí é ansin mar &ldquo;riachtanach na hoibleagáidú mar Chomhalta de na Comhphobail&rdquo;. Arís sa leagan Béarla, Cuid II, táimid ag iarraidh that we strike out the words &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; and that it should read; &ldquo;measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities&rdquo;. Similarly the following line is &ldquo;acts done or measures adopted by the Communities&rdquo;, leaving out &ldquo;by the European Union&rdquo;. This was the procedure adopted previously and was the procedure adopted in the Single European Act. The words simply were as we are proposing. It is surprising and it has not been explained why the Government deliberately put in &ldquo;necessitated by obligation of membership of the European Union&rdquo; because we have been assured by the Taoiseach that there will be another referendum in 1996. He said there is nothing in the Maastricht Treaty about defence but that it will come up in 1996 and that there will then be a referendum. He said it on at least two occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that this Treaty commits us to defence. We do not have to wait until 1996: it is very clearly there with the question of European unity. Putting these words in will ensure that a referendum will not be required in 1996 if a defence policy and a common defence is decided on. The same applies if a European army is established, because we are saying that no provision of the Constitution invalidates laws which would be necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union. It will be said that these are necessitated by the obligations of the European Union and that, therefore, there will not be a referendum. Why does the Minister insist on putting in these words when they should not be there? They distort matters <Col N="811" /> and ensure that there will not be a further referendum, no matter what decisions are made, as long as they are decisions necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union, not the obligation of membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>This is fundamentally important and I appeal to the Minister to explain why he feels it essential to insert these words. This will leave us in the position in which we were in regard to the Single European Act and there should be provision for further referenda if there are more changes.</P>

      <P>One of the concerns I have in relation to the inclusion of the European Union in this section is the question it raises about the Minister's statement in the House earlier today that if the question of a European defence policy or European defence arises in 1996 or thereafter, the matter would come back to this country for a referendum. It seems to me &mdash; addressing the matter from the point of view of a layman &mdash; that this amendment to the Constitution seems to make that unnecessary, that in future we can agree anything in relation to the Maastricht Treaty and its developments without holding a referendum in this country. I presume whatever developments took place would have to be ratified by the Dáil but it seems that this provision attempts to eliminate the need for a referendum.</P>
      <P>The other concern I have relates to common foreign policy, security and, if it develops at a later stage, defence, justice and home affairs areas which are outside the competency of the institutions which will be dealt with by intergovernmental co-operation. This was a concern which the European Parliament raised, that the Maastricht Treaty left these matters outside the jurisdiction of the institutions and that they would not be accountable to the European Court of Justice. Will the Minister address himself to those concerns?</P>

      <P>It is a farce to draw a <Col N="812" /> sinister inference from the fact that the words &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; appear here because we are taking the next step in the creation of European Union. The Deputies should look at the original Treaty of Rome, the Treaty of Luxembourg and the Single European Act and they will find that different modes of operation were used, which were appropriate at the time. I see the point that Deputy Mac Giolla is making but he should not draw a sinister inference in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>With all due respect to Deputy Garland, his contribution was little more than scaremongering.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I regard Deputy Garland's <Col N="813" /> contribution as little more than high-level scaremongering.

He said that the rights of appeal to courts &mdash; Irish or European courts &mdash; would also go out the door, which is patent nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the backbenches myself so I appreciate Deputy Mac Giolla's feeling of isolation. As I understand it, the proposals seek to amend subsection (5), the deletion of the words &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; in line 23, the deletion of the words &ldquo;by the European Union&rdquo; in line 26 and the deletion of the words &ldquo;or by bodies competent under the Treaties establishing the Communities&rdquo;. I regret that, in the circumstances, the Government cannot accept the amendment to subsection (5) proposed by Deputies De Rossa and Garland. The words &ldquo;of the European Union&rdquo;, &ldquo;by the European Union&rdquo; and &ldquo;by bodies competent under the Treaties establishing the Communities&rdquo; are necessary to ensure that Ireland can fulfil its obligations under the new Treaty. The text is based closely on the provision in the existing Article 29.4.3º amended to take account of the establishment of a European Union. It permits first the State to adopt laws, Acts or measures necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union, in addition to those arising from membership of the Community. The use of the words &ldquo;laws, acts and measures&rdquo; is to ensure comprehensive cover to our obligations and follows in this respect the exact wording of the existing provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection permits the laws, acts and measures adopted by the European Union, by the Communities or by bodies competent under the Communities such as the new Central Bank, to have the force of law in Ireland as this is required by our Treaty obligations. The bodies competent to which reference is made in the Bill are the European Central Bank <Col N="815" /> and the European Monetary Institute, a transitional body which would exist during the second stage of economic and monetary union. Since these bodies will not be institutions of the Community, they will not be covered by the reference to the institutions in the amendments and hence they have to be covered by a separate reference. That is the technical position in relation to the proposed amendments by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific question of neutrality and the <i>angst</i> which that is causing a number of Deputies, I would refer to the speech made by Deputy Spring in this regard. Those of us who have heard the various contributions in this debate and listened to the efforts being made by people to clarify the specific issues under this very complicated and diverse Treaty, White Paper and popular version, might examine the contribution by Deputy Spring on neutrality. It is clear to the point of understanding and is very helpful in that regard.</P>
    <P>To return to the point made by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa, I assume that they are in some way suggesting that we are handing over our neutrality and our neutral status as we understand it. I do not have to remind them that there is a queue of neutral countries waiting to get into the EC and become full members. I specifically refer to Finland, Austria and Sweden. There is a vast queue of countries in addition to those with neutral policies anxious to become members of the Community. How dare I have any objection to anybody suggesting that a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote is the right answer in the referendum on 18 June next. Nevertheless I have yet to hear those people seeking a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote telling me what the advantages would be, how Ireland would be advantaged and how the people would benefit. Nobody has come forward with any answers in that regard. For those reasons and the other reasons I have stated, we cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The proposal before the House is to delete the words &ldquo;of <Col N="816" /> the European Union&rdquo; from the Schedule. The proposal seems to be a bit daft. If you are against the European Union it might make some sense, but since this House has agreed that we are to join the European Union, surely the proposal to change the Constitution must provide that any laws necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union must be constitutionally valid. The suggestion that we should delete the words &ldquo;of the European Union&rdquo; would entirely negative the fundamental principles on which we are joining that Union. I do not see any merit in the argument adduced in favour of this proposal.</P>

Why will there be any need for a referendum in 1996 or 1997 when the Union makes proposals at that stage which are necessitated by the obligations of membership? This clearly would be one of the things necessitated by the obligations of membership. Why would another referendum be required in 1996 if this is passed?</P>

      <P>In the course of this discussion I have not referred once to the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; and have not implied that the question of a common foreign and security policy as outlined here is in any way in opposition to my concept of how the European Community should develop. My concern relates to the control that this House and the people would have in relation to how it develops. The common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs intergovernmental co-operation are outside our control and outside the range of matters accountable to Members of this House and the people of this country. I am concerned also about adopting this section with European Union incorporated into it and altering our Constitution in such a way that any Acts passed arising from European Union will <Col N="817" /> not be in contravention of our Constitution. When we adopted the Single European Act in 1987 we did not seek at that stage to ensure that any Acts done by intergovernmental co-operation would be automatically acceptable to the Constitution. We are introducing a new element which needs clarification. What is the purpose of introducing this new element which will ensure that Acts done by intergovernmental co-operation will not be in contravention of our Constitution or any section of it?</P>

      <P>I want to add my voice to that of others who are opposing these amendments. We should face up to the reality of what we are asking the people to vote on. We are talking about the creation of European political and monetary union. We should not be afraid to debate these issues. If people hold genuine opposite views, so be it. We have to talk about our involvement in a common security and defence policy and about what neutrality really means in the next century. We are mature enough to be able to debate these issues. Why should we all have to stay quiet once these words are mentioned? Is it not time to say to the people that we are moving into the next century and this is what it means? We must bring the people with us. Anybody who holds the opposite view does not have to engage in insulting remarks. Let them put their point of view and hope they persuade people to their way of thinking. With respect to Deputy Garland, there is no need to engage in that sort of language when opposing the point of view of others. That is what is wrong with this debate. At both ends of the scale there are extremists who fail to see the huge number of people on the centre ground who wish to be properly informed before going to the polling booth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early eighties when heroin and other hard drugs <Col N="820" /> became a major problem here, particularly in Dublin's inner city, a number of notorious criminal families were the main suppliers. As a result of the efforts of the Garda drug units and the response of the local communities, led by the concerned parents movement, the drug godfathers were put out of business, put behind bars, or forced to get out of the country. For a number of years the heroin problem appeared to have peaked but regrettably, over the last few years the problem has again reached the proportions of the early eighties and is now even more serious because it is more widespread, affecting many areas in Dublin and its suburbs and other cities. At every stage there has been a consistent official policy of refusal to accept the seriousness or even the real extent of the problem. Even the needed local Garda drug units assigned to specific areas where there is a serious drugs problem have been tortuously slow in getting official sanction, perhaps because the hard drugs problem is largely concentrated in poor urban areas long accustomed to official neglect by Government agencies. The Central Drug Unit in 1982 had 26 members and today ten years later it has only 30 members, despite the ever expanding drugs problem on a national scale. Against this background it came as no great surprise to me to read the following in the <i>Irish Times</i> in an article on 13 April last:</P>
      <P>Six major drug traffickers from Britain and the Netherlands are now conducting their operations from Ireland. Some 10 Irish nationals are also believed to be dealing on international markets. At least one is thought to be as prominent as the foreign incomers . . .</P>
      <P>The largest of the dealers conducts an elaborate trade in a variety of drugs from South America and the Dutch Antilles to the US and Canada. He is also suspected of smuggling narcotics into Ireland . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> According to the authorities there is a second large-scale trafficker closely associated with the largest operator. He is suspected of being a major player in the European amphetamine trade . . .</P>
    <P>Another suspected trafficker is living in an isolated home . . .</P>
    <P>He is believed to deal in cannabis and heroin, is associated with drug dealers in Britain and travels to Pakistan regularly. Yet another major figure in the international scene has moved to Ireland recently and is suspected of being involved with a wide range of drugs, but is reputed to specialise in amphetamines . . .</P>
    <P>About 10 are thought to be dealing in cannabis, heroin and cocaine on an international scale. The Dublin-based operator who is thought to be the largest conducts business between Britain, the Netherlands, the US and Canada and has served a jail sentence abroad for drug-related offences.</P>
    <P>The authorities are aware of the whereabouts of the traffickers, who are enormously wealthy and generally favour secluded homes where covert surveillance operations can be easily detected . . .</P>
    <P>It is believed that some of the major traffickers are engaging in high-profile legitimate business here in order to launder drugs money.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister if he can confirm the accuracy or otherwise of these statements. If the statements are correct they pose a number of serious questions. The Minister has direct responsibility in this area. Is this country being increasingly regarded as being safe for major drug traffickers as a base for their operations? Do the traffickers believe that the dedicated Garda drug units simply do not have the resources or the manpower to deal with them? If this trend continues will Ireland inevitably be flooded with <Col N="822" /> hard drugs like heroin, cocaine and crack as was suggested by a US police officer in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times?</i> Will the Minister outline the steps he intends to take and the resources he intends to make available to deal with this very serious and real threat?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities are aware, through intelligence gathering and surveillance operations, that a small number of persons including both Irish nationals and others are involved in the importation of drugs into this country.</P>
      <P>For obvious reasons I cannot go into detail on the operations which the Garda are mounting to deal with such criminals but I have every confidence in the effectiveness of Garda action in this respect. Indeed the House will be aware from recent media reports of the successes the Garda have achieved through operations targeted at drug suppliers.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that the problem of drugs will continue to receive the highest priority. The Garda authorities monitor the situation very closely. They constantly review and adapt their strategies to deal with it. These strategies include close liaison with Customs authorities and continuous international co-operation with police forces abroad so as to curb the supply of illicit drugs to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International co-operation is of course, vital to effective action against drug traffickers. In the time available to me, I cannot go into detail on the many important fora for such co-operation. However, I will mention a significant new initiative in tackling drug trafficking, that is the establishment of a Europol Drugs Unit. It is intended that this unit will be established by the end of this year and will act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for, in particular, drug-related information between member states. This unit should be of great practical benefit to us in dealing with drug <Col N="823" /> trafficking. I very much welcome its establishment.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities treat drug law enforcement as a priority. All members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drugs misuse within their operational area. There are now gardaí specially trained in this area in every Garda Division. In addition, specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and, at present small specialist units are in operation in Dublin's north inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and Tallaght. Similar specialist units are set up on a temporary basis in other areas as required. The services of the drug squad are also made available to all areas as required.</P>
    <P>A National Drugs Unit, which was set up in 1990, based in Garda headquarters, co-ordinates the Garda anti-drug efforts in this country and also acts as a liaison body with international drug enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>The allocation of manpower and other resources to specialist areas, such as drug enforcement, is of course a matter for the Garda authorities. They assure me that specialist drug units have been and will continue to be given the resources necessary for them to deal effectively with the problem. They have assured me also that they are keeping the situation under constant review.</P>
    <P>Of course one of the most effective measures which can be taken against drug traffickers is to deprive them of the profits gained from their illegal activity. A Bill to do just that is at a very advanced stage of preparation and I expect to be able to introduce this Bill at an early date.</P>
    <P>However, I must reiterate what I have said on a number of previous occasions &mdash; law enforcement alone will not solve this problem. Every member of society has a role to play. This role can be as important as the Garda response. The Government are aware that there is a need to tackle the drug problem on every front and that co-ordinated action must be taken to reduce the supply of, and <Col N="824" /> demand for, drugs in this country. For this reason, my colleague, the Minister for Health, last year launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse. This strategy sets realistic objectives for the achievement of its aims.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy and the House that the drugs problem is being taken very seriously indeed and will continue to be the subject of ongoing urgent attention by the relevant authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered it would be useful to give the Minister an opportunity to state clearly the official position with regard to the use of schools or school grounds in the cause of or to promote or campaign on the current issue of abortion. I contend that such should not be permitted on either side of the current discussion.</P>
      <P>I have already received a telephone call from a number of parents in my constituency who have already noticed numerous posters in a local school and the school being used for meetings. One will appreciate the difficult position of parents. They are unlikely to want to complain directly for fear that any such action would influence or affect their children. Therefore it puts them on the spot.</P>
      <P>My objective in raising this matter was to allow the Minister an opportunity to state the case officially, to enable schools become neutral zones, so that they will not be used by one side or the other. Teachers are concerned also. This surfaced at the TUI conference at Easter, when strong views were expressed by teachers that they should not be placed in the position of having to oppose any attempts of various groups to come into classrooms and put their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did attend a separate meeting in a local national school one evening and saw wall-to-wall posters describing abortion as murder. We must accept that, in circumstances like these, parents must be allowed be the educators and informants of their children. It is not right to bombard <Col N="825" /> young people with information on this kind of sensitive issue; I do not think they are able to comprehend it and it is wrong. Therefore we public representatives, and in particular the Minister for Education, have a responsibility to give a clear direction so that, in the following months, there will not be bitterness or division in schools, which I suspect could happen because there are significant political overtones to the current debate. Therefore, it would be very helpful if all of us, teachers and parents, knew exactly where we stood on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fennell for having raised this matter on the Adjournment this evening. I should say, first of all, that the use of school premises by out-of-school groups is a matter for the management authorities of the individual schools.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have no hesitation in agreeing fully with the sentiments behind the motion put down for this Adjournment Debate by the Deputy. It is the view of the Minister, and I agree fully, that schools should not be used in the debate on abortion issues by any of the proponents. It is particularly important, too, that the children in class would not be exposed to pressure by any of the active groups involved in the abortion debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister was aware that organised groups might wish to use school premises for, or seek to address the students on, the issues involved. For this reason he arranged some weeks ago that officials of his Department would speak to the school managerial associations to make known his view that schools generally should not become embroiled in the abortion debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction of the managerial associations was very positive. There is no doubt that their views are fully in accordance with those of the Minister. The managerial associations have advised <Col N="826" /> their local school management authorities of the issues in question, advising that schools should not become involved in the debate.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the approach which has been adopted is the correct one in the circumstances. Apart from any other consideration the issue of a circular, such as the Deputy has in mind, might serve only to initiate a controversy about the use of school premises and, as such, would be counterproductive. However, I can assure the Deputy that the position will be carefully monitored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again I raise on the Adjournment the matter of the requisite permanent buildings at Confey Community College, Leixlip, Co. Kildare. Since I raised this matter in the House previously the contention has continued, with parents justifiably agitating for the production by the Minister of a realistic timetable for the provision of permanent classrooms.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, and has been mentioned by other speakers in the House, of the 400-plus students attending the college at present, only about 25 per cent are housed in permanent classrooms, with obvious consequences for the standard of education both parents and teachers require, causing grave problems for the teachers there who must work under those conditions in addition to the fact that those students receive their secondary education in far from ideal accommodation. As a result of parents' agitation the Minister responded to his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, on 29 April last. I will not quote the entire letter but it is indicated therein that invitation to tender is scheduled for August 1992, tenders to be received &mdash; I presume that is the latest date for receipt &mdash; by December 1992. Then the important paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> Construction on this project should then begin in January 1993. You will appreciate that unforeseen circumstances could disrupt this schedule. However, I am confident that this timetable is realistic and can be adhered to.</P>
    <P>That is a rather contradictory statement, one which has led to confusion on the part of parents who were present at a well-attended public meeting in Confey Community College last evening, indeed on the part of public representatives and, I am sure also, the Minister of State sitting opposite. I have been asked by the parents and other public representatives to request the Minister to confirm his intentions in relation to Confey College. I can see no reason whatever for postponing the work until January 1993 or deferring the proposals which have been agreed to until a later date.</P>
    <P>The Minister should outline his intentions in relation to this college. The letter from which I have just quoted would seem to indicate that the Minister may not proceed with the work in certain circumstances. Such a decision would not be welcomed by the people in the area and would be regarded by the parents, students and teachers as the straw which broke the camel's back. Notwithstanding the funds which have already been allocated, I do not for one moment believe that the kitty is so empty that the Minister cannot respond positively to the needs of Confey College which is located in an area which has registered the fastest growth in population in the entire country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning by the County Kildare Vocational Education Committee's Design Team of the extension to replace existing temporary accommodation at Confey College has only recently been completed. The provision of this new permanent accommodation will be the solution to the long <Col N="828" /> term accommodation problems at this school. Pending the construction of this new accommodation the school has been housed in temporary classrooms and a small permanent block of four classrooms.</P>
      <P>I should point out to both the Deputy and the House that every step has been taken to ensure that no undue delay occurred in the planning of these facilities. Indeed the Department authorised the vocational education committee to allow their design team to combine some stages of planning in order to speed up the planning process while still maintaining the very necessary high standards of design and cost control.</P>
      <P>Following representations from local interests, and having considered the position regarding this urgently needed accommodation, the Minister decided that the project should proceed according to the following schedule: invitation of tenders, August 1992; receipt of tenders and placement of contract, December 1992; and construction to commence, January 1993. There is no reason to think that this schedule cannot be met. I am confident that this timetable is realistic and can be adhered to.</P>

The fact that the £22 million allocated in the 1992 budget has not featured in either the Social Welfare Bill or the Finance Bill that is currently before the House has caused great anxiety to thousands of women who have been waiting for payment for over six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Department of Social Welfare are unable to devise a scheme which will give every women concerned a chance to apply. I call on the Minister <Col N="829" /> to state clearly the categories of women who are entitled to payment, the social welfare schemes involved and whether his Department have the necessary records either at local or national level to enable a decision to be made in each case.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;despite the fact that court proceedings arising from the delay were instituted by married women in January 1985. It is because of the failure of the Deputy's party to implement <Col N="830" /> the provisions on time and the decision to defend the proceedings initiated by married women in January 1985 that we now have to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>It is scandalous that we have to allocate significant resources to meet retrospective payments which will amount to £22 million in the current year alone. The Exchequer would have saved money if the Deputy's party had implemented the necessary measures on time. Bearing in mind that they delayed implementing equal treatment for almost two years beyond the required deadline, Fine Gael's new-found concern for the entitlement of married women can only be described as amusing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The required legislation is already at a very advanced stage and I expect to be able to make the statutory instrument by the end of the month. The precise details of the package will be announced at that stage. As I have already stated in the House, the retrospective payments involved will be made on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994. Under the first phase, the increased rates of benefit and the extended duration of unemployment benefit will be paid this year. Payments in respect of increases for dependants and unemployment assistance will be made in two equal instalments in 1993 and 1994. Providing for equality of treatment in respect of the period of the delay has major administrative implications for my Department. Claims for retrospective payments will be processed in a new central unit which has already been set up in the <Col N="831" /> Department. It is my intention that this new unit will become fully operational by the time the statutory instrument is made. This will ensure that potential beneficiaries will be able to make their claims once the details of the overall package are announced and that work on the processing of claims can be undertaken immediately.</P>

      <P>I raise the question of wandering horses and goats causing serious problems in Galway city. This problem is mainly concentrated in the Castlepark-Ballybane area which is located at the back of the new Corrib Great Southern Hotel, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.</P>
      <P>Approximately 20 years ago a pilot scheme of 22 houses was built in this area for travelling families. I believe this pilot scheme would have proved a great success if it had been given a chance to work. However, over the past few years a number of caravans have parked illegally in the area. The owners of those caravans have brought their goats and horses with them. The nuisance these animals are creating in the Castlepark-Ballybane area would have to be seen to be believed. These people have erected shanty-type buildings in which to house their horses. These animals are scaring the adults and children living in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway Corporation have done their best to deal with this problem. Their record in housing itinerants and travelling people in the Galway area is second to none. They have provided four hard stands in the city and one on the outskirts, and have housed over 100 travelling families in the past few years. The corporation periodically gather up the horses and bring them to pounds. On one occasion five or six horses which had been brought to the pound in Portlaoise were back on the streets in the Castlepark area the next day having been released illegally. Even if these horses are not released illegally, an £18 fee will ensure <Col N="832" /> their release, a sum which seems to be no problem to those people. If people want to come in to live in our city or to live illegally in caravans, they should conform to the way other people live in the city. There should not be one law for settled people and another law for travelling people. This problem should be seriously considered because it makes life intolerable for the people of Castlepark and Ballybane, whom I compliment on their restraint despite what they have had to put up with in the last ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, it is important that I outline to the House the extent of the responsibility of the Minister for Justice in relation to wandering animals, including horses. Primary responsibility for the impounding of wandering animals rests with the local authorities who maintain pounds for the purpose. The Garda are also authorised to impound wandering animals and to assist local authority officials responsible for the work. The Minister for Justice authorises the fees charged by local authorities for the use of their animal pounds. The Minister for Justice is also responsible for monitoring and, where necessary, updating the law on civil liability for damage caused by animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law in relation to wandering animals was updated in recent years by the enactment of the Animals Act, 1985. That Act tackled the question of impounding in three ways: first, it give increased powers to the Garda and local authorities to impound animals; second, it improved the effectiveness of the impounding procedure by giving local authorities power to order the sale, disposal and destruction, where appropriate, of impounded animals and, third, it increased substantially the fines for turning animals loose, allowing them on the public road or for pound breaking. The 1985 Act also abolished the then immunity of occupiers of land adjoining the public road in relation to damage <Col N="833" /> caused by animals straying from such lands onto the road. As a result, the ordinary laws of negligence now apply in such cases. Thanks to the Act local authorities and the Garda now have power to impound an animal wandering on the road, even where the owner is known. The authorities are also empowered to impound animals trespassing in public parks or other open spaces owned by a local or State authority.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the local issue of wandering animals in Galway, as raised by the Deputy. Over the years there have been several incidents of wandering animals in Galway city. On all occasions the Garda have responded to requests for assistance from local residents and the local authority. I understand that the Garda authorities have dealt with numerous cases of wandering animals in the Hillside area of the city. My information is that the matter is at present under control.

      <P>The case I raise concerns an application for a visa to enter this country by an Iraqi national whose brother is an Irish citizen and whose family have suffered horribly under the Saddam Hussein regime. This person's father is dead, one brother was killed in the Iran-Iraq War after being conscripted, two other brothers were arrested by the secret police and have not been heard of since, and the fate of another brother is unknown. This person, Metham Muhssin, <Col N="834" /> was forced to join the Iraqi army, deserted during the war as a result of leaflets dropped by the Americans and Saudis and gave himself up to the Americans. The leaflets assured him that he would be safe and treated as a guest in Saudi Arabia. Instead, he is now treated as a refugee and finds himself in a refugee camp.</P>
      <P>This man's brother, residing in my constituency, is not permitted by the Saudis to visit him and he faces execution if he returns to Iraq. His brother is an Irish citizen with his own business in Ireland and he is prepared to give his brother employment and otherwise support him as necessary. I am appealing to the Minister on humanitarian grounds to reconsider the decision to refuse an entry visa in these especially tragic circumstances.</P>
      <P>Finally, it is regrettable that the manner of dealing with this matter by the Department of Justice lacks sensitivity and compassion. The manner in which representations from the family have been received by the Department leaves a lot to be desired.</P>

      <P>The position is that an application for a visa for Metham Sahib Muhssin was first made to my predecessor last year. The application was just one of a number of applications or visas in respect of people who are natives of Iraq and who have family or other connections with Ireland. Detailed consideration of the whole question of visas for those persons was given at the time by my predecessor. Having considered all aspects of the application, he decided to refuse to grant a visa in this particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have looked into the matter again <Col N="835" /> with an open mind. I am satisfied that the original decision taken was the correct one and that it should stand. I am aware of all of the circumstances surrounding the application mentioned by the Deputy and I regret that I would not be justified in overturning the original decision.</P>
    <P>It has been, and still is, the practice not to disclose the reason why particular visa applications are not granted. Generally speaking, this is the accepted international practice; so we are not alone in this regard. Accordingly, I am not in a position to explain my reasons for refusal <Col N="836" /> in this case but I would conclude by saying that they are valid and justified. If the Deputy wishes to pursue the matter with me personally or if what I say seems to him inaccurate or not the full story, I shall be pleased to hear from him.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to remind the House that the vast majority of persons who visit this country, either for touristic or business reasons, do not require a visa. Where a visa is required there are no obstacles put in the way of people who genuinely wish to visit us as tourists or for business purposes. Indeed, for those bona fide tourists and business people who visit us on a regular basis, and for whom there is a visa requirement, multiple entry visas are available to reduce the level of delay and bureaucratic inconvenience which multiple applications would otherwise impose.</P>
      <P>Where doubts arise as to whether a particular application for a visa is a genuine one, the referee in Ireland, who is named by the applicant when applying, is normally consulted with a view to dispelling those doubts. When this is possible, a visa will issue. When it is not, a decision is taken in the light of all of the circumstances surrounding each case and each application is considered on its own merits.</P>
      <P>It is generally speaking the international practice not to disclose the reasons for the refusal of visa applications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 21, 31, 35, 36 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 164 on 24 March, 1992 Dáil Debates, Vol. 417, No. 5, Col. 1173-1174) the Garda Commissioner has examined the question of false alarm calls and, following consultation with the security and insurance industries, has put proposals to my Department for a new policy to deal with the unacceptably high level of false alarm calls being experienced throughout the country.</P>
      <P>At present approximately 94% of the well over 250,000 alarm activations notified to the Gardaí annualy are false, yet the Gardaí must commit resources to all such calls as if each were genuine. This involves an intolerable waste of Garda resources and a real handicap in the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that any new policy will reduce the level of false alarm activations to make alarm systems once again an effective instrument in crime prevention. With this in mind I am at present examining the proposals the Commissioner has drawn up and I hope to make an announcement in the matter shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of holding a further inquiry into this case was considered recently by the Government in conjunction with the decision to grant a pardon to Mr. Kelly. The Government had before them the advice of both the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions that any further inquiry into the circumstances of the case would be unlikely to produce any clearer resolution of the issues involved. The Government accepted that advice coming as it did from the law officers who had concluded a full review of the case and who were best placed to judge whether an inquiry would or would not produce results. The Government certainly do not consider that it would be in the public interest to initiate a costly and time-consuming inquiry which would leave us no wiser than before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not to say that nothing has been or is being done to protect the rights of the individual in custody and to safeguard the Gardai against false allegations made by persons in custody. The Criminal Justice Act, 1984 and the regulations on the treatment of persons in custody made under that Act introduced many new safeguards, including new procedures for interviewing persons in Garda custody. In addition the Garda Síochána Complaints Act, 1986 introduced comprehensive arrangements for the investigation and adjudication of complaints made by the public about the comduct of members of the Garda Síochána. The Martin Committee has also recommended further additional safeguards, <Col N="759" /> including a recommendation that audiovisual recording of questioning be introduced. I expect to be in a position to bring recommendations on this matter before the Government in the near future. As regards formalised arrangments for dealing with alleged miscarriages of justice, it is the Government's intention that the necessary legislation will be introduced in the Dáil next autumn. I would also draw attention to the statement in the Martin Committee report that &ldquo;submissions received from practitioners, and in particular defence practitioners, are unanimous to the effect that the coming into force of the Regulations on the Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations, coupled with the setting up of the Garda Complaint Board, has resulted in the virtual disappearance of complaints of physical ill-treatment or threats of violence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the taking of action against any serving or retired member of the Garda Síochána in connection with this case would not be a matter for me or my Department. I might add that the Director of Public Prosecutions in communicating his views to the Attorney General made it known that in his opinion there are no grounds for bringing proceedings against any member or former member of the Force. This is a matter in which the Director of Public Prosecutions has sole discretion. The Director is completely independent in the discharge of his duties and functions and neither the Government nor I as Minister for Justice have any role in the matter.</P>

The local Garda Officers in Blanchardstown report that while there are no indications that there is a serious drugs problem in the area, they are continuing to be vigilant to ensure that this does not change for the worse and all necessary action will be taken in any case coming to light.</P>

      <P>There is a Garda recruitment competition currently in progress from which 1,000 Garda will be recruited over the next few years. The current strength of the Force is 10,880 and it is expected to reach 11,000 by the end of this year. In addition to this, a further 140 civilian clerical staff will be recruited this year to provide clerical support for the gardaí and to release more gardaí for the outdoor operational <Col N="762" /> duty for which they were trained. There will be a total of 700 clerical staff employed in the Garda Síochána by the end of this year and I plan to increase this further in future years.</P>
      <P>All Garda recruits now undergo a comprehensive training programme which was approved by the Government and which takes account of the recommendations of the Walsh Committee. There is an emphasis during training on the development of practical policing skills and the course also covers such topics as criminology, behavioural science, psychology, public relations, communications, social science and management skills. The training course is now two years in duration. Part of this time is spent assigned to Garda stations to gain &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; policing experience. Some £13 million has been spent on the Garda College over the past few years to bring it up to the highest international standards. While it serves as a training facility for recruits, there are also ongoing in-service training courses provided there which deal with all aspects of police work and keep gardaí aware of any advancements that have been made in all areas of policing. There are also specialist courses for members of specialist units and management courses to ensure that Garda management is kept up to the standards elsewhere in the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>The technology used by the Garda Síochána is constantly being reviewed and improved to keep the Force equipped to the highest possible standard in their fight against crime. This year alone approximately £5 million will be spent on computer technology and other equipment for the Force.</P>

      <P>As an inquest is pending in this case there are limits to how much comment I can make on the matter.</P>
      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question was committed to Portlaoise on 11 January 1990 to serve a 5 year sentence and was transferred to the Training Unit, Glengarriff Parade in July 1990.</P>
      <P>During his time in the Training Unit he was seen by a Medical Officer on several occasions but never sought, or appeared to require, referral to a psychiatrist. He was on a normal work programme, was receiving regular visits and was generally participating well in the activities of the Training Unit. A short time before his death he had been interviewed by an official from my Department and informed that a pre-release programme was under consideration for him, commencing with temporary release for a weekend in May 1992. In all these circumstances his death was quite unexpected.</P>

      <P>The prisoner referred to by the Deputy was committed to prison in 1982 to serve a sentence of penal servitude for life for murder. In 1990 the case was the subject of a review body by the Sentence Review Group which is a non-statutory body set up in 1989 to advise the Minister in relation to the administration of long term prison sentences. Arising out of that review, the prisoner was granted a series of accompanied outings for re-socialisation purposes, pending a further review later this year. He was on his ninth such outing when he absconded on 29 April, 1992. He was re-captured on 1 May, 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Pre-release programmes are common to civilised penal systems throughout the world. They attempt to re-integrate offenders into the community in a planned way. All decisions to grant temporary releases are made with due regard to the length of sentence, the nature of the offence, length of time served, behaviour while in custody and the safety of the public. In this case there was, in addition, the advice of the Sentence Review Group.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the temporary release in this case was granted only after rigorous scrutiny and subject to proper safeguards and was in accordance with long-standing practice. No system of temporary release or pre-release programme is infallible and the fact that the prisoner in this instance absconded on his ninth outing does not mean that the system is defective or alter the fact that it is desirable and necessary to have such a system.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy well realises, large increases in investment of resources, <Col N="766" /> regardless of the taxpayer's ability to pay for same, are something which it is all too easy to call for but which no responsible Government could provide without regard to the implications. I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the remarks of the Garda Commissioner at the GRA Conference earlier this week where he rejected claims that a lack of resources was hampering the policing function in this jurisdiction. Having said that, it is my firm intention, as I have already indicated to the same Conference, to do the very best I can for the gardaí in the matter of allocation of resources.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the Garda Síochána is 10,880 and a total expenditure in excess of £341 million is provided for in this year's Estimates in respect of the service which the Force provides to the public. The current ratio of gardaí to population compares more than favourably with the police/ population ratio in other EC member states. Moreover, to ensure that the Force is kept up to full strength, a recruitment campaign is underway to recruit 1,000 new gardaí over the next few years. The first batch of these new recruits commenced training at the Garda College last month.</P>
      <P>The crime problem in this country is not amenable to any &ldquo;quick-fix&rdquo; solution. Crime is a multi-dimensional issue. It requires a sophisticated response from the community as a whole and from all the relevant agencies and authorities. From the policing perspective, crime can best be tackled through the optimum management of manpower and physical resources, through sophisticated training and tactics and through ensuring that the Gardai have the appropriate legal powers to perform their task effectively. In this regard, as part of my on-going programme of reform of the criminal law I will be publishing, later this year, a Criminal Justice Bill which will give increased powers to the Garda Síochána to protect the public from threatening behaviour on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the role of the Garda Síochána at the local community <Col N="767" /> level in the prevention of crime is also of major significance. The increased involvement of Gardaí in community based projects together with the introduction of Neighbourhood Policing, Community Policing in Rural Areas, the Garda Schools Project and recent amendments to the Juvenile Liaison Scheme will, I hope, have a considerable downward impact on the future level of crime in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of Garda Task Forces, it should be remembered that in any area the Gardaí do not operate in isolation and can call on back-up at any time should the occasion demand it. I am informed by the Garda authorities that Task Forces are set up when and where appropriate. In 1988 the DMA Crime Task Force was replaced by Divisional Task Forces in that area. The Commissioner informs me that these have proved successful and continued in existence.</P>

      <P>The Garda stations concerned are Enfield, which is attached to the Louth/Meath Division and Kinnegad, Rochfordbridge, Kilbeggan, Moate and Athlone, which are attached to the Longford/Westmeath Divisions.</P>
      <P>Arrangements regarding the hours which these and all other Garda stations are open to the public are a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the Garda authorities that any extension of the existing opening hours would prove counter-productive by taking men off operational duties to deal with administrative work in the Garda stations concerned. The Commissioner is satisfied that the present arrangements make for the most effective use of available manpower resources.</P>
      <P>A patrol car is attached to Enfield Garda station and operates on a 24 hour basis. The District patrol car at Trim is also available to assist in providing patrols in the area when required. With regard to the stations mentioned above in the Longford/Westmeath Division, patrols are carried out by local Gardaí and in addition to this is a motorcycle attached to both Moate and Kinnegad stations which provide mobile patrols.</P>
      <P>Patrols are also provided by mobile units from Mullingar to Kinnegad and Rochfordbridge and also from Athlone to Kilbeggan and Moate. This stretch of roadway is also policed by the Traffic Corps which is based in Mullingar.</P>
      <P>Crime levels in the Districts in question are quite low; for instance the provisional crime figures for last year for the sub-District of Enfield indicate a reduction of about 1/3 over the 1990 figure, while those for the Moate sub-District show a slight reduction.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together. It has been decided to suspend work indefinitely on the Bonet catchment drainage scheme with practically 91 per cent cent of the scheduled work completed. The stretches of the upper Bonet River in the areas of Mullies and Glenade were <Col N="771" /> included as part of the scheduled works of this drainage scheme.</P>
      <P>For reasons both environmental and economic, works in these areas have not been completed. The upper reaches of the catchment contain valuable fish spawning grounds. If drainage works were done in these sensitive areas serious damage would be caused which would, no doubt, give rise to substantial claims for compensation. Some works have already been carried out on intermittent sections of the channels in the Glenade and Mullies so the lands in question will not suffer any significant loss. Furthermore, the river in this area has a steep gradient and flows through a narrow valley so that any flooding which does occur is very limited and of short duration.</P>

      <P>National schools are schools recognised by the Minister for Education and, as such, eligible for receipt of appropriate grant-in-aid from my Department.</P>
      <P>In order to warrant the grant of aid, I, as Minister, would have to be satisfied that a particular school is required as a national school.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which would be examined in the light of an application to my Department from the school in question. Such an application does not appear to have been lodged to date.</P>
      <P>The Constitution of Boards of Management of National Schools and the Rules of Procedure are set out in booklet form available from my Department or from the Government Pubications Sale Office, Dublin.</P>

      <P>Since 1989, contact has been made with a number of North American carriers about the possibility of their operating direct services to Ireland. To date, only one foreign carrier has made a firm proposal in that regard. Earlier this year, Delta Airlines proposed that, in the event of the Government deciding to eliminate the Shannon stop policy, they would commence a New York/Dublin service. This would be in addition to their existing service which operates Atlanta/Shannon/Dublin.</P>
      <P>My predecessor also received proposals from Aer Lingus in 1991 seeking approval to operate services between Ireland and Los Angeles, on the basis of a direct service to/from Dublin, and also for the operation of some direct services between Dublin and New York.</P>
      <P>I am assessing the approaches from both Delta Airlines and Aer Lingus in the context of proposals on the Shannon stop, which I will be formulating shortly for consideration by the Government.</P>
