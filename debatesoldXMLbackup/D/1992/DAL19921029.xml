      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12 and 13.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: 1.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the effect of the continuing political uncertainty on decisions that have to be taken by the Minister for Finance, among others, on important economic matters, would the Minister agree that this political uncertainty should be cleared up by a formal statement by the Government in the House next Tuesday at the latest as to the future of the Government and the future of the legislative programme <Col N="1298" /> agreed between the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Malley?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could give a list of the promised legislation but I do not want to burden the House with it.  A lengthy legislative programme was agreed not long ago in good faith, it appears, between the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Malley.  I would like to know if that remains the case and if the Government will make a formal statement as to their future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to promised legislation, I understand that agreement has been reached that the second Finance Bill will be taken by a committee of this House.  May I ask the Minister for Finance when that Bill will be published? Will he confirm that it is extremely important that the Bill be put through the House before 1 January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister for Finance not agree that the Government promised legislation to grant assistance to firms in difficulty as a result of the sterling devaluation?  Will the Minister say when this legislation will be introduced in view of the fact that many firms along the border are in acute and immediate difficulty, carrying out contracts on which they are losing money? If this legislation is not brought in very quickly firms will go under and many thousands of jobs will be lost.</P>

    <Title>Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Bill, 1992    [Seanad]:  Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned yesterday evening I referred to devices which are used for interception of telecommunications and the availability of such equipment on the Irish market.  I asked the Minister to clarify the exact procedure which will be in place when this Bill is enacted.  I am aware he indicated that there will be fines of up to £50,000 or terms of imprisonment. However, many Bills have been enacted in this House which have not been tested in the courts although we are aware that legislation and regulations are being abused.  What steps is the Minister prepared to take in regard to the whole area of unauthorised interference in communications?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister also indicate if there has been research or investigation into certain cases?  We are all aware of the recent interference in communications and that conversations have been published in the national newspapers.  We are also aware that the Garda are investigating the political case to which I referred yesterday, but I wonder if the Minister has received a response to the investigations underway or in regard to any other interference in communications? If he is not in a position to report at present when does he envisage being able to do so?  Will we have an opportunity at a later stage to discuss this matter in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> I welcome the Bill and I look forward to it being enacted.  The one thing which everybody wants is freedom to communicate in total privacy without interference.</P>

I welcome its provisions.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice I want to put to the Minister on notice that when it comes to Committee Stage I will want to tease out some aspects of the Bill.  I do not see any purpose in making a lengthy speech about the Bill's contents.  In his address yesterday to the House the Minister outlined the general intent of the Bill.  My concern is not merely that we complete Committee Stage but that the Bill is enacted as it has passed through the Seanad.  I am particularly concerned that it will be enacted before there is a general election.  I say that because it was quite clear from the Order of Business that there is a sort of end of term atmosphere about the House.</P>
      <P>We can all predict when there will be an election.  Perhaps next week we will be on the hustings, or it may not be until the new year.  But it is quite clear that the Government are on the point of disintegration. It is no longer a question of an effective Government; it is a question of two parties dancing around each other, eyeballing each other and determining when it would be to the advantage of one or other to pull the plug.  The impact of this on the country is something that does not seem to be of great concern to either party in Government in the context of the current situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that at times of political desperation the Fianna Fáil Party have behaved in a somewhat bizarre way and at times of political desperation, in the past some members of the Fianna Fáil Party have seen fit to abuse individuals' rights to privacy by tapping telephones. It is a matter of public record that that happened and journalists have been financially <Col N="1306" /> compensated for that type of behaviour.  It was only around this time last year that we were listening to stories of mysterious Hiace vans travelling the streets of Dublin allegedly listening in to telephone calls or communications going on within the flat of the Taoiseach. Nobody ever managed to establish whether that was all a piece of theatrical nonsense or whether it was a reality.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we have a situation in which the leaders of the two parties in Government are bad mouthing each other and accusing each other of being dishonest in circumstances where it seems that each of these parties may have justifiable reasons to tap each other's telephones.  It is becoming increasingly urgent that this legislation be enacted.  In case there is any suggestion that what I am saying might in some way be over the top, it is not that long ago when two members of Fianna Fáil, the current EC Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry and the then Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, got themselves into something of a mess trying to record what one was saying to the other.</P>
    <P>I take a simple view of this legislation. This Dáil is slowly dying.  Certainly, we are now suffering from a political illness that is terminal.  It may be that the parties that formed this Government will continue threshing about for another few weeks and if they do, and if they remain in Government, there is one important item of legislation, among others, that must be passed and it includes this Bill. I want to see this Bill enacted into law before we have a general election.  Bearing that in mind I welcome the general principles of the Bill.  I welcome the fact that it is in this House and that it has completed its passage through the Seanad but I would ask the Minister how soon he intends to take Committee Stage. I urge the Minister to take it next week and, if not, the following week.</P>
    <P>We must have legislation which regulates the behaviour of those involved in the interception of telecommunications and postal packets.  I recognise, as a matter of principle, that individuals or groups involved in crime must be brought <Col N="1307" /> to justice and that as a matter of principle the Garda must have available to them the type of powers this legislation allows for.  For far too long these powers have been operated without statutory responsibility of constraints.  There has been no means of reviewing them and we have had clear examples of blatant abuse.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure there can be no further examples of this.  I want this legislation put on the Statute Book and when we are debating Committee Stage there will be some technical aspects of the legislation that I will want to tease out.  It is not appropriate to do that today.  The Bill that follows the conclusion of this debate, the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill, 1992, is one of equal urgency in that it seeks to ensure that we deal with the public finances in an efficient way.  It is a Bill that my colleague, Deputy G. Mitchell, and the Fine Gael Party, have been pressing the Government to produce for the past four years.  I do not want to delay the completion of the Second Stage of that debate today either because I hope we can enact it before the Government completely disintegrate and we find ourselves going to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department the Marine (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do na Teachtaí a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht seo.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate for their constructive and at times robust contributions. In general, the subject we are discussing is emotive and raises all sorts of technical questions.  It is also a delicate subject.  In particular, this Bill is complex in places and it does have a narrow focus. In short, it is a difficult subject to talk about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying purpose of the Bill is to strike a balance between protecting the fundamental public interest involved in the security of the State and the effective investigation of serious offences on the one hand, and safeguarding the right of individuals to privacy of communication <Col N="1308" /> on the other hand.  Some degree of official interception of telephone communications is a feature of law enforcement internationally and it is accepted that to be effective any system of official interception must be accompanied by the greatest degree of secrecy that can be achieved compatible with the interests of justice.</P>
    <P>With a view to achieving a proper balance between the public and private interests the Bill provides for clear but limited circumstances in which authorisations may be given.  It provides a procedure under which a complaints referee, who will have full access to all relevant papers and information, can investigate complaints and award compensation for improper authorisations. Most importantly, it provides for continuous supervision of the operation of the system by a judge of the High Court, who will also have complete access to all relevant papers and information.  Under the Bill, any authorisation given will be given in the knowledge that that authorisation can come under the scrutiny of an independent judicial authority of high standing.  This is the surest guarantee that authorisations given under the Act will be proper authorisations.</P>
    <P>The Bill proceeds on the basis that nobody has a right to know whether their telephone has been lawfully tapped, whereas everybody has a right to know that there has or has not been a contravention of the Act in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with specific points raised by Deputies I feel I must comment in a general way on some criticisms of the Bill.  This Bill evolved from the 1985 Bill and the 1990 Private Members' Bill.  It is very similar to those Bills and any changes that have been made are by way of bringing this Bill up to date.  These changes have been made in the context of what this Bill sets out to do, that is, placing on a statutory basis the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interceptions of postal packets and telecommunications and introducing two new provisions for controlling the exercise of the Minister's powers in that respect.  None of the criticisms are of <Col N="1309" /> those changes and, indeed, it is gratifying that the provisions in the Bill have generally been received very well.</P>
    <P>Deputies have criticised the Bill for what it does no contain.  Those matters which I will deal with in detail in a moment were not in the 1985 or the 1990 Bills either, and for good reason.  They are not relevant to this Bill and they are not matters that are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  It is not as if illegal interception of communications was not an issue some years ago or that equipment for receiving electric or magnetic signals was not heard of.  They were not relevant to the 1985 Bill, the 1990 Bill or to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with some specific points raised by Deputies and I will start with the question of unauthorised interceptions and scanners, as raised by Deputies Kemmy, Gilmore and Durkan. I have already explained the very precise intent of this Bill.  It deals with authorised interceptions of postal packets and telecommunications messages.  It does not deal with unlawful interception of postal packets or telecommunications messages. Any such interceptions would, as I suggested, be breaches of the criminal law and would be investigated by the Garda and where appropriate, dealt with by the courts.</P>
    <P>The offence of opening or tampering with postal packets is at section 84 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  The offence of intercepting telecommunications messages is at section 98 of the 1983 Act.  In the case of postal packets it is also an offence to disclose the extent or contents of the packet or to use for any purpose any information obtained from such a packet. In a case of telecommunications messages it is also an offence to disclose the existence, the substance or purport of any such message allegedly intercepted.</P>
    <P>The penalty for an offence under either section 84 or 98 of the 1983 Act is, on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to £50,000 or up to five years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>I would hope that Deputies would <Col N="1310" /> agree that the law governing illegal interception of telecommunications messages is adequate to control any abuses of the telecommunications network in that respect.  It would seem that the appropriate way of dealing with illegal interceptions of phones or postal packets is to criminalise the publications of any information obtained by that method or even disclosing the existence of such information. The 1983 Act deals with those points adequately.  Before leaving section 98 of the 1983 Act I would like to mention that it also gives the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications power to make regulations prohibiting the provision or operation of overhearing facilities in relation to any apparatus, including private branch telephone exchanges, connected to the Bord Telecom network.</P>
    <P>I turn now to interception by other means &mdash; for example, devices attached to walls, or as they are called, bugging devices.  Such devices that are used to monitor conversations are outside the scope of the Bill.  Under no stretch of the imagination could they be classified as devices that intercept postal packets or telecommunications.  Even if within the scope of this Bill, the Minister could not undertake to deal with them in this Bill because to do so would delay it further to an unacceptable extent.  It is a major and complex question that would require much consideration.  Indeed, if it is ever decided to attempt to tackle the subject legislatively, it would warrant a Bill of its own.</P>
    <P>If a device for eavesdropping on conversations was to fall within the definition of &ldquo;apparatus for wireless telegraphy&rdquo;, which I will deal with in another context in a moment, it would of course be an offence to have or to keep it without a licence.  Even if not covered by legislation &mdash; and because of the variety and type of devices potentially available and the complexity of the technology involved I do not intend to make any general comment on that &mdash; the circumstances in which bugging devices are used could involve a criminal act, for example, trespass or blackmail.  The constitutional <Col N="1311" /> right to privacy with regard to telephone conversations has been dealt with in the Kennedy/Arnold case and it could well be that what the court held in that case could be extrapolated to include intrusions into privacy by other means.</P>
    <P>Finally on this point, there is the question of intercepting cellular phones by way of what are called &ldquo;scanners&rdquo;.  I referred a moment ago to the meaning of the expression &ldquo;apparatus for wireless telegraphy&rdquo;.  Its meaning is inserted into the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, by the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.  It is a rather long and technical definition but the most salient feature of it is that it means an apparatus, capable of emitting and receiving, or emitting only or receiving only over paths which are not provided by any material substance, electric, magnetic or electromagnetic energy or communications, sounds, signs, visual images or signals.  It is an offence to keep or have in one's possession any such apparatus without a licence and the penalty on indictment is a fine of up to £20,000.  Any scanner that receives such signals, etc., which probably means all scanners, would fall within the definition of &ldquo;apparatus for wireless telegraphy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That definition is very wide and includes, for example, such household goods as television sets, although the penalty for having an unlicensed television is considerably less than £20,000. It would not be a function of this Bill to attempt to amend the definition of &ldquo;apparatus for wireless telegraphy&rdquo;, but even if it was it would hardly be a practical proposition given the complexity and ever changing nature of the technology involved.  I would maintain that control of such equipment by means of licensing, as at present, is more realistic, with substantial fines for keeping it or having it in one's possession without a licence or for using it contrary to the terms or conditions of the licence.</P>
    <P>In this context Deputies, in particular Deputy Kemmy, also referred to the recent incident concerning Deputy Bruton's car phone.  The Bill has been <Col N="1312" /> re-examined in the light of the recent controversy, and in the context of what the Bill set out to achieve it would appear no changes are necessary.  There is a crucial difference between the purpose of the Bill and the alleged incidents surrounding Deputy Bruton's car phone.  As I already explained, the Bill places on a statutory basis the conditions under which the existing power of the Minister for Justice to issue warrants authorising the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages is to be exercised and it regulates the procedure for the issue of authorisations.  In other words, it is concerned only with authorised interceptions.  The alleged interceptions of Deputy Bruton's car phone was not authorised and therefore has no direct implications for this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more about that incident as it is now the subject of a criminal investigation.  However, I am satisfied that no issue has been raised that is directly relevant to this Bill.  The issues are relevant, as I have already explained, to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, and other Department of Tourism, and of Communications legislation that deals with apparatus for wireless telegraphy.  If that Department are in any way concerned that arising from recent events legislation for which they are responsible needs to be amended, the Minister would consider using this Bill as a vehicle for any such amendments if technically and procedurally feasible.  However, no representations have been made to the Minister for such changes and as far as he is aware the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications have no proposal at present to amend the 1983 Act or the Wireless Telegraphy Acts in connection with interception of communications.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy thought it would be preferable for a judge to authorise interceptions rather than the Minister for Justice. The task of deciding whether a communication should be intercepted in particular circumstances or whether the security of the State is endangered is essentially an executive function and has <Col N="1313" /> been regarded as such by every Government since the foundation of the State. The Minister will have the advice and recommendation of a nominated officer of his Department to assist him in making such a decision.  A judge would not have this assistance.  It would be undesirable to involve the Judiciary directly in secret operations relating to the investigation of crime or the security of the State.  The more logical and reasonable approach is to have the authorisation issued by a member of the Executive and to have the oversight of the system carried out by a member of the Judiciary.  There are other pragmatic arguments against giving a judge power to authorise interceptions, but as I am basing my argument on principle I need not go into those here.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kemmy and Gilmore suggested that the reports of the designated judge should be presented to the Dáil. The position is that under section 8 (7) of the Bill the Taoiseach will in any case cause a copy of any report from the designated judge to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  If the Taoiseach considers after consultation with the judge that the publication of any matter in a report would be prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime or to the security of the State, he can exclude such matters and append a statement to that effect to the report.  In other words, if such matter were left in the report it would be prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime or to the security of the State.  If the judge reported direct to the Dáil he might feel inhibited in what he included in his report.  I am sure that Deputies, like me, will await with interest the reports of the designated judge. Deputy Gilmore wanted the report to include statistical information such as the number of authorisations granted.  It will be up to the judge to decide on how much statistical detail will be included in his reports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore was concerned about the expression &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo; He thought it too vague a criterion to justify interception.  The expression &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo; is not capable of precise definition as the circumstances in which <Col N="1314" /> State security may be endangered are infinitely varied.  It is one of those expressions that everyone knows what it means but if asked to define it in a few words would be unable to do so.  Any words or phrases that might be used in a definition would themselves require definition &mdash; for example, &ldquo;subversion&rdquo;, &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;, &ldquo;espionage&rdquo;.  It is also relevant to note that Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention uses the expression &ldquo;national security&rdquo; but does not define it.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter for the Minister to make a judgment, in the light of all the circumstances known to him and on the basis of the information supplied with an application for an authorisation on grounds of State security, whether the security of the State is in fact endangered. Section 5 sets out quite clearly the conditions that must be fulfilled before the Minister can issue an authorisation for interception in the interests of the security of the State.  Under section 5 (a) he must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that particular activities are being carried on or proposed to be carried on that are endangering or likely to endanger the security of the state.</P>
    <P>Thus, the criterion of security of the State is strictly limited by the conditions in section 5 which may be regarded as indirectly defining or circumscribing the expression.  Moreover, the question whether or not the security of the State was endangered and whether an application or authorisation on these grounds was justified will be open to review by the High Court judge designated under section 8.  Furthermore, the views of the judge as to the way in which the criterion was being applied would no doubt form part of his reports to the Taoiseach, who is required to place such reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is reasonable to say therefore that, while the expression &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo; is not formally defined, there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill to prevent any extreme or irrational interpretations of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore wanted assurances <Col N="1315" /> that there would be no abuses of the legislation.  The safeguards built into the scheme of authorised interceptions will ensure that no abuses can arise.  He also wanted the legislation to cover private individuals.  In so far as he is referring to illegal interceptions, I have already explained the existing law in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore was also concerned about giving the Defence Forces power to request a warrant for an interception. There is a distinction between the role of the Army and the Garda in ensuring the security of the State.  Generally in this area one senior Army officer is responsible for security matters in the Defence Forces and it is appropriate that he should be able to originate a request for a warrant if it is concerned with State security.  Any such request must be accompanied by a recommendation in writing from the Minister for Defence supporting the application.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely referred to equipment that unintentionally picked up other people's communications.  I think the existence of such equipment and other equipment with perfectly legitimate uses highlights the difficulties that would be faced by anyone trying to ban the sale of this type of modern equipment all the time coming on to the market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan wanted to know why the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; does not include listening or recording where one of the parties concerned in the conversation has consented to the listening or recording.  There are many examples of when a person might want his or her phone calls intercepted &mdash; for example, if he or she were being blackmailed or in a kidnapping.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter in his brief contribution referred to the urgent need for this legislation and the necessity for the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.  I have no doubt but that the Whips will deal with this matter in due course.  The Deputy said that the legislation should be enacted before a general election.  I can assure the Deputy that that time limit would give the Government almost 18 months, because I doubt very much that <Col N="1316" /> there will be a general election within the next 18 months.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate and I reiterate that the Bill has a very precise purpose. It is right up to date in that context.  But it is not the intention that the Bill should stray into the legislative territory of another Department unless, as I have already stated, that Department proposed amendments that could be technically and procedurally included in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From the earliest times, societies, kings and lords have addressed the issue of accountability &mdash; the obligation of officials or servants to answer for the responsibilities entrusted to them.  We are told that public accountability was highly developed in classical Athens, where it was a matter of pride and principle. Indeed the idea of accountability is probably as old as organised government itself.</P>
      <P>Aristotle, writing in the 4th century before Christ, said &ldquo;some officials handle large sums of public money; it is therefore necessary to have other officials to receive and examine these accounts. These inspectors must not administer funds themselves.&rdquo;  It would be difficult for anyone to argue with that statement today, more than 2,000 years on.  Again, in the parable of the talents, we find servants giving account of their stewardship and receiving due reward and punishment for their action and inaction.</P>
      <P>This Bill, then, which proposes the most far-reaching change in the statutory mandate of the Comptroller and Auditor General since the foundation of the State, deals with a very ancient but perennial problem of administration, that is, how best to render those holding public office accountable for the proper management and disposal of the resources entrusted to them.  In a democracy such as ours this accountability is ultimately to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General, as one of the great officers of State, has a crucial role to play in making this public accountability a reality.  There has since the foundation of the State been a very great increase in the volume and complexity of public expenditure and receipts and also in the number of different <Col N="1318" /> bodies administering public funds and other public resources.  There is an ever greater need therefore to ensure good administration in the bodies concerned. The public have to be assured that those receiving and spending substantial amounts of public money are rendered accountable in a full and effective manner.  In our system of government the Oireachtas, as the supreme legislative organ of State, appropriates the money needed for the public services.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's function is to assure the Dáil, as representing the public, that the conditions set down by the Legislature are complied with by those charged with the stewardship of this money.  This is why the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General is so important.</P>
    <P>This independence is assured by the fact that he holds a constitutional office, under Article 33 of the Constitution, which also sets down his basic responsibilities &mdash; to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, and to report to Dáil Éireann at stated periods as determined by law.  The Constitution also provides for appointment to and removal from the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the terms and conditions of the office to be determined by law.</P>
    <P>All substantive legislation relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General however, predates the Constitution, being contained in the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts, 1866 and 1921 and in the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923.  Such development as there has been in the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General since then has been on the basis of convention and practice.</P>
    <P>The principal development of this nature has been the acceptance that he has a function in identifying and reporting on instances where it appears to him that there has been loss or waste or uneconomic expenditure by Government Departments.  My Department have, for many years, supported the Comptroller <Col N="1319" /> and Auditor General in the exercise of this important non-statutory function. The latest development on this front has been the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent initiative of presenting reports on project audits &mdash; which focus on particular issues or areas of expenditure or revenue &mdash; together with his usual report on the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years or so, there have been ongoing developments in the practice of audit generally and, in particular, in relation to national audit.  There is now, of necessity, a much greater emphasis on what is broadly termed &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; in the public sector.  This is in addition to the traditional audit of accuracy and regularity which of course remains the cornerstone.  Indeed new techniques of computer scrutiny have given greater sophistication to this traditional process.</P>
    <P>In formulating this Bill, the Government undertook a comprehensive review of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, including an examination of developments in national auditing in other countries in recent years &mdash; particularly in those countries with a similar parliamentary tradition to our own.  I think everyone supports the view that legislation is now required to update the existing law and to modernise, on a statutory basis, the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, having regard to best international practice and our own national needs.  Thus I am introducing this Bill to consolidate and modernise existing legislative provisions; to make additional provision to extend the range and scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's scrutiny of public expenditure and the management of public resources in line with modern requirements; to provide for more effective arrangements for reporting by the Comptroller and Auditor General and to deal with other incidental and miscellaneous issues which now require attention.</P>
    <P>The White Paper published with this Bill gives a detailed account of the issues <Col N="1320" /> and the reasoning behind the measures proposed and the explanatory memorandum outlines the purpose of the individual provisions of what is necessarily a quite technical Bill.  On this account I do not think it necessary for me to speak at this Stage at great length on the detailed provisions of the Bill.  I want rather to focus on the intention of the Bill and on a number of its more significant features.</P>
    <P>The Bill consolidates and updates existing provisions in legislation relating to the constitutional role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, principally in regard to the comptroller function, section 2, and the auditor function, section 3.  As a natural extension of his audit function in regard to the Government accounts, it provides in section 4 for the audit by him of the finance accounts. Also, a number of incidental and ancillary provisions have been made, to which I will refer later.  But the two major new elements of the legislation relate to the nature of the audit process, and to the scope of that process.</P>
    <P>The nature of the audit process will be enhanced by the addition of a new statutory role for the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to value for money, section 9.  The examination of value for money may be broken down into the three &ldquo;Es&rdquo;, economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  While pocket definitions can be misleading &mdash; these concepts are inter-related and, in practice, cannot be so readily separated &mdash; I think that, with that caveat, it is helpful to give the essence of the concepts.  Economy relates to acquiring and using only the necessary resources at the least cost; efficiency means achieving the required output with the minimum of resources and effectiveness means that the outputs achieve the desired results.</P>
    <P>I must explain that regarding effectiveness, certain problems arise which do not apply in relation to economy and efficiency.  As my predecessor pointed out in this House on 14 March 1989, there are two areas which can cause concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>The first relates to the difficulty, in the public sector, of establishing the degree <Col N="1321" /> to which changes in an area or sector affected by a programme are the results of that programme, since, in real life, programmes do not generally have a single objective with readily quantifiable results.  What is most important, however, is that Departments and other bodies should have the necessary systems in place to enable them to appraise the effectiveness of their own operations in achieving policy objectives.</P>
    <P>The second area relates to the link which exists between judgments on effectiveness and judgments on policy.  The formulation of policy is the responsibility of Government and Ministers are answerable to the Dáil for policy matters in their Departments.  National auditors in most countries would accept that it is not their business to examine policy and that they have no role in this regard.  The problem is that when examining effectiveness in practice it can easily happen that questions arise as to the merits of the objectives of programmes being examined as well as on the basis of validity or suitability of the programme itself.  Thus an auditor could very easily find himself being drawn into considering whether the objectives of a programme were reasonable in the first place and, directly or by inference, expressing opinions on the merits of the policy on which the objectives were based.  If it were to happen that the Comptroller and Auditor General was in this way to be drawn into dealing with matters which belong to the political arena, his independence, and consequently his effectiveness, could be undermined.  Here again, the important consideration is that it is the responsibility of Departments and other bodies to have the necessary systems in place to enable them to appraise the effectiveness of their own operations.</P>
    <P>This consideration has been the central one determining the Government's approach to examinations by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to effectiveness.  The Bill provides, therefore, that the Comptroller and Auditor General may, at his discretion, examine and report on the economy and efficiency of Departments and <Col N="1322" /> bodies, which will be expected to have in place the necessary systems for carrying out such appraisal of effectiveness so as to provide Ministers and management with the necessary information to take any corrective or policy action which may be indicated.  Such systems will be subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In this way the danger of the Comptroller and Auditor General becoming involved, directly or indirectly, in the area of policy is avoided while, at the same time, the Dáil and the public have a reliable and independent assurance that evaluation of the effectiveness of expenditure is not being neglected.  It will be noted that the power to examine the three &ldquo;Es&rdquo; is discretionary while the normal financial audit is mandatory.  This distinction is necessary because it would not be possible for the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out every year a value for money examination in every body he audits.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit will be extended to cover all the non-commercial State bodies not already statutorily audited by him, and a number of other bodies, principally in the education sector, section 5.  These bodies are listed in the First Schedule.  Also the health boards and the vocational education committees will be audited by him, sections 6 and 7.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will, in addition, be empowered to examine funds under the aegis of bodies which he audits, and with appropriate ministerial approval, subsidiaries of such bodies. The two main categories not coming within the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit are local authorities and commercial State bodies.  In the case of the former there is already accountability to elected local representatives while the activities of the latter come under the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  To involve the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts in reviewing these categories would represent unnecessary duplication of accountability.  It should be mentioned <Col N="1323" /> that the local government auditors' reports are made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General and in his report on the Appropriation Accounts he may draw attention to any matters in the local government auditors' reports which he considers to be significant.</P>
    <P>A further very important extension of the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's operations will be the introduction of a new statutory power of discretionary inspection, section 8.  He will be able to inspect and report on the accounts, books and records of commercial harbour authorities, the regional tourism organisations and any body, other than a commercial State body or a local authority, in respect of any year in which it received 50 per cent or more of its gross receipts directly from Departments or from the Central Fund, to check that public moneys have been spent for the purposes for which they were provided. This power of inspection is quite distinct from his power of audit.  He will not be auditing the accounts of the bodies which he will inspect, and these bodies will continue to have their own auditors as at present.  The purpose of this power is to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to follow public funds as far as may be necessary so that he can satisfy himself, and assure the Dáil, that they have been correctly appropriated.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures I have already outlined, which represent the major policy content of the Bill, a number of incidental and ancillary provisions have been included.  Many of these are of a consolidation nature; they are explained in the White Paper and in the explanatory memorandum and there is no need for me to deal with them at length here, but I will mention the more notable innovations and changes involved.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the Comptroller and Auditor General, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to charge fees in respect of audits, inspections and examinations carried out by him.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the appointment <Col N="1324" /> by the Comptroller and Auditor General of a suitably qualified independent person to audit on his behalf the Appropriation Account for his office and, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to examine his office in regard to economy, efficiency and management effectiveness.  For constitutional reasons, that person's report will be appended to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the Appropriation Account of his office.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the transfer of staff from the Office of the Minister for the Environment to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General as audits are transferred from the Local Government Audit Service to the Comptroller and Auditor General consequent on the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 19 sets out, for the first time in statutory form, the duty of accounting officers to give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to regularity and propriety, economy and efficiency, management effectiveness and matters arising from special reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that different provisions of the Bill can be brought into effect at different times by ministerial order.  The large amount of new work passing to the Comptroller and Auditor General under this Bill will have to be introduced on a phased basis.  I want to assure the House that it is the Government's intention to bring the different provisions of this Bill into effect with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>Other sections provide for repeal of obsolete legislation and consolidation of existing measures so that we will have a comprehensive piece of modern legislation covering the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the close and complementary relationship which exists between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Heretofore the Committee of Public Accounts' terms of reference related specifically to the examination of the appropriation accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's <Col N="1325" /> reports thereon.  The committee functions by calling the accounting officers of Departments to give evidence to them, thereby ensuring accountability to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The important work which the Committee of Public Accounts do will now be adjusted to correspond to the extended role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The White Paper sets down the revised terms of reference of the committee which the Government will propose to the Dáil after this Bill has been enacted.  The committee's role will be extended to cover all audits, examinations and inspections carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>For the first time, then, the committee will be given a focal role in examining the accounts of all the non-commercial State bodies, the health boards, the vocational education committees, and certain other educational and academic institutions.  In addition, the Committee of Public Accounts will examine on behalf of the Dáil the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports on his examinations of economy, efficiency and management effectiveness and on inspections he has carried out on bodies which receive 50 per cent or more of their revenue directly from Government Departments, as well as regional tourism organisations and the commercial harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, for the first time the duties of accounting officers in giving evidence before the Committee of Public Accounts will be set down in legislation.  This accountability will complement the additional powers proposed for the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to Government accounts, and for the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>At this point it is timely for me to express my appreciation of the valuable and important work which the Committee of Public Accounts do on behalf of this House.  I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the along term interest and support of the Chairman of the Committee, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for the work which is coming to fruition in this Bill.  In particular, the recommendations <Col N="1326" /> of the committee in their Special Report on the Future Role of the Comptroller and Auditor General have contributed to the development of the ideas set out in the White Paper and embodied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns among staff of the Local Government Audit Service about the implications for them of the transfer of certain audits to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I would like to reassure them that the proposals will not result in a situation whereby staff in that service will be left high and dry in the new audit environment. The basic approach will be that staff will be transferred to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office at the time the work is being transferred.  There will be a much greater degree of co-operation and co-ordination between the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and the Local Government Audit Service.  The Bill will cause no diminution of work, in terms of quality and quantity, for auditors.  My Department will be available to discuss with the relevant unions any concerns the staff may have.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe that this Bill will result in a more effective scrutiny of public expenditure with greater emphasis on value for money and the efficient use of resources in Departments and bodies supported by public funds.  This will ensure a more comprehensive public accountability, thereby contributing to a more economical and effective public service &mdash; in short, better value for the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I have relentlessly pursued the introduction of this legislation over a number of years.  I have probably been identified with seeking its introduction more than any other Member of this House.  Therefore, I welcome it.  However, as we have an adversarial system, it would be remiss of me if I did not point out during my contribution, which in general welcomes this measure, what I consider to be the shortcomings in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will consider sending the Bill to the Committee of Public Accounts for Committee Stage <Col N="1327" /> and allowing that committee to convert to a legislative committee for that purpose. If he does so I can assure him that the Bill will be treated with absolute fairness and his rights as Minister will not be interfered with in anyway.</P>
      <P>The last major legislation affecting the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General was the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866, which was introduced by Gladstone who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The Estimates for the Civil Services of the then United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland totalled £7 million in that year.  In any given year now Exchequer expenditure, including debt servicing, would exceed £15 billion. One per cent of £15 billion is £150 million. Are any of us so optimistically confident in the system that we cannot suspect at least 1 per cent of wasteful spending?  Could the amount be much higher?  The volume, complexity and variety of Government financial transactions have multiplied enormously over the years given that the State spends the equivalent of about two-thirds of GNP.</P>
      <P>The independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General is enshrined in the 1937 Constitution.  He is appointed by the President in a manner akin to the appointment of a High Court judge, on the nomination of the Government with the approval of the Dáil.  He may be removed from office only for stated mis-behaviour and then only by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Having been given this constitutional independence he was then left dependent on tools shaped in mid-Victorian times.  In recent years the Committee of Public Accounts have encouraged the Comptroller and Auditor General to take a growing interest in value for money, VFM, and not simply regulatory audits. The Department of Finance have facilitated this to a great extent though on a non-statutory basis until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 the Committee of Public Accounts appointed the Advisory Group on Public Financial Accountability under my chairmanship and with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the immediate <Col N="1328" /> past President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Chief Executive of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Director of the Institute of Public Administration as members.  That advisory group met on several occasions, interviewed Irish and foreign witnesses and looked at a number of models of parliamentary accountability abroad before reporting in a timely fashion to the Committee of Public Accounts who examined the group before endorsing the report and presenting it to Dáil Éireann.  That report was debated by the Dáil in 1988 and many of its recommendations are contained in the current legislation.  I would not like to let the occasion pass without paying tribute to the people who served on the advisory group, at no expense to the State.  They did sterling work in preparing that report for the committee.</P>
    <P>Essentially the Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee should have the power to pursue public moneys wherever they saw fit, including grants to private individuals or companies whether directly or indirectly through the Exchequer.  They recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have the statutory power to carry out value for money audits based on economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  Though the legislation allows for economy and efficiency audits, it has restricted him to examining the systems, procedures and practices employed by Departments for evaluating the effectiveness of their operations rather than allowing him evaluate whether a programme is effective.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the three &ldquo;E's&rdquo;, a polio vaccination programme would be measured for economy by whether the vaccine was purchased at the most economic price consistent with quality; efficiency would be considered by measuring the number of shots per vaccine purchased against the optimum number which should be achieved; and effectiveness would be measured by the incidence of polio, whether the problem was controlled or reduced?  The Department <Col N="1329" /> feel that it is not the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to question policy decisions, hence the terminology used in the legislation in relation to effectiveness. I believe that both the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General can live with this restriction.  However, the committee's recommendation that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have the power to pursue all public expenditure is restricted to pursuing expenditure which has been received directly from the Exchequer, that is, not via a State agency.  In addition the Comptroller and Auditor General will be given power to audit all non-commercial State agencies, including the IDA, and the Public Accounts Committee remit is being extended to cover all these agencies which will have to send witnesses to appear before the committee.</P>
    <P>The Committee's recommendation that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be relieved of the audit of commercial State bodies but should continue to have inspection rights for all such bodies has not been accepted by the Government and it is proposed to relieve him of the remaining commercial audits which he undertakes.  In future everything audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be subject to the Public Accounts Committee's examination. This is to be extended, as was recommended, to include vocational education committees and health boards and, in addition, hospitals which receive over 50 per cent of funding directly from the State.</P>
    <P>These developments in so far as they go are welcome but the Comptroller and Auditor General should have inspection rights in respect of commercial State bodies where he feels that the public interest is involved.  I will cite a couple of examples.  In Northern Ireland when the De Lorean factory was established the Public Accounts Committee in Britain and the Comptroller and Auditor General under the National Audit Act, 1983, which replaced the 1866 Act in Britain, pursued the matter and inquired into the funds De Lorean received.  That was a <Col N="1330" /> perfectly proper exercise.  The Public Accounts Committee were not reviewing the commercial efficiency of the company but were examining the probity, integrity and correctness of the expenditure made.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General should continue to have inspection rights for that purpose.  One of the members of the board of Telecom apparently took a decision to commission a report on the privatisation of Telecom.  Privatisation is a decision to sell a State asset and it relates to more than the commercial running of the company involved.  It is the same as selling a couple of ships or any other assets such as buildings which the State might own.  The Comptroller and Auditor General would inquire as to whether these assets when sold realised reasonable value for the State.  The sale of shares would be similar, or any report on a proposal to commission the sale of shares.  Anything which the State might reasonably expect to obtain from the sale of an asset should fall within his remit. He will never know about such matters unless he has inspection rights.  The Bill is weak in this respect, There should be provision for inspection rights, not to oversee commercial operations but to ensure financial probity, correctness in expenditure and the absence of fraud. Anything which might take from or reduce the State's potential revenue should fall correctly within his terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It should be mentioned in passing that the Comptroller's function is not being changed in any way.  The Department of Finance must seek the approval of the Comptroller and Auditor General before they can draw moneys from the Exchequer.  He will grant this automatically by certifying that the Dáil has voted money for that purpose, once he is assured that this is the case.  This is normally automatic, but it is an important financial control which should continue.</P>
    <P>The changes being made relate essentially to the role of the Auditor General. While I welcome them, I wish to compare the Public Accounts Committee's special report with the White Paper and Bill published by the Government and to put <Col N="1331" /> on record where the Public Accounts Committee's recommendations have been accepted or not accepted, or accepted in part, or not addressed by the legislation.  For anybody reading this debate in the future it is important that those variations should be put on the record.</P>
    <P>PAC recommended that the committee should be consulted before the name of the appointee for Comptroller and Auditor General is put before the Dáil by the Government.  This has not been accepted.  I do not understand the reason.  In Britain the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee virtually appoints the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Prime Minister is the person who brings forward the nomination but he virtually leaves it to the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. The report did not suggest that this should happen here but it suggested that the committee should be consulted. The Comptroller and Auditor General is the only constitutional officer who works directly for this House, not for the Executive. That is an important distinction. I will not always be a member of the committee or its chairman but I believe the committee should be consulted, even on an informal basis, before the Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed.  The Government have not accepted that recommendation in the Bill and the White Paper.  The Government's view is that they do not consider this necessary since the members of the Public Accounts Committee as Members of the Dáil are already involved in the nomination process.  It seems we are prepared to empower anybody bar the Dáil and we are the Dáil.  We should seek to change this.  I hope the Minister will consider putting in place an informal process whereby the views of the PAC will be considered before the appointment of a Comptroller and Auditor General.  The committee also recommended that the appointment and removal provisions in the 1923 Act should be brought into line with the Constitution.  This has been accepted.  The proposed action is contained <Col N="1332" /> in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill. It is proposed to repeal provisions in the 1923 Act and let the Constitution serve as statutory backing.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation by the Public Accounts Committee was that the retiring age for the Comptroller and Auditor General should be 65.  This has been accepted and the proposed action is in section 15 (6) (a) of the Bill.  The retirement age of 65 is to be stipulated in the new Act for future Comptroller and Auditors General.</P>
    <P>The fourth recommendation by the committee is that the Comptroller and Auditor General should take the views of the Public Accounts Committee into account when drawing up his work programme. This was not addressed in the White Paper but I am assured by the Comptroller and Auditor General that it is accepted in principle.  I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General will suggest an annual meeting with the Public Accounts Committee dedicated to listening to the committee's proposals prior to finalising his annual audit plan.  That is a proper way of proceeding.</P>
    <P>The fifth recommendation that the Department of Finance powers of direction to the Comptroller and Auditor General should be terminated has been accepted and the proposed action is outlined in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill. The offending sections in Acts are to be repealed.</P>
    <P>The sixth recommendation is that the Public Accounts Committee should have a central role in determining the Estimate for the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.  This has not been accepted. The Government's view in the White Paper is that Article 28.4 of the Constitution makes it clear that it is the task of the Government alone to prepare Estimates each year and submit them to the Dáil for consideration.  They state that the adoption of the Public Accounts Committee recommendation would in effect introduce practice or convention which would lead to a <i>de facto</i> position where the Government would become merely the conduit for the presentation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's <Col N="1333" /> Estimate to the House.  In Britain, because the Comptroller and Auditor General is Parliament's officer, it is the Public Accounts Committee which presents directly to Parliament the Estimate for the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.  The committee accept that the Minister for Finance has a constitutional role in this regard and that he must present the Estimate, but it recommended that the committee should present the Estimate to the Department. The Minister would not become a conduit because he could change the Estimate if he wished.  It would be up to the Public Accounts Committee to let the House know that the Comptroller and Auditor General's Estimate had been changed and to seek explanations for that.  It made these recommendations because, theoretically we cannot make the Comptroller and Auditor General independent, tell him to go after wasteful spending and act on behalf of this House if a Department of State can circumvent his independence by managing his budget.  The Committee of Public Accounts is an all-party committee made up of six Members of Fianna Fáil, four Members of Fine Gael, one Member of Labour and one Member of The Democratic Left.  It never divides on a party political basis.  There are a number of safeguards and the Minister would have the last word on bringing the Estimate into the House.  I do not see why that recommendation has not been accepted.</P>
    <P>If we are to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General proper powers of audit then he should be given a proper budget and at the outset the Public Accounts Committee should have an input into the budget he is given so that if necessary we can hire professional services to assist him in that regard.</P>
    <P>The seventh recommendation was that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have flexibility regarding staffing and remuneration matters.  This has been partially accepted.  The Government views are in the White Paper at paragraph 4.9 and are as follows:</P>
    <P>...exemptions from the disciplines <Col N="1334" /> applying generally to the Exchequer-financed agencies could over time result in grading and pay levels which would themselves involve additional expenditure and because of the inevitable demonstration effect would have very expensive repercussions elsewhere in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The proposed action is in the same paragraph of the White Paper, 4.9:</P>
    <P>...having regard to the arrangements for delegated administrative budgets in Departments, the Minister for Finance will explore with the C &amp; AG the extent to which some additional flexibility in the allocation of resources might be introduced within the limits of agreed budgets for administrative costs. </P>
    <P>The eighth recommendation was that the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office would be taken by an external auditor.  The Government's view is in section 13 of the Bill and at paragraph 4.8 of the White Paper.  It is that the Constitution requires the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit all accounts of budgets administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and that on this basis the legislation will make provision for the appointment of an external auditor by the Comptroller and Auditor General to undertake the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.  I think that is a reasonable compromise in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>The ninth recommendation was that the format of the finance accounts should be revised and they should be audited before submission to the Oireachtas.  This has been accepted and the proposed action is in section 4 of the Bill and paragraph 3.3 of the White Paper.  It deals with the format of finance accounts already revised to the satisfaction of the Committee of Public Accounts and to the satisfaction of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It says that the legislation will make provision for the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the accounts and their submission to the Oireachtas.  That is a welcome development because what the <Col N="1335" /> Comptroller and Auditor General has been doing up to now is auditing the various parts of the finance accounts but not the final finance accounts themselves.</P>
    <P>The tenth recommendation is that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be relieved of responsibility for audit of commercial semi-State bodies.  The proposed action is contained in the White Paper at paragraph 3.6 and has been accepted, but the legislation will not provide for the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit of commercial State-sponsored bodies with the exception of Temple Bar Properties Ltd., which is statutorily audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and whose financial audit will continue to be performed by him.</P>
    <P>The eleventh recommendation is that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be given access inspection rights, with reporting responsibility to Dáil Éireann, in the case of commercial State-sponsored bodies and such reports should be subject to examination and report by the committee of Public Accounts.  This has not been accepted.  The Government's view is contained in section 8 (3) of the Bill and at paragraph 3.6 of the White Paper.  I have already made my point about this.  I fail to understand why this has not been accepted.  I hope that will be recognised and that the Comptroller and Auditor General would have inspection rights.  For example, in a De Lorean type affair, if De Lorean had located in the Republic rather than in Northern Ireland we would not have been able to pursue it at Public Accounts Committee level whereas the Public Accounts Committee in Britain were able to pursue it.  I am not referring to the commercial running of any agency but to the use of public funds.  In my view that is perfectly within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The twelfth recommendation is that the audit of non-commercial State sponsored bodies should continue to be the responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General reporting to Dáil <Col N="1336" /> Éireann and such reports should be subject to examination and report by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This has been accepted.  The proposed action is in section 5 (1) of the Bill and at paragraph 3.4 of the White Paper and the legislation provides for the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit all non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>The thirteenth recommendation is that the Comptroller an Auditor General should examine the feasibility of using private sector auditors for the financial audit of State-sponsored bodies.  The Government accepted this and the proposed action is at section 16 (2) of the Bill.  The legislation will provide for the appointment of agents by the Comptroller and Auditor General to undertake audits.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The fourteenth recommendation is that there should be an audit report on all State-sponsored bodies to Dáil Éireann over and above the normal audit opinion or certificate.  This was partially accepted. The Government's view is in the White Paper at paragraph 3.12.  It says that the Comptroller and Auditor General reporting on commercial State-sponsored bodies is inappropriate.  The proposed action is in the Bill at section 11 (2) (a) (ii) and in the White Paper at paragraph 3.12.  It says that legislation will enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to prepare reports on general matters arising from his audits that this would facilitate the preparation of special reports on non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I think we could live with that.</P>
    <P>The fifteenth recommendation is that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have access inspection rights in all cases where (a) the State provides 50 per cent or more of the body's capital funding, or (b) the body receives 50 per cent or more of its annual revenues or sums in excess of a specified amount directly or indirectly from the State, that he should report his findings to Dáil Éireann and that such reports should be subject to examination and report by the Committee of Public Accounts.  That recommendation was not accepted.  The <Col N="1337" /> Government's view, set out in section 8 (3) of the Bill and in paragraph 3.6 of the White Paper, is that the Comptroller and Auditor General's inspection rights should not cover bodies which receive 50 per cent or more of their capital funding form the State, presumably because this would encompass commercial State-sponsored bodies.  It has been partially accepted because in section 8 (1) of the Bill and at paragraph 3.10 of the White Paper it says that legislation will provide for the Comptroller and Auditor General's inspection of bodies which receive 50 per cent or more of their annual income directly from the State.  In the White Paper at paragraph 3.11 it says that as regards bodies which receive 50 per cent or more of their annual income indirectly from the State, the Government consider:</P>
    <P>that the C &amp; AG should, in the context of his proposed wider remit, concentrate his efforts on the arrangements within those agencies [which are providing the funds] for monitoring the operations of bodies receiving grants.  Should it be necessary, the Government will be prepared to review this aspect again in the light of experience gained over the next few years. </P>
    <P>Say, for example, the State directly funds some health projects.  But then, instead of doing that, we create a health agency and put the money into that agency which in turn pays it on to another body.  The Comptroller and Auditor General cannot then audit it.  The Health Education Bureau was an agency that came under the Department.  It was out of the Department and the funding of the agen-Department; and the funding of the agencies it funded was no different than it would have been if the money came directly from the Department.  Yet under the provisions of this Bill unless the money comes directly from the Department or the Exchequer, either through a direct grant from the Department or a direct grant form the Central Fund, the Comptroller and Auditor General will not have audit rights.  That is something <Col N="1338" /> which I consider to be a weakness in the Bill that should be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The sixteenth recommendation was that the audit of non-directly elected local or regional authorities should be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General with a reporting responsibility to Dáil Éireann and that such reports should be subject to examination and report by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This has been accepted and the proposed action is in sections 6 and 7 of the Bill and at paragraph 3.5 of the White Paper. Legislation provides for the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit health boards and vocational education committees with reporting responsibility to the Oireachtas.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will have inspection rights rather than audit rights in relation to commercial harbour authorities and regional tourism authorities.  Their audit will continue to be performed by the local government audit service.</P>
    <P>There is a situation where the Comptroller and Auditor General is being given inspection rights.  Should the Comptroller and Auditor General not be given the same inspection rights in respect of commercial State bodies so that he need not get involved if there is no reason for him to do so? If he suspects that something is wrong should he not have the right to look at the accounts?</P>

      <P>It is not just a question of their performance but rather what happened in terms of financial accountability and the diminution in the value of the State's assets in relation to the shares held in that company.  This goes beyond the question of effectiveness to one of <Col N="1339" /> strict financial accountability.  In those circumstances the inspection rights being given to the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to harbour boards and regional tourism authorities should be extended to cover commercial State bodies so that he would be enabled to present a report to the House if he felt it was necessary to do so.  It does not mean that he would inspect their accounts every year but at least he would have the right to do so.</P>
      <P>Recommendation No. 17 of the committee was that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be given access inspection rights in directly elected local authorities in respect of moneys provided by central Government and that he should report to Dáil Éireann on how these moneys are used and that such reports should be subject to examination and report by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This recommendation was not accepted and the Government's view is set out in section 8 (3) of the Bill and paragraph 3.5 of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that public accountability requirements would be met by strengthening and formalising existing liaison arrangements between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service in order to facilitate closer oversight of Exchequer funding to directly elected local authorities.  I accept that this is a reasonable way to proceed.  Indeed, since the report of the Committee of Public Accounts was presented there has been greater co-operation between the Local Government Auditor and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As a matter of practice, the Department of the Environment make the Local Government Auditor's reports available to the Comptroller and Auditor General and he draws the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts to any matters he considers necessary.  I accept that directly elected local authorities are in a different position because there is a body to which they are accountable.  Provided that the working arrangements can be <Col N="1340" /> strengthened as suggested that is a reasonable way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts suggested in recommendation No. 18 that the possibility of a Local Government Audit Commission headed by the Comptroller and Auditor General should be looked at separately by the committee but they have not followed this recommendation up because it has been overtaken by events.  For instance, the relationship between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Auditor has been strengthened and this arrangement seems to be working quite well.  This should lead to any difficulties being overcome.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 19 was that there should be no change in the operation of the Comptroller function.  As I said, this recommendation has been accepted and this matter is addressed in section 2 of the Bill and paragraph 4.3 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 20 was that the financial and regularity audit should remain as an important feature of the Comptroller and Auditor General's work.  This has also been accepted and is dealt with in section 3 (1) and (5) of the Bill and paragraph 2.1 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 21 was that there should be a structured development of the internal audit function within Government Departments.  This recommendation has been accepted.  I have been informed that action has already been taken in this regard consequent on the Comptroller and Auditor General's project audit report on internal audit in central Government.  This is a welcome development because an internal audit is every bit as important as an external audit.  The hand of the external auditor would be strengthened if he knew that there were sound systems in place.  The development of the Institute of Internal Auditors, many of whom are employed in the public sector, is welcome because they, in turn, encourage standards of excellence in relation to internal audits and this can only be to the benefit of the taxpayer and the public in general.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> Recommendation No. 22 was that the dates for the annual submission and audit of accounts should be brought forward. This has been accepted and is dealt with in section 3 (9) and (11) of the Bill and paragraph 4.7 of the White Paper.  Legislation will provide for submission of Appropriation Accounts by 31 March and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report thereon to Dáil Éireann by 30 September, compared with the current dates of 30 April and 31 October, respectively. It is a good idea to bring the dates forward.  However it would be difficult to bring the date forward any further than 30 September because the Comptroller and Auditor General has to wait for the books to be closed and presented to him. This must now be done by the end of March and this gives him six months to complete his audit.  This is a big undertaking but it would be a substantial improvement if the audit reports could be presented within nine months of the closing date.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 23 was that a system of interim reporting by the Comptroller and Auditor General to Dáil Éireann should be introduced.  This has been accepted in principle and is dealt with in section 11 (2) of the Bill and paragraphs 3.12 and 4.5 of the White Paper.  I am of the view that once the Comptroller and Auditor General completes his report and places it in the Library it should automatically be sent to the Committee of Public Accounts. However very often we find that a dozen interim reports are listed on the Order Paper waiting for someone to move a motion so that they can be sent to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We should make it a general rule that they should be sent to the Committee of Public Accounts once the Comptroller and Auditor General presents his report.  I understand that this will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 24 is that official Comptroller and Auditor General queries should be answered by Departments within a month of their issue.  This recommendation has not been addressed.  This can be regarded as an internal administration matter which does not require <Col N="1342" /> legislation but I would remind the House and the Minister that this recommendation has been made.  Departments should be required to adhere to this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 25 was that a more structured approach to VFM audit using audit based methodologies should be employed.  This has been accepted by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The project audits undertaken on a pilot basis employed a structured methodology.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 26 was that value for money audits should include matters relating to effectiveness as well as economy and efficiency but not to the extent of questioning the merits of policy objectives.  This has been partially accepted.  As I said, the Government's view is contained in section 9 of the Bill and in paragraphs 2.3-2.7 of the White Paper.  Their view is that there is no problem with economy and efficiency aspect of VFM audit.  However, the legislation will provide that the Comptroller and Auditor General's role in relation to effectiveness will be to examine the systems, procedures and practices employed by the Department or organisation concerned for evaluating the effectiveness of their operations rather than himself carrying out the examination of whether a programme of expenditure is effective. I referred to this matter earlier and think that this is something both the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General can live with.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 27 was that value for money audit should be applied to all organisations in the State, semi-State and local government sectors.  This has been accepted and is dealt with in section 9 of the Bill and paragraph 2.2 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 28 was that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be given a statutory mandate for value for money audit.  This has been accepted and is dealt with in section 9 of the Bill and paragraph 2.2 of the White Paper. Legislation will provide the statutory basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> Recommendation No. 29 was that value for money audit reports should be made to Dáil Éireann on an individual basis.  This recommendation has been accepted and is dealt with in section 11 (2) (a) of the Bill and paragraph 4.5 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 30 was that the chairman of the committee should nominate a deputy chairman on an informal basis.  This is an internal matter for the committee and has been addressed.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 31 was that the role and status of the chairman of the committee should be addressed.  This has not been addressed in the Bill or the White Paper.  I cannot act as a judge in my own cause but I should say as someone who does not expect to be chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts forever that the role of the chairmen of committees of this House should be strengthened.  It is time that we started taking ourselves more seriously.  Is it any wonder that the Gleeson Commission had the temerity to come up with the recommendations they made when we do not take ourselves seriously?  I presume they now expect this house to rubber stamp those recommendations and implement them.  I fail to understand the reason chairmen of committees of this House are not properly resourced because they are not in conflict with the Executive.  There seems to be a fear within Government Departments that if we were to do this the House might start doing its jobs as a House of Representatives. Is it not time we started to do that?  Committees should be properly resourced and required to give an account of their stewardship.  That matter is not addressed in the legislation or the White Paper.  That recommendation was made unanimously by the advisory group, which included all the external personnel I mentioned, was endorsed by the Committee of Public Accounts and debated in this House.  Everybody in this House will accept that the chairmen of committees should be encouraged to take a fuller and more active role in the work they do for this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> The report recommends that membership of the Committee should automatically lapse in the case of a member failing to attend six consecutive meetings. This is a matter for Standing Orders and is not addressed in the White Paper or the Bill.  Another recommendation is that the committee should be empowered to appoint sub-committees &mdash; neither is this matter addressed in the White Paper, or the Bill.  In the past the committee have appointed sub-committees although it is not one of their terms of reference.  Perhaps it should be included in the terms of reference in case the committee wish to appoint sub-committees from time to time.  The report recommends that staff should be subject to direction and under the day-to-day supervision of the committee and their chairman.  That matter is not addressed in the White Paper or the Bill.  It should be dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. In practice I have an excellent working relationship with the staff of the Committee of Public Accounts and I am satisfied with the arrangements, but I believe that close co-operation between the staff and the committee is very important.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the committee is (a) the functions of the former Committee on Public Expenditure should be assigned to the Committee of Public Accounts and (b) the committee should be empowered to review any agency or body who receive substantial funds from the State.  Part (a) of that recommendation is not addressed in the White Paper or the Bill, whereas part (b) is partially accepted &mdash; in section 19 (1) of the Bill and paragraph 4.11 of the White Paper.  It is suggested that a review of the committee's powers correspond to the audit and inspection rights of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  By and large I accept that, but where the committee believe that there is misappropriation of State expenditure by whatever body, they should be empowered to send for persons, papers and records and to compel attendance of the people involved to find out whether or not the suspicions are well founded.</P>
    <P>The committee recommend that their <Col N="1345" /> reports, when adopted, should be automatically laid before the Dáil and published and that there should be a fixed time limit for response by the Minister for Finance to committee reports.  It has been accepted that the reports be laid before the Dáil and published but the matter of the response by the Minister has not been addressed.  Whereas reports, once they have been presented to the Dáil and published, come back in a reasonable period, there should be an obligation on the Minister to respond within a fixed period to the findings of the committee.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends that the committee should have discretion to seek Dáil debates on their reports.  That matter is not addressed in the White Paper or the Bill.  It should be considered in reform of the House and in the proposals to be put before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It appears likely that the committee will issue a number of interim reports during the year rather than just the annual report.  If the committee believe that a particular report should be drawn to the attention of the Houses and debated, they should have the discretion to seek Dáil debates on such a report.  I am not suggesting that this should be done all the time but bearing in mind that the House is the parent body of the committee, if the committee believe that the attention of the House should be brought to a certain matter, they should be empowered to do so.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation is that the committee should be empowered to extend privilege to witnesses appearing before them.  No decision has been made on that matter.  The White Paper states that the issue of parliamentary privilege, which should also apply to other Oireachtas committees, is under consideration. This matter needs to be addressed.  I can understand that the question might arise as to what one would do in the event of abuses of this privilege. That matter was addressed in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts and we also sought the opinion of senior counsel.  I suggest that we proceed as <Col N="1346" /> outlined in the oaths Act, that is, with the authorisation of the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach.  An Oireachtas committee can administer an oath to any witness appearing before them.  I understand that at the committee dealing with the Limerick Markets Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;evidence was taken under oath.  Perhaps I am wrong but I think that was the case.  The oaths Act empowers the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad to confer on a committee the right to hear evidence under oath.  Similarly, in relation to privilege it may be possible for us to empower the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach to confer on a committee the right to hear evidence under privilege and where that privilege is abused to withdraw that right.  The committee set out ways in which this might be done.  It is important that it be done not just because people appearing before the committee might feel they cannot give certain information because the meetings are held in public and are reported but if accounting officers, who are practically the only witnesses to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts, say something which is a slip of the tongue and it has implications for people outside the House they have only a limited privilege; they do not have full privilege as have members of the committee.  That matter needs to be considered to ensure that accounting officers and witnesses appearing before committees are protected and that committees are effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another recommendation of the report is that the committee should draw up and publish an annual work programme. The proposed action, contained in paragraph 4.11 of the White Paper, is that the revised terms of reference for the Committee of Public Accounts include a provision that the committee shall present to Dáil Éireann progress report on their activities and plans.  At the beginning of the year I as chairman sit down with the staff of the committee and set out a draft plan.  This is brought to the <Col N="1347" /> attention of the committee for approval and it is amended as necessary during the year.  This is something the committee should be required to do and I welcome its inclusion in the White Paper.  The final recommendation of the report is that the committee should be given extended terms of reference.  That recommendation has been partially accepted.</P>
    <P>There are strengths and weaknesses in the legislation.  Substantial progress has been made but mostly in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Progress has not been made to the extent we would have wished in relation to the Committee of Public Accounts.  This legislation is a signal move with which I am happy to be identified.  It seems strange that in this day and age when we as a Parliament empower tribunals, court-appointed and ministerial-appointed inspectors and so on to carry out inquiries but do not empower ourselves to do so, it is no wonder that Gleeson made such recommendations. Under the Constitution this House is the House of representatives; it is not just a Legislature.  In all other parliamentary democracies, committees of the House of Representatives are empowered to compel the attendance of witnesses &mdash; and severe penalties may be imposed for non-attendance &mdash; in order to pursue inquiries.  We have power to give our committees that same standing, but why do we refuse to do so?  We refuse to do it because there is an over-concentration of authority in church and State affairs. It is time for greater parliamentary democracy and accountability.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts published a very difficult report without dividing on a party basis in Carysfort at no additional cost to the State and that committee &mdash; and other committees of the House &mdash; could have carried out many other inquiries in relation to Greencore, Telecom and others.  It will cost a great deal more to publish some of the reports we are getting than if they had been prepared by committees of this House.  The fees being charged for these reports &mdash; outside this House &mdash; would <Col N="1348" /> make anybody blush and there is no reason committees of this House could not conduct inquiries and present these reports.  As a House we have allowed ourselves to be dictated to and controlled outside it.  Instead of the Executive being a committee of this House &mdash; it is no more than that, albeit the most powerful committee set down in the Constitution &mdash; the committee of the House, known as the Executive, is requiring the House on a constant basis to work to its will rather than the other way round.</P>
    <P>The Government are unduly influenced &mdash; I am not talking specifically in relation to this legislation but in general &mdash;by the permanent public servants. Somewhere along the line they have been able to divide and conquer, we are all whipped into line.  I am not blaming this Government only, it has been happening over a long period.  We are fearful of empowering our own House to do the job which the Constitution says it should do.  The Minister should examine that matter, specifically in relation to the Committee of Public Accounts, and generally in relation to committees of the House.  Governments change and their members can find themselves in Opposition. It is time that the House of Representatives empowered itself to carry out many of the examinations which we are devolving to others at great cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for the courtesy extended to me in relation to the publication of this Bill and for his kind words about me in his introduction. I also wish to thank the Secretary of the Department of Finance for the many courtesies extended to me as chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts for the past number of years.  I wish to pay tribute to all the accounting officers who must appear before the committee and, in the full glare of publicity, render an account of their stewardship.  We are very well served by an upright and dedicated group of public servants whose probity would be difficult to equal in any other State.  I should also like to express our appreciation of the excellent work done by the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="1349" /> and his staff and to express a special word of appreciation to the current holder of that office, Mr. P. L. McDonnell, with whom I have worked in close association for a number of years.  He is a man of great maturity and judgment and is most unassuming and helpful.  I wish to praise the clerk and assistant clerk &mdash; and other staff &mdash; of the Committee of Public Accounts for the pleasant and efficient manner in which they execute their duties and I thank them for responding well to the changing role of the committee in recent years.</P>
    <P>I also wish to praise the members of the Committee of Public Accounts because, although it is an all-party committee made up of six Fianna Fáil members, four Fine Gael members, one Labour member and one Democratic Left member, we have never divided on party lines despite some trying investigations.  We have a working relationship which would be difficult to equal.  I have the great honour to be their chairman and I hope, in the critical examination of this Bill, that I fairly reflected the views of the Committee of Public Accounts as stated in the report which we laid before the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that the legislation now before the House will be considered in a calm and proper manner and not turned into a political football for other purposes. This Bill is long overdue and we should give it quiet disquisition.  It specifically relates to this House since the Comptroller and Auditor General is an officer of the Dáil working for the House and it is the most important legislation in relation to the workings of this House to come before it for some time.  I compliment the Minister on introducing it and I ask him to consider on Committee Stage the suggestion I made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill and I compliment the Minister for Finance, despite his many pressing engagements, for having the time and initiative to introduce it.  It is also fair to recognise the efforts of Deputy Gay Mitchell who, on many occasions, sought to have this Bill on the floor of the House and sought to <Col N="1350" /> strengthen and increase the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Bill may not capture the imagination of the public but it is extremely important legislation concerned with the regulation on spending of State funds.  It is also a Bill which concerns a very important office holder under our Constitution, which has not been recognised in the past.  It is extremely important, for the management of public funds, that the office holder of Comptroller and Auditor General should have the support of the House and the Executive.  He or she should also have the respect of the House in relation to the extremely important functions carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>It is also incumbent on this House, during the passage of this Bill, to show due recognition to the responsibility which the Comptroller and Auditor General carries in regulation of accounting procedures dealing with spending public moneys.  We welcome the Bill and I see it as a long overdue step in what perhaps will be a series of legislative measures and statutory instruments to improve accountability of public expenditure and taxation &mdash; ultimately for the Dáil &mdash; because that is where the ultimate responsibility lies.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General investigates whether public moneys are spent properly and if taxes are being used for purposes for which they are supposed to be used.  There is a huge amount of Government expenditure which needs to be rigorously addressed; obviously questions will arise from time to time as to whether money has been properly spent. If there are overruns &mdash; which happen quite frequently in public programmes &mdash; it is important to know where responsibility lies and how they can be avoided in future.  The public have a right to such information.  We have the right to examine and the Comptroller and Auditor General has the right to inform himself, the House and the public because our responsibility is to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, I feel strongly that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has not been adequately funded <Col N="1351" /> or resourced.  It is extremely important that, in the context of new legislation which effectively will increase and expand the functions, adequate resources are provided.  By such provision we can protect public moneys, which is also extremely important.  The Comptroller and Auditor General could not be blamed in the past because the limited resources restricted the effectiveness of the office.  However, the office &mdash; and office holders &mdash; carried out their functions to the best of their abilities despite limited resources.</P>
    <P>A very recent example of the effectiveness of the office was the special report carried out in relation to the Carysfort property deals.  They are well equipped to do that and it could certainly be more effective.  I agree with the comments of Deputy Gay Mitchell, on broadening and expanding the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the committees of this House.  The Minister, in his speech, mentioned the three &ldquo;Es&rdquo; in terms of improving what can be done.  I would say in terms of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness, there are areas which we can consider on Committee Stage where we could save much public funds, be it in terms of inquiries and inspections and in terms of the consultants and lawyers employed by the State.  This is perhaps something that an expanded office of Comptroller and Auditor General could examine.</P>
    <P>Ultimately this House must take responsibility and increase its functions, and the Members of this House must be serious about the issue of public accountability which, I feel, we have not been in the past.  If we devoted more time to accountability and the administration of public moneys we would be doing a far better job.  Obviously, this would require a strengthening of the powers of the committees of this House.  It requires proper staffing which would include staff for chairpersons of committees to enable them to carry out their work.  I have, at times, questioned how they find the time or the energy, given the demands on politicians in the normal course of their constituency <Col N="1352" /> duties, to do this work.  If we are to be serious about this matter, we must provide the necessary staff and resources.  Ultimately, we would save public moneys if we provide public moneys in the first instance to properly staff and equip committees and Members of this House to do the job we are elected to do.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes an extension of the Comptroller and Auditor General's competence and I welcome that.  I also welcome the many areas which are listed in the Bill.  One area which it appears to overlook completely, and to which the Minister for Finance might respond, is in relation to county enterprise boards.  The Government have established some of them and have outlined a programme to establish others around the country. They will be disbursing large sums of public money and, in that respect, I ask the Minister where will the accountability lie for these new bodies?  Is it possible that they could come under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General? Local voluntary bodies of a non-commercial character should come under the scope of this legislation.  Otherwise, questions will be asked in relation to how these boards are selected, how they disburse their funds and their critera in the disbursement of their funds.  As yet, this House has not had an opportunity to discuss the role and function of those bodies.  The Labour Party will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to the effect that the newly appointed county enterprise boards should be brought within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposed extension to the authority, power and brief of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as outlined in the Bill, must be accompanied by obvious parallel legislation or by reform of this House.  The role of the committee must be increased and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and the Committee of Public Accounts are two which come to mind.  They have been mentioned and it is noteworthy that the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts have received consideration. Perhaps some of those recommendations <Col N="1353" /> could be included on Committee Stage.  It is important that the functions of these committees should dovetail with the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The basis of parliamentary democracy is the right of Members of this House to question the Executive on the spending of public money.  That does not have to be done in a controversial manner but, at present, in the way this House functions, that is a limited right.  In that respect the method of reporting to this House from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has been inadequate in the past.  It is important that not only should reports be made but that this House would have an opportunity to study and debate those reports.  Time must be provided for this either in Oireachtas committee or in this Chamber.  Perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts is the appropriate vehicle for a thorough examination of the reports presented.  There is little point in presenting reports if this House does not debate them and to act on them if action is required.  Ultimately, the action must be taken by the Executive. Obviously, pressure can be brought to bear on the Executive by a committee reporting or by the report being debated in the House.</P>
    <P>In that respect, it is necessary to update the law because, as the Minister said, most if not all the legislation in this area is pre-1937 Constitution and, therefore, needs to be updated.  The Minister also mentioned that computer technology has introduced greater sophistication into the area of accounting.  It is important that we adequately staff and resource those charged on behalf of the State to monitor the spending of public moneys.  There are dangers in that respect because new and sophisticated methods have been used both here and around the world to commit computer crime.  We must ensure that the new technology is not used to the disadvantage of the State.  The fact that we are updating and modernising the law on a statutory basis is of importance and the reasons for this have been well outlined.</P>
    <P>I regard as particularly important the <Col N="1354" /> extension of the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's role in relation to discretionary inspection, as outlined in section 8.  The facility to inspect commercial harbour authorities and regional tourism organisations, where 50 per cent or more of their gross receipts is received directly from Departments or from central funds, is very important.  It will give the Comptroller and Auditor General a new function in relation to monitoring public funds as far as necessary.  He can also satisfy himself and, ultimately, the Dáil that these funds have been correctly appropriated.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General may appoint suitably qualified independent persons to audit on behalf of the appropriation account for his own office and that is something the Minister might wish to examine.  I have reservations about that and believe we may not be going down the correct road.  Should it not be for the Dáil to appoint the auditor or the person who will audit on behalf of the Dáil?  I am worried that there would be a danger of a cosy relationship developing.  In saying that I am not attempting to question either the competence or the upstanding nature of the way this Office has been conducted but we should attempt to separate functions.  Section 13 may give us an opportunity to consider an alternative method of appointing the person who will be auditing the Office. Perhaps that should be a function for the Dáil or for the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for that information.  That recommendation should be considered again by the Minister for Finance and we will hopefully have an opportunity on Committee Stage of examining that.  This issue concerns transparency and the more transparency we can have in relation to the spending of public moneys the better for everybody. There is a tendency here not to have transparency in terms of grants being disbursed, <Col N="1355" /> lottery funding or whatever.  The more public accountability there is in relation to the spending of public moneys the better for everybody, including the Executive who award the grants, and those in public office who examine the basis on which they are given.</P>
      <P>Section 24 allows the Minister to introduce the provisions of the Bill at different times, and I hope this will not result in any further delay.  There has been much delay, not just through the fault of this Government but of previous Governments also, but I would hope that the provisions of the Bill will be brought into effect as quickly as possible.  The legislation is long overdue.  As I said earlier, let us bring in the resources that are necessary.  Obviously there is a large section of work involved, a large transfer of responsibility, and in that respect I hope there are no further delays.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the setting down in legislation of the duties of accounting officers in their role of giving evidence before the Committee of Public Accounts.  That will be of assistance to both the accounting officers and to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In the past there has been at times some confusion or difficulty in relation to spelling out the role of the accounting officer <i>vis á-vis</i> the function of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This measure is in the interest of both the accounting officers and the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a party, we have argued for some time for the extension of the powers of legislators to question the Executive.  The obvious way forward to bridge this gap in our democracy and to ensure proper accountability is to provide for the growth in powers of Dáil committees in line with, perhaps, the select committees of the House of Commons or, indeed, the greater powers of the US congressional committees.  That provision in the Bill relates back to the willingness of the Executive to give more powers to the committees and, indeed, the willingness of members of the committees and the Members of this House to take on the <Col N="1356" /> extra responsibility, something that is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Bill has some weaknesses, though I welcome it in general.  Perhaps we can address those weaknesses on Committee Stage.  The Bill fails, for example, to address other measures which could increase even further the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would want to see the holder of that office having absolute power because at the end of the day there has to be maximum accountability.  Ultimately the integrity and respect that the body politic, the State Departments, the local boards and, as I mentioned earlier, the county enterprise boards will have in the community can be substantiated through the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the effectiveness of that Office.</P>
    <P>The 1991 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General includes a section called project audits. These provide an extensive analysis, through investigation, of public expenditure programmes.  I would like to see these project audits increased.  This would require a commitment from the Minister and the Government to provide adequate resources in terms of staff.  The provision of extra resources and staff in this area would be money well spent as it would put a spotlight, through investigation, on public expenditure programmes. There have been many programmes in the past which, for various reasons, have had overruns.  It seems unfortunate that overruns will take place more easily in relation to funds in the public sector than in the private sector. We must question that situation &mdash; it must be brought to an end.  Do these overruns occur because there is a more casual approach to the spending of public money by the various bodies involved than there would be if it were private sector money?  There is an opportunity through the project audits of eliminating the overruns which have occurred in the past.  It is extremely important that we in this House and the committees of this House make it plain to the people involved in the expenditure of public moneys that overruns will not be tol<i>á-vis</i><Col N="1357" /> erated.  The question must be asked as to whether people are ever taken to task in respect of overruns in public expenditure where there are public contracts involved, whether these relate to the building of harbours, to public buildings and so on?  Is anybody ever brought to task?  Accountability must feature in relation to the expending of public moneys.  Hopefully, through the project audits the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to maintain a more day-to-day inspection on the spending of public moneys and unlike the overruns, perhaps they can be stopped before public money is wasted.  If the resources are not provided, if the House does not provide the facilities for something to be done when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on overruns, then effectively the concept of accountability will be a waste of time and a further waste of public moneys.  It is extremely important, as I said at the outset, that we provide the facility for reporting and for action because the bottom line in all of this is that action must be taken in areas where public moneys have been wasted.  Therefore, resources are necessary and obviously they will be required if interim reports are to be published and brought before this House.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary scrutiny in this country to date has been quite feeble.  The development of the concept here compared with the majority of advanced democracies is, I believe, a long way behind.  Perhaps it has been through the efforts of the Committee of Public Accounts and of Deputy Gay Mitchell, as their chairman, that we have made some advances in recent years but we still have a long way to go.  This area can obviously be looked at in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The bottom line, from my point of view, is that confidence in our system depends on accountability and belief among the electorate that the political system will respond to meet those concerns. Above all, greater freedom of information and transparency in Government actions is absolutely vital.  I am at a loss to understand why, down through <Col N="1358" /> the years, and this applies to all Governments including Governments I have participated in, we have been hesitant about transparency in public offices.  If we can resolve, in the context of this Bill, to ensure that there is greater transparency, it will be the stimulus that our democracy and, perhaps, those in public life in this country need at a time when those in public life are under serious pressure.</P>
    <P>Powerful interest groups can operate most effectively when there is a shroud of secrecy covering executive decisions. If the electorate ceases to believe in the powers of the Oireachtas to effectively check these interests, I believe we are talking about a crisis of legitimacy in our democratic institutions.  Unfortunately, as I have said, there is growing evidence of alienation among the ordinary population, those outside the system who do not see that our work is always as effective as they would wish.  This, perhaps, is a challenge for this House and for the democratic institutions.  We have got to ensure that the public can see and have confidence in the work that is being done. We are talking about a great deal of money.  It is public money and much of it is raised through taxes.  The public are entitled to see that they are getting value for money and they should at all times have information as to how that money is spent.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill.  We have a duty to increase real accountability, and this Bill gives us an opportunity of doing so. The Bill can be improved and I am sure the Minister, being a fairly open-minded man, will participate on Committee Stage and take on board the suggestions that have been made concerning increases, powers and increased transparency in relation to the spending of public moneys.  It is our duty and right as legislators to increase real accountability, to ensure there is access to information and to vigorously question as many areas of executive responsibility as possible.</P>
    <P>Some of the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts have been taken on board.  This Bill will be strengthened by the inclusion of even more of those recommendations.  As the chairman <Col N="1359" /> of that committee, Deputy Gay Mitchell said, those recommendations are made in a non-political manner.  I do not believe that any party representative on the Committee of Public Accounts has been seeking political advantage by virtue of those recommendations.  They are recommendations made through the experience of that committee, and recommendations which I believe would benefit this House and the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage of what I believe is a very valuable first effort at improving the legislation in this area and of strengthening the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Of all the constitutional Offices this is not a high profile one; nevertheless it is perhaps one of the more important in the State.  It is important that the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General is done efficiently and effectively and that the public can be so assured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first of all like to speak about the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is my opinion that that committee is an example that could well be followed by many committees in the House.  Indeed, the Committee of Public Accounts should be examined in the light of improvements being made to the operation of other committees.  The Committee of Public Accounts have always provided an example of public representatives taking their work seriously and addressing themselves to the fundamental interests of the citizens of this State by trying to ensure that there is accountability for money spent and transparency in relation to what is going on in what is, it has to be admitted a very complex and detailed area.  There are no kudos to be had from the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Much detailed effort and attention is required in the very complicated area of accounting and the relationship between public bodies and the House and the expenditure of public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte is the Democratic <Col N="1360" /> Left representative on the Committee of Public Accounts and he hopes to be able to contribute to this debate before its conclusion.  Obviously, Deputy Rabbitte will have much more insight than I do into the operations of that committee and into the operations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Nevertheless, there are some general points that need to be made.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is the only constitutional officer nominated by this House &mdash; theoretically at least &mdash; appointed by the President and accountable directly to the House.  He or she is not accountable directly to the Government and can be dismissed from office only by way of a motion of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore in my view the Comptroller and Auditor General has a very important independent role in the expenditure of hard-earned taxpayers' money.  Even though an important part of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to identify waste or abuse, he or she should also seek to prevent the development of trends in the expenditure of public money that are wasteful or, as has happened in some instances, fraudulent.</P>
    <P>An illustration of the importance of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is provided in the newspaper headlines that appeared following the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which it was pointed out that some public contracting authorities failed to require tax clearance certificates before awarding contracts, the holding of taxes by sheriffs was a cause of concern, unpaid tax totals about £2.5 billion, a harbour survey mistake cost £1 million and so on.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of public perception the Comptroller and Auditor General clearly has an important role. However, apart from the fact that it would probably be true to say that many Members of the House are unclear as to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, very few people outside of the House would be aware even of the existence of the office of Comptroller and Auditor General.  If people are to have <Col N="1361" /> confidence in the operation of their democratic institutions they should be conscious of those institutions and of the checks and balances on the operations of those institutions.</P>
    <P>I think there is a perception outside the House that we here are in some way independent operators who can do as we chose in a whole range of matters.  It is only those of us who have been in the House for a while who recognise that that is far from the truth.  There is a feeling that Members have the power to do something but we do not do it, that we overspend and even that we overpay ourselves. We need to address the question of how we should inform the public about what we do and the way in which there are controls exercised over what we do and over what the agencies that we establish do.  There is an urgent need for civics education in our schools.  Unless we reach a position where people know what our institutions are, how they operate, what the various arms of Government do and do not do and what they are entitled to do, it will be impossible for people to make a true judgment about whether we are acting in a proper or an improper way.</P>
    <P>The operation of public companies and public agencies is extraordinarily complex. The list of bodies that the Comptroller and Auditor General is and will be entitled to examine numbers about 30 or 40.  People outside the House may not even have heard of many of those bodies.  Coiste and Asgard, for example, is, I am sure, an important body and I presume that it is connected with the Erskine Childers yacht, but who except those who are directly interested in that enterprise know that there is such a committee, that the committee are in receipt of public funds and that there is a body &mdash; the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; that examines whether that committee are operating properly and spending taxpayers' money in a proper way?</P>
    <P>The point I make is that we are dealing with a complex area and that it is extremely difficult for people to be conscious of what is going on if they do not <Col N="1362" /> even known about the bodies that are in existence and about the agencies that are established to control and examine their operations on behalf of the people.  There is a need for transparency, for public accountability and for people to know and to be taught at an early age what precisely are the constituent parts of our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has to a large extent, up to the present at any rate, operated under fairly ancient legislation is a mark of the foresight of the originators of the legislation in 1866, that the basic principles that applied then could continue to be applied reasonably effectively right up till now.  The designation of the office in our Constitution lends it an importance over and above virtually all other issues that may be dealt with in this House.  That the Government considered it important enough to publish a White Paper on the background of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is indicative of the importance that more people outside the House be conscious of just what the office is and the way it works on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The interrelationship between the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Dáil and the introduction of new legislation, which has been backed by a White Paper, provide a model of the way in which we should do our business in general. Too often in this House we deal with legislation in a very <i>ad hoc</i> manner. We respond to emergencies and produce legislation that is not thought through fully.  I would suggest that the debate in the House of the past two weeks, now continuing in the Seanad, on the abortion issue is an example of that.  More attention should have been paid to the issues, the production of a Green Paper outlining the different options to be followed by a White Paper and then legislation. That would create a much more informed and less heated debate about that issue.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General is a good working relationship and it is not in <Col N="1363" /> any way confrontational.  That is important, but it does not necessarily mean there is a cosy consensus involved.  As Deputy G. Mitchell said, because differences of opinion on the committee do not necessarily break down on strict party divisions, that is not to deny that there are differences of opinion but they are based on understandings of the issues and not as a result of the operation of a party whip on any particular issue.  It would be good to see that kind of development in other committees and even in relation to legislation on the floor of this House where people could stand up and deliver their views on any given issue, as indeed backbench Members of the Fianna Fáil Party have done in recent days on a fairly controversial issue in relation to Aer Lingus.  That kind of stance should not be seen as in some way odd or as a threat to the Government but rather as an honest reflection of the views of Deputies on a particular issue.  The question of how people vote at the end of the day on a particular issue is a separate matter. People should feel free to stand up in this House or in committees and deliver their views on issues as they see them in an honest and conscientious way without feeling they are undermining their party, their party leader or threatening the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring expressed wonder at how members of the Committee of Public Accounts could do such an effective job despite their heavy workload both at constituency and Dáil levels.  Presumably many of those members are also involved in local authorities.  I made a submission on the question of Dáil reform some time ago in which I suggested we needed to give far more work to committees of this Dáil.  The only effective way that could be done would be to review how the Dáil sits.  I am not going down the simplistic road of suggesting the Dáil should sit six days a week 50 weeks of the year, but I suggest we rationalise the sittings and have effective committees meeting more often, but when the committees meet the Dáil should not meet.  Two weeks of the <Col N="1364" /> month should be set aside for key committees to meet and do their business in an effective way without being interrupted by quorums, votes or running here and there so that the business that comes on the floor of this House is the work that has been teased out by committees in a rational and reasoned way.</P>
    <P>We would be a far more democratic institution if we did that and got away from this constant haranguing of each other and indeed haranguing by the public that we sit only X number of days per week or X number of days per month. We will be seen as effective when we produce the goods, not on the basis of sitting until midnight or five day per week as opposed to four days per week.  There is a genuine desire among most Members of this House to rationalise the way in which we do our work and to get away from the old conceptions of how parliaments operate.  It is impossible, given the complexity of the work we have to deal with, for us to operate in the way in which parliaments operated in 1800 or before, when there was much more leisure time for those who had the opportunity to sit in a parliament at that time because the vast mass of people had no representatives in parliament.</P>
    <P>Because of technology we have the capacity to inform the people much more quickly and easily.  There is no reason the proceedings of this House and the proceedings of our committees should not be broadcast verbatim on a radio wavelength or on a public service television channel so that people can see what we do on a daily basis.  Committees are constrained by a range of problems &mdash; for example, finance, staffing and lack of powers &mdash; which we should deal with.</P>
    <P>The reason I am dwelling on this area and perhaps moving away from the main issue of the debate is that the Committee of Public Accounts and their relationship with the Comptroller and Auditor General is an example of what an effective committee can achieve if they do their work and if we give them the time, the resources and the freedom to do the work.  The legislation is welcome and I support it in broad terms.  I admit I have <Col N="1365" /> not studied the Bill in any great detail but it seems to be a progressive move in the right direction.  Deputy Rabbitte will deal with the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I should like to raise.  For example, why are commercial State bodies excluded from examination?  I have read the section in the White Paper which makes the argument for and against including commercial State bodies.  The arguments against include that it would be considered inappropriate in the case of bodies which are intended to enjoy a certain degree of autonomy and freedom from interference in their day-to-day operations.  It goes on to say that they are already sufficiently accountable to parliament through the responsible Minister and the presentation of the annual report and accounts.  They point out that the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies &ldquo;has wide-ranging terms of reference which help to ensure that these bodies are directly accountable to parliament&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The point I would make in relation to that and in relation to local authorities, which are also excluded, is that to a significant extent the expertise does not exist at local authority level to consider the reports of local authorities.  From my reading of the reports of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies they rarely if ever deal with the question of financial accountability and how the company is being run.  They are not a body that can examine on a regular basis every company; that is a task the Comptroller and Auditor General could do.</P>
    <P>The case for not including commercial State-sponsored bodies is a weak one and should be reviewed.  I welcome the fact that the Minister in his speech said it was not intended to include them now.  I hope that means there will be an opportunity to review it.  For example, if the Comptroller and Auditor General's mandate had covered bodies such as Green-core and Aer Lingus Holidays Limited, the debacle we saw there might have been avoided.  Why should St. Angela's <Col N="1366" /> College of Home Economics, Lough Gill, County Sligo, come under the mandate of the Comptroller and Auditor General but not Aer Lingus or CIE? There seems to be an imbalance there which should be addressed.  Obviously the job of the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be simply to ensure that every penny allocated for paper clips is not spent on staples, but to ensure that the financial interests of the country at large are protected.  As I said, the fundamental point has to be value for hard-earned taxpayers' money.  Indeed, in income tax terms, the PAYE sector pay something like 90 per cent of this money.</P>
    <P>The provision in relation to the charging of fees by the Comptroller and Auditor General also gives me cause to pause.  I do not have any objection in principle to that but I would not like to see the point being reached where he would be expected to become self-financing, as this would impose constraints on his work.  I think it costs a little over £1 million to run his office at present.  This is certainly money well spent in view of the huge amounts of money he has the task of overseeing and the extremely important role he plays on behalf of the public at large.</P>
    <P>I also have questions on the sub-contracting-out of work.  I wonder if this is a good idea.  Unfortunately, as we have seen, many private firms have not exactly covered themselves in glory and several cases before the courts are alleging failure on the part of private accountants and auditors.  This area needs to be approached with some caution.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to bring the regional tourism organisations under the mandate of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Of course, these organisations are effectively being abolished by the implementation of the Government's proposals on county development committees.  Will the county development committee come under the mandate of the Comptroller and Auditor General given that the regional tourism organisations are being abolished?</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments by the Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="1367" /> General has been the issuing of project audit reports.  The report published in October 1990 on the business expansion scheme was an eye opener for many people.  There had been constant complaints about the operation of that scheme.  The project report undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out that while the scheme was good in its intention &mdash; that is, to create or maintain employment and improve the productive base of the economy by providing tax incentives to taxpayers to invest in companies experiencing difficulty in raising capital for start-up or expansion &mdash; the examination had revealed the absence of procedures which would be necessary in order to evaluate properly the success or otherwise of that scheme.  The most notable weaknesses were that although the objectives of the scheme were well defined in general terms, in practice, the economic, financial and employment targets were not defined at all; no procedures were in place to obtain feedback on the extent to which the scheme was meeting its objectives in terms of job creation or maintenance; information was not being compiled to evaluate the extent to which the scheme had been successful in terms of attracting equity, etc; no attempt was made to identify the cost of jobs maintained or created; and there was no special policing of the scheme with regard to detecting a change of circumstances which might cause disqualification or withdrawal of relief.</P>
    <P>That scheme was operated by the Department of Finance, the key Department of Government who exercise overall policing of every other Department, who rightly demand that every other Department keep their budgets under some kind of control and require all kinds of cost cutting in order for these Departments to qualify for whatever budget they may get in any succeeding years.  Yet this scheme was found to be grossly and inadequately monitored by the Department of Finance.  Despite the fact that that Department is accountable, through the Minister for Finance, to this House <Col N="1368" /> on a regular basis, this scheme operated for years with these glaring inadequacies.</P>
    <P>The other issue brought to light by these project audit reports was that the Shannon Leasing Company, which operated under the business expansion scheme, received large tax exemptions but provided little employment.  The example given was that this company received a tax exemption of £13 million but created only seven jobs.  That is extraordinary and represents almost £2 million per job created.  Obviously many Members in this House raised objections to the way the scheme was being operated but this practice went on.  Eventually it was the Comptroller and Auditor General, and not the Minister for Finance or the parties in Opposition, who brought this practice to an end.  This highlights the importance of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>This is one of the occasions on which Members on all sides of the House can welcome legislation and hope that it strengthens the hand of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Hopefully the work of this House will be improved both as a result of the example of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General and the way in which this legislation has been developed and backed up by a White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks made by the previous speaker have somewhat modified my approach to this issue.  As Deputy De Rossa correctly stated, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts are the twin pillars on which the financial oversight of the Oireachtas is supposed to be based. However, we do not really understand how they work; we do not devote enough time to how they work.  In fact, we do not give enough publicity in general to committees, an issue I will deal with in further detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I believe this Bill is particularly welcome.  Like Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Spring, I commend the Minister on the approach he adopted in producing a White Paper on a somewhat <Col N="1369" /> obscure but very important area of public administration and following that by legislation.  This is an important precedent to set on issues such as this.  After all, under the Constitution the Dáil has very specific roles to play: it must make and break Government &mdash; we are all familiar with this &mdash; it must control the Government, ensure that the Government do not become involved in excesses and make the Government behave.  It is also charged with making laws and, ultimately, with making war and peace.  It also has the very important constitutional role of controlling the public purse, one of the longest-standing roles of any parliament in any form of democracy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil's primary involvement in the finances of the State in terms of time consumed is concerned with the way we handle the Estimates and the financial provisions.  The Dáil is also concerned to establish that money has been correctly used.  Successive Dála have been very remiss in the way they have handled this part of their responsibility.  There are two sides of the responsibility of financial oversight.  Three institutions exist through which the Dáil and the State control the expenditure of public funds. The role of the accounting officer has not been dealt with in any detail in the debate but it is touched on in the Bill.  There is also the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee. We had for a short period a fourth institutional arrangement, a Committee on Public Expenditure, which was allowed to fade away.</P>
    <P>The role of the accounting officer is largely ignored but it has at least the same importance as the other two.  The accounting officer is appointed by the Minister for Finance for each Department under the terms of the 1866 Act. The officer is responsible to the Dáil and answerable to the Dáil through the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee.  Normally the accounting officer is the civil servant who heads a Department, but there are exceptions &mdash; for example, in the case of the Department of the Taoiseach. While the accounting officer can <Col N="1370" /> delegate responsibility for administration, the ultimate responsibility lies with him or her.  The accounting officer presents the appropriation accounts of his Department to the Comptroller and Auditor General not later than 30 April in the year following the year to which the accounts relate.  There is an issue of timetabling.  The 1992 accounts will be due to be handed over in April next year. The accounting officer can be called on by the Comptroller and Auditor General to answer any matter arising from these accounts and in theory may be held personally responsible for making good any expenditure which is disallowed.  It does not happen in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many instances where in theory it could happen but in reality it does not.  This is just as well for some accounting officers because they would be paying £40 a week for the rest of eternity in some cases.</P>
      <P>The primacy of the accounting officer is illustrated in cases where the accounting officer and the Minister differ on the use of funds.  It is a tribute to the people who drafted the original legislation that they saw a differentiation was needed.  From my own experience as a civil servant I remember an occasion when an accounting officer and a Minister had a <i>contre temps</i> over who had primacy in this matter.  Of course it was the accounting officer.  The law provides very clearly that where the accounting officer and the Minister differ, the accounting officer must notify the Minister and suggest a joint consultation with the Department of Finance.  Where the Minister insists on a contradictory course of action the accounting officer is required to receive these instructions in writing and then to inform the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General. The accounting officer plays a very important role, although largely it is ignored.  Within the Department the accounting officer has responsibility to ensure financial propriety at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> That is the role on which accounting officers focus, rather than ensuring efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>This is where the other two pillars on which parliamentary control is based come into the matter.  Like the accounting officers, the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was established by the 1866 Act, which was updated in the early years of the State.  Article 33 of the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be appointed by the President on the nomination of the Dáil.  It is interesting that the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General was continued into our law and given absolute primacy and constitutional status.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reports to the Dáil and the independence of his office is assured by the provision of an impeachment process which permits his removal only in the most extraordinary cases of stated misbehaviour and only upon the vote of both Houses.  He has great security of tenure.  The drafters of our Constitution were as alert as the drafters of the original legislation to the very important role in terms of parliamentary democracy played by this officer.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General had two distinct roles.  The Comptroller role tends in discussions to be put on one side.  As Auditor General he is charged with the task of auditing the accounts of Departments to ensure their accuracy, regularity, appropriateness of expenditure &mdash; that is, that there is an appropriation for each item of expenditure &mdash; and to examine any loss or waste.  During the incumbency of the present holder of that office and under his predecessor there has been an interesting extension and expansion of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This has largely happened without legislative support.  That is why this Bill is so important. It provides a legislative basis for current practice.</P>
    <P>Historically, Comptrollers and Auditors General tended to emphasise correctness and financial propriety rather than efficiency.  Tribute must be paid to <Col N="1372" /> the existing Comptroller and Auditor General and to his immediate predecessor, as well as to the Public Accounts Committee and its current and past chairmen because it is only in recent years that the issue of efficiency has come into focus.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has the responsibility to report to the Dáil on loss, waste or uneconomic expenditure; but he has had no specific function in regard to policy.  He will not be able to investigate a project from a policy point of view.  At present his responsibilities cover all issues from the Central Fund, the appropriation accounts of the Departments to certain stocks and stores accounts, the accounts of any moneys which are payable from the Central Fund and accounts of a limited number of State-sponsored bodies.  I am mystified as to why some come under his aegis and some do not.  He is also responsible for accounts where from time to time he is requested by the Minister for Finance.  In performing his functions the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff have free access at all reasonable times to the books and accounts of the Departments.  It may be tedious to relate all these things but it is important in the current context to see how these responsibilities have evolved and where this office is heading.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General presents his report to the Dáil not later than 15 October.  Between the receipt of the appropriation accounts at the end of April and 15 October the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff are charged with the task of examining all the appropriation accounts.  There is clearly tension and pressure.  When the law was set in place the State was very small and expenditure was very limited.  In recent years the State has grown very dramatically and during the long period of growth the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General has not grown in a commensurate way.  The staffing of his office has lagged behind the growth of the State and State institutions; yet there is this dreadfully narrow time span in which the Comptroller and Auditor General and subsequently the Committee <Col N="1373" /> of Public Accounts have to perform a vital task.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General has any doubts regarding any items of expenditure he communicates these in writing to the accounting officer in the Department.  Where the Comptroller and Auditor General has any doubts regarding an item which comes to his attention he need not of course wait until the appropriation accounts are available but can draw the matter to the attention of the Department prior to the arrival of the appropriation accounts on his desk.</P>
    <P>Historically, the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General have drawn attention to cases where amounts granted by the Dáil had been exceeded. That is probably one of the most frequent issues reported on.  Attention has also been drawn to cases where money received from the Department from sources other than the supply grant has not been properly used or properly accounted for.  That is a fairly common error.  A third area that one finds is where sums charged against a supply grant are not supported by proof of payment, that is, by way of the vouchering system.  A fourth one we find is where payment against a supply grant has not been made within the period of the account.  This is where accounting officers and Departments might find themselves with spare cash at the end of one year.  Because of our budgetary system they do not want to be in that position, so they may bring forward a payment.  Equally they may find themselves financially strapped and may put back payments.  Finally, the Comptroller and Auditor General brings forward cases of loss, waste or uneconomical expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the examples we find in the reports that the Comptroller and Auditor General does highlight a variety of inefficiencies and technical breaches each year.  It is equally obvious that, historically, there are widespread inefficiencies in the accounting system and in the control systems that operate in Government Departments.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, it has to be said, has a very small staff to perform <Col N="1374" /> the task on hand.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is therefore clearly limited in the amount of space and the amount of cover that can be given to the accounts.  Moreover his staff, although they are very talented people, are generally widely possessed only of in-house experience and tend not to be fully trained auditors.  These factors, plus the need to concentrate on the administrative aspects of the audit and the sheer size of the task, have always limited the true effectiveness of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge what has been done in recent years, what I am suggesting to the House is that there are very serious limitations on what can be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General under the present system of operations. If we are considering the effectiveness of the Dáil's financial oversight it is important to consider also the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in so far as it is inextricably interlinked with the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell dealt with the Committee of Public Accounts in some detail, but I think it is always difficult for a chairman to be objective and to praise his own committee to the extent that it deserves to be.  I want to make up for any deficiencies that modesty has caused in his case.  The committee is one of the most important committees in the Dáil. It plays a very central role.  With the Comptroller and Auditor General it is one of the twin pillars of institutionalised parliamentary accountability.  As Deputy De Rossa has said, the role played by the committee, as indeed the role played by the Comptroller and Auditor General, is not properly recognised.</P>
    <P>As we know, the committee consists of Dáil Deputies only.  It is traditionally chaired by a member of the Opposition. The committee is assisted by the Comptroller and Auditor General and bases its work on his report.  It stands to the great credit of the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; it has been mentioned here by several speakers &mdash; that the great tradition of the committee has been that it has never tended to operate on a partisan <Col N="1375" /> basis.  That is so of all the committees in this House.  That is something which demands to be said and put on the record.  The fact that parliamentarians &mdash; Members of both Houses in the case of my own committee and Members of the Dáil in the case of Deputy Mitchell's committee &mdash; give so much of their time without seeking ever to take political advantage of it is something that is praiseworthy and should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>In examining the appropriation accounts of the Department the secretary, as the accounting officer, usually attends before the meetings of the committee. The Department of Finance are also usually represented.  When the committee's examination of the appropriation accounts is completed they report to the Dáil.  Here we come across a second major weakness.  What does the Dáil do with the reports of the Committee of Public Accounts?  It consigns them to oblivion because we do not act on them and we do not debate them. That is an issue of ongoing concern to me and to anybody who is even remotely interested in parliamentary democracy. It is a scandal which should be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>The final reports and the verbatim reports are circulated to us all as Members and, largely, they are ignored. The committee, of course, also have certain powers, such as the powers to send for persons and papers; but, like other Dáil committees, they have no right to compel attendance and there is no ultimate right to <i>subpoena</i> the production of documents.  In their reports the Committee of Public Accounts examine the financial rather than political aspects of public expenditure, and that is as it should be.  The committee do not operate in a partisan way but in an objective way. In practice the committee's reports to the Dáil are not debated and that is an ongoing scandal.  Instead of getting what I believe the Committee of Public Accounts should get, that is, specific time to have their views aired in this House and a specific ministerial response, what do we have?  The recommendations of <Col N="1376" /> the committee are in effect dealt with administratively by the Department of Finance.  In practice if the committee recommend a course of action the Minister for Finance will indicate to the committee in a document entitled &ldquo;Minute of the Minister for Finance on the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts&rdquo; the action to be taken on foot of the committee's recommendations.  Where the Minister for Finance does not agree to follow the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts, the minutes will indicate why.  In the following financial year the Committee of Public Accounts will consider the response of the Minister for Finance to it.  If it is unhappy at the response, the only recourse open to the committee at that stage is to incorporate that in a report to the Dáil, which, like all other reports, will be ignored by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In reality then the Committee of Public Accounts are unlikely to resolve really controversial issues because of political nature of the issues and because the Dáil tends to ignore their operations.</P>
    <P>The committee's effectiveness is also limited by a number of specific things which we should recognise here.  There has been an increase in the number of meetings which the committee has had in recent years.  On checking back to get a view of the operations of the activities of past Committees of Public Accounts I found that the current Committee of Public Accounts and their predecessor have met more frequently than any other Committee of Public Accounts in the history of the State.  However, in spite of that, and because of the very nature of our activities as politicians, there is clearly always going to be a limit on the number of meetings that the committee can hold and the amount of time Members can devote to these meetings. While the Committee of Public Accounts can depend on the Comptroller and Auditor General, it cannot engage specialist consultants.  It strikes me as bizarre that other committees of the House do have the power to engage consultants; but the Committee of Public Accounts, arguably one of the most <Col N="1377" /> important committees and a committee that could be directly related to the Constitution do not have that power.  It can call witnesses, but it cannot compel witnesses. Deputy Mitchell has already referred to this.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I have of the committee is that they do from time to time tend to over-focus on detail; but that is, I suppose, the nature of politics.  It has also been mentioned from time to time by chairpersons that attendance at the committee may not always be spectacular. There will always be a couple of very energetic members of the committee. I know the committee are taking steps to deal administratively with nonattendance. The political nature of the committee can engender defensiveness, particularly from the Government side. That has to be acknowledged.  The committee works <i>post facto</i>, often dealing with matters two or three years removed. That is in the nature of matters and is not under the control of the committee. There is no process whereby the Dáil must of necessity debate the reports of the committees and that is an extraordinary failing.  The process whereby the Minister for Finance replies by note to the committees is a process of doubtful usefulness and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>None of these points, I hasten to add, is intended to undermine the excellent work done by the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, we must bear in mind that the committee have very specific limitations with which they must deal and which also tend to constrain them.  If we are to reform the system of parliamentary oversight of public finances it is essential that we recognise its weaknesses and also that we address them.  A strengthened Comptroller and Auditor General, for which the Bill provides, would make it doubly urgent to deal with the problems that the Committee of Public Accounts have had to face.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to deal with the provisions of the Bill against that background. As I said at the outset, the Bill is most welcome given that, for the first time in 130 years, a major effort is being made to improve and modernise one arm <Col N="1378" /> of parliamentary oversight of public finances. The changes relate primarily to the audit role of the Comptroller and Auditor General but, nonetheless, they are very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined this morning the main aims of the Bill, and they are praiseworthy. These are: to consolidate and modernise the existing legislative provisions; to make additional provision to extend the range and scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's scrutiny of public expenditure and the management of public resources in line with modern requirements; to provide for more effective arrangements for reporting by the Comptroller and Auditor General and, finally, to deal with other incidental and miscellaneous issues.</P>
    <P>While I welcome these aims I would like to deal with specific items addressed in the Bill.  In addition to these aims, the Minister recognises the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General scru-effective auditor of public expenditure. This is particularly welcome because in a sense the legislation is following the practice adopted by recent Comptrollers and Auditors General.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognises the changing nature of the audit process and the need to emphasise what he described as the three &ldquo;Es&rdquo;&mdash; economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  Again, this is to be welcomed. Parliament should focus its attention on matters such as this more frequently.  Unfortunately, because we tend to get involved in cat-calling and name-calling we are inclined to ignore this important work.  It is welcome that the Minister recognises that efficiency, effectiveness and economy should be to the forefront in carrying out a modern audit.  However this raises the question of the capacity of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office to handle this challenge of value for money audits. Given that the great bulk of training provided for the staff &mdash; I have referred to this matter already &mdash; is in-house, there is a need to bring more outside expertise to bear on this area.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding some of the points made by Deputy De Rossa, we, in <Col N="1379" /> Ireland, are fortunate in having considerable strength in the accounting area. The quality of training provided at both university and professional level is regarded internationally as being exceptional. There is a great deal of talent in this field and the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts should be empowered and funded to use this talent in addition to its existing, in-house talent.</P>
    <P>In this regard I welcome section 16 (2) which will permit the Comptroller and Auditor General to appoint an agent to operate on behalf of the office.  I hope the Comptroller and Auditor General will make use of this provision regularly as this would be one way of extending on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis the capacity of his office and of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the extension of the Comptroller and Auditor General's purview to non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Last week when we discussed the role of my own committee, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies and their special report on their terms of reference, I drew attention to the fact that, to my mind, the lack of a direct parliamentary oversight of the performance of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies is extraordinary.  I am pleased that the Minister has addressed this matter both in the Bill and the White Paper.</P>
    <P>In 1976, when the Dáil discussed the establishment of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies it was decided that the Oireachtas should not oversee non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  The argument put forward was that the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies were in effect extensions of their parent Department and, in reality, were budget-based expenditure agencies and that it would be inappropriate to handle them on the same basis as commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I would not quibble with this view, that the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies are qualitatively different from commercial State-sponsored bodies, but that having <Col N="1380" /> been said it is remarkable that until this Bill was produced by the Minister non-commercial State-sponsored bodies were effectively outside the direct oversight of the Dáil.  The decision to bring all non-commercial State-sponsored bodies under the purview of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I trust, by extension, of the Committee of Public Accounts, is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome another provision which has not been referred to in any of the other contributions made that is the provision contained in section 8 which deals with the right of inspection.  I regard this as an important breakthrough.  I acknowledge however that it is limited to specific bodies but it is very important that this power be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As he will now have this right of inspection in respect of certain bodies, I hope it will be extended to cover those parts of public administration where we consider there is a need for some form of parliamentary oversight.</P>
    <P>It is critically important that the right of inspection be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General, given that direct intervention is clearly required in respect of specific events which present themselves from time to time, first, by an impartial and objective agency such as the Comptroller and Auditor General and, ultimately, by committees of the Dáil, be it the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies in the case of commercial State bodies or, in the case of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies or State Departments, the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Having praised the Bill in general terms, I would like to raise question marks in respect of two specific areas, the first of which is the issue of extending the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit to cover certain local authorities. This issue has been brought to my attention by one local government auditor.  I consider that many of the points raised and the concerns expressed by the local government auditor in question require, at the minimum, a response and I should <Col N="1381" /> be grateful if the Minister would outline his views on the specific points raised.</P>
    <P>The first question raised by the local government auditor concerning the issue of such extension was that of public accountability.  This suggests that the accounts of such bodies are being audited and reported on publicly at present by qualified auditors with specific knowledge and expertise.  He points out that local government audits are specialised and require unique statutory powers which have evolved through years of legislation and case law aimed at safeguarding public accountability.  Local Government auditors wonder if this role is to be abandoned.  The Minister made it clear in the House today that he was dealing only with a limited number of local authorities but the auditors are concerned that there will be an extension and that their role will be redundant.</P>
    <P>The second question raised by the local government auditors concerns the professional staff.  They point out that local government auditors are qualified accountants, that they are members of professional organisations and that the standard among local government auditors is very high.  I tend to agree with them.  They are qualified and do a fine job.  I wonder therefore why it is necessary to make a change in the case of the vocational education committees and health boards.  Each local government auditor is publicly responsible for their audit and they fulfil this responsibility well.</P>
    <P>They also make the point that the issue of subsidiarity arises.  As Members are aware, the subsidiarity doctrine has been discussed widely not only on this side of the water but elsewhere in recent times and has been subject to all sorts of bizzare interpretations but the general interpetation is that one does not give responsibility to a high public authority if that responsibility can be performed by a lower public authority within the community itself.  It seems, given their background and experience and having regard to the fact that they are located around the country, that local government auditors would best serve the local <Col N="1382" /> community, democracy and local traditions.</P>
    <P>In fact, I would go a step further.  One of the deficiencies in the local government audit at present is that it is rather static.  I have always argued &mdash; I discussed this matter with the Minister and his predecessor &mdash; that there is need for a mobile local effectiveness audit which could be called on by the elected members of a local authority to ensure that the estimates presented to them represent the best deal that can be got for the taxpayers in the local area, that the expenditure procedures in the local authority are efficient and, more importantly, that at the end of the day we get value for every pound spent.</P>
    <P>I am sure that a centralised unit in Dublin would be more efficient in operating the local government audit.  Arguably it could be more costly than the present arrangement.  It may be that when the new arrangements come into operation the Comptroller and Auditor General will appoint some of the existing local government auditors as his agent to carry out the initial audit of the vocational education committees or the health boards.  Local government auditors pointed out that there are aspects of the value for money audit which have always been part of their standard procedure and they do not seem to get credit for it.  They also point out that a lack of resources, mainly staffing, has prevented them from undertaking value for money audits on a structured basis.  Recognising that this is the case I suggested to the present Minister, and previous Ministers for the Environment, that there is need for a mobile audit in the local authority area that can be called in by the elected members to perform specific tasks relating to effectiveness, efficiency and value for money.</P>
    <P>Local authority auditors point out that in the past arrears of unaudited accounts were an inhibiting factor in local government audits but that &mdash; this is reasonable &mdash; in recent years due to the great efforts of auditors in spite of staff shortages the audits are up to date and the annual audits have now become the norm.  The <Col N="1383" /> auditors query some of the suggestions made in the special report published by the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the way the audit is carried out in vocational education committees and health boards.  In general, local government auditors have done a very good job.  I hope the Minister will address some of the issues an concerns exercising the minds of local government auditors at present.</P>
    <P>Local government auditors suggest that a special report of the Committee of Public Accounts recommended that a distinction be made between mainline local authorities and others such as health boards and vocational education committees &mdash; that is effectively done in the Bill &mdash; on the grounds that the former are directly elected by the public whereas the latter are not so elected.  The rationale behind this recommendation appears to the local government auditors, and to me, to be quite unreasonable in that the health boards and vocational education committees are composed of councillors nominated by local authorities and representatives of other local interests.  Their origins are steeped in local government tradition and the board members aspire to serve the public locally.  In turn, the public perceive the boards as being similar to county councils.  Therefore, it is more difficult to understand the distinction made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The auditors point out that it appears unreasonable to draw a distinction on the basis of funding.  As they suggest, funding arrangements are volatile and entirely dependent on economic circumstances and Government policy.  The fact that local authorities invested their resources in local health services for more than a century prior to the present arrangement should not be lost sight of.  The auditors suggest that it is noteworthy that in the UK responsibility for the audit of health authorities, formerly that of the DHSS audits section, has recently been transferred to the audit commission, the UK equivalent of our local government audit service.  They suggest, therefore, that the <Col N="1384" /> moves we are contemplating would be a step in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>The special report of the Committee of Public Accounts identifies a need to improve the matter of reporting to the Dáil on local government expenditure other than the examination by the local government auditors.  Prior to the issue of that report local government auditors made a comprehensive submission to the inter-departmental committee set up to review the local government audit service. This submission included a recommendation that an annual report be made to the Government by the head of the audit service, which would be laid before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The main features of such a report suggested by the local government auditors were as follows: first, an account of the activity of the services in the year being reported on; second, audits conducted and reported on; third, an analysis of the main shortcomings highlighted by the auditors; fourth, targets for the following year and, finally, resource allocation, staff revision and a general financial report on the audit service. Local government auditors feel that this measure would serve the dual purpose of accounting to the Dáil for local authority expenditure while preserving the present accountability of local authorities to the local population.  It is worthwhile in this regard to draw attention to a recent extract from a report of the Scottish Audit Commission which states:</P>
    <P>Although parliament provides the funds for a large portion of local authority expenditure, it does so out of taxes levied upon the public and we consider therefore that public rather than parliamentary accountability is of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>By implication the suggestion of the audit commission was that accountability at local level was best achieved through local auditors.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a final point concerning the Committee of Public Accounts.  With the extension of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General the Dáil must take immediate steps to <Col N="1385" /> provide a proper level of support for the Committee of Public Accounts.  I agree with other speakers that an improvement here would in the long term save money. I outlined to the Dáil last week that there would have been an earlier revelation that all was not well in the Irish Sugar Company had it not been for the fact that the relevant Oireachtas committee were deflected from their task and did not have sufficient resources to complete their task in time.  It is vital that the Committee of Public Accounts be given the necessary resources to fulfil their task.  It is wrong that members of that extremely important committee do not have the staff support necessary to compensate for the time they spent on that committee.  It is unacceptable that the Oireachtas does not recognise the amount of time Members of the Oireachtas must spend on parliamentary committees if the committess are to be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of another committee &mdash; I paid tribute to my committee colleagues here last week &mdash; and we spend an endless amount of time teasing out reports but we get no recognition for that. For every hour we spend on that work we spend on hour less on our constituency work unless we work longer hours, and that is what we are doing.  It is unreasonable to expect members of committees to continue, without recognition and support, to devote an increasing amount of time to committee work.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Committee of Public Accounts, and other committees, have the right to compel witnesses to appear before them &mdash; I made this point last Friday.  There is nothing as frustrating as getting half way through a report and finding it impossible to compel a witness to appear before the committee to answer questions.  It makes a farce of the parliamentary oversight procedure. If such a procedure is to be satisfactory we should address that matter.</P>
    <P>Committees should also have the right to <i>subpoena</i> all documents.  It is very frustrating and wrong in a parliamentary democracy that even in the most important cases where documents may be confidential, parliamentary committees <Col N="1386" /> cannot have access to them.  It is important that committees have the right to request time in the Dáil for discussion of reports.  There is no point in producing reports of committees unless the Dáil is willing to debate them.  The Minister and the Government indicated that the knotty issues of privilege of witnesses and the <i>sub judice</i> rule are being addressed and this is welcome &mdash; the Minister refers specifically to this matter in the White Paper.  The resolution of these two issues is vital if we are to have a meaningful committee system and if the Committee of Public Accounts are to fulfil their expanded task.</P>
    <P>There is one other area that needs to be addressed &mdash; this point was made by Deputy De Rossa.  At present it is not possible for radio or television transmissions to take place directly from Dáil committees.  As we all realise, publicity is the life-blood of politics.  It is vital that the public are aware of the work of committees and accept that the Dáil is looking after their interests.  I cannot understand why cameras and microphones are excluded from the committee rooms.  After all, it is a constitutional principle that the work of the Dáil is done in public and that the public have access to it.  We recognised that when we allowed television cameras and radio into the House and the same should now be done in relation to parliamentary committees.</P>
    <P>With those quibbles &mdash; and they are really no more than quibbles &mdash; I commend this Bill to the House.  It is marvellous legislation.  The Minister and his officials should be commended on the Bill and I am sure it will have an easy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I too compliment the Minister for introducing the Bill.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I am very conscious of the committee's role.  Much of our work has been centred on accounting procedure, but more and more we are moving in the direction of ensuring that the Government &mdash; and indeed Departments &mdash; are getting value for money.  I should like <Col N="1387" /> to compliment all those involved in the Committee of Public Accounts, particularly the chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who has been an excellent chairman and very objective in his approach.  Deputy Spring said this morning that the committee are non-political, which is true, and much of the good work has been done because the emphasis has been on not involving the committee in politics.</P>
      <P>I also compliment not only the staff of the committee but all departmental officials and the secretaries of the various Departments who have appeared before the committee.  They were very forthright in answering questions which at times were very difficult.  I note that there are representatives of the Department of Finance in the House and I acknowledge the role they have played; they have been very helpful to all members of the committee.</P>
      <P>Many commercial firms have slogans on the bottom of their notepaper advertising their products and services.  I should like to see the slogan &ldquo;Never forget that the buck stops with the taxpayer&rdquo; on the bottom of notepaper used by Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies.  To ensure that the taxpayer does not get an unfair bill it is vital that there are systems of public accountability which match the way we spend money.  It is vital to have a system which will show that early projections do not match the invoices presented at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most notorious example is the Beef Tribunal.  Nobody asked the general public if they wanted to spend over £40 million to examine the workings of export credit insurance.  One political party, in an effort to damage the credibility of their partner in Government, decided to splurge taxpayers' money on this tribunal.  Nobody knows what the final costs will be but the indications are that the direct costs will be well in excess of £40 million.  Many lawyers will do very well out of the tribunal.  I am merely talking about direct costs.  How do we cost the time of perhaps 20 officials of <Col N="1388" /> the Department of Agriculture who have been taken off their normal important duties to feed this judicial animal?  I acknowledge the role of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, in the workings of the Department.  However, as agriculture is experiencing great difficulties, he and the Department could do with 20 extra officials.  If the end result of the tribunal meant that there would be a benefit to the unemployed in my constituency I would approve.  There is a very high level of unemployment in all constituencies.  What do the unemployed say about the tribunal?  Have they said that perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts are the vehicle which should have examined the allegations being examined by the Beef Tribunal?  After all, they elected us as their representatives to ensure that proper accounting procedures are maintained and proper value for money received on their behalf.</P>
    <P>If the result of the tribunal meant that the hard-pressed farmers of my constituency would benefit I would say that the expense of the tribunal was worth it. If it meant that people in my constituency in dire need of housing would benefit I would approve of the expense.  It is significant that the Minister introduced this Bill which will give more powers to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Like many of my colleagues, I maintain that the allegations made against various Members of this House in the Beef Tribunal should have been investigated by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Many people are unemployed, the businesses of others have failed, they do not have houses and cannot see a prospect of jobs for their children.  They must be asking whether the Houses of the Oireachtas should be accountable in relation to the allegations made.  Is it right that lawyers and civil servants should spend their time assessing these allegations while Members of this House have access to records and have the right and power to summon people before various committees, particularly the Committee of Public Accounts, to assess these <Col N="1389" /> charges?  I do not believe that anything will come out of this inquiry which will justify its cost.</P>
    <P>In future if allegations are made and there are calls by political parties to spend £40 million of taxpayers' money on examining allegations, the proper vehicle for doing so is the Committee of Public Accounts.  After all, we are paid to ensure policies are implemented and that the public are getting value for money.  I do not believe that any Member of the House could give me an example of an inquiry which has provided benefits to unemployed or homeless people, hard-pressed farmers and business people.  All that is clear at this stage is that the amount the tribunal was supposed to cost was grossly underestimated.  The tribunal is not the only thing which will cost the taxpayer a lot more than originally expected.  The Garda radio network was supposed to cost in the region of £3 million or £5 million but it will cost something closer to £30 million.  This was examined by the Committee of Public Accounts and brought to the attention of this House by that committee.  However, we did not have the resources necessary to address this problem in a more comprehensive manner.  There is an urgent need to allocate specific resources for members of the Committee of Public Accounts to ensure that they can identify any anomalies in the accounting procedures of any Department and, also, ensure that the various Departments get value for money.</P>
    <P>The Garda radio network was to have cost between £3 and £5 million but the cost to the taxpayer was close to £30 million.  That is not acceptable to the public or to the members of this House. The planning and management of that project was not good enough and we, as public representatives, should have ensured that the Committee of Public Accounts had the necessary resources to investigate and highlight this problem at an earlier stage, rather than when it was too late.  That occurred at a time when in our constituencies there is a shortage of housing and a lack of jobs.  It is frightening that a Government Department overspent by £26 million on a Garda <Col N="1390" /> radio network, and that we, as Members of this House, allowed that to happen. The Minister's proposal to extend the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts should, in future, ensure that such anomalies do not arise.</P>
    <P>Another example of a cost overrun or wasteful expenditure examined by the Committee of Public Accounts is the £300,000 spent on prison design fees or plans which were not used.  How could a business succeed if it spent more than £300,000 on plans that are never used? How could any small industry or shopkeeper justify spending such an amount on plans that are not used?  A sum of £750,000 was paid for the rent and rates of a building under-utilised by Telecom Éireann over a four year period.  That is a huge sum yet when we approach Ministers seeking money for the mentally handicapped or housing, we are told it is not available.  We do not have the facilities to examine Departmental budgets.  I hope this Bill will resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>The catalogue of overspending in various Departments goes on.  What does this indicate?  It indicates that we must have a fiscal policy service second to none here.  We must have the State's accounting procedures as up-to-date as possible. Every financial institution here has had to up-date their preventive measures against fraud in the past few years.  As fraud has become high tech., so also must fraud prevention become high tech. However, there is much more at issue here than fraud.  There is the problem of waste and inefficiency.  If we are to prevent the waste of taxpayers money we must have an up-to-date system and not depend on one that has existed for more than 100 years.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has a key role to play in the system of public accountability.  He is the key independent assurance to the Dáil that public money is being properly spent.  Now is the time to expand the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is also the right time to expand the role of the Committee of Public Accounts. Nobody can be in any doubt that we require a complete and up-to-date audit programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Too often when we discuss public finances, we talk about constraints, as if the amount of money available was all that mattered.  That is not true.  The value we obtain for money is crucially important. Just as businesses have to eliminate waste, the Government must eliminate the waste of taxpayers' money.  Just as businesses demand value for money, so the Government must demand value for taxpayers' money.  Just as good businesses introduce flexibility and react quickly to new demands and new challenges without using money inefficiently, so the Government must adapt in the same cost-effective way.  A modern, properly supported Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a vital requirement now.</P>
    <P>I hope that the proposals before the Dáil today will ensure that proper accounting procedures are maintained and that we, as representatives of the people, ensure that our constituents get value for money.</P>

    <P>As one who served on the Committee of Public Accounts some years ago, I recognise the value of the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, many people may well be unaware of his investigative powers. Some years ago when I was a member of the committee, a Secretary of a particular Department refused to produce a file to the Comptroller and Auditor General for examination by him.  The committee was told by the Comptroller and Auditor General that he was satisfied that to his knowledge the file in question did not contain anything of a security nature, despite the fact that it was a Department of Justice file.  The committee had to go before the House and obtain an order of the House that the file be produced to the Comptroller and Auditor General, which it was.  He was later satisfied to report to the Committee of Public <Col N="1392" /> Accounts that, in his view, there was nothing in the file which was of a security nature and which he should not have seen.  However, the same does not apply in other countries.  I remember that at the time it was pointed out that in the United States during the development of the Manhattan Project, which was the development of the atomic bomb, the Vice-President was not even aware of the work being carried on but the Comptroller and Auditor General of the United States had knowledge of this development, and the amount of money being spent on it.</P>
    <P>It is no harm for the public to realise the extent of the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General, bestowed on him by the State, to protect the interests of taxpayers.  There have been many cases illustrated over the years by the Comptroller and Auditor General of excessive expenditure.  In years past when the Office of Public Works undertook refurbishment work, equipment was hired rather than purchased.  The project ran beyond the time limit for completion.</P>
    <P>It would have cost less if the Office of Public Works had purchased the equipment instead of hiring it.  This overspending is indicative of the need for accountability of expenditure in respect of State institutions.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General can only work efficiently if it is properly staffed.  I urge the Minister to ensure that staff are appointed to the office to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate the expenditure of public sector moneys.  A great deal of taxpayers money is spent in the public sector covering many areas.  I am pleased that extra responsibility is being given to the Comptroller and Auditor General in recognition of the amount of work that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts has always been a member of the main Opposition party of the day.  I must commend my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for the way he has chaired that committee.</P>
    <P>At times it would have been politically <Col N="1393" /> advantageous for him to make political comments in relation to his duties but he did not do this.  He has not allowed himself, in his position as chairman of that committee, to be used in that manner by his own party or others.  The Committee of Public Accounts, and this House, are fortunate in having a man of Deputy Gay Mitchell's abilities as Chairman. He is a Deputy from my constituency and I commend him for his work on that committee.</P>
    <P>Most of the matters of concern to us were raised by Deputy Cullimore and others.  I commend the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I recognised the amount of work he has to do and that more staff are needed to carry out the duties of his office, to investigate the wide area of public expenditure.  I am glad I had an opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue.  As Deputy Briscoe said, we have seen over the years, particularly in recent years, the need to extend the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This Bill goes a long way towards doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts highlighted some of the major overspends. The Minister for Finance recognises that the annual allocation of funds often results in Government Departments being placed in financial difficulties. They may have embarked on the first phase of a five, six or ten phase project, as Deputy Cullimore said.  They may have embarked on design or other aspects of a project and may subsequently find that the capital expenditure to fund this work is not forthcoming.  They may have incurred excessive costs on aspects of projects that will be wasted and these costs may become the basis of serious criticism. That happened in many areas, including my constituency.  In relation to a prison, there was expenditure on design and other work but the project did not proceed. This is not an accountability matter, it is one of managing our finances from central Government in co-operation <Col N="1394" /> with other Government Departments. There is a need for a three to five year capital programme that would allow for greater medium to long term financial planning and would minimise the difficulties faced by Government Departments as a result of studies undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General or by the Committee of Public Accounts highlighting substantial costs incurred with no gain to the State or the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The main burden of tax is borne by the PAYE sector and greater accountability of how this money is spent is necessary. Those taxpayers have their incomes assessed weekly or monthly and they must contribute an exact amount in tax. The State has the power to extract taxes from their income.  Those taxpayers see the finances of the country managed in a different way, not involving the same transparency or accountability that is evident in the collection of their taxes.  They expect that, we as legislators, should vigorously support this Bill and have it dealt with as quickly as possible to ensure that finance is properly monitored.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the Minister has not taken on board the need to scrutinise the commercial State-sponsored bodies and the local authorities.  I do not believe it is sufficient that the State companies should only be scrutinised by the responsible Department or the Oireachtas Joint Committee to whom they report.  The Committee of Public Accounts can only find the stable after the horse has bolted and that is not sufficient.  Greater accountability of the management of the nation's affairs is necessary.  On Committee Stage we should consider an inter-linking, or some expansion of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to oversee the operations of State companies.</P>
    <P>In relation to local authorities, there is a very substantial annual outlay of funds. They are not as effectively dispersed as they might be.  There is greater potential for job creation and productivity in that area.  It should come under the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The potential for job creation by local authorities is being considered by the <Col N="1395" /> Committee on Employment.  There is need for action when one considers the finances that were being voted annually and there is need for accountability.  The provisions of the Bill should be extended to take in local authorities.  I do not know why a two dimensional arrangement is being entered into.  I do not understand why it cannot be dealt with under one heading or why the Department of Finance or the Minister on Committee Stage cannot take that responsibility on board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that health boards and educational institutions will be subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General and will, therefore, be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is desirable.  The sums of money that are voted annually under various headings to those bodies are very substantial.  Those institutions have a very important role to play in society and they should be accountable.</P>
    <P>Another move in that direction, the declaration of interests of Members of the House, is welcome.  The public will appreciate that there must be transparency and that the political system, Government Departments and various other members of the community charged with the disbursement of taxpayers' funds should be accountable.</P>

      <Quest>if she has satisfied herself that enough is being done to combat the growing number of obscene and malicious telephone calls, particularly to women; the response, if any, of Telecom Éireann to the suggested provision of a 24 hour freephone help line; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for taking action in relation to obscene and malicious telephone calls rests with the law enforcement authorities and, as I indicated in my reply to a similar question on 2 April 1992, I am satisfied that the statutory powers available to deal with such cases are adequate.</P>
      <P>As a result of discussions with Telecom Éireann on the matter, I am not satisfied that the provision of a 24-hour freephone helpline will do anything to reduce the number of such calls.  However, Telecom Éireann have informed me that the victims of such calls can get advice and information from any of Telecom Éireann's local offices and that the company try to help as far as possible the people who are affected by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the response from Telecom Éireann to the suggestion of a 24-hour help line is negative.  As a result of my raising this matter in the House on 2 April, I received a large number of telephone calls and letters which have assured me that the problem has been and is increasing.  The Minister told the House on the previous occasion that she had personal experience of malicious telephone calls.  I point out to the Minister that there would appear to be many people in this country who receive such telephone calls almost on a nightly basis &mdash; many of them in the middle of the night.  It seems that women in particular are affected.  They say that they are afraid to answer the telephone and they are afraid not to answer the telephone.  Under those circumstances would the Minister not agree that a service such as the helpline I have suggested should be provided to give victims some confidence that their problem is recognised and that there is an attempt to do something about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the previous <Col N="1397" /> occasion on which the Deputy raised this subject I advised him that I had been the victim of malicious telephone calls myself and that I was well aware that there are very many victims, particularly women, who are concerned about this malicious threat to them.  As I indicated to the Deputy that I would, I talked specifically to Telecom Éireann about the prospect of introducing a freephone help line.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out what is available to victims at the moment.  Victims are offered a change of telephone number.  Of course, people are also told by Telecom Éireann when they make a complaint that they should immediately raise the matter with the Garda.  Telecom Éireann can offer that kind of advice at any of their offices or through their existing freephone service, on No. 1800 500 500.  One way around the difficulty might be for me to ask Telecom Éireann to advertise the 1800 500 500 freephone number so that people know that that number is available for complaints about malicious telephone calls.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that a freephone help line of the kind requested by Deputy Currie might provide advice for the victim but could do very little about combating the number of such calls.</P>

Perhaps I feel a little more strongly about this issue than others because of my personal experience with this problem &mdash; granted, it was in another jurisdiction.  Because of that shared experience of both of us and knowing the trauma that these calls can cause in families and to women in particular, <Col N="1398" /> surely the Minister should consider taking additional action?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;rebalancing&rdquo; is one I would be careful with.  I shall be interested to discover what that word means.  The Government were so concerned about recent currency fluctuations that they introduced a £50 million market development fund.  Would the Minister agree that because Ireland is the only island community not linked to continental Europe our telecommunications charges should ideally be the lowest in Europe?  Our long distance telephone charges to Europe are 38 per cent above the EC average and its costs 44 per cent more for us to make a call to someone in the United States than for someone in the United States to call us.  In this regard <Col N="1399" /> we are talking about jobs.  Would the Minister agree that one of the Government's highest priorities &mdash; certainly until the past couple of days &mdash; has appeared to be the attraction and the creation of new jobs and that the reduction of telephone charges is a positive way in which that could be done?</P>

      <P>It is a Government priority to create jobs.  I accept the points made by Deputy Currie in relation to the high cost of international, cross channel and trunk call charges in Ireland. It is a result of that and because of the tremendous concern of the Government for job maintenance that I am examining urgently the proposals submitted to me by Telecom Éireann very recently.  I intend to take a policy decision urgently, which will be put to the Government, in relation to those matters.  Of the more than 1,072,000 customers of Telecom Éireann about 345,000 are business customers and I am very concerned about anything that might work to the disadvantage of those customers in the international market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5, 8, 26, 37, 39 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment by the Government of county enterprise boards will have a positive impact on local economic development.  The importance of tourism to local economies and the need for ongoing liaison and co-operation with the local tourism industry has been fully recognised with the amalgamation of the RTO functions with the new entities.</P>
      <P>There will be special arrangements to cater for tourism within the new structures. A current member of the local RTO will be appointed to each county enterprise board.  Each board will have a tourism manager.  A specialist tourism committee will be established within each board, and local industry members of the existing RTOs will become <i>ex officio</i> members of this committee.  Through its chairman and the new county/city tourism manager, the committee will report directly to the partnership board and its chief executive.  Each county will have a tourism advisory council representative of the local tourism industry, all of the local authorities and, where appropriate, the State sectors in tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism manager will prepare an <Col N="1402" /> integrated tourism development plan for his or her area following consultation with all relevant local tourism interests and State and semi-State agencies.  This plan, when sanctioned by the County Enterprise Partnership Board, will form part of the overall county action plan and tourism enterprises will have access to the wider enterprise funds which will be available under the new arrangements. The boards will provide an important new local basis and focus for tourism development, facilitating close co-operation between the tourism industry, local authorities and other tourism interests.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month I met the chairmen and managers of each of the six RTOs and I discussed with them the Government's intentions in regard to tourism and the new enterprise boards.  In the meantime a working group representative of the Department of the Taoiseach, my own Department, Bord Fáilte and RTO management and staff are examining the practical implementation of the Government decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the manner in which the six regional tourism boards were abolished devastated the board members and their staff?  Why were there no prior discussions which would have been normal in circumstances where there was a termination of such bodies?  Can the Minister say whether it is proposed to reprieve the Dublin Tourism Organisation, as stated in the press and, if so, why have the others been abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of the abolition of the regional tourism organisations.  It is merely an amalgamation of the regional tourism organisation functions with the new county enterprise partnership boards. During the past nine months I have travelled to tourism functions in different parts of the country.  The one aspect of tourism development with which I have been confronted on each occasion was that each local authority wanted to be allocated tourism functions.  That was not possible until we had the decision by the <Col N="1403" /> Government in relation to the county enterprise partnership boards.</P>
      <P>Another point which has to be borne in mind is that during the past number of years, as the Exchequer support through Bord Fáilte for regional tourism organisations did not increase, more and more of the time and effort of regional tourism organisations was spent in raising money from local and business interests in each region.  In fact one of the regional managers at their meeting with me went so far as to say they had their eye off the tourism ball because of the tremendous attention they had to give to the raising of funds privately.  We now have a system of county enterprise partnership boards aimed at economic development and the creation of jobs.  As tourism is the national priority industry for the creation of jobs it would be very foolish of the Government to have the enterprise partnership boards working in the tourism area and at the same time have another organisation working in the same area.  It is a more practical and efficient way of dealing with tourism development and for the first time it gives access and membership to each local authority on a county basis which they did not have up to now.</P>

Can the Minister outline to the House the level of consultation which took place with Bord Fáilte on the move to abolish the six regional tourism organisations?  Would the Minister not accept that if there is to be a comprehensive tourism plan for the country it needs to be on a regional basis and not on a county structure in view of what the <Col N="1404" /> Minister has said &mdash; that we will have at least 26 different bodies planning tourism on the international stage?  Would the Minister concede that the functions of the regional tourism organisations within the county structure will be so diluted as to be ineffective?</P>

      <P>In relation to the existing staff of the regional tourism organisations, I met with the chairmen and regional managers of all the regional tourism organisations earlier this month. The working group to which I have referred have met with IMPACT &mdash; the union representing the regional tourism organisation staff &mdash; on two occasions. On that working group both IMPACT and the regional tourism organisation staff are represented.  The discussions with IMPACT covered a number of areas &mdash; the security of employment and the ability of the enterprise boards to meet the wages bill in the short term.</P>
      <P>I already gave an undertaking to the regional tourism organisations that there would be no redundancies among permanent staff.  That guarantee has been reiterated by the working group, whose chairman has also indicated to IMPACT that there will be no worsening of the conditions of service for the permanent staff and that the transfer of staff to the enterprise board will not take place until funding for their wages is secured.  I could not give any commitment to the regional tourism organisation chairmen or regional managers when I met them regarding contract staff.  The working group are now in discussion with IMPACT and the regional tourism organisation staff to examine the position of contract staff.  The matter of seasonal staff will be discussed, as it used to be by the regional tourism organisations at that time of the year when they need to employ seasonal staff.  It will be a matter for the county enterprise partnership board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister refused to make any reference to the role of Bord Fáilte in all of this in spite of my question.  Can I put it to the Minister that this decision, so far as tourism is concerned, represents a watering down of the importance of tourism within the Irish economy?  I would refer the Minister to the three basic objectives of the county enterprise structures as announced by the Taoiseach.  He stated that their most important role was to help new and start-up businesses, to provide training and education and finally, community development.  In announcing the county enterprise structures the Taoiseach did not see fit to make reference to the role of tourism within the county structure. Yet the Minister can say with an air of confidence that she sees tourism having a more important role at county level than heretofore within the regional tourism organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it will have a more important role at county level.  There are several local authorities who were not represented on the previous regional tourism organisations. Every local authority in every county will have a representative voice on the county enterprise partnership boards.  In relation to the Taoiseach's announcement on the <Col N="1406" /> role of the county enterprise partnership boards, I said already that the main function of the county enterprise partnership boards is to help to create jobs.  If our priority nationally in creating jobs is tourism, then it also has to be the priority industry in the creation of jobs locally and on a county basis.  Therefore new and start-up businesses, education and training and community development have to be focused in one way or another on tourism.  It would be inefficient to leave tourism to one side and to allow the county enterprise partnership boards to go ahead and evolve proposals and plans in relation to job creation while forgetting about the main targeted industry for job creation.</P>

      <P>I intend taking Questions Nos. 7, 14, 23, 35 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was appointed Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in February last, there was a number of important issues on my desk, <Col N="1410" /> among which was the Shannon stop issue. Within days of my appointment, I embarked on the process of consultations with all sides in the debate on this important and far reaching issue.  I met with Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Bord Fáilte, Ryanair, Shannon Development, the Shannon Status Committee which represents tourism, commercial and industrial interests, Dublin and Galway Chambers of Commerce, ICTU, SIGNAL &mdash; representing the Shannon workforce, Irish Airline Pilots' Association, the Dublin Lord Mayor's Committee on the economy and Fly Dublin Direct Committee.  In addition, I both met with and received submissions from a large number of private individuals who made their views on the matter known to me.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I was asked by all concerned to review the matter in such a way that whatever decision was taken would be in the best long term interests of the airport and the region.  Many investors were concerned that a short term decision would create a climate of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised for an undue delay in taking a decision on the Shannon stop issue.  I categorically reject this criticism. There were two very valid reasons for not submitting proposals before now: first, I wanted to consider carefully the implications for Ireland of recent US initiatives in relation to their air transport policy and secondly, I acceded to a request from the Chairman of Shannon Development to postpone a decision until he had concluded discussions with local interests.  These discussions have only been concluded recently.</P>
    <P>Within a week of receiving these two crucial inputs, I presented proposals to Government and achieved remarkably speedy agreement to the strategy I outlined on Tuesday last.  I announced then that the Government, on the basis of proposals I put to them, had taken a decision in the matter.  This decision starts with a commitment by the Government to further investment in transport infrastructure in the west and mid-west regions.  The Government have reaffirmed their commitment to make Shannon <Col N="1411" /> a major aviation centre, with the retention of the Shannon stopover.  Fundamentally, this decision ensures that jobs in Shannon and along the western seaboard are preserved and that new jobs can be created.  It does not endanger a single job anywhere else.</P>
    <P>To further develop Shannon Airport, I am setting up a special traffic development task force for the airport with a budget of £1 million over the next two years.  The task force will have an independent chairperson.  Aer Rianta and Shannon Development will be represented by their chief executives and one other designated senior staff member from each body.</P>
    <P>The Government have also approved proposals for new transport development plans for the west and mid-west regions to be drawn up by me and my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for the Marine.  This will be done in the context of the forthcoming National Plan, to be co-financed by EC Structural and Cohesion Funds.  There will be a substantially increased investment in transport infrastructure in the west and mid-west regions.  Not only will this enhance the attractiveness of Shannon Airport itself but will also ensure that these regions will not be so dependent on the airport to achieve their development potential in future.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the decision to retain the Shannon stop-over is not only in the best interests of Aer Lingus, but is very much in line with concerns expressed by tourism interests, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Joint President of SIPTU and the Bishops' Forum on the Development of the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that this much delayed decision would never have had to be made if it had not been for the fact that her predecessor irresponsibily threw doubt on the entire issue?  May I ask the Minister if, having made that very sensible decision, she now has any plans to take steps to deal with the main part of the issue, that is, renegotiate the bilateral agreement between Ireland and the US in order to gain more access points in North America, the only way we are going to gain more traffic?</P>

      <P>First, I thank the Minister for retaining the stop-over at Shannon Airport.  I acknowledge that the problem was not of her making, rather that she inherited it from her predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  The question mark which has hung over Shannon for the past three years as a result of the indecision of the Minister's predecessor caused much damage to the region.  Would the Minister consider getting together with the Minister for Finance <Col N="1413" /> and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to examine the difficulties being experienced by people in the tourism and industrial sectors in the region? Some of these people failed to secure finance while others could not go ahead with their plans because they were unsure about the future level of tourist traffic through the region.  In addition to the steps being taken by her in conjunction with the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for the Environment in terms of setting up a transport task force, would the Minister consider setting up another task force to deal with the damage which has been caused to the industrial and tourism sectors in the region?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that there is a necessity to have such a task force because the State company, Shannon Development, have responsibility for the areas mentioned by the Deputy.  Of course I will be delighted to have discussions with both my ministerial colleagues in relation to any assistance we can give to Shannon Development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave it as her understanding that the decision on the Shannon stop-over was in the best interests of Aer Lingus.  For from being in the best interests of Aer Lingus, this will be cold comfort for the company, having regard to the very serious crisis facing Aer Lingus at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further question on the Aer Lingus problem. I dealt with it on the Adjournment earlier this week and for a three-hour period over the last two nights.  The concern of Aer Lingus in relation to the Shannon stop goes back to the late eighties and the beginning of 1990 when the company approached the Minister and the Government asking the Government to negotiate on their behalf landing rights with the US authorities at Los Angeles Airport. They did so on the basis of existing Government policy which included the Shannon stop.  In September 1990 those rights were secured for Aer Lingus and <Col N="1414" /> Irish airlines by the Government.  The company then produced detailed, costed arrangements by way of an application to the Minister, the Department and the Government for the acquisition of aircraft to service that route.  They did that once again on the basis of accepting totally existing Government policy which included the Shannon stop.  Permission to acquire the airport was given to the company, who proceeded to acquire the aircraft.  Within 12 months the management of the company stated publicly that the company could not operate the route without a change in Government policy.  In the latest proposals which have been presented to the board, and which seem to have found their way into the public domain, the best option put forward by management to the board for Aer Lingus as a company is the retention of the Shannon stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the object of the Shannon stop-over is to create jobs in the Shannon region without taking jobs from anywhere else.  That is a ludicrous statement.  Jobs are being lost and will be lost in the Dublin area.  Has the Minister taken into account the serious environmental factors in respect of the Shannon stop-over, issues such as airline safety and the diminution of personal choice, which is now the lot of people wanting to travel in either direction between here and the United States?</P>

      <P>Regarding airline safety, I hope Deputy Garland is not raising doubts about the safety of Shannon Airport.  If he is, I must reject any such suggestion out of hand.  He claims that people do not have a choice. <Col N="1415" /> Two-thirds of people travelling from the US to Ireland alight at Shannon.  Those people are voting with their feet.  Much has been made of the fact that business people often travel via London to the USA, making a stop-over at London rather than at Shannon.  The reasons are several.  Business people, individually and collectively through their organisations, have told me in recent months that they do this for convenience purposes and secondly because of the vast number of destinations in the USA served out of London.  Many business people who work in the financial services industry travel out of London because they use Concorde, but many of them return on the late night flight from New York or Boston to Shannon.  They can sleep overnight and arrive in their offices in time to do business the following day.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concern in the small towns and villages and large suburbs of north County Dublin, villages like Lusk, Malahide and Swords where every second house has an employee of Aer Lingus?  What comfort is there for the region of Dublin and its hinterland?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Flaherty is suggesting that there have been job losses in the past and that there will be more job losses in the future because of the Shannon stop policy, perhaps she will provide me with figures to prove the case.  It has not been proven. In relation to regional policy, this is a very unbalanced, lopsided country. During the past few months when we were campaigning in the Maastricht referendum many of us made frequent use of the European buzz word &ldquo;subsidiarity,&rdquo;<Col N="1416" /> which means the development of the regions.  It would be ludicrous for a Government or a party to talk about subsidiarity in the European context if they were not prepared to talk about it at home.  That means balanced regional development.

On the other hand, the Minister is pursuing, with the full support of the Fine Gael group, a policy of part privatisation. Would the Minister not agree that the policy of part privatisation and the supposed permanency of the Shannon stop-over are contradictory, in that as soon as private interests are involved with Aer Lingus, that will sound once and for all the deathknell of the compulsory Shannon stop-over?

      <Quest>the likely implications for the tourist industry of the substantial increase in the value of the Irish pound against sterling, particularly if the current exchange rate is maintained into the tourist season for 1993; the plans, if any, she has for specific measures to assist the industry in view of these difficulties; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>We were most fortunate that the 1992 peak tourism season was almost over before the recent turbulence in international currency markets.</P>
      <P>Given the almost daily fluctuations in recent weeks in the value of the pound sterling it is too early, at this stage, to attempt to estimate the level at which the sterling to Punt exchange rate is likely to stabilise and where it will stand next spring at the beginning of the 1993 tourist season.  Neither is it possible at this stage to quantify the impact on the British market for Irish holidays next year which will be also affected by a number of other factors including the general state of the British economy, consumer spending levels, comparative inflation rates, etc.</P>
      <P>The matter is being kept under constant review in what is an evolving situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that with a 10 or 15 per cent differential between sterling and the punt, this is the time to start worrying about the tourism industry next year?  Brochures are being prepared and next year's prices are being calculated.  Would the Minister not agree that this is the time to offer incentives for British tourists, whom we are trying to attract?  Does the Minister have any plans to build in incentives to keep up tourist numbers and would she consider, as a global incentive to tourists, the incorporation of the petrol coupon scheme?</P>

      <P>All of those issues are, ones which, first of all, Bord Fáilte are discussing with the industry representative whom they are meeting today.  The executive chariman of Bord Fáilte will be coming to see me next week in the light of those discussions to present for consideration proposals that Bord Fáilte might have in regard to the UK market next year.</P>
      <P>However, there are swings and roundabouts in the whole currency fluctuation. We have been fortunate in that the major source of growth in Irish tourism in recent years has been in mainland Europe which is outside the sterling area.  While the IR£1 has strengthened against the £1 sterling it has weakened against other major currencies, for example, the US dollar, the Deutsche Mark, the French Franc and the Dutch Guilder, all of which represent important markets for Irish tourism. Mainland Europe has been the real market for Irish tourism since 1987 with traffic increasing by over 115 per cent and revenue almost trebling to come within 8 per cent of the British figure by the end of 1991.  Again, this year, even in a relatively bad year, growth from continental Europe is again ahead of the UK growth. It would not be fair to say that all of our tourism eggs are in the one basket in that the growth that has happened took place in continental Europe where the IR£1 has weakened, and that is very helpful in relation to the marketing that will be done by Bord Fáilte at this time of the year for the next tourist season.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been disappointingly vague in her response to a direct question.  I would put it to the Minister that now is the time, for forward planning so that next spring, at the start of the tourist season proper, she will have a set of proposals in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister accept that the car hire industry is an important aspect of our tourism industry that has been particularly badly hit and will continue to suffer due to the currency fluctations?  I put it to the Minister that if we accept in the House that any form of devaluation is out, the 10 per cent appreciation of the <Col N="1419" /> IR£1 represents a real threat to attracting holiday makers from the UK to this country. It is not sufficient to simply say, as the Minister says, that we should look at the swings and roundabouts and that what we lose in the UK we can pick up elsewhere.  That response is simply not good enough.  I would ask her what plans she has for next year, having regard to the fact that the gap between the value of the IR£1 and the pound sterling shows no sign of narrowing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan cannot have it both ways.  Just a couple of minutes ago he was accusing me of not consulting with the industry in relation to the regional tourist organisations and not consulting with Bord Fáilte.  I explained very clearly when I was answering a moment ago that Bord Fáilte had met the industry representatives today to specifically talk about the UK situation in relation to next year and the marketing proposals that it must now put together very urgently.  I said that the executive chairman of Bord Fáilte is coming in to see me next week to discuss with me the proposals that Bord Fáilte have and indeed to listen to various proposals that I have to put to Bord Fáilte about initiatives that could be taken in relation to marketing in the UK market.</P>
      <P>The Deputy accuses me of being vague.  I think it is important to be able to establish from the industry itself where it sees specific problems arising, whether in the area of car hire or elsewhere. Therefore, it is important that we have a package of proposals that we put together to cope with the currency difficulties in relation to sterling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the area of real growth has been in continental <Col N="1420" /> Europe and not in the North Atlantic. However, would the Minister not agree that, having debated the Shannon stop-over and also the 767 aircraft that are flying on contract to other companies in the ownership of Aer Lingus, what exactly does she propose to do about the North Atlantic tourism trade, given that with the devaluation of the British £1 Great Britain will now be seen by the North American market as being more attractive than the Republic?  The question was what specific measures the Minister had to assist the industry in view of the difficulties?  Has she no specific measures in mind?  The Minister sat on the question of Shannon stop-over for the whole duration of her Ministry. Would she please make some decisions now in favour of next year's tourism industry which must be made now particularly in relation to the North Atlantic?</P>

      <P>In relation to the UK market, I have already indicated to Deputy Flanagan and others that I am considering this matter with the greatest urgency and moving on it as quickly as possible with the support of the industry and the State organisation who deal with the industry on our behalf.  At this stage the Deputy can be assured that every initiative that is felt to be necessary is being taken to ensure that this very important market for Ireland, the UK market, will be handled efficiently and effectively to retain our share of that market in the next season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 10, 25, 43, 47, 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt comprehensively with the matters raised in these questions both in the course of the Adjournment Debate which took place on Wednesday of last week and during my contribution on Tuesday of this week during Private Members' Time which resulted in this House confirming its support for the Government's air transport policy.  I will, however, reiterate my position.</P>
      <P>I have been deeply concerned for some time at the continuing deterioration in the financial performace of Aer Lingus, particularly in its core air transport business. I have repeatedly made this concern known to the chairman and management of the airline.  I have consistently emphasised that it is the responsibility of the board of Aer Lingus to ensure that the commercial and operational strategies pursued are sufficient to ensure the airline's financial viability.</P>
      <P>The board, as a first step towards bringing the air transport business out of losses to a position of profitability, are currently carrying out a fundamental and wide-ranging appraisal of their transport business.</P>
      <P>I met with the board of Aer Lingus on this day week.  I made clear my deep concern at the fact that the air transport division of Aer Lingus had lost over £80 million in the past two years and is facing further major losses again this year.  This is despite a cost reduction programme which my prodecessor was assured would get the airline into a breakeven situation. This programme was introduced almost two years ago to counteract the effects of the economic recession and the Gulf War.  It was still being negotiated into this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> I have been criticised for not giving specific proposals to the board of Aer Lingus to solve the airline's problems.  It is quite correct to say that I have not done so.  That is the responsibility of the board.  When the board has produced specific proposals then I, as the shareholder's representative, will carefully examine them.</P>
    <P>The Government made it very clear when Aer Lingus were looking for approval to acquire aircraft that the acquisitions had to be funded without recourse to Government equity or State guarantees of borrowing.  This condition was accepted by the board of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if Aer Lingus's European fleet had been replaced in a more gradual manner over a longer period of years, the current problems might not be so serious.  Aer Lingus's current problems highlight the need for the company to strengthen its corporate planning procedures, particularly in a cyclical business such as commercial air transport.  I have urged them to do so.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, the Minister for Finance has already made clear on several occasions that the position of the Exchequer finances is such that the Government are currently not in a position to invest additional equity in semi-State companies, including Aer Lingus. In any event, such investment would not make sense unless the airline can produce a credible plan showing that its business will be operated profitably so as to produce a return on any investment.  As I have already said, the days of free equity are gone.  It is precluded in any event by EC competition rules.</P>
    <P>Both I and my predecessors have over the years encouraged.  Aer Lingus to develop linkages with foreign airlines with a view to improving access to international markets as well as achieving additional earnings in areas such as maintenance, overhaul and training.  These objectives can be achieved in a variety of ways, such as minority cross investments, joint venture agreements and service contracts.  No proposals for such minority cross-investments or joint venture agreements <Col N="1424" /> have been received by me.  I have always made it clear that, if such a proposal were to emerge, I would give it every support.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister made no reference to the subject matter of Question No. 4 let me put the question to her again.  Has she or the Government given any consideration, or approval, to the prospect of selling any shareholding in Aer Lingus?  May I also ask the Minister if she would elaborate on a comment made by the Taoiseach to the effect that it is very important for Aer Lingus to find a partner?  May I put it to her that it is simply not on for Aer Lingus in the current climate to find a partner along the lines envisaged by the Taoiseach?  May I also ask the Minister if she would avail of an opportunity to dissociate herself from remarks attributed to her in the media?  It was reported that these remarks were made at a meeting of a Fianna Fáil transport committee at which she is supposed to have said that if she cannot get a board which will work in the interests of the Government, she will fire the board with which she is not satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say in response to the Deputy's first supplementary question that the Government have not considered the prospect of selling any shareholding in Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's second supplementary question concerning the Taoiseach's comment that Aer Lingus need to find a partner, I would remind Deputy Flanagan of something I have said twice, both inside and outside the House, this week, that is, that the Taoiseach made that comment at a time when he was Minister for Finance.  It was repeated by my predecessor on several occasions to the chief executive, the <Col N="1425" /> chairman and senior management of Aer Lingus.  When I became Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications I suggested also that the company should look at that possibility.  Therefore it is not something that is being suggested to the company for the first time, and when they are confronted by a financial crisis.</P>
    <P>I would also remind the Deputy that in 1977 the then Fianna Fáil Government launched the &ldquo;European&rdquo; campaign the specific purpose of which was to alert both public and private companies to the fact that they would face increased competition from 1 January 1993 in the context of the single European Market.  We did not want public and private companies to find themselves confronted with a situation on the eve of the Single Market where they had to face this competition having made no preparations to deal with it.  It is my understanding that despite this Aer Lingus have not put any specific proposals to the board &mdash; I am open to correction on this &mdash; that they should find a partner or enter a joint venture or strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the comments attributed to me and reportedly made at a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party committee, unless Deputy Flanagan becomes a member of the Fianna Fáil transport committee he will never know what I or anybody else said at that committee meeting.  Like Deputy Flanagan, I always say to Members of the House that remarks attributed to people and quoted later in the newspapers have to be taken with a large grain of salt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the crisis confronting Aer Lingus affects not only the company and their workforce but also the rest of the country and the Government, in particular?  The Minister must do far more than merely encourage, exhort and pressure the board.  She also has an obligation to lead and to find a way forward.

      <P>Since, I became Minister last February, I have met with the Chairman and the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus on a number of occasions.  Indeed, I have met the Chairman of Aer Lingus more often, and at greater length, than I have met with the chairman of any other State company under the aegis of my Department.  I have met the Chairman of Aer Lingus on several occasions since the end of August.  I have indicated strongly both to him and to the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus that they have to face up to the severe financial crisis confronting the company.  As Deputy Dukes who has served on a previous Government will realise, no Minister can direct the board of a State company to carry out a particular activity; that is a matter for the board of the company concerned acting on the advice of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board have yet to present me, for presentation to the Government, with specific proposals to deal with the present financial crisis confronting the company. Since last February, in all the discussions I have had, I have indicated strongly that the company should look at a number of proposals, including the one issue which is causing most financial difficulty for Aer Lingus, that is, the suicidal fare war on the Dublin/London route.  I have indicated strongly to both airlines operating on that route that something needs to be done to stop the haemorrhage, in Aer Lingus in particular, that that service is causing.  That is the most important issue that the board of Aer Lingus have to face up to.  If one's company are losing money one must address the area in which most money is being lost.  The board assured me last Thursday at the conclusion of my meeting with them that after their November meeting they will present me with specific proposals to deal with the <Col N="1427" /> financial crisis confronting the company. I await those proposals.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly, many of the difficulties being experienced by Aer Lingus have arisen from the cost of fleet replacement, a problem which will be further exacerbated as more fleet is replaced.  May I ask the Minister if she has considered at any stage, given that this is an island nation, the possibility of meeting with the EC Commissioner to seek either Structural Funds or Cohesion Funds for the purpose of fleet replacement, in particular to meet the cost of the two aircraft that Aer Lingus have already purchased?  A special case can be made given that as an island nation, we are in a different position from that of the other EC member states which can receive funds for the construction of highways. However to get to another member state we have to traverse by either sea or air.  Would the Minister consider making such a case?</P>

      <P>An application for assistance for mobile assets, which would include air and sea transport, was made by my predecessor but this was turned down by the European Commission.  I have resubmitted this application.  The Commission has sought extra information and this has been provided. Given that this is an island nation, as mentioned by Deputy Taylor-Quinn, and taking into account the cost disadvantages for manufacturers and industrialists at present, I have lost no opportunity to push the Commissioner responsible, Mr. Van Miert, and the Commission to favourably consider Ireland's application for assistance for <Col N="1429" /> mobile assets under the Structural Funds or the peripherality programme.  I have lost no opportunity in pushing that case very strongly and I will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the tourist industry is the main industry targeted by Government.  Does she recognise the core role played by Aer Lingus in tourism generation?  Will the Minister comment on the statement by SIPTU that there is no partner waiting to bail out Aer Lingus?  If no partner is found and she refusees to provide additional State investment in Aer Lingus, how can she envisage the retention of jobs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise fully the role Aer Lingus play, in cooperation with Bord Fáilte and other State agencies, in relation to tourism and marketing.  The Government made a decisions since last February that each of our State agencies abroad, particularly in the United States, should come together in one building in the various cities to market Ireland as a whole.  In that way tourism would not be left to Aer Lingus or Bord Fáilte on their own, or indeed to CIE International Tours who have a substantial presence in the United States. Every State agency abroad would deal with all aspects of the Irish economy, including tourism.  In relation to the SIPTU statement that there is no partner available, I said already that Aer Lingus have not put specific proposals to me. The airline told me that they have spoken to a number of airline companies and others who may be interested in a partnership, and when they bring forward their proposals in November I presume they will give details of those discussions, what companies they had discussions with and what the outcome was.</P>

      <P>Why is the Minister so coy about giving a direction to Aer Lingus when she had no hesitation earlier this year in directing them very firmly to keep their mouths shut.  Will the Minister try to persuade Aer Lingus that leasing might be a better option for fleet replacement <Col N="1430" /> in present, and probably future, circumstances than purchase, which is the direction the company have taken up to now?  Would the Minister not agree that it is virtually impossible for Aer Lingus to expect that they can do an equity deal with another company as long as their present statutory position exists whereby the Government are the sole shareholder? Would the Minister not agree that a change in the legislation might open up the possibility of finding an equity partnership to ease the company out of their problems?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that the direction I gave to Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte related specifically to the Shannon stop-over policy &mdash; a matter of policy is the responsibility of the Government &mdash; and not to the day-to-day operational matters of the company.  As regards fleet replacement, I said already that concern was expressed by the government at the time the company requested permission to replace the European fleet, but eventually approval was granted to the company in this regard.  I said that had the replacement taken place on a much more gradual basis the present serious problems would not exist.  In relation to the 767s, the fleet on the north-Atlantic route was replaced by way of lease.  On the final aspect of Deputy Dukes's supplementary, whether or not the legislation should be changed to allow for another shareholder rather than have a 100 per cent shareholding by the State, that is a matter that may be considered at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it then that the Minister is considering the matter?  I welcome the Minister's statement about seeking the support of the European Commission as regards funding for fleet replacement, particuarly on the north-Atlantic route which will be of great importance in the next three years.  To continue along the line pursued by Deputy Madeleine Taylor-Quinn on the question of Ireland's peripheral position in the European Community, I would put it to the Minister that, in spite of what <Col N="1431" /> she said regarding competition laws, a case could be made to the Commission to permit the Irish Government to inject equity into Aer Lingus.  Having regard to what the French and Belgian Governments did recently, there is a precedent for that.  Considering that European competitions laws were relaxed to suit Belgium and France, surely, having regard to our peripheral location in the European Community, the Minister would have an even stronger case to make for Ireland.  Why will the Minister not pursue that angle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, no consideration has been given by the Government to the matter of the shareholding.  The application by the Irish Government to the EC for mobile assets for air and sea transport is being pursued vigorously by myself, my Department officials and the officials permanently based in Brussels who represent the Irish Government.  We have made the case as strongly as possible and will continue to do so on the basis that we are the most peripheral country in the European Community.  In relation to European competition rules, the European Commission precluded the Spanish Government from injecting further capital into Iberia on the basis that it would distort competition.  That is the difficulty facing us now.  The Deputy can be assured that every avenue possible is being explored and vigorously sponsored by me as Minister and by all the officials on behalf of this country who are working with me.</P>

That would give us a chance to discuss the proposals in full.  I agree with the Ceann Comhairle's ruling in banning the word &ldquo;handbagging&rdquo; in this House.  I did not use that phrase last night because members of my party would not allow me to use such a sexist expression, although it was widely used on the floor <Col N="1432" /> of the House.  The Minister has been well capable of dealing with Opposition speakers down the years and many of us come out second best with her.  However, we will not use that word in future.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the level of safety being excercised at present by Iarnród Éireann at manuallyoperated railway level crossings.  Over the past ten years, the annual total of level crossing accidents notified to my Department by the company has decreased from a peak of 60 in 1982 to an average of 26 for the ensuring nine years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann have a programme for reducing hazards at these crossings and inspections are carried out at regular intervals by the company's staff.  Users of accommodations and occupation level crossings have also been issued with guidelines for safe use of these crossings and meetings between Iarnród Éireann and the IFA and the ICMSA are held regularly.  Initiatives taken in the past few years to increase safety at manually <Col N="1433" /> operated level crossings include; ten crossings on DART system automated and provided with warning lights and bells and full barriers; 18 crossings, system-wide, automated and provided with warning light and bells and half barriers; three crossings, system-wide, automated and provided with warning lights and bells; eight crossings, system-wide, provided with warning lights and bells and manually operated barriers; and the designation, layout and system of operation of about 50 attended public road level crossings have been altered.</P>
    <P>Safety at level crossings generally is monitored by a working group who met under the aegis of my Department.  The group also have representation from the Department of the Environment, the Garda Síochána, Éireann and Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have been informed by the Chairman of CIE that Iarnród Éireann will continue to take all necessary action to eliminate identified hazards at manually operated level crossings with the objective of further reducing the level crossings accident rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Will she accept that the manual level crossing is inherently dangerous? How many manually operated crossings are on our mainline rail services between Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick and Dublin-Sligo? Will she agree that it is extremely important, not only that periodic checks take place, but that a system of advance warning lights and bells is installed on every manual crossing, having regard to bad weather conditions in winter, particularly fog, and the inherent dangers for farmers who do not have any other option in many instances but to take their animals over mainline rails operated by manual crossings?</P>

      <P>There are about 2,700 manually operated gates at level crossings, I am referring to public roads on the Iarnród Éireann system. There are attendants at many of the 300 crossings on the public roads and the gates about which Deputy Flanagan is <Col N="1434" /> concerned at the 2,400 accommodation crossings must be opened and closed by users.  Of course I am concerned and that is why Iarnród Éireann have worked so closely with the two main farming organisations &mdash; the ICMSA and the IFA &mdash; to ensure that they get the message in relation to safety and the importance of closing the gates immediately after using the crossing.  That is why it is so important to have continuing dialogue.  I am happy to have been able to report to the House the various improvements which have taken place up and down the country in Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>I intend taking Questions Nos. 12, 24, 31 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The six regional airports, which are all privately owned, have each submitted to my Department plans to upgrade infrastructures and facilities at the airports and to strengthen the economies of the regions serviced by these airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government regard the network <Col N="1436" /> of regional airports in the State as being of fundamental importance in meeting the tourism and transport needs of our most peripheral regions and, accordingly, a major capital investment programme for the development of regional airports was announced in 1991, coupled with investment programmes for tourism, services and industry.</P>
    <P>The regional airports are all relatively recent in origin.  Many of the start-up services at the airports have been badly hit by international recession, particularly the recession in the UK, to and from which most services operate.  In addition, low fares on the Dublin/ London route have attracted traffic from regional airports.</P>
    <P>I have already voiced my opinion in this House that the fares policies on the Dublin-London route are suicidal in the long term and I have asked the companies involved to address this issue.  The regional airports have also expressed their concerns to me and my predecessors in this regard.  In response, a special marketing fund was set up in March 1991 under the operational programme for tourism for the marketing of air services to and from the regional airports.  The fund is administered by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Up to £500,000 in European Regional Development Fund aid is available to match expenditure by airports and airlines for promotion and marketing purposes. I am disappointed that take-up on this assistance has been negligible to date.  In September 1992, I sought the approval of the EC Commission for the use of funds under the operational programme on peripherality for capital grants to the airport companies to strengthen their balance sheets or for subsidies to cover operational losses.  The EC Commission again refused my application on the grounds that European Regional Development Fund funds could not be used for such purposes.</P>
    <P>In October 1992, I sought increased funds for the purpose of promoting regional airport services.  This was also rejected principally on the grounds that a fund for marketing already existed in the operational programme for tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> I am currently trying to assess whether there is any source of funding to help tide the regional airports over their current problems.  I am, however, very anxious that the current marketing fund be drawn down in full so that the regional airports will be in a position to take advantage of renewed traffic growth when this occurs. The regional airports are part of the economic infrastructure of the regions which they serve and bring important benefits to the regions, particularly by providing quick access points for tourists.  In view of this, I hope that local business and commercial interests in the regions will support the regional airport companies in their present difficulties and ensure that the full marketing funds are drawn down.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputies will accept that these measures reflect my commitment, and the Government's commitment, to the maintenance and development of the regional airports.  However, we must recognise that in the first instance, the development of traffic is a matter for the airports, while the operation of air services to and from the regional airports is a matter for the air carriers concerned having regard to the economic viability of particular routes.  While I will give every encouragement I can, I have no powers to compel carriers to continue to operate particular services or to introduce new services.</P>
    <P>In the light of Ryanair's recent decision to discontinue scheduled services from Galway, Waterford and Kerry to London (Stansted), I made it widely known that I was anxious to see new operators replace them.  I received a proposal from a new Irish airline, Airbridge Ireland Ltd., who are seeking to commence operations from Waterford, Galway and Kerry to Luton and London Stansted.  I am pleased to inform the House that I have given my approval, in principle, for this proposal, subject to the operator meeting my Department's financial, technical and operational requirements.  I have also given Aer Arann approval to operate a new scheduled service between Galway and London Stansted.</P>
    <P>I understand that a number of UK <Col N="1438" /> airlines may be looking at operating services to the regional airports.  The licensing of a UK airline to operate any such services would be a matter in the first instance for the UK authorities. However, I have let it be known that I would welcome such services and automatically license any such operator.</P>

      <P>I dealt comprehensively in my initial reply with the supplementary questions which Deputy McCormack asked.  However, for his further clarification, there is a sum of £500,000 in the promotion marketing fund which is available but it needs to be backed by commercial and financial support in all regions to keep the airports in operation.  That would involve, for instance, pointing out opportunities to airlines and bringing to the notice of potential airline operators the facilites available at the various airports, engaging in market research, including profiles of users of the airport and marketing services to customers such as tour operators, travel agents and local businesses. I want to see the available sum used in full but it needs to be backed up and supported by the local business interests. I have no doubt that the airport with which Deputy McCormack and I are most familiar &mdash; the regional airport in Galway &mdash; will, when one looks at the tremendous support there has been already from the commercial business interests in the city, attract the same level of support in helping to facilitate the airport company to use at least some of the money available in the marketing fund.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that the marketing fund upon which she places such emphasis is seriously flawed without a marketing body.  Will the Minister take steps to set up an overall marketing <Col N="1439" /> body that will distribute the marketing fund?  Will the Minister also confirm that the two airline policy is now in tatters and that the future of Ryanair is fundamental to the continued operation of regional airports?  Will the Minister also give the House her views on whether she regards the number of regional airports at present in operation in the State as sufficient?  Will the Minister outline her policies on the need for extra regional airports if that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer Deputy Flanagan's first question, we already have an overall marketing body, as I indicated in my first response, which distributes the marketing development fund.  What I am now looking for is that the local regional airports, which are all private companies over which I have no control, would draw down from the marketing development fund.  They can do that by getting the support of local business and commercial interests, which many of them have done.</P>
      <P>In answer to the second question, I am happy that we have a reasonable spread of regional airports.  We should now concentrate on establishing them firmly, encouraging them to draw down the funds for marketing the services that are available at the airports to carriers, passengers, tour operators and travel agents. The level of support that each of the regional airports has received from the Government and the European Community is an indication of the high value we place on the establishment, direction and infrastructure that exists in the regional airports.</P>

      <P>Cuidím leis an mBille seo, Bille i leith an Ardreachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste.  Mar a deir an seanfhocal, más maith is mithid.  Táimid ag plé na ceiste seo ó 1986 i leith, agus luaitear go bhfuil sé in am dúinn scóip obair an Ardreachtaire a oiriúnú don ré seo.  Téann na rialacha, na hAchtanna agus na horduithe siar go dtí 1866.  Tá géarghá leis an reachtaíocht seo agus cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille.</P>
      <P>The opening paragraph of the explanatory memorandum states that the purpose of the Bill is to bring the legislation governing national audit up to date on the basis of a review carried out of developments in this country and abroad and to consolidate existing legislation relating to the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will ensure greater accountability for public expenditure and foster better public administration.  The Government, in this regard, are also publishing a White Paper which sets out the background to the legislation.  For many years, but particularly since 1986, we have been discussing the need to establish the activities of the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose functions are governed by legislation that goes as far back as 1866.  While we have been advancing legislation, as was required, down through the years this most important function of the operation of Government and of finance and was not attended to.  The day of reckoning has arrived.  We are all aware of occasions in recent times where, if we had had the benefit of proposed legislation in the Bill of the kind as suggested in the White Paper, much of the discomfort, and I put it as mildly as that, of the cases of appropriation of <Col N="1489" /> funds, how deals were done, how sites were sold and huge profits made, would have been avoided.  These incidents have highlighted the urgent need for this Bill and for the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The nature of the audit process carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be extended to include, at his discretion, statutory examination of economic efficiency and management effectiveness.  The range of bodies to be covered by the audit and examination process will include, as usual, Government Departments and non-commercial State bodies as well as third level education bodies and health boards.  The last two of these, in particular, require to be brought into the realm of the examination and audit process of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would refer to the deal concerning a certain site which we all know of and which caused so much concern.  Maybe if we had had in place legislation such as that now proposed events of that kind would not have occurred.</P>
    <P>An indication of the bureaucratic slowness is that the health boards' audit is carried out by the local government auditors who are officers of the Department of the Environment.  They were responsible for audits before the setting up of the health boards 20 years ago and they continue to be responsible for auditing the accounts of the health boards.  That is the position because the forerunners to the health boards were known as local health authorities who were set up by the local authorities.  I am endeavouring to indicate the absolute need for this legislation and the example I have given should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Comptroller and Auditor General will be responsible for examining the audit of the health boards. In regard to local authorities, health boards and vocational education committees, I would like to quote from the White Paper on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General which states:</P>
    <P>Elected local authorities operating under the aegis of the Department of <Col N="1490" /> the Environment (mainly county councils, county borough councils, borough corporations, urban district councils and town comissioners) now receive about half their total income from the Exchequer for their day-to-day spending. About one-third comes from the Exchequer whereas the capital programme is virtually funded by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statement in the White Paper that:</P>
    <P>The Dáil has a justifiable interest in the expenditure by these authorities of money provided by central Government (£628 million in 1992).  At the same time these authorities remain primarily answerable to the local electorate rather than to the Dáil.  The Government are therefore satisfied that the audit arrangements for these authorities should continue as at present.</P>
    <P>That is important.  It further states:</P>
    <P>Health boards and vocational education committees receive 95% and 91% of their income, respectively, from the Exchequer and the case for having the expenditures of these bodies audited and reported on to the Dáil is compelling.  Not only is the bulk of the expenditure of these authorities voted by the Dáil but the amounts involved are very substantial &mdash; about £1.4 billion in 1992 and the current parliamentary review of their auditing expenditures is limited.  It has therefore been decided that the audit of health board and vocational education committee expenditure will in future be the responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General rather than, as at present, the Local Government Audit Service.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the allocation of moneys in respect of local authorities later.  I want to refer to elements of the legislation and the current functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his excellent staff, and the improvements proposed in this legislation to give greater effectiveness <Col N="1491" /> to his work.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will be empowered under this legislation to carry out, at his discretion, inspections of organisations and bodies which receive the bulk of their funding directly from Departments.  Up to now the Department's accounting officer went before the Committee of Public Accounts, reported and answered questions, but a link was missing in the chain in that the organisations and bodies who receive funding from Departments were not called before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am privileged to be serving a second term on that committee having served on it in the mid-eighties.  I am very familiar with the operation of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the activities of the Committee of Public Accounts and I will refer to some of those later.  Some experiences I had in regard to that office and that committee were good and others were not so good and I will deal with them later.  The fact that we can now call in representatives of those organisations and bodies who receive funding from the Department is a welcome provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of such inspections is to ensure that public funds have been spent for the purposes for which they were authorised and this is a very important provision in the Bill.  Some bodies and organisations that receive moneys from Departments are of the view that the moneys must be spent within a financial year.  They would not consider handing back those moneys to the Department or leaving them over to the following year even though some of that funding may not be used for the purposes for which it was originally allocated.  I should take a case to the allocation of £250,000 to the Southern Health Board of which I have recently become a member.  It was not possible to spend that money for the purpose for which it was allocated.  We were advised by management at a meeting that the money would be spent and that some use would be found for it.  I welcome the granting of additional powers of the <Col N="1492" /> Comptroller and Auditor General so that cases like this can be followed up.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware that the Department of Finance have completed a detailed review of the legislation relating to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is extraordinary that some of the legislation dates back to 1866 with changes in the twenties and further changes in 1946. What were we doing all this time?</P>
    <P>It is never too late to amend legislation. The review has taken account of our national needs and international developments.  It has had regard to developments in auditing which have extended well beyond the traditional fields of accuracy and regularity to cover the key areas which will always remain economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The Government have concluded, on the basis of that review, that it is desirable to update and to extend the statutory mandate of the Comptroller and Auditor General and to widen the scope of the audit of that office for public service bodies.  The legislation now before us has been introduced for that purpose. Because it has been such a long time since the enactment of legislation in relation to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General this Bill will represent the most far-reaching change in the statutory mandate of the Comptroller and Auditor General since the foundation of the State.  The legislation will give greater assurance to the Dáil and to the taxpayer that there is value for money from public services.</P>
    <P>The White Paper published by the Minister for Finance gives the background to the proposed legislation. Equally as important, the White Paper aims to stimulate public interest in this area.  To be honest, when it comes to public interest the affairs of the Comptroller and Auditor General have been left out in the cold.  That is not due to any fault of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, possibly not through the fault of any of us as individuals.  Legislators and Governments down through the decades have not seemed to make any effort to stimulate <Col N="1493" /> the kind of public interest in the workings of and the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General that should have been stimulated.  It is to be hoped that this debate and the White Paper will redress that imbalance.</P>
    <P>One could suggest with justifiable confidence that the changes proposed will be successful in improving accountability and public administration.  To achieve that success it is essential that the proposed changes have full co-operation and commitment from all concerned.  This is important if we are to ensure that we get the best use of scarce resources &mdash; something we have been trying to do, particularly since 1987.  It would be fair to say that since the present Administration came into Government in 1987 &mdash; and I played a small role in that Government &mdash; we set about getting value for money, achieving the best use of scarce resources and eliminating waste.  That was all part of the overall economic plan for recovery. Things were in a desperate state but the Government have made a contribution. The determination with which that objective was handled by the Government in 1987, and particularly by the Minister of Finance at that time, Mr. Ray MacSharry, led to greater regulation in finances and turned round our country's economy.  Mr. MacSharry was called unpleasant names &mdash; I am not going to repeat them, there are others who can do so if they wish &mdash; but there is one sure fact: he set in motion a train of events that brought regulation into our finances and turned round our economy.  The effectiveness of that determination and commitment has been seen, is being seen and will be seen &mdash; that is the important thing, will be seen &mdash; for a long time to come.  It is ensuring that we get the best possible return from our scarce resources.  That is a very important phrase.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has two main statutory functions and I shall deal briefly with those.  One is to ensure that no money is issued from central funds to the Executive except for purposes approved by the Oireachtas. His second function, as Auditor General, <Col N="1494" /> is to audit Government accounts for accuracy and regularity.  In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General has, for many years, with the agreement of the Department of Finance &mdash; this was one of the changes that took place in the vacuum of the decades about which I spoke earlier &mdash; undertaken a non-statutory directionary function that involves identifying and reporting to the Dáil on instances in which it appears to him that there has been a loss, a waste or uneconomic expenditure by Government Departments.</P>
    <P>It is also important to refer to the range of the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General audits: first, the accounts of issues from central funds; second, the Appropriation Accounts and other accounts attached to the Appropriation Accounts; third, the Departments' stock and store accounts; fourth, the accounts of receipts of revenue of the State; fifth, the accounts of a number of Department funds, State bodies and other agencies.</P>
    <P>The next point of reference would be the nature of the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General examines the appropriation accounts from two different angles.  First, there is a financial audit which, like a commercial audit, tests the accuracy of the records and the reliability of the systems underlying them so as to establish that the accounts are correct. The tests carried out in the course of the exercise have been designed so that there is a reasonable chance of detecting fraud, overpayments and technical errors. Second, there is a regulatory audit to ensure that expenditure accords with the intention of the Dáil, that expenditure has been authorised by the Department of Finance and that the provisions of the relevant statutes, regulations and so on have been complied with.</P>
    <P>On rare occasions expenditure authorised by the Department of Finance has become the focus of attention of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Another deficiency has been encountered, despite the apparently hard line taken by the Department of Finance to ensure that <Col N="1495" /> every &ldquo;i&rdquo; is dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; is crossed before approving expenditure. That is their function, and I would not for one moment try to deny it to them. However, there have been times, and I will deal with a particular instance later, when the Department of Finance would not approve of the way things were done, of the accounting system in operation.  In other words, they went too much by the book &mdash; I will deal with this later &mdash; when dealing with expenditure on the development of the pier at An Daingean.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak for a short time on the Committee of Public Accounts and its functions.  The committee's functions as set out in the Dáil Standing Order 130 are: &ldquo;to examine and report to the Dáil on the annual appropriation accounts and to suggest alterations and improvements in the form of the Estimates submitted to the Dáil.&rdquo;  I am reminded that when I was previously a member of this committee in the mid-eighties it was known as the Appropriation Accounts Committee.  That was a lovely term but none of us, even those of us who were on the committee, knew what it was all about until we joined it.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note when I was reinstated as a member earlier this year that the title had been changed to &ldquo;Committee of Public Accounts.&rdquo;  That is a much more understandable and identifiable title than Appropriation Accounts Committee.  I welcome the change in the title in the sense that the public can relate to it.  The comittee work in the interests of the Dáil but more importantly in the interests of the public.  The persons who pay the piper are obliged to call the tune; they are the people who subscribe by means of taxation both direct and indirect, which eventually is allocated to the various Departments in Votes and so forth.</P>
    <P>I indicated earlier, and it is worth repeating, perhaps in a different way, that, although there has been no statutory change in regard to auditing for a long time, a development of the Comptroller and Auditor General's role has taken place with the full support of <Col N="1496" /> the Department of Finance and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Small additions were made, new roles and agreements were confirmed by the Department of Finance that they could investigate or examine bodies or groups which were not covered by the original legislation.  All those small adjustments arose out of the need to expand the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General which should have been expanded as the economy grew, as science and technology developed and as the whole world progressed especially in the last half of this century.  The office and the activities of the Comptroller and Auditor General all but remained static.  If people study the White Paper they will be surprised to learn that that has been the case.  I recomend that people take note of this debate and realise the functions and the effectiveness of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; limited though they have been up to now.  With the expanded functions I am sure they will be happy with the manner in which the funds are controlled and optimistic that never again will they learn of events that occurred because some of the activities to which I have referred were outside the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>A further example of an effort being made to expand the role and activities of the Comptroller and Auditor General was that in December 1967 when the then Rúnai of the Department of Finance, in a letter to the Appropriation Accounts Committee, explained this development in relation to administrative efficiency as follows: &ldquo;This function is that of seeing whether, in the implementation of policy, there is a waste of public moneys for any reason.&rdquo;  It has always been the view of the Department of Finance that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be facilitated in investigations designed to ensure that in the carrying out of policy there is no failure to get value for money, no waste or inadequate financial control.  These are all commendable objectives.  That was and still is their view.  This important function of the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="1497" /> has the sanction of custom and good sense rather than of an express statutory provision.  Even though we did not have the legislation and the statutory regulations to improve the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it was clear that some extra measure of responsibility was given by the Department of Finance out of necessity.  By means of this legislation we are giving statutory effect to some of the measures I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I hope in the course of Second Stage and on Committee Stage, as is customary with all legislation, that the interest of Members and of the public having been aroused as well as of the statutory bodies referred to, all will have observations to offer.  We would welcome suggestions from whatever discussions emanate from this debate and the White Paper to strengthen the legislation.  If we have not had legislation on the subject since the foundation of the State we had better avail of this opportunity to get it right. We have had occasions when we did not get things right in legislation.  I am reminded of one or two of those occasions, one of which was the rod licence issue.  We did not get it right on the first occasion, but having got the views of many people throughout the country, then on the second occasion we succeeded.</P>
    <P>Because we erred in the legislation, a monopoly was created.  Nobody knows this better than the people of Cork city and county where in the eighties one company only were licensed to provide a multi-channel service.  For economic reasons, which we all understand, the company said they could not provide a service to all the citizens living within the area covered by the licence.  The resilience of Cork people is well known and they did not sit back and wait until the company thought it was profitable and sound to extend the multi-channel service. Rather they got together &mdash; like the old Meitheal &mdash; and, as the old saying goes, ní ceart go cur le chéile, there is strength in numbers &mdash; and provided a service for the small sum of £30 per year, <Col N="1498" /> which was not always collected.  They provided a multi channel system.</P>
    <P>The legislation provided that there could be only one licence for the MMDS system, which was regarded as a technological advance on the cable system, in an area.  The existing cable licence holder was granted the licence to install what was regarded as the marvellous new MMDS system.  As a result, the service provided by the community for the community was declared illegal, which it was under the laws passed by this House.</P>
    <P>My passing reference to this issue may be rather long but the point I am making is that mistakes can be made in the context of legislation that may need to be corrected.  As I said, we must ensure that we get the legislation right on this occasion.  I am giving as an example of the mistakes which can be made in legislation the appalling situation in the rebel county where one licence only has been granted to provide the MMDS system, thus creating a monopoly.  Like me, many people believe that this legislation is not correct, good or fair.  This being so, it should be amended.  Of course, the snag here is that the Government could have a legal battle on their hands if the contract with the licence holder is breached.</P>
    <P>Many people in County Cork have indicated to me and my colleagues &mdash; Deputy Dennehy who is sitting beside me is well aware of what I am talking about &mdash; that they will not accept the MMDS system from the company for two reasons: first, the cost of the cable system in Cork is twice what it is in Dublin and, second, regardless of the number of benders or twisters, as they are called, installed many homes in County Cork cannot and will not be serviced by the new system.  People living in the areas where the new system may be made available have said &mdash; these are the words they used &mdash; that Cork multi-channel can stuff it.  This means that they are not going to avail of the service on point of principle. They were able to provide a service for themselves at the ridiculously low cost of £30 per year.  I should say that on many occasions senior citizens and social welfare <Col N="1499" /> recipients were not asked to pay the £30 charge.</P>
    <P>As I am not making a sales pitch for the licence holder I am not going to quote the installation charge and the quarterly payment.  People who wish to watch the sports channel or movie channel will have to pay additional charges.  People who have two televisions will be required to pay one and a half times the amount while people with three televisions will have to pay twice the amount.  Restrictions are also laid down in regard to taping and so on.  In the main, the people of Cork will not accept these restrictions. The promoters of this service should rethink their position.</P>
    <P>People may say that very few people have three televisions.  Despite the perceived economic downturn in Cork, I can tell the House that many households have more than one television.  For example, many young people buy televisions which they keep in their bedrooms.  This means they can watch programmes while their mothers and fathers watch television in the dining room or sitting room.  I watch television in the kitchen whenever I get a chance.  I know that one television per household is the norm but we should not underestimate the number of households where there is more than one television.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been very patient in allowing me to make a lengthy passing reference to what I regard as faulty legislation passed by this House.  This issue needs to be looked at so that the same mistake is not made in regard to this Bill.  The Committee of Public Accounts discussed this issue. That committee is all about accountability. On the day he was being examined, the accounting officer of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications was asked if that Department had any function or role to play in regard to the prices charged for these services.  It transpires that the people who issue the licence have no statutory powers to control the prices charged.</P>
    <P>There has been a row about service charges in Cork.  I live in the county area <Col N="1500" /> and have been paying service charges for 30 years.  If I did not have a water supply I would have to carry buckets of water from the pump.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage there is a certain freedom to make passing references. I accept that fellows like me who have kissed the Blarney Stone may go a bit far.</P>
      <P>Following the initiation of a Bill all of us should seek the advice and opinions of others.  We do not know it all and the people we represent will always have a contribution to make.  At times we do not listen.  Legislation has been proved faulty on a number of occasions.  I would refer, for example, to the Act which empowers the Department of Communications to issue licences for MMDS and the legislation concerning service charges introduced by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, in 1983. Many people forget who introduced that legislation.  Another example of faulty legislation is that which required Ministers of State to stand down from local authorities.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General have the sanction of custom and good sense rather than statutory provision.  I am not saying that incorrect things were done.  An audit is in process which is carried out to examine and report on the discharge of a responsibility and is usually carried out by a third party.  At central Government level that independent third party is the one and only national auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Traditionally the audit process has consisted of a statutory financial regulatory audit and a non-statutory <i>ex post facto</i> examination in matters which involve loss, waster or uneconomic expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Public Accounts Committee read the Votes for the various Departments.  We note under each subhead the estimated expenditure and the actual expenditure and the difference <Col N="1501" /> between them.  Then we read the explanatory notes.  The figures for overtime make the mind boggle.  When I was a sheet metal worker none of us worked overtime of one of our number was unemployed. I am a former member of a trade union and I cannot understand why so much money is expended for overtime working.</P>
    <P>Our young people are educated to the highest educational standards.  Anybody who has had the privilege of attending meetings in Europe will be aware that this is acknowledged widely.  Irish students and qualified people are well ahead of anybody else.  As Niall Toibín would say in Cork lingo, &ldquo;we are way out ahead of you, boy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It appals me to see so many hours of overtime worked by officers throughout the system.  We have many qualified people who could be gainfully employed. I will refer later to 90 people who were not gainfully employed but were paid £1 million.  People have not noted the effectiveness and the value of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to bring to the public consciousness the need for the expansion of the staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General so that he can be more effective. His role is not understood, and that is our fault.  We have the opportunity to put this issue centre stage.  We can debate amendments to the Constitution and all sorts of other subjects but they are all diversions.  We must get down to basics. We would not know what was happening to our money without the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  This Bill is timely and I hope that, with sufficient debate, we will get it right on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Given the continuing dominance of the Estimates in the Government's accounting system, the Government are satisfied that financial regulatory auditing must continue to be the most essential constituent of the auditing process and should not be weakened or relaxed.  I hope that this legislation will strengthen the financial regulatory audit as it is the <Col N="1502" /> most important constituent of the auditing process.</P>
    <P>There is now a widespread acceptance that more is required than a financial regulatory audit.  There may be some doubt about that, but the Government are satisfied that simple examination of losses, waste and extravagance is no longer adequate to serve the interests of parliamentary accountability and develop a more cost-conscious public sector.  The Government have decided, therefore, that the process should be strengthened by expanding the nature of the audit to include formal <i>post facto</i> examination of the economy and that this should be done by Statute.  The purpose is to examine the effectiveness and adquacy of the measures employed by Departments and other public bodies.  I will refer later to the evaluation of effectiveness when I deal with the development at Dingle Pier.</P>

      <P>I served a few years on this committee in the early eighties.  When I gained one stripe, by becoming a Minister of State, I lost another stripe by losing my place on the committee.  Now I am no longer a Minister of State, I am again a member of the committee.  If I have been wide-ranging it is because of my experience on the committee.  I know the need for the legislation and that is why I am putting so much effort into this. I could say much more but I want to specify the areas that need attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary responsibility for good systems of management will continue to rest with the management in each body. It is not intended that the new audit process should be a substitute for this.  The new process should prove to be an invaluable aid to the Dáil in its task of assessing how the Executive has discharged its responsibilities as well as assessing those audited and improving their ability to ensure that the public get the best value for money.  That is the kernel of it.  I <Col N="1503" /> spoke about waste and effectivness but the underlining principle is value for taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>There are three important elements &mdash;economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Economy means providing suitable resources for a task at the lowest cost with the minimum wastage having regard to quality. This can be achieved by competitive tendering for goods and services and keen management of the use of resources.  Efficiency involve the cost of resources against the outputs achieved. Thus an efficient operation gets maximum output from a given level of resources or from minimum resources. An activity could be economical without being efficient if resources were purchased at lowest cost but failed to give the required outputs.</P>
    <P>That leads me on to the question of effectiveness.  We must consider the extent to which the stated objectives of a programmed operated by a Department or body in the public services have been achieved.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to raise, albeit with great sadness and seriousness, this case in the House.  I have tabled a question to the Minister for Justice dealing with the substance of this matter but following the events of last weekend there is now greater urgency attaching to it.  I felt it was right to seek to raise the matter on the Adjournment and I am glad that I have been given the opportunity to raise it this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Sunday night Daniel Kavanagh, a 16 year old schoolboy, died following a scuffle with a gang of six or seven youths which ended tragically.  People living in the Finglas area have been saddened, shocked and devastated by this loss. Huge numbers of young people along with their parents attended the funeral <Col N="1504" /> services on Tuesday and Wednesday. The question that was on all their lips was how had it come to this, that families cannot go about their normal business safely and a teenager with two friends cannot go and get a video on a Sunday night.  Underlying this sadness there was anger at the lack of resources and the slow response in introducing legislation to provide the Garda with the tools that they need to do the job and to prevent incidents such as this occurring.</P>
    <P>In common with other Deputies and councillors in the area I have attended the launch of an extraordinarily large number of neighbourhood watch schemes in Finglas and Ballymun during the past few months.  At each of these meetings the point has been made repeatedly to the politicians, as the community strive to combat crime, that the Garda Síochána in seeking to deal with the most common problem, the gathering of youths in public places, such as street corners, garden walls, outside shops and parks, can only talk to these youths as they do not have the power to move them on or to ask them to go home.  It is not an offence to drink in public.  Legislation has been long promised but it is very slow in coming.</P>
    <P>On the night in question the gang involved were at the location concerned two hours earlier.  If the Garda had the power to move them on perhaps this tragedy could have been avoided.  The members of the force in Finglas are outstanding and much respected in the community. However, they are faced with an impossible task due to the lack of numbers and the fact that their hands are tied behind their backs.  The old powers under the law relating to breaches of the peace and loitering have been repealed and nothing has been put in their place. As a consequence, communities feel unprotected.  I gave the community an undertaking before this incident occurred that I would raise the matter in the House in the next ten to 14 days to see at what stage legislation was at and when we could expect it to be introduced.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to provide extra resources.  There are six community <Col N="1505" /> gardaí in Finglas and they are much loved and respected but this number is inadequate in policing an area with a population of 17,000 and in maintaining a presence.  We need to put gardaí on the beat and engage in community policing, in addition to giving the Garda the power to move groups of young people on before they become drunk and disorderly, to prevent trouble arising and tragedies occurring.  Both sides know that the Garda have no powers.  The Garda also know that if they suggest to a person that they should accompany them to the station, they are going beyond their powers.</P>
    <P>Let me make two further points.  In recent months two public houses on the outskirts of Finglas have closed, partly due to the recession and partly due to other factors.  The business community is tightly knit and has invested enormously in upgarding their premises.  They have proposed that a business watch programmed should be devised in the village. They intend to invest money but they need the support of the Department of Justice in making the community a safer place in which to live.</P>

      <P>I thank both the Minister of State and you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to express briefly my heartfelt sympathy and the sympathy of this House to the bereaved and, understandably, numbed members of the Kavanagh family on the tragic death of their boy, a blossoming young man whose precious and unique life was taken away in such an unnatural, unwarranted and highly tragic fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened is not peculiar to any one spot but representative of the new menace abroad.  I am thankful to the Minister for Justice to whom I made representations <Col N="1506" /> on this matter some months ago, as a result of which he indicated to me in this House that legislation was in the course of preparation.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the menace in question is not going to be solved in any gentle, legalistic fashion but will have to be attacked and a response made to those young people who seem to be indulging in excesses of freedom which cannot be tolerated in any just or right society.  For my part, while, traditionally, I would like everything to be done in a sympathetic and effective fashion, this menace is not going to be cured unless we give to our esteemed gardaí powers beyond those regarded as acceptable to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">

      <P>First, I should explain to the House that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, is unable to be present due to his involvement in the talks in Belfast and that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is involved in the proceedings in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to express my sincere sympathy to the family of the young man who was killed at the weekend apparently as a result of a wanton, unprovoked and violent assault. I know that whatever I say here this evening will be of little comfort to the family of the bereaved but I would like to assure them and the House that the Minister for Justice is determined to ensure that the persons responsible for this despicable act will be brought to justice. While it is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to give detailed information to the House about individual Garda investigations I can inform the House that a number of individuals have made statements to the Garda in connection with this incident.  A file is being prepared on the matter which will be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Garda strength in Finglas, there are 59 gardaí assigned to Finglas Garda Station.  Foot and mobile patrols are carried out on a regular basis in the Finglas area.  At present the area is also patrolled regularly by members of the divisional task force and the district <Col N="1507" /> detective unit car.  In addition there are five community gardaí who keep in close contact with the community through the various residents' associations and the neighbourhood watch groups.  There are 24 neighbourhood watch schemes in the Finglas area involving 5,849 households. On behalf of the Minister for Justice I would like to commend those involved in these schemes and to encourage even greater co-operation between the local community and the Garda.  This kind of co-operation is vital in the fight against crime.  The crime figures for the sub-district of Finglas have fallen by almost 17 per cent between 1989 and 1991 and the indications are that this trend is set to continue this year.  The policing arrangements for the Finglas area are kept under continuous review by the Garda authorities and all resources will be used to maximum effect given the overall demands of the force.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the legal issues involved here and to stress that the Garda are not operating in a legal vacuum in regard to acts of public disorder.  The intoxicating liquor laws were substantially strengthened in 1988 to deal with the problem of under-age drinking. The Garda also have certain powers already including the power of arrest for breaches of the peace which can be used in these cases.  However, the Minister for Justice accepts that there may be an argument for additional provisions to strengthen the hands of the Garda to deal with potential cases of serious mis-behaviour in public which can lead to random violence.  The Department of Justice are currently in the process of preparting draft legislation to modernise the law in certain relevant respects as recommended by the Law Reform Commission. These new provisions will apply to adults as well as to persons under 18 and they are specifically targeted at the problems caused by wandering groups of youths who are out just to cause trouble. They include the creation of offences relating to: (a) persons being found drunk, or under the influence of drugs, in such circumstances that they are a <Col N="1508" /> danger to themselves or others; (b) the use of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place; and (c) disorderly conduct as, for instance, shouting, singing or generally obnoxious conduct in circumstances likely to cause annoyance to other persons in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>These new offences will carry the power of arrest and liability to substantial fines and, if drink is involved, the Minister for Justice intends that the Garda will have the power generally to confiscate it on the spot.  It is his intention to bring forward the necessary legislation to deal with street intimidation as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Green Paper on Education.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party's views on education are extremely radical and we would argue that the present educational system does not serve the needs of the planet in that it encourages conformism, consumerism and exploitation. However, be that as it may, we do accept that the Green Paper, flawed as it is, is some effort to improve the many defects in the present system, and for that we can be thankful.</P>
      <P>The Green Party's paper on education should be consulted by the Minister for Education, and I shall forward this to the Minister as part of the consultation process on his Green Paper.  Unfortunately, many Members in the House have not taken the opportunity of reading this radical &ldquo;Green&rdquo; paper on education. I would recommed it to them; it might broaden their thinking on education to the benefit of future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that everyone in the House would agree that the other Green Paper on Education is one of the most important policy documents issued in this area by Government for a number of years.  A Green Paper, by defination, is a discussion document to be discussed not just by the Government, the Oireachtas or the various educational interest bodies &mdash; trade unions, Churches and so forth &mdash; it is, in my view, to be debated by the public <Col N="1509" /> at large &mdash; students, parents, teachers and everybody who is interested in education. Tremendous public interest has been shown in this paper and rightly so, but we must ask ourselves, has the Minister done everything to facilitate this debate.  I would suggest that he has singularlay failed to provide for adequate public debate.</P>
    <P>First, the Green Paper is available to anyone who is prepared to pay £10.  I think we must start from here.  I am not suggesting that the Green Paper should be distributed free to every persons, every household or even every teacher in the country because we must keep a balance between the need for maximum public debate on one hand and the needs of the Exchequer.  It does not seem unreasonable to me that the Green Paper should be more readily available, free of charge, for those people sufficiently interested to seek it.  For example, the paper should be available to individuals calling to Government publications.  Other centres throughout the country could be sent a supply of copies to be distributed on the same basis.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; public meetings which are taking place at certain urban areas are not being organised by the Department of Education and are not public; they are by invitation only and are attended by some union members and representatives of parent bodies.  This is not adequate.  The Department of Education should arrange meetings in both urban and rural areas to which all interested parties, students, parents, teachers, members of school management boards and so forth may come and question either the Minister or his representative after an outline of the proposals has been spelt out.  It is extremely important that as much detailed information as possible be made available and discussed so that no-one need feel, after the consultation process is over, that they did not have adequate time or indeed the opportunity to participate in what is the most important development in education this century, barring the late Donough O'Malley's free, or as I would prefer to say, no direct charge, Education <Col N="1510" /> Bill of the seventies, though subsequent Governments have watered down this Bill to almost non-existence.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will be flexible and will not stick rigidly to the six months' time limit.  I accept that some time limit must be imposed, but he should consider extending the time if there is public demand to do so.</P>
    <P>Education is the very basis of our society.  It is the making of future generations and it is the blueprint for the thinking which will shape the future of this world.  Therefore, it is extremely important that a radical approach be adopted, and it is absolutely essential that consultation and communication with all interested groups be as open as possible, in as many locations around the country as possible.  I would ask the Minister to please heed this very sincere request on behalf of very many parents, teachers and so forth in this country.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the thrust of the Deputy's motion to the effect that there has not been sufficient opportunity for parents and members of the public to have an input in the national debate on the Green Paper.  The Minister and I are seeking to actively facilitate the debate in every way open to us.  Just as we welcomed every group and interested individual we would also be happy to include any proposals Deputy Garland wishes to put forward for consideration. The Introduction to the Green Paper containing all the main aims was published on 21 April 1992 and was made available extensively to all concerned, including individual teachers and schools.  The full text was published in June and made available immediately to all the major interest groups.  It was also published extensively in the national media.  Copies were furnished to each school in the country and to all public libraries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately following the publication, senior officials from my Department invited all the main education interest groups, including parents councils to briefing/clarification meetings.  We have <Col N="1511" /> taken every possible opportunity to talk to the various groups.  Major seminars have already taken place in Cork and Limerick and seminars will be held in Sligo and Athlone in the coming weeks. Indeed only today the Minister announced a further two seminars to be organised in Galway and Dublin, such is their success.  Even the Deputy would accept that there is a limit to the number of people who can be accommodated at seminars of this type.  My approach was to invite a widely representative group to the meetings and also to give and opportunity to some members of the general public, including parents, to attend. When the Minister opened the first of the Green Paper seminars in Cork on 12 October, he stated that these seminars were a part &mdash; only a constituent part &mdash; of the consultation process which commenced as far back as last April.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I have also attended numerous other privately organised seminars and my Department officials monitor the discussions at all these forums and on the national airwaves.  We have made it clear that written submissions on any aspect of the Green Paper are welcome from any group or individual who wishes to comment.  Some submissions have already been received and are being considered. Within the last two weeks also we have had wide discussion in this House and in the Seanad on the Green Paper.  Surely there could not be a more representative group than the Members of Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the level and extent of the debate so far on the Green Paper among all concerned interests and the general public.  It has been the most open and positive debate in the history of Irish education.  Everyone, I know, is agreed on the importance of the issues facing us.  Equally, I believe there is a desire on all sides to proceed as quickly as possible to the information of clear policy directions to facilitate the development and implementation of a new framework for our education system, in partnership with all concerned.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i>&ldquo;Pollution&rdquo; is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; word nowadays and the Department of the Environment lay down all kinds of regulations for county councils who, in turn, must implement them.  Farmers, very often when they cannot afford it, have to spend money to ensure that they do not cause pollution. It is very strange that the Minister's Department lead by bad example: Muine Bheag treatment plant is an example which should be an embarrasment to the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>The need for the plant was accepted on 19 April 1984.  Muine Bheag is a nice, rural town of about 3,000 people but the plant for treating sewage is adequate for only 1,000 people, resulting in overflow into the River Barrow, which is not good enough.  In the interests of the community, Muine Bheag built their own swimming pool many years ago when much larger towns did not have one. They also have swimming contests in the Barrow.  I need not go into further detail as I am sure the Minister knows what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7 May 1991, a year and five months ago, tenders were accepted by the county council and sent to the Minister's Department. While the Department are fiddling and making excuses the council must take the blame for this indefensible form of pollution on the Barrow, and the people of Muine Bheag suffer as a result.  I have had many replies in regard to this matter, once on the Adjournment.  On 3 March 1992 I was told by the Minister of State that he understood the existing treatment and collection systems were overloaded. He also said that the need for a Muine Bheag scheme had been established.  On 7 April 1992 the Minister said that he had instructed his officials to examine the scope for approving new schemes, including Muine Bheag sewerage <Col N="1513" /> scheme, in the current year.  To add insult to injury, when I asked about the matter on 20 October 1992, I received gobbledegood written by a distant relation of Hans Christian Andersen which said: &ldquo;Tender recommendations submitted by Carlow County Council in respect of four contracts for this scheme are under consideration&rdquo;. If I was not in the House I could say that was a dishonest answer because I have no doubt that the examination of tenders is not holding up this scheme.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me exactly what is going on?  If the same fiction writer has written his script, I do not want to hear it.  What is the point in having tenders advertised and submitted 14 or 15 months ago when the builder is expected to keep within reasonable levels in regard to price, apart from an increase in normal costs?  How will he keep his workforce if he is depending on work like this?  The whole shambles of the Muine Bheag sewerage treatment has been caused by the Department.  It is an embarrassment which I hope the Minister will end this evening.</P>

      <P>The improvement of water and sanitary services infrastructure is one of my priority objectives as Minister for the Environment and is a major area of activity for local authorities.  Since 1980 almost £1 billion has been invested in modern water and sewerage services throughout the county.  This level of investment has assisted the drive for economic growth, as well as meeting higher environmental standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance attached by the Government to the provision of adequate water and sewerage infrastructural facilities has been clearly established in the environment action programme.  Quality and investment targets have been clearly identified for the water and sanitary services programme up to the year 2000.  The overall strategy is aimed at improving the quality of inland and coastal sewage through the provision of modern sewage treatment arrangements, together with <Col N="1514" /> improved systems for the provision of good quality drinking water.</P>
    <P>The programme is being assisted by some £96 million in EC co-financing under the operational programme for water, sanitary and other local services, 1989-1993.  This programme has as its main objectives the provision of water and sewerage schemes of appropriate capacity and quality to facilitate industrial development; to support the agri-food sector, aquaculture and fish processing, to protect water resources important for tourism purposes, and to allow reasonable advance provision of services for economic development.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made over the years in bringing new and improved water and sanitary services to County Carlow.  The Muine Bheag sewerage scheme is intended to advance this progress further.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the existing sewage treatment and collection systems in Muine Bheag are overloaded.  Carlow County Council's proposals provide for an improved collection system, pumping station and treatment works.  It is intended that effluent will receive secondary treatment before discharge to the River Barrow and thus contribute significantly to river water quality.</P>
    <P>Tender recommendations in respect of the civil works, mechanical pumping and sludge dewatering plants contracts are under consideration in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will accept that proposals must be considered in the light of the existing level of commitments under the water and sanitary services programme. He will be aware that the capital allocation for such schemes for the current year is £72.5 million.  This allocation has been assigned principally to meet the cost of schemes recently completed or currently under construction.  The scope for approving new schemes, including Muine Bheag sewerage scheme, will be considered when the capital provision for water and sanitary services for 1993 is known.  While I cannot give an explicit undertaking today in regard to the immediate approval of the tenders for <Col N="1515" /> this scheme, I can assure the Deputy that I will give his comments every consideration before making a final decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Finance to reintroduce stamp duty relief for young, trained farmers who have qualified for EC green certificates in farm training.  This successful scheme was introduced in 1982 and remained in operation until 1987.  However, the annual rate of land transfers has halved in the last five years and is now at a level comparable with the sixties.  It is clear that the initiatives introduced during the period 1982-87 encouraged earlier land transfers and was of tremendous benefit to young farmers in taking over the running of the farm units from their aged parents.  It also promoted the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The colossal and exorbitant cost of stamp duty has prevented many young, trained farmers from staying in the agricultural profession.  Indeed, young farmers today are leaving the land and competing with other unemployed young people in the already depressed job market, thereby increasing the already high unemployment figures.  The high level of emigration in my constituency &mdash; Cork South-West &mdash; can also be attributed to a lack of a coherent land policy. Therefore, if the current rate of new entrants to farming continues to decline, in 20 years' times there will be only half the number of farmers there are today. This will have the effect of seriously swelling the already huge unemployment queues that exist throughout the country. I urge the Minister to act before it is too late and to ensure that the stamp duty relief be again introduced in the forthcoming budget and, thereby, giving the young farmers of today an opportunity to take over the running of their farms from their respective parents.  In many cases young farmers of today must wait until they themselves are middle-aged to become farmer owners.  The abolition of the stamp duty relief in 1987 made it <Col N="1516" /> impossible for farmers to hand over their property to their sons and daughters owing to the exorbitant rate of stamp duty that would be imposed on the transfer of the property.</P>
    <P>If a new generation of dynamic well trained young farmers are to be brought into the agricultural industry, this situation must now be changed immediately and I urge the Minister to heed my advice and grant this request in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>I urge the Minister for Finance to restore the exemption thresholds for capital acquisition tax that existed in 1976 to their real level today and continue to be index-linked each year thereafter.</P>
      <P>The capital acquisition tax was introduced by the Capital Acquisition Tax Act of 1976.  There have been only two minor amandments to the tax free thresholds since its introduction.  Therefore, 16 years later it has become a major source of concern for farm families and a disincentive to early farm transfers.</P>
      <P>The increase in the liability for capital acquisition tax has been brought about chiefly by the non-indexation of the exemption thresholds until recently.  The increase in the value of assets, the introduction of the milk quotas and the classifications of all gifts, both agricultural and non agricultural has aggreganted since 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister to introduce an amnesty for capital acquisition tax and stamp duty to encourage people to get their affairs in order.  There is quite a backlog in getting capital taxation cases agreed and I believe that there are a <Col N="1517" /> large number of unadministered estates awaiting decision.</P>
    <P>Giving an amnesty would concentrate the minds of all those involved, resulting in a greater flow of capital taxes to the State in the short term and encourage the proper registration of lands and properties within the State.  It would also remove an unnecessary and unaffordable burden for many farm families at the most critical time in the family life-cycle when settlements, education and other expenses have to be met.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is vitally important that the Minister restore the exemption thresholds for capital acquisition tax that existed in 1976 to the real level of today and continue index-linking each year thereafter.  This is essential if jobs in agriculture are to be preserved and young farmers are to take over their respective holdings and play their part in guiding the policy of agriculture in the years that lie ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to both questions, let me say that during the course of the debate on the 1992 Finance Act, the Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, indicated that the Department of Finance would carry out a study of whether the overall tax treatment of gifts tends to discourage the lifetime transfer of farms by the postponement of farm transfers until the death of the farmer. The study is focusing on the interaction of stamp duties and capital acquisition tax on gifts of farms to see whether the current tax arrangements act as a disincentive to the lifetime transfer of farms. The land transfer survey, carried out by Macra na Ferime and published earlier this year, will be taken into account in the Department's consideration of the issues involved.  This study will be completed in time for the Government to consider its findings for the 1993 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 the indexation of the exemption thresholds in line with the consumer price index commenced.  As a result, the class 1 threshold, which applied to children, <Col N="1518" /> has increased from £150,000 to £166,350.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This concession in the capital acquisition tax code will be of considerable benefit in cases of an inheritance of a farm from a parent or the lifetime transfer of a farm from a parent to a child.  Given the low yield from capital acquisition tax as a whole, and the low proportion of the overall capital acquisition tax yield represented by payments from the farming community, there is not room for further major concessions in the area of capital acquisition tax thresholds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the index linking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is index linked.  In this context, I should mention the several concessions already made in the capital acquisition tax code which are of considerable benefit to the farming community. I have already mentioned the introduction of the indexation of the thresholds in 1990.  In 1991 the top two rates of tax in the capital acquisition tax code, 55 per cent and 45 per cent, were abolished, leaving the top rate at a standard 40 per cent.  In 1991 agricultural relief was increased from £200,000 or 50 per cent, whichever is the lesser, to £200,000 or 55 per cent, whichever is the lesser.  The proceeds of insurance policies, in so far as they are used to meet capital acquisition tax liabilities on the lifetime transfer or inheritance of a farm, have been exempted from capital acquisition tax.  The total exemption from capital acquisition tax for inheritance by spouses has been extended to gifts to spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be seen that measures have been taken over recent years by this Government to relieve the capital acquisition tax liabilities in respect of the inheritance and lifetime transfer of farms.  I trust that this puts the matter in perspective and I can assure the House that when the Departmental study is completed the <Col N="1519" /> Minister for Finance will consider it in detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>And it will include any <Col N="1520" /> alterations to the proposals in the forthcoming budget?</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 30 October 1992.</P>

The decision to request the Independent Radio and Television Commission to make arrangements for the provision of the necessary services to broadcast the <Col N="1441" /> Taoiseach's announcement on the Maastricht referendum was made by the Taoiseach in order to ensure that every avenue available to inform the general public about the issues raised in the referendum was explored.  As is required by the Radio and Television Act, 1988 I gave my consent to the arranging of these services.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission decided to accede to the request.  I did not have any function in this decision but such a response to an important, proper, legitimate, and reasonable request from the Head of Government is hardly unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I am not aware in any formal sense of the technicalities or modus of recording the broadcast but I do not see how the mechanics of recording the announcement could give rise to a conflict of interest as the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>I outlined the purpose and main policy options of the EC Green Paper on the Development of the Single Market for Postal Services in reply to a Question on 20 May last.  The European Commission is allowing Government and other interested bodies a six-month period, ending in December next, to furnish views on the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I launched a wide-ranging consultation process on the Green Paper and, on completion of that process, I will convey my views on the Paper to the European Commission.  I have invited written views from some 50 bodies.  In addition, I held a seminar in Dublin Castle on 28 September and arrangements are being made for a Dáil debate on the Green Paper at an early date.  At this stage I am not in a position to outline my views on the policy options set out in the Green Paper.  However, I can inform the House that I fully support the central thrust of the Green Paper i.e. the provision of a universal postal service at affordable prices and with a satisfactory quality of service throughout the Community.</P>
      <P>The House is already aware that An Post is in serious financial difficulty and that there is an urgent need for measures to restore the company to financial health.  Some remedial action has already been taken and management/union negotiations on further recovery measures are in progress.  I wish to place on record my appreciation of the the progress which, I understand, is being made in discussions between the company and the Trade Unions.  I want to compliment the Unions and management on their constructive approach which is now being taken and wish them every success in their discussions.</P>

      <P>Following a period of rapid expansion in self catering capacity which has grown by some 25 per cent since 1987, with a 90 per cent increase in capacity in holiday cottages schemes the priority now is to further develop the market for this product particularly in the off-peak and shoulder months.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 38, and 46 together.</P>
      <P>In common with the practice in other European States it is not customary to publish reports of investigations into aviation accidents in the private/general aviation sector.  Each such accident is carefully investigated by technical staff from my Department and any safety action necessary is taken with the minimum of delay.  The number of accidents to light aircraft and helicopters in 1992 has been higher than normal but the causal factors have been typically diverse and not repetitious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> My Department sets rigorous and searching standards in respect of aircraft maintenance and flight crew functions. Untimately, it is the responsibility of the operators to exercise care and professionalism in the conduct of aircraft operations.  In consultation with my Department, the various Irish aviation representative bodies have taken action in this area.</P>
    <P>On the question of transparency I would like to point out that the standards and recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) require that:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the sole objective of the investigation of an accident or incident shall be the prevention of accidents and incidents.  It is not the purpose of this activity to apportion blame or liability,</P>
    <P>&mdash; any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability should be separate from any investigation conducted in accordance with the ICAO procedures.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is adequate transparency at the technical level. However, I should, perhaps, advise the House that in a Bill that I will shortly be introducing to establish the Air Navigation Services Office as the Irish Aviation Authority I will be making specific provision to ensure that accident investigation remains my responsibility as Minister and not that of the Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the failure of the European College of Aeronautics at Cork Airport and in particular the position which that college left it's trainee students in. The training standards at the college were approved by my Department.  However, I must point out that it was a private sector commercial venture and as such there could be no question of direct State financial support for the college. However, I would like to emphasise that I and my Department facilitated the ECA in every way possible.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated, the standards at the college were approved by my Department. With a view to meeting increased demand for pilot examinations my Department introduced a wide range of new measures in the administration of pilot licences.  These measures included:</P>
      <P>&mdash; increasing the frequency of examinations from 3 per annum to 5 per annum;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the holding of examinations in Cork, in addition to Dublin;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" />&mdash; rephasing written examinations and flying tests to facilitate ECA candidates;</P>
    <P>&mdash; reducing the period between examinations and the issue of results from 3 months to 6 weeks.</P>
    <P>Delays in flight testing of candidates were not due to my Department but rather to the unavailability of ECA aircraft.</P>
    <P>When I became aware that ECA was in financial difficulties in May, 1992, I arranged additional funding for one month, so that potential users of the College could be consulted in an orderly manner.  This consultation revealed that there was not sufficient domestic demand for pilot training in ECA, which would maintain the financial viability of the College.</P>
    <P>In August, I established a Task Force to examine the overall scenario of pilot training in Ireland and to determine if there is a requirement for a National Flying School.  The Task Force is composed of representatives from Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Ryanair and the Air Corps as well as my Department and the Departments of Defence and Finance. The Task Force has had three meetings to date and work is continuing.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention that shareholders in ECA included both Aer Rianta and the IDA.  Such shareholdings, however, are matters solely for those bodies and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in such arrangements.</P>

      <P>When MMDS franchises were awarded in late 1989 and 1990, definite start up deadlines were not specified as my Department was aware of a number of factors which were not within the control of the MMDS operators.  Such factors included transmitter site identification, acquisition, planning permission and site development, and the ordering and delivery of equipment.  A number of operators suffered very considerable delays in the planning permission process.</P>
      <P>The MMDS franchise for the Waterford area was awarded three separate franchises.  Generally speaking, I believe the company is making a reasonable effort to establish the MMDS service in its three franchise areas.

      <P>Sales of photographic film by VAT-registered traders are liable to VAT at the standard 21 per cent rate.  However, while, in general, a VAT liability arises in the case of goods disposed of free of charge, this provision does not apply to gifts which cost the donor less than £15.</P>

      <Col N="1456" /> Films supplied free as part of a processing offer are treated under this gifts provision.

      <P>The ongoing Royal Canal restoration programme, which is being carried out by the Office of Public Works, achieved significant progress in 1992.  Work continued on the restoration and reopening of the section of canal between Blanchardstown and the River Liffey.  Works consist of dredging the canal to navigation depth, removal of spoil, restoration of lock chambers, construction of replacement lock gates, fitting of lock gates and the provision and improvement of pedestrian towpaths.  In 1992, the Office of Public Works restoration works have progressed to the 2nd lock at Binn's Bridge in Dublin.  At present, dredging works are being carried out on the first level between Newcomen Bridge and Binn's Bridge and with the completion of these works, the installation of new lock gates at the 2nd lock, and the replacement of the railway culvert at Newcomen Bridge with a new lifting bridge in 1993, the Royal Canal will be navigable from Dublin to Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Works are also underway on the restoration of the Canal west of Mullingar to its junction with the River Shannon at Clondra.  Here again, where works are <Col N="1457" /> being carried out at the same time as those on the Dublin stretch, progress has been considerable.  In 1992 dredging and bank clearance works have been carried out between the 35th lock at Ballynacargy and the 40th lock at Mullawornia, County Longford.  Also, a section of the Longford Branch of the Royal Canal was dredged and rewatered and now provides a pleasant amenity for local residents.  In 1993, restoration works will continue to progress westwards towards the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Aside from the major restoration works being carried out by the Office of Public Works, they have also carried out considerable environmental improvement works along the system e.g. dredging works in Mullingar, fish restocking at Maynooth and Leixlip, fishing surveys at Mullingar, water supply studies and provision of assistance to local voluntary groups along the system.  While most of the resources available to the Office in 1993 for the Royal Canal will again be committed to the major restoration works required, similar environmental improvement works will also be carried out in 1993.</P>

      <P>There are no grants available for bog development.  The private bog development scheme, introduced under the Turf Development Act, 1981, was terminated in 1987.  The scheme fulfilled its main purpose which was to stimulate the development of private peat resources. This is evidenced by the increase in production from this source from around 1 million tonnes per annum in 1981 to 1.5 million tonnes in the current year.  I have no plans to reintroduce the scheme.</P>

      <P>The latest estimates available from the Central Statistics Office relate to the first six months of 1992 and show visitor numbers up on last year by 4 per cent for the first six months of the year <Col N="1463" /> and overseas revenue up by 5 per cent for the first quarter.  Although visitor numbers are behind the five year target set by Government, revenue estimates indicate at this stage that the targeted £500 million increase in foreign revenue over the period 1988-93 is likely to be achieved.  Revenue growth should ensure that job creation targets for the industry are also met.  Between 1989 and 1991 employment sustained by tourism increased by an estimated 19,000 jobs. The five year target is to create an additional 25,000 jobs in the Irish economy between 1989 and 1993.</P>
      <P>Some industry sources have been reported as stating that first half year increases this year in visitor numbers were not reflected in booking levels.  One possible reason is the expansion which has taken place in accommodation in recent years with an extra 33,000 tourist beds now on the market, up almost 50 per cent on 1987.  As a result, despite visitor growth, increased occupancy levels expected by some operators at the beginning of the season may not have been achieved.</P>
      <P>Next year will mark the final year of the Government's five year EC co-funded programme for the development of Irish tourism.  To date over £164 million has been expended on capital developments under the programme, of which £77 million came from the EC, and a number of new and improved facilities will be open for their first full tourism season in 1993. These facilities cover a wide range of tourist products including culture and heritage and outdoor holiday pursuits and will be amongst the best available in Europe.</P>
      <P>There will also be increased marketing activity next year.  On top of Bord Fáilte's normal promotional and marketing activities, there will also be additional marketing expenditure of £12 million under the programme in 1993 on selling Ireland in overseas markets, with particular emphasis on generating off-peak business, and promoting Ireland's new range of tourist products.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware from previous responses, the provisions of Council Directive 89/552, which came into effect on 3 October 1991, relating to independently produced programmes and programmes of European origin have been implemented by Statutory Instrument 251 of 1991, made on 27 September 1991 and entitled the European Communities (Television Broadcasting) Regulations, 1991.  It is a matter for the RTE Authority to comply with these regulations.</P>
      <P>RTE have, very recently, supplied my Department with figures relating to the transmission of independent productions for 1990 and 1991.  RTE estimate that 10.05 per cent and 9.7 per cent of transmission time in each year respectively was devoted to independent productions. Because broadcasters are still putting in place the necessary measures to fully account for programming source, in the context of preparing the biannual reports required by the Commission, these figures may err on the cautious side, as they may not take full account of independent productions bought from the BBC, ITV or Channel 4.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 80 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>At present Iarnród Éireann are providing a range of commuter rail services on the Dublin-Mullingar line which includes Enfield.  There are no proposals under consideration by Iarnród Éireann to extend the range of these services.  The upgrading of services and the reopening of stations such as Kilcock is, under the Transport Acts, a matter entirely for Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Government has recently approved the development of diesel based commuter rail services along the south west rail corridor.  The project will cost approximately £12.4 million, of which 50 per cent will be provided by EC Structural Funds.  The project involves the development of commuter rail services between Kildare town and Heuston Station, with a dedicated feeder bus service link to the city centre.  The main elements of the project are as follows: new or increased outer suburban services based on existing stations at Newbridge and Kildare; new stations to be established at Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin, Hazelhatch (Celbridge) and Sallins (Naas); services to be provided using a combination of existing mainline trains plus two new diesel railcar trains and dedicated feeder bus services, from Heuston Station to the city centre.  The new commuter services are expected to commence in early 1994.</P>

      <P>In 1990, KPMG Stokes Kennedy Crowley on behalf of the Irish Government and the EC Commission examined Ireland's requirement for improved sea and air freight services.  Based on the recommendations contained in their Access Transport Study, the Government applied to the EC Commission for initial priority investment in direct shipping services to mainland Europe which were regarded as essential by the consultants.</P>
      <P>On 18 December 1991, the EC Commissioner for Regional Affairs indicated that the Commission was not in a position to agree to Ireland's proposal.  Among the reasons cited by the Commission were difficulties in relation to distortion of competition.</P>
      <P>Following direct personal intervention by me, the Commission agreed to consider a renewed application which would address, <i>inter alia,</i> the concerns which had been expressed by the Commission. The renewed application was forwarded to the Commission in April 1992.</P>
      <P>There has been further extensive discussions between my officials and the Commission.  Arising from these it was agreed to update aspects of the Access Transport Study.  The Commission are at present considering the updated study and their response is awaited.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed Unemployment Benefit from 3 September 1992.  To qualify for Unemployment Benefit a person must have 39 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing tax year which was 1990-91 in this case.  The person concerned entered insurable employment in June 1991 and did not have sufficient contributions in the year 1990-91 to qualify for Unemployment Benefit.  Accordingly there was a delay in authorising her claim while her entitlement to credited contributions for this period was being examined.  Her entitlement to credits has now been established and she qualifies for Unemployment Benefit from 3 September 1992.</P>
      <P>Arrears of £335.70 were issued to her on 23 October 1992.  Payment at a rate of £53.00 per week will be made to her while she continues to qualify for Unemployment Benefit.</P>
