      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to assure the House that I will fully discharge the duty placed on me by Artcle 28.5.2º of the Constitution to keep the President generally informed on matters of domestic and international policy.  I would not, however, regard it as appropriate or in keeping with the constitutional position to depart from precedent by discussing, in detail, in this House how I propose to do this.  I should add, however, that, as I indicated I would, in reply to a supplementary question on Wednesday week last, I met the President yesterday for general discussions, and, of course, our respective offices keep in touch on a daily basis on a wide variety of matters.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House if it is a departure from <Col N="1030" /> recent practice that the Taoiseach's Office and the President's Office get in touch on a daily basis?  Would the Taoiseach agree that in the past Presidents have been largely ignored by Governments, and would he further agree that a structured arrangement for keeping the President generally informed in accordance with Article 28.5.2º of the Constitution would be a desirable practice from here on?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that the two offices did not regularly keep in touch irrespective of what administration was involved.  In relation to any details about meetings or otherwise, it has never been the practice of this House to have a debate on that aspect and I will not depart from that.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the President could well be a useful source of independent and confidential advice to the Taoiseach, and that the advice given now is one way?  Would the Taoiseach confirm that he intends to have the sort of meetings he had yesterday regularly with the President and that he will on a regular basis keep her informed as is required in Article 28.5.2º, since this Article of the Constitution has been breached on a number of occasions in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, would it be possible for the Taoiseach to answer Question No. 2 separately, as it is on a specific matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see anything specific in it; it is linked with the British Prime Minister's meeting.</P>
      <P>My meeting with the SDLP on 24 February, at which I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, provided an opportunity to obtain, at first hand, their assessment of the prospects for political progress in relation to Northern Ireland and to outline the Government's approach as set out by me in the House recently.  We also discussed North/South economic co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At our meeting in London on 26 February, the British Prime Minister and I <Col N="1032" /> discussed a range of bilateral matters, European Community affairs, and other issues of common interest to our countries.</P>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, we were in total agreement on the need to take forward political dialogue in the three-stranded talks and we pledged the support of our Governments for this process.  I conveyed to the Prime Minister my Government's appreciation of his initiative in meeting in Downing Street, for the first time since 1976, the leaders of the four main constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland and our welcome for the agreement he reached with those leaders under which they would meet to discuss obstacles in the way of further political dialogue.  Deputies will be aware that, in furtherance of their agreement with the Prime Minister, the party leaders met last Friday and indicated that they see no obstacle to the resumption of talks as soon as possible.  The Government very much welcome this propitious development.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I also discussed the recent violence in Northern Ireland and its appalling toll of death, bereavement and destruction.  We reaffirmed our determination to work together, through co-operation in all areas, including security, so that those who are engaged in terrorist activities are fully dealt with under the law, and that terrorism does not succeed.</P>
    <P>We also affirmed our joint commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and agreed that it would continue to be implemented in full unless it is transcended by new and better arrangements.</P>
    <P>We continued our discussions at a working dinner.  The Prime Minister was accompanied at this dinner by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Brooke, and the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Dr. Brian Mawhinney, MD, and the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr. Tristan Gasrel-Jones, MP I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Pádraig Flynn.  Our discussions covered European Community <Col N="1033" /> and international issues, as well as further consideration of Northern Ireland matters.</P>
    <P>I outlined to the Prime Minister the importance Ireland attaches to the Maastricht Treaty and our initial appreciation of the Commission proposals for the Delors package mark II.  I also set out for him our concerns in relation to the agriculture aspects of the GATT negotiations and as regards the Commission's proposals on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The British side conveyed their views on Delors mark II and on the likely priorities of the UK's Presidency of the Community in the second half of this year.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I agreed to remain in touch and to continue the understanding about meetings at least twice yearly.  These meetings will normally alternate between Dublin and London.</P>
    <P>While in London I also had a very useful meeting with the Leader of the British Labour Party, Mr. Neil Kinnock, MP, who was accompanied by his Deputy, Mr. Roy Hattersley and the party's spokesman on Northern Ireland, Mr. Kevin McNamara.  I outlined the Government's approach to the Northern Ireland question and our hopes that political dialogue would commence as soon as possible.  We also touched on EC concerns.</P>
    <P>My meeting with the Prime Minister provided an early opportunity for me to renew my acquaintance with Mr. Major. We have the shared objective of seeing that yet another generation is not afflicted with a repetition of the suffering and deprivation of the past 22 years of violence.  I look forward to working with the Prime Minister to that end and achieving progress through the political process &mdash; and the peace and reconciliation desired by the vast majority of the people in these islands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party may I welcome the fact that discussions are being resumed between the parties in Northern Ireland?  I am sure that view is shared by all sides of this House.  Are <Col N="1034" /> there proposals to have a further meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference before either the British general election or the end of April, whichever is the later?  In regard to the subject matter of Question No. 2, did the British Prime Minister indicate to the Taoiseach that his Government were opposed to Delors mark II, which involves a 35 per cent increase in own resources for the Community? Is the Taoiseach aware that if that package is not approved, there will be no funds available for compensation under the MacSharry package and that this would have very grave consequences for the Irish economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference before April; one is scheduled for Friday next, 6 March.  In response to the Deputy's second question let me say, the British and Irish Governments have different interests, as the Deputy will appreciate in relation to Delors mark II.  Clearly the British Government see the increase sought by President Delors in his package as being excessive, while we want to see it maintained as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify two matters: first, did the question of an internal settlement in Northern Ireland arise in his discussions with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, and if so did the Taoiseach express a view on its acceptability or otherwise?  Second, will the Taoiseach outline what obstacles, in his view, were removed over the past number of days to facilitate the talks in Northern Ireland and whether he and the British Prime Minister played a role in removing those obstacles to facilitate the recommencement of talks, which we all welcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's second question, clearly the calling of all political leaders in Northern Ireland to a meeting at Downing Street had the effect of focusing their minds on the recommencement of talks.  We are all glad that talks have recommenced.  We are aware that the British Prime Minister <Col N="1035" /> and the Leader of the British Labour Party made statements to the effect that irrespective of the results of the general election, the talks should continue on the same basis as prior to the election.  I know that written commitments to that effect are being sought at present.</P>
      <P>I am aware also that talks are scheduled to take place very shortly after the Anglo-Irish Conference meeting on Friday.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's first question, I should like to say we were not dealing with the specifics of an internal settlement; we ranged over a variety of topics and we did not get down to any specific detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated in his statement after his meeting with Mr. Major that the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, was on the agenda. Could he now indicate what aspects of that Act were placed on the table and whether he believes they conflict in any way with aspects of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, specifically article 1 of that Agreement?  Is the Taoiseach seeking a written statement from the British Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on the basis of the recommencement of talks, which I hope are underway again, and their continuation after the British general election which will be held shortly?  When discussing the Maastricht Treaty with the British Prime Minister did the Taoiseach raise the fact that Britain opted out of the Social Charter aspects of the treaty and how that will impact on jobs and the social concerns of workers in Ireland?  Does he see this having an impact on Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the discussion that took place related to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, but, as I said in this House before, my approach is to be fair-minded and open in discussions, recognising the differences and the diversity of the traditions in both communities. In that context, I demonstrated clearly that my approach was fair and equitable. <Col N="1036" /> I do not see any conflict in discussing aspects of the 1920 Act and article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In fact article 1 of the Agreement accepts that there are differences in approach.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's question on the Maastricht Treaty, we discussed the referendum on this matter to be held by the Irish Government later in the year and also the possible holding of referenda in France and Denmark as well.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that Britain opted out of the Social Charter and we will be dealing with this question again under the British Presidency, if not beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the Anglo-Irish Agreement effectively supersedes the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, in that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was explicitly approved by the British Parliament? Second, does the Taoiseach agree that no matter how the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, is interpreted it does not have the same constitutional imperative force as our courts have decided Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as we all know, is the basic legislation which partitioned this country.  Every initiative that has been taken so far, up to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and the three strands approach to talks at present, has clearly failed.  I see no serious conflict with the Anglo-Irish Agreement in going back to analysing the problem from the start.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement can, of course, be expanded and enlarged as we go along and now that the strand one talks are about to start again we hope that strand two can start as soon as possible after strand one.  We will work along those lines through political dialogue.  The explanatory memorandum which accompanied the 1920 Act showed the thinking at the time about the setting up of a Council of Ireland and the devolving of various policy matters to the Council, such as fisheries, railways and common administration in relation to animal disease. <Col N="1037" /> There are many interesting aspects to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the subject matter of Question No. 2, in view of the serious importance for Ireland of the extra financing for the Community in the Delors package, does the Taoiseach propose to take any steps to persuade Prime Ministers of other member states who have so far indicated opposition to these proposals to change their minds?  Apart from his discussions with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, has the Taoiseach any plans to meet Chancellor Kohl, who has indicated that he too is opposed to the Delors package?  If that opposition were successful it would have disastrous effects on the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House can be assured that all steps necessary to persuade everybody and anybody in relation to it will be taken.  The matter was the subject of discussion at the General Affairs Council on Monday and we will continue to lobby, everywhere we have to whenever we have to, regarding the approach of other member states to the Delors plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the policy on Northern Ireland which the Taoiseach outlined on behalf of his Government at his meeting with Prime Minister Major concur completely with that outlined and pursued by his predecessor since 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We reaffirmed our total commitment to the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and our approach to the three strands of talks.  We were not then aware of the probable resumption of those talks but we welcome them and hope they can proceed on the basis envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach would have to agree that the placing of the 1920 Act on the agenda was a departure from the previously stated policy of the Government.  I would ask him to expand on his view as to the aspects of that Act which will be on the table.  It is <Col N="1038" /> fine to talk about the co-operation which was envisaged under that Act; that is the kind of co-operation we would envisage in any event, with or without the 1920 Act.  Could the Taoiseach explain in more explicit detail what specific aspect of the 1920 Act he wants tabled as part of the bargain in having Articles 2 and 3 also on the table?  Perhaps he would give an answer to my earlier question with regard to guarantees from the British Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Neil Kinnock.  Is he seeking a written commitment from them or is he satisfied with the private commitment he has received from them with regard to the basis of talks after the forthcoming British general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the latter part of the Deputy's question, both leaders have already made public statements in regard to the situation post-election. They are being asked by the parties in the North of Ireland for written commitments to reaffirm that position.  I leave it at that.  Regarding the further details sought by the Deputy, this was an introductory meeting.  Our thoughts and our plans on various structures will be developed as we go along.  I can reassure the House that along with the resumption of the three strands of talks both of us agreed that we would keep in touch on a regular basis and watch developments as they take place.  We are not necessarily bound to stick with the two meetings which have become institutionalised.  We can have as many meetings as are thought desirable as occasion arises and we will keep in close touch in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's discussions with the British Prime Minister and the 1920 Act, did he raise the question of the monstrous &ldquo;check point Charlie&rdquo; arrangements along the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic?  Would he bring to the attention of the British Prime Minister that this is an unfriendly act and a vote of no confidence in our security arrangements along the Border?  I ask the Taoiseach to question whether, under the <Col N="1039" /> 1920 Act, the British Government have authority to close the Border during the hours of darkness.  Would the Taoiseach care to comment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not engaging in repetition.  I intend to approach the question in a slightly different way. Articles 2 and 3 which the Taoiseach has offered to put on the table refer to the territorial claim by this State with regard to Northern Ireland.  The 1920 Act is the basis in legal terms for the existence of Northern Ireland.  Is that the fundamental issue which is at stake when he places this item on the agenda?  Is he now saying he does not accept the constitutional position of Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be fully aware that any discussions in relation to Articles 2 and 3 and the 1920 Act will be on the table at the end of the day.  That has already been made clear and I again confirm it.  The question of the concerns of both communities will be put on the table at the same time.  That <Col N="1040" /> has been my approach and it is a fair, open-minded and equitable approach when we reach the table for final discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of security in general terms arose.  There was no specific discussion on internment.  The Prime Minister made it clear at his press briefing afterwards that as far as he was concerned internment was there to be used if thought necessary.  With regard to other security matters, there were complimentary remarks to the Irish Government and the security forces here for their continued co-operation.  Many of those&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The proportion of women barristers in the Attorney General's Office is approximately the same as the proportion of women barristers in the Law Library at present who have the number of years practice required for recruitment to that office.  The Deputy may or may not be aware that the minimum number of years practice is four years.  Considerably fewer women than men chose to practice at the Bar up to 15 years ago and less than one in ten barristers were women, but the situation is reversing itself in recent times.</P>

Perhaps the Taoiseach would indicate from where he gets his figures to suggest that the Attorney General's Office reflects the balance of practising barristers currently at the Bar?  I suggest to the Taoiseach that it does not reflect such a balance and that the imbalance in the Attorney General's Office is worthy of investigation by the Employment Equality Agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At my invitation, the women Members of the Oireachtas met me on Tuesday last, 25 February 1992, to discuss the concern which had been expressed by all Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; but particularly its women Members &mdash; arising from the recent High Court judgment in the case of the 14 year old victim of an alleged rape.</P>
      <P>The meeting provided me with an important opportunity to hear the views of all the women Members of the Oireachtas who attended the meeting and to have a full and frank exchange of views on the options to deal with this problem which had been raised arising from my consultations with the other party leaders on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my discussions with the Oireachtas women Members took place in advance of the Supreme Court ruling on the parents' appeal in this case.  I have made clear my view that further consideration of this distressing case must await the Supreme <Col N="1045" /> Court making available the reasons for their decision on the parents' appeal.  I welcome the Supreme Court's decision to lift the injunction on travelling.  We still await the reasons for the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas women Members asked me to have a further meeting with them when the Supreme Court decision and the reason for this were available.  I responded that I was anxious to preserve the cross-party support which has been so evident and so welcome in our dealing with this matter.  I made it clear that I would be having discussions with party leaders on the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal.  I propose to do this as soon as practicable after the detailed judgement from the Supreme Court becomes available.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my gratitude to the Taoiseach for meeting with all the women Members in the House; it was certainly a very useful meeting.  Most of the women who contributed at the meeting expressed their concern about the present situation with regard to the lack of information and access to information on abortion and other issues regarding women's health and the lack of non-directive counselling. Whatever the outcome of the Supreme Court judgment these matters will have to be resolved.  Would the Taoiseach consider asking the Oireachtas Joint Committee <Col N="1046" /> on Women's Rights to examine the extent of the problems created by these difficulties and perhaps make a recommendation or give him a brief?</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons in the motor trade have suffered serious losses on vehicles in stock arising from the reductions in excise duty on motor vehicles announced in the budget, and if he will introduce a scheme in the Finance Bill to allow such persons to reclaim such losses by way of an appropriate excise rebate.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that, because of the particular difficulties facing the motor trade at present which I recognised in a reduction in the excise on cars and abolition of that on certain commercial vehicles, I have authorised the Revenue Commissioners to implement a scheme of relief from excise duty in respect of motor vehicles delivered at the existing rates of duty on or before 29 January 1992 but not sold until after that date.  The scheme is as follows:</P>
      <P>A.  For cars:</P>
      <P>(i)  To qualify a car must have been removed from warehouse in the period 1 December 1991 to 29 January 1992.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Relief for qualifying cars will be restricted to 70 per cent of the full reduction in duty; (i.e. 1.57 percentage points).</P>
      <P>B.  For goods vehicles:</P>
      <P>(i)  To qualify a goods vehicle must have been removed from warehouse in the period 1 November 1991 to 29 January 1992.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Full relief will be made for those qualifying vehicles which exceed three tonnes weight (unladen).  For other qualifying goods vehicles, it will be restricted to 70 per cent of the reduction in duty (i.e. 4.55 percentage points).</P>
      <P>All claims for relief must conform with specifications laid down by the Revenue Commissioners.  These will include the supply of information on the date of sale of the vehicle and any other information which they deem to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No claims will be accepted after 27 March 1992, and I should stress that no <Col N="1052" /> relief will be granted to any party making fraudulent claims.</P>
    <P>Finally, as a result of my action, I expect the motor trade to pass on to final consumers the full benefits resulting from the duty reduction.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for his prompt reply to my representations.  I am sure he will thank me for giving him the opportunity to make this announcement in the House. From the text of his reply, it seems that the concession is being made to motor traders adversely affected by the reduction in excise duty on motor vehicles.  May I ask the Minister if it also applies to the budgetary announcement of the removal of the 6.5 per cent excise duty on articulated trucks?</P>

      <P>First, I should say to the Deputy that I received his detailed representations and, as he may know, I held discussions with SIMI for a number of days last week.  It has also been my practice as Minister to make announcements in the House and not outside.  I acknowledge what the Deputy said.  No difficulty arose in the case of the larger trucks because 100 per cent relief is made.  They were happy with that.  As I have to come to realise during the past few weeks, every trader is not a member of SIMI and I have tried to take into account the representations made by others.  In this regard, one could put the date back but in relation to cars the date of 1 December is fair.  Given that trucks have hoods I moved the date back by a further month.  That is a reasonable concession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 January 1984, it was announced that appointments to the posts of Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Assistant Secretary, and equivalent non-general service posts, were to be made on the recommendation of a top level appointments committee.  Secretaries appointed under the new system would serve for a period of not more than seven years and would have to retire from such posts at age 60 instead of age 65.  Officers aged 55 years or over at 3 January 1984 were eligible for appointment as Secretary but, if appointed, would have to retire after five years or in any case at age 65 years.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 5 March 1987 that, where an appointee reaches the end of his/her term before age 60, the Government would consider the position in each individual case with a view to deciding whether to appoint the person concerned to another position elsewhere in the Civil Service.  If the Government decide not to follow this course, then other options are explored, including a possible appointment elsewhere in the public service or in an international organisation. Such appointments would be by mutual agreement.  Where these options are not possible, then the Government may, at their discretion, allow early retirement in accordance with the provisions of sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963. Where an appointee reaches the end of his/her term after age 60, but before the normal retiring age of 65, these provisions may also be applied.  I should stress that Secretaries and Heads of Departments hold office at the will and pleasure of the Government in accordance with section 5 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 and that the early retirement provisions are entirely at the discretion of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My immediate area of responsibility is, of course, the Civil Service and the extension of terms on the lines of those outlined above to other areas is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant Minister responsible for the service concerned or, in the case of State bodies, for the relevant boards.  However, the Deputy <Col N="1054" /> may be aware that broadly similar arrangements have been made in respect of the Garda Commissioner and city and county managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, wearing his hat as Minister responsible for the public service, that it would be very useful to extend the seven year requirement to similar grades, such as Deputy Secretary, Assistant Secretary and to similar grades in the wider public service, so that people can be either reappointed on merit or make way for those from lower ranks or, indeed, outside the public service who are capable of doing the job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported these measures from the other side of the House, when they were introduced.  I would be prepared to look at any aspect but other arguments could be made.  For example, there is a cost element in that people may be offered an attractive package at a relatively young age.  The position has been radically changed.  As we are all aware from discussions at committees of the House and from our involvement with Secretaries at different Departments the age profile of Secretaries and the opportunities available to them have changed dramatically.  Last year the arrangements extended to the Garda Commissioner and city and county managers.  Perhaps it should be looked at on a case by case basis to see if it should be extended but there can be a cost element.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it would be a good idea to extend it not just throughout the public service to include the chief executive officers at vocational education committee and Eastern Health Board levels but to civil servants?  Will he agree further that it would be a good idea to encourage civil servants, having served a seven year period, to work elsewhere in the public or private sectors and to encourage people in the private sector to enter the public service on seven year contracts? Would this not be good for the public <Col N="1055" /> service?  Would it not stimulate competition and service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 107 and 164 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the budget, income tax relief was available on up to £5,000 worth of shares per annum per employee allocated to employees under approved profit sharing schemes.  In my budget speech, I indicated that I proposed to abolish this relief <Col N="1056" /> in respect of shares acquired by trustees of such schemes with funds paid over to such trustees on or after budget day.  A Financial Resolution to this effect was passed by Dáil Éireann on budget night.</P>
    <P>I have indeed received representations since budget day requesting restoration of the relief.  While I have noted what has been said in these representations, I have in response pointed out that abolition of the relief, like other comparable budget measures, must be seen in the context of the Government's commitment to tax reform as set out in last October's review of the Programme for Government.  I have also stressed that the Government's approach, of extending the tax base by abolition or curtailment of special reliefs, has been recommended &mdash; and constantly urged on Government &mdash; by such bodies as the Commission on Taxation, the European Community, the OECD, the National Economic and Social Council, and most recently by the Industrial Policy Review Group.  Inevitably, tax reform which does not prejudice the Government's budgetary targets must entail some trade-offs between improvements in the mainstream income tax regime and reliefs which benefit limited groups. However, the general consensus is that our economic needs &mdash; and the needs of employers and employees &mdash; are better served by a tax system which has fewer special reliefs, and lower mainstream tax rates for all taxpayers.  I would also point out that abolition of the relief must be seen in the context of the continuing process of tax reform over recent years, which has seen the top rate of tax cut from 58 per cent to 48 per cent and the standard rate cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent, and the standard rate tax band extended by nearly 60 per cent since 1987.  As Deputies will be aware, it is the Government's firm intention to endeavour to achieve further progress in tax reform in the 1993 budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, having regard to the fact that just under 100,000 employees are involved in this scheme and that the total cost to the Exchequer was £1.8 million in 1991, that <Col N="1057" /> the scheme's benefits are lauded throughout industry?  Will he also recognise that last July, when Minister for Labour, he published a Green Paper at the request of the FIE extolling the virtues of the scheme?  The Taoiseach &mdash; who was then Minister for Finance &mdash; also extolled its virtues.  Having regard to the very explicit commitment to the benefits of such a scheme over a considerable period of time, what happened to the Minister for Labour when he became Minister for Finance which forced him to make a U-turn in regard to this measure?  How did they get at the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A few months ago the Deputy said that I would never be able to fill the post of Minister for Finance.  I see many benefits in this scheme and I am on record in that regard.  I was responsible for the publication of a document in relation to it and I am also partly responsible for the Programme for Government which said that if we want to reduce our tax rates and broaden the tax base, according to national and international advice, we must look at all the shelters, reliefs and exemptions in the system.  I suppose that every relief removed affected some group.  I am sure the Deputy, if he had time, could argue about the benefits and productivity in relation to this scheme.  However, I wish to take issue in regard to the figure: 80,000, the highest I heard until today, is compiled on the basis of taking from the returns of the Revenue Commissioners the number of people who have share options in each year.  In fact, the same companies use them and normally towards the end of each year an employee gets a proportion of the £5,000 in share reliefs.  The same people are being counted on an annual basis and the figure involved is probably less than half the one mentioned.</P>

      <P>There has been no change whatsoever in that policy.  The established accounting treatment of the proceeds of such sales, whereby any receipts of this nature are treated as Exchequer capital receipts was, as the Deputy should be aware, maintained in the 1992 budget.  The proceeds of the recent disposal by the State of part of its remaining shares in Greencore are being taken to account in precisely the same way as those of the original flotation last year.</P>
      <P>Under this accounting treatment, the question of using such funds for current expenditure purposes does not arise; to the extent that debt-servicing costs are reduced by such sales there is, of course, a saving on Central Fund Services.</P>

I used the argument regarding the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on the basis that things change, and that applied to Greencore shares.  I said that we had to change rules in consultation with the social partners, particularly public service workers, in relation to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I did not say that the money was being transferred; the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is costing less this year.  The accountancy method used of Exchequer capital receipts is the same one which has been used over the last number of years. I will give a few examples: in 1989 the sale of Tara Mines was treated in the same way; in 1990 a number of shares were sold, including those in Irish Spruce; in 1991 there was the sale of Greencore shares, Great Southern Hotels, IDA redemption of shares and Irish Life shares.  This year Greencore shares are involved, so the accountancy method is exactly the same.</P>

      <P>I am not going to correct Deputy Noonan every time he says I mislead the House because he continually says that I mislead the House.  I did not mislead the House on budget day.  The Deputy asked what is the accountancy practice.  The accountancy practice for disposal of shares is in the Exchequer capital receipts.  I want to make it absolutely clear that it is the same process.  The Deputy answered the question himself. Regardless of whether the amount is taken off the accumulated debt up to the end of the previous year or taken off the debt in the current year, it is the same thing.  Therefore, it does not make any difference.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the present situation with regard to wheelchair access is not ideal and I am pleased to say that works are being undertaken to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>A new lift which allows wheelchair users direct access to the visitors' gallery was recently installed.  External and internal ramps will be constructed during the summer recess and these, taken in conjunction with the new lift, will provide access to most areas of the House.</P>
      <P>These works, as is normal, are being carried our by the Office of Public Works. I hope Deputy Garland will avail of this opportunity to withdraw the obscene remarks he made on Wednesday last in this House when he referred to the Office of Public Works staff as faceless Fascists. Such references to civil servants are contrary to the traditions of the House and are not acceptable.  I wish to place it formally on the record that I have always found the staff of the Office of Public Works to be committed and dedicated.

I do not know why the Minister chose this opportunity to bring in this totally extraneous matter.  I asked about access for wheelchair users to Leinster House and not about interpretative centres. It is a gross abuse of Question Time to go off the agenda like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an absolute disgrace that we are only now getting down to providing proper facilities in this House for wheelchair users.

If the Deputy does not like to listen to the facts it is time he read what he said. As a public representative it is time the Deputy realised that people who are not in this House have a right to be respected, particularly when they serve the State with such dedication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer <Col N="1064" /> Questions Nos. 24, 25, 84, 96, 134, 135, 176 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>The completion of the Internal Market in accordance with the provisions of the Single European Act and, in particular, the abolition of internal frontier controls, will mean considerable staffing, operational and other changes for the Customs and Excise service.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have now produced a report on the staffing implications for the Customs and Excise service of the planned completion of the Single European Market on 1 January 1993 and, in particular, the elimination of the fiscal frontiers and Border controls between member states.</P>
      <P>This report has been presented by the Revenue Commissioners to the staff and the staff unions concerned.  In summary it shows that a potential surplus of approximately 600 Customs and Excise staff will arise as a consequence of the introduction of the Internal Market.  This surplus figure is based on the current assessment of post-1992 staffing requirements taking account of decisions taken so far at EC and national levels.  It will be necessary, of course, to review, on a continuing basis, the assumptions made in the report in so far as those might be impacted upon by future decisions in relation to the completion of the Internal Market.</P>
      <P>Within this overall outcome, it is clear that the impact of the Single Market changes falls unevenly on Customs and Excise locations.  Understandably, areas with a heavy customs preventative work element such as the Border areas will suffer the most.  These areas will require special attention to avoid hardship to Customs and Excise and their families.</P>
      <P>Referring specifically to Deputy Deasy's question, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are at present 74 Customs and Excise staff employed in County Waterford and that based on current decisions and assumptions they estimate that 32 of these will be surplus to requirements following the completion of the Internal Market on 1 January 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1065" /> have outlined proposals aimed at reducing the surplus figure. These proposals envisage the enhancing of existing areas of work currently undertaken by Customs and Excise staff such as the control of drugs and other illicit traffic and the control of duty-free sales to better cater for the post-1992 environment. Also the commissioners have put forward proposals for the involvement of Customs and Excise staff in new areas of work which will arise post-1992 but on which final decisions have yet to be taken.  These areas would include motor vehicle taxation and control of excisable products.  I have no doubt that these proposals will prove fruitful in reducing the surplus numbers.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have made it clear that it will not be possible to address the surplus staff situation solely within the Customs and Excise area. They have, therefore, put before the staff and the staff unions concerned the necessity to accept that solutions to the surplus staff problem must be sought within Revenue as a whole and within the wider public and Civil Service areas. They have put forward, in this context, a specific proposal to absorb surplus Customs and Excise staff through access to decentralisation posts in Revenue and in the wider public and Civil Service areas.  The Deputy will be aware that in the current phase of the decentralisation programme the Revenue Commissioners are relocating about 900 staff to the Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh areas.  Furthermore, the House will be aware that in the next phase of the decentralisation programme the Government have decided to relocate staff to Tullamore, Cork, Portlaoise, Wexford, Kilkenny, Waterford and Dundalk, areas in which staff surpluses have been identified in the 1992 context.  It is obvious that the relocations to these centres provide the opportunity to absorb staff in their local communities.</P>
    <P>Other specific proposals to absorb surplus Customs and Excise staff outlined in the report include: using Customs and Excise staff to fill normal vacancies arising in non-decentralised areas of Revenue <Col N="1066" /> and other Departments; transfer of Customs and Excise staff to other Departments; derogation for Revenue from interdepartmental promotion panels; the identification of what work, now done elsewhere in Revenue, could more advantageously be done by Customs and Excise staff; the identification of what new work in support of activities elsewhere in Revenue could be undertaken by Customs and Excise staff, particularly in relation to compliance and collection operations; the identification of how Customs and Excise staff might best be integrated into other areas of Revenue; the introduction, without delay, of a migration plan, for redeployment of staff between now and 1 January 1993 and the availability of a voluntary early retirement package in the context of the surplus staff situation arising in the Customs and Excise area.</P>
    <P>All of these proposals are now being actively negotiated with the staff unions concerned and the Revenue Commissioners are keeping my Department fully informed of developments.  The implementation of these proposals will demand a high degree of flexibility and co-operation on the part of the staff and the unions concerned.  I would be hopeful that this will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the redeployment which may result from this will have a particularly adverse effect on Border areas?  I am thinking in particular of the town of Dundalk. May I specifically ask the Minister what proposals he has for Dundalk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Each individual area has been looked at in the plan.  Consideration has been given to the figures, grades, staff and the scope within areas for decentralisation. I referred to the Waterford area because there was a question on Waterford.  For example, if there are 50 posts in an area we will look at how many of the posts can be filled through other Revenue work or public service work and if people are interested in early retirement packages.  That is being done in respect of each area.  The report is being discussed with the staff unions, particularly <Col N="1067" /> with the local branches for each area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is extremely complex but this is such a serious issue that it needs to be addressed in great depth.  Did the Minister say there will be 600 surplus staff in the whole country, including 32 in Waterford?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down the question initially because the Customs officials in the various centres who are affected were not communicated with until quite recently, and they did not know where they stood.  Any person who is unsure of his future career would be extremely anxious to find out the position.  Can the Minister say whether these people will be made redundant or will they be placed in other jobs within the Civil Service in the areas in which they are at present employed?</P>

When I took up this post in November the issue was brought to my notice by several Deputies who asked me to meet groups from various areas.  I met a number of representatives and then asked that we proceed with work on the report.  This is a public document, and Deputy Deasy is correct; it was essential that it be completed and published as quickly as possible.  It covers every area &mdash; what will happen, what the possibilities are for each area, the structures and possibilities for new revenue tasks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report that issued before Christmas which made disappointing reading for people in the Dundalk area and along the Border.  A supplemental report, issued this week and handed to Customs officials, is of even greater disappointment to the Dundalk area in that approximately 90 staff in that area will be surplus to needs at end-1992.  What specific proposals exist in relation to the Dundalk area as regards replacing the work these people have been doing?  Is the Minister aware that the counterparts of the Customs officers in Newry have been taken care of with the decentralisation of VAT collectors to the Newry area to take up any surplus that might occur on that side of the Border?  Could the Minister comment on the much heralded decentralisation programme for Dundalk which has run into difficulties?  The Revenue Commissioners are at present considering possible factory premises in the Dundalk area in which to locate surplus staff, but perhaps it would be better if they were located in the decentralised office.</P>

      <P>I would like to reply to Deputy Dermot Ahern because he is one of the Deputies to whom I referred earlier who asked me to meet a number of staff groups from Dundalk.  Because of its location close to the Border, Dundalk has been hit very badly in this report. The Revenue Commissioners, staff unions concerned and officials of my Department, have been considering the position in Dundalk to see whether the best way to proceed would be by way of decentralisation, relocation of staff or other activities which will be necessary after 1 January next, to reduce substantially the numbers at present involved.</P>

    <P>With regard to conclusion 21 of the report, I have noted the comments therein but it is also noted in the body of the report that the inspectors accept that the Greencore board acted on legal advice and, therefore, in good faith.

      <P>At the outset I welcome the completion of this investigation and, indeed, the decision of the court to authorise publication of the report on the findings of that investigation.  I also point out that this investigation was carried out under the auspices of the court following application by me under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990.  Section 12 of the Act provides that the court, after considering a report made to it, may make such order as it deems fit in relation to matters arising from that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice, therefore, to any order which the court may decide to <Col N="1072" /> make, it can be taken that the Government will be concerned to ensure that in so far as any action is called for by it or its agencies arising from the findings of the report, such action will be taken.  In particular, copies of the report will be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to pursuing prosecutions where evidence of breaches of criminal law would sustain that course.</P>
    <P>Although the findings of the report in relation to the ownership of the Talmino loan note differ from those in the earlier section 14 investigation, I confirm that that loan note will continue to be subject to the section 16 restriction which I have issued in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I understand that a copy of the report has already been sent to the Revenue Commissioners for them to pursue the matters which are relevant to them arising from the report.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I put it to the Minister that the first conclusion in today's report of the inspectors appointed by the High Court is in absolute conflict with that and states that Mr. Comerford and his family never had a legal or beneficial interest in the ownership of Talmino.  Does the Minister think it satisfactory that two such expensive inquiries, which have cost the taxpayer so much, should now be in conflict and that the persons involved will quite clearly be able to play one report against the other?  What further steps does the Minister intend taking to clarify the position and to make sure that the truth, whatever it is, is arrived at?</P>

      <P>I made it clear that the earlier report had reached a different <Col N="1073" /> conclusion in respect of the Talmino loan note.  In that report, issued about three months ago, the inspector said that on the evidence available at that time it seemed to him, on the balance of probabilities, that the ownership probably lay in a certain direction.  The two inspectors of the final report have had the advantage of much longer and more thorough investigation and they reached a contrary conclusion. Even if the two reports were similar on this point &mdash; and, so far as I can tell, this is the only point on which they are not similar &mdash; the matter would have to be decided by a civil court in any event.  Proceedings have already been instituted in the High Court in relation to the ownership of the loan note.  In the meantime, the freezing order I made some months ago concerning the note remains in place, as I mentioned in my earlier reply.</P>

Can the Minister explain to the House, in the light of those circumstances, how the inspectors could have found that no blame whatever attaches to the chairman, Mr. Cahill? Can he further comment on the inordinate expense this inspection is costing the taxpayer until the Minister for Justice makes other arrangements?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as Conclusion No. 21 on page 222 is concerned, the conclusions are, of course, entirely a matter for the inspectors themselves.  I cannot attempt to explain to the House or to anyone else the reasoning of the inspectors except in so far as it appears from the report, which is available to the Deputy now.  The Deputy may study the report in full at his leisure.  In so far as the particular incident is concerned, I understand that the board, some days after having made the arrangements to which the Deputy referred, thought better of it and withdrew the arrangements. I believe that those arrangements, like various other aspects of the matter are now the subject of litigation between the parties.</P>
      <P>I have already expressed my views in public and on several occasions in relation to the question of costs.  The costs seem to be extremely high and I hope that in any inquiry in the future we will not be faced with the present problem of very high costs.  Consideration of liability for the payment of the cost has, I understand, been adjourned by the High Court for further consideration on 21 March.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister present a question that is on the mind of every Irish citizen: in view of the fact that an Irish State-owned company has been ripped off by forgery, bribery and secret forging of documents &mdash; those are the words of the report &mdash; what action will any Minister take to ensure that nobody benefits from such illegal acts; that the money is restored to the Irish taxpayers, to whom it belongs; and that the cost of the inquiry does not fall upon the shoulders of the hard-pressed taxpayers? That is the only question to which people want an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already explained to the House, all of those matters have been taken in hand by the <Col N="1075" /> Government.  There was an application before the High Court today by the Minister for Justice that the costs be paid by Greencore because the problems appear to have arisen within that group.  Consideration of that application has been adjourned to 21 March and it would not be appropriate to say any more about that except that I hope the Minister's application will be successful.</P>
      <P>As far as fraud, bribery and so on are concerned, as both the Minister for Finance and I have made clear, the report has already been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and I hope he takes criminal proceedings at an early date in respect of these matters. However, it is outside the control of the Government.  The question of taking proceedings is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions but I hope he feels he has enough evidence to do so now.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister for Industry and Commerce aware of Conclusion No. 3 which states that Mr. Comerford was given and corruptly accepted moneys; that the purpose for making the payments was to circumvent public policy and may constitute the taking of bribes in consideration for remaining in his employment at Siuícre Éireann at a time when he was managing director of the company?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there was a breach of the criminal law, it will be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to institute proceedings, presumably on indictment.  In regard to the recovery of moneys from persons who might improperly have got them, that is a civil matter and it is open to the main company involved if it feels that it has been wrongly deprived of those moneys to institute civil proceedings for their recovery.  I am quite sure the company concerned will do that at the earliest available date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions did not take any moves against a 14-year-old girl recently.  The Deputy will be aware that there is legislation on the Statute Book which makes it an offence for practically anyone to intervene with the Director of Public <Col N="1077" /> Prosecutions.  The only exception I can think of readily is the Attorney General, and if the Attorney General can lawfully make suggestions or speak to the Director of Public Prosecutions about this matter I will certainly ask him to do all he can to expedite this matter.  I am concerned, for example, that even though an early report was given to the Director of Public Prosecutions in November, to the best of my knowledge no prosecutions have arisen out of that yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to reform the law of evidence in four important respects.  It makes it easier for children and persons with mental handicap to give evidence in cases of physical or sexual abuse; it sets out clearly the circumstances in which the spouse or a former spouse of an accused person is to be competent or compellable to give evidence; it makes business records admissible; and it will help to bring to justice persons who commit crimes against tourists.</P>
      <P>The most important of the reforms is that affecting the giving of evidence in child abuse cases and I will deal with that first.  What I have to say applies also to another vulnerable category &mdash; persons with mental handicap, irrespective of their age &mdash; but for convenience I will refer only to children in this context.</P>
      <P>At present there are serious difficulties where children are required as prosecution witnesses in cases of physical or sexual abuse.  The child may be too young to give evidence at all and no prosecution can be taken.  Even where the child can give evidence the court appearance may be disturbing and harmful.  It involves facing the accused again in the atmosphere of a crowded courtroom.  It involves the ordeal of examination and cross-examination.  There is sometimes the need to denounce a loved relative and also, perhaps, the possibility of a future threat from the accused.  Understandably, there is a desire to shield children from such an experience, often leading to a failure to report or prosecute the crime.  That situation encourages further abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission carried out extensive research into this problem, including a study of the measures adopted in other countries.  They published their conclusions in a consultation paper and, after considering a large number of submissions, published their final report in September 1990.  The provisions of <Col N="1285" /> Part III of the Bill are based on the recommendations in that report.</P>
    <P>Part III provides that persons under 17 may give evidence in cases of this kind by live television link and that, in an appropriate case, questions to those witnesses may be conveyed through a competent person appointed by the court. While evidence is being given, wigs or gowns will not be worn by the judge or by the barristers or solicitors concerned in the examination.  Moreover, it will not normally be necessary for the witnesses to identify the accused again in court if they have already done so during the investigation.  If their evidence at the preliminary examination of the offence has been videorecorded, the videorecording will be played at the trial and so it may not be necessary for them to give further evidence.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to have the necessary technical facilities installed in the Four Courts this year to enable evidence to be given there by live television link.  The system will then be extended to a courthouse in the south and in the west of the country and will be further extended later in the light of experience.  In the meantime, provision is being made in section 16 to enable courts in areas without these facilities to transfer cases of this kind to areas which have them.</P>
    <P>There appears to be general agreement that a contemporaneous account of events is frequently more accurate and detailed than one given much later in court, particularly in the case of child witnesses.  The Bill recognises this in providing that the evidence of children in these cases should be given at the preliminary examination of the offence rather than at the trial itself, which may be many months later.  It also makes admissible a videorecording of an interview with qualified people, which very often takes place shortly after the alleged offence, provided that the alleged victim is available for cross-examination by the accused.</P>
    <P>Changes are also being made as regards the competence of children as witnesses.  The present test of competence <Col N="1286" /> is whether the child has sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of its evidence and understands the duty of speaking the truth.  The Law Reform Commission reviewed the available psychological evidence on children's competence and came to the conclusion that the witnessing powers of children may have been seriously under-estimated by existing law.  It expressed the view that children's ability to answer questions about witnessed or experienced events is better than both the law and common belief has up to now recognised.  It said that even very young children can respond to the demands of testimony when questions are posed in a way appropriate to their stage of development.</P>
    <P>The commission accepted that in this area it would not be easy to arrive at a solution that would command universal acceptance.  On the one hand, the commission were impressed by the force of the contention that the account of the victim of an offence should at least be heard during the course of the trial, even where he or she was too young to understand the concept of being under an obligation to tell the truth.  But it said that, as against this, the danger of convicting an innocent person on the uncorroborated testimony of an immature child who did not understand the difference between truth and falsehood could hardly be over-estimated.</P>
    <P>The commission thought that the balance of the argument was, on the whole, in favour of confining the test of competence to one limited to ascertaining whether the child had the necessary verbal skills to give an account of the relevant events that was intelligible to the court.  They said that they had carefully weighed the risk that innocent people might be convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of immature children but were satisfied that, given the inherent safeguards of the criminal process itself, the possibility of any serious miscarriage of justice occurring was so remote that it could reasonably be discounted.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended accordingly, that the court should continue <Col N="1287" /> to make the ultimate decision as to the competence of children to give evidence.  The test of competency should be the capacity of the child to give an intelligible account of events which he or she had observed.  The Bill gives effect to this recommendation in section 26.</P>
    <P>In accordance with other recommendations of the commission, the present requirement that a child's unsworn evidence be corroborated is being abolished, as well as the requirement that the jury be warned about convicting on a child's sworn but uncorroborated evidence.</P>
    <P>These are very substantial changes in the law of evidence in criminal proceedings. They are however paralleled in many other countries where, as here, the extent of physical and sexual abuse of children has been underestimated and where the existing law has made it difficult, and in many cases impossible, to bring offenders to justice.  The new provisions provide a challenge to judges and the legal profession but I have no doubt that they will surmount any initial difficulties in the operation of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The second aim of the Bill is to set out clearly the circumstances in which the spouse or former spouse of an accused person is competent or compellable to give evidence.  For example, a wife will be obliged to give evidence for the prosecution if the husband is accused of violence against her or of violence or a sexual offence against a child.</P>
    <P>In this respect the Bill departs from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Competence and Compellability of Spouses as Witnesses.  In that report the commission recommended that it should be a general rule that a spouse is not compellable for the prosecution where the other spouse is charged with a criminal offence. However, the recommendation was given before the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1988 in the case of The People <i>v.</i> JT.  In that case the court held that any provision that purported to provide that a wife was not a compellable <Col N="1288" /> witness in charges against her husband of sexual assault on his daughter would be unconstitutional.  Other passages in the judgment suggest that any statutory restrictions on the compellability of a spouse for the prosecution in cases of attack by one spouse on the other would also be found to be unconstitutional. Accordingly, the Bill makes the spouse of an accused compellable in the case of domestic violence or of a sexual offence against a child of the marriage.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also that a spouse will be compellable where the other spouse is accused of offences involving violence or sexual offences against any person under 17 years, whether a member of the family or not.  This extension of compellability is based on the vulnerability of children and young persons to physical and sexual abuse and on the need to give them special protection.</P>
    <P>These are the only circumstances in which the spouse of an accused person will be compellable to give evidence for the prosecution.  A spouse will not be compellable in cases where the other spouse is accused of offences such as larceny, fraud and the like.</P>
    <P>The position of former spouses in this regard is also clearly set out.  They will be compellable for the prosecution in all cases except where the offences in question were committed during the period of the marriage and were of a kind for which a spouse would not be compellable.  I should say that for the purposes of the Bill &ldquo;former&rdquo; spouses includes a spouse who is still married but legally separated.</P>
    <P>This Part of the Bill seeks to provide a reasonable balance between the interests of protecting the institution of marriage and of protecting and vindicating the rights of spouses and children who are the victims of offences.  It therefore provides that the spouse of an accused will be compellable for the prosecution and a co-accused only in cases of violence or sexual offences but will be compellable for the accused in every case.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill, relating to documentary evidence, is based on recommendations of the Law Reform <Col N="1289" /> Commission in its Report on Receiving Stolen Property.  These provisions are of particular significance in relation to the successful prosecution of offences such as fraud.  They remedy a serious deficiency in our criminal procedure caused by the fact that at present documents are not admissible as evidence, apart from a few exceptions, such as social welfare records and bankers' books.  Moreover, most commercial records are held nowadays on computer and there is no provision for the admissibility of computerised records, apart from the exceptions I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious of the need for reform of the law in this area and, when the commission's recommendations on the law of dishonesty are received, their implementation will be given priority.</P>
    <P>The documents that are now being made admissible are those compiled in the ordinary course of business or administration on the basis of information supplied by someone with personal knowledge of the matters dealt with. Computer printouts are admissible provided that they have been produced in the course of the normal operation of the computer concerned.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill excludes documents prepared in contemplation of legal proceedings and documents that are privileged from disclosure &mdash; such as those covered by legal professional privilege &mdash; as well as documents containing information supplied by a person who would not be compellable to give evidence in the proceedings concerned.  But, exceptionally, it does make admissible such documents as maps, photographs, records of directions by members of the Garda Síochána, records of medical examinations and records of the handling of evidence.  I should emphasise that, with one exception, the documents being made admissible under the Bill may be given in evidence by either the accused or the prosecution.  The exception is a record of any direction given by a member of the Garda Síochána under an enactment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> In order to ensure that neither party to the proceedings is taken by surprise, it is being provided that a party wishing to give a document in evidence must give advance notice to the other party.  The notice must be given at least 21 days before the trial begins unless, in the case of the prosecution, the document has been included in the book of evidence. The other party can signal its objection to the admissibility of the documentary evidence by serving a notice of objection at least seven days before the trial begins, so that the party receiving the notice can decide whether to summon the witness, if available, to attend and give oral evidence. If the notice of objection is not served within the time specified or at all, then objection can be made at the trial to the admissibility of the evidence only with leave of the court.</P>
    <P>Before a document can be admitted in evidence under this Part of the Bill the party producing the document must prove that it satisfies the conditions for admissibility specified in section 5.  Provision is made in section 6 for this proof to be given by way of a certificate from a person who is in a position to give it. However, the court may require oral evidence to be given of any matter stated or specified in the certificate and it must do so where a notice has been served objecting to the admissibility of the whole or part of the information contained in the documents.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a key provision.  It provides that no documentary evidence will be admissible by virtue of section 5 if the court is of opinion that in the interests of justice the whole or any part of it ought not to be admitted.  The section spells out the considerations to which the court must have regard in reaching a decision on this point, including the likelihood that the information is reliable and that the document is authentic and also to any risk that its admission or exclusion would result in unfairness to the accused.  In other words, documentary evidence may be admissible under the Bill but whether it is actually admitted is entirely under the control of the court which is obliged <Col N="1291" /> to exclude it if in the interests of justice it ought not to be admitted.</P>
    <P>As I see it, this Part of the Bill will save a great deal of court time in the case of documents whose authenticity and probative value are not contested.  Where any of these matters is disputed, and oral evidence can be produced by the party producing the documents, that oral evidence will be forthcoming when a notice of objection is received to the admissibility of the documents.  In the remaining cases, that is, where the documents are contested and witnesses are dead or otherwise not available, the court will allow the documents to be admitted only if that would not be contrary to the interests of justice and it will pay particular attention to whether their admission would be unfair to the accused or, if it is the accused who has tendered the document, whether its exclusion would be unfair to him or her.</P>
    <P>The final aspect of the Bill to which I would like to draw attention is the provision made for the protection of tourists who have been the victims of crime.  At present the only way in which such a tourist can have a written statement by him read at the trial of the accused is to have it taken in the presence of a district judge and of the accused.  That procedure is set out in section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  While the sworn deposition is being made the accused has an opportunity of cross-examining the tourist.  Section 15 (2) (b) of that Act provides that, except where the witness has died, the deposition may not be read at the trial if the judge considers that to do so would not be in the interests of justice.</P>
    <P>Obviously, this provision is of little or no value to a tourist who has to leave the country before the alleged offender is apprehended.  Or the tourist may be still in the country but it would not be practicable for him to attend a formal hearing of this kind.  Section 5 (4) (a) of the Bill provides therefore that in such circumstances the victim may make a sworn statement before a district judge in any case where it would not be possible or <Col N="1292" /> practicable to avail of the present procedure. Such a statement will now be admissible at the trial of the alleged offender but, as in the case of a sworn deposition under the present law, it will not be admitted if the court is of opinion that in the interests of justice all or part of it ought not to be admitted.</P>
    <P>Further provision for enabling a tourist who has returned to his own country to give evidence is contained in section 28. That section provides that a witness outside the State may, with the leave of the court, give evidence through a live television link.</P>
    <P>I expect that both these measures will give greater protection to tourists against criminals who may have seen them as soft targets because of their inability to prosecute cases against them in court.</P>
    <P>Part V contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  I have already referred to some of them, such as the abolition of the necessity for young persons to take the oath, and section 28, which enables evidence to be given from outside the State by means of a live television link.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned section 28 as being relevant in relation to the prosecution of crimes against tourists, but of course it has a far wider significance that that in present circumstances, when international crime is on the increase.  There are various international conventions aimed at providing mutual assistance between countries for the purpose of prosecuting crime, such as facilities to enable evidence to be taken in one country for use in proceedings in another.  In legislation which I will be bringing forward shortly I will be dealing with that matter. While these conventions do not so far refer to giving evidence across frontiers by video links, I am sure that that will be a coming feature of inter-state arrangements and section 28 will enable us to take part fully in such a development.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that the Bill makes extensive changes in the law of evidence governing criminal proceedings.  In so far as it deals with evidence relating to child abuse, domestic violence or offences against tourists <Col N="1293" /> it seeks to provide a better balance between the rights of victims of crimes and those who are accused of committing them.  Article 40.3 of the Constitution obliges the State by its laws to protect as best it may from unjust attack &mdash; and, in the case of injustice done, to defend and vindicate &mdash; the personal rights of every citizen, including in particular his or her life, person and property rights.  In this Bill the Oireachtas is endeavouring to discharge that obligation not only in relation to our citizens, and especially the most vulnerable of them, but also to non-citizens who are equally entitled to those fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to put on record my appreciation of the valuable work done by the Law Reform Commission in producing the reports on which the Bill is based, namely the reports dealing with sexual abuse of children and the mentally handicapped, receiving stolen goods and the competence and compellability of spouses as witnesses.</P>
    <P>This is in no way a party political measure and I am sure that its aims will be supported on all sides of the House.  I want to assure Deputies that any suggestions they make in the course of the debate will be carefully considered by me between now and the detailed examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first formal Bill introduced to the House by the Minister since his appointment as Minister for Justice, I congratulate him formally on that appointment.  I am pleased we are taking this Bill because it is a very important measure.  Some aspects of it derive from the Law Reform Commission Report of 1985, as well as the Law Reform Commission's most recent report on sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal first with aspects relating to the Bill which have been in the forefront of public comment in recent days and the politics of illusion or the Alice-in-Wonderland approach which appears to be adopted to legislation.  One of the major issues in this legislation is the <Col N="1294" /> whole area of sexual abuse, in particular child sexual abuse.  There is widespread concern about the instances of child sexual abuse which are taking place.  Statistics during the eighties seem to show an ever-growing increase in the problem. That problem must be addressed not only in relation to the laws of evidence but in relation to the totality of our laws.</P>
    <P>It appeared that this House was coming to terms with some of the needs in these areas in legislation which was passed but which has not been implemented.  The Child Care Act, 1991, which was passed in June of that year, imposes new obligations on health boards and seeks to provide protection for children at risk, particularly children who are victims of sexual abuse.  It is deplorable that this legislation, passed over eight months ago, is not yet operational.  It will not become operational in this and in other areas until ministerial orders are made to bring it into force.  This is not the fault of the Minister for Justice; this legislation falls within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Health.  It is, however, the fault of the Government who are collectively responsible for the failures in this area.</P>
    <P>It is not only misleading to the general public but is becoming exceedingly dangerous because people start believing that legislation enacted in this House is actually in force.  It is dangerous that we pass legislation in this House which does not come into force by a specific date stated in the legislation as enacted.  Too many important Bills come before this House with provisions contained in them to the effect that they will not become operative until a ministerial order is made bringing either the entirety of an Act into force or specific sections or parts of it.</P>
    <P>This House is passing legislation which does not become operational and does not provide additional protections which the Government press office in their wisdom seek to pretend are coming into operation.  It means that this House loses control of the legislative process.</P>
    <P>This House has lost control of the Child Care Act, 1991.  We cannot bring it into force and we are dependent on this <Col N="1295" /> Government deciding that the time has come to make the orders necessary to extend to children the protection to which they are entitled.  In providing children with protection against sexual abuse we are still operating under legislation passed in 1908.  I say that with some anger as a Deputy who laboured for many months with other Deputies present today on the Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill.  We went through that legislation with a fine tooth comb and many substantial amendments were made to it.  It came out of the legislative process a far better Act than when first published.  That was because we had a constructive approach to that Bill such as the Minister appears intent on providing with regard to this Bill.  We should not be party to legislation that does not have immediate effect or at least what I would describe as a &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date built into it. It may be necessary to put new administrative procedures in place before legislation passed by this House can become operational.  If that is the position, the legislation should expressly state that within three, six or nine months it will come into force.</P>
    <P>In the area of child sexual abuse we have the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, which was passed in December 1990.  On last Thursday's RTE news bulletin we had a wonderfully glossy presentation of the benefits that will derive from this legislation which seeks to provide for genetic fingerprinting when it becomes operational.  This presentation, no doubt inspired by the Department of Justice, can best be described &mdash; although I know the Department were not involved in making the film &mdash; as a Department of Justice sponsored documentary in praise of Government which one would have expected to come from one of the east European States before the recent political upheavals; in fact, it was worthy of the Communist Governments of Soviet Russia.  It extolled the benefits of genetic fingerprinting as if we had never heard of it before, as if we had not debated the issue in the House almost <Col N="1296" /> a year and a half ago, and enacted legislation to provide for it.</P>
    <P>We were told, with much excitement by the commentary which went with this glossy newsreel that genetic fingerprinting would be available soon to assist the Garda.  This was supposed to be a cause of excitement.  Far be it for me to suggest that this glossy newsreel was stimulated by the Department of Justice due to the embarrassment felt by the uncertainty in the Garda Síochána as to whether DNA fingerprinting could be undertaken in the case of the 14½ year old girl who was an alleged rape victim and whose court proceedings were determined in the Supreme Court last week. The Garda were reported as saying that yes, a DNA sample can be taken to determine the perpetrator of the alleged rape and no, it can not be taken.  There was much learned legal comment which had an equal diversity of views.</P>
    <P>No doubt this glossy documentary was designed to say that the Department, the Minister and the Government were on the ball.  The only ball they were kicking was the ball of political hype.  The news reporter who was responsible for the report &mdash; a gentleman for whom I have a great deal of respect &mdash; seemed to run away with his sense of enthusiasm.  He seemed to think that telling the nation this would become operational soon was a cause of great interest.  The Taoiseach, two weeks earlier, when asked in this House if that legislation would become operative, first, said he did not know and then that it would become operative soon.  I think what came out of that newsreel was that this legislation might come into force towards the end of this year &mdash; approximately two years after the legislation was passed by this House.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about dealing with child sexual abuse, let us bring, first, the Child Care Act into operation and, second, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act into operation immediately.  There is absolutely no reason the Act passed over 14 months ago, should be lying dormant, gathering dust on the shelves of the Department of Justice, while somebody gets their act together to bring before this <Col N="1297" /> House the regulations necessary to make it operational.  It should not take that long to bring those regulations before the House.  That Act is a victim of the &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; approach I am talking about in the child care legislation; none of it comes into force until the Minister makes the order.  This House has lost control over the Child Care Act and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill, my concern is that Part III of this Bill &mdash; which I will be addressing in some detail &mdash; has inbuilt the same difficulty.  In recent days the Minister has gone to press in relation to this legislation, which was published on 31 January.  Apparently the news media only discovered it around last Wednesday or Thursday, and the Minister is getting substantial praise for the publication of this legislation which, I think I am right in saying, was published by his predecessor; so they both deserve praise for it.</P>
    <P>Part III is of substantial importance in changing the law with regard to giving evidence in cases of alleged sexual offences, be they in relation to children or otherwise.  In so far as Part III is being lauded as a major reform, I would put a large warning beside it because section 1 (3) states that Part III will only come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed by the Minister.  The first question I put to the Minister is &mdash; I hope he will respond at the close of the Second Stage debate &mdash; when will Part III come into force?  Is it intended to be brought into force in six weeks, two months, six months or whatever?  Will it be in force by this time next year?  The hype given to the Bill in the national media over the last few days seems to lead everyone to believe that within a couple of weeks this Bill will be enacted and will come into operation.  That is clearly not the case with regard to Part III.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>... arrangements are being made to have the necessary technical facilities installed in the Four Courts this year to enable evidence to be given by live television link.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> On the genetic finerprinting Bill I recall the Minister's predecessor telling us that the gardaí would have the necessary forensic facilities made available to them domestically within a matter of months of the Bill being passed.  Last week in the glossy newsreel we discover that the Garda are just learning about it and are about to set up the forensic laboratory, which may be functioning by the end of the year.  I hope the Minister's aspiration to provide for the television link facility in the Four Courts by the end of the year can be met.  I am putting him on notice that I will be tabling an amendment to this Bill to require that Part III of the Bill come into force within a specific stated time of the passage of this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas rather than waiting for ministerial orders to be made.  I do not have confidence that those ministerial orders will be made this year, and I am not totally convinced they will be made next year.  I do not know whether the diffficulty arises due to the bureaucracy in the Department of Justice, the lack of funds or difficulties in the Attorney General's Office.  I would not go so far as to suggest a lack of political commitment.  I am prepared to accept that the Minister would wish this Bill to become operative otherwise he would not bring the legislation before the House.  There would be no point doing it unless, of course, we were merely making public play about concerns of a serious issue while knowing that the reality was that we are somewhat spancelled for financial or other reasons from implementing measures which everyone regards as desirable.</P>
    <P>I hope we are dealing with Part III of the Bill in a serious way and that we are talking about legislation that will become operative within a relatively short period following its passage through this House. I would be prepared to accept that it may take two or three months to set up the facilities necessary, but if we are to have these facilities, I suggest the Department get on with the work.  The provision of these facilities does not require the passage of this Bill.  The final report of the Law Reform Commission in this area was <Col N="1299" /> published in 1990 and there was nothing to prevent the Department of Justice during 1991 or even at this stage setting up these facilities.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about the suggestion that the facilities will be in the Four Courts.  Surely the intent of Part III of this Bill is to take some of the fear out of this type of court proceedings in the context of the child who is the alleged victim of a sexual assault.  My understanding is that the intention is to make the panoply of the legal justice system appear more humane and less intimidating to a child who has to give evidence about matters that are deeply distressing.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the intention, as detailed by the Law Reform Commission and, in fairness, in the Bill, is to allow a child to feel at ease, in so far as this is ever possible, in providing background factual information as to incidents in which the child has been involved and to enable the child to truthfully but simply explain events that have taken place.  If that is the case, it would be my suggestion, if we are talking about cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse, that these cases should not be heard in the Four Courts or in the Central Criminal Court.  We have already recognised the need in the family law area to deformalise court buildings and structures to some extent.  In Dublin, both the High Court and the Circuit Court can hear family law cases involving distressing family matters, marriage breakdown and disputes over custody of children in a less formal atmosphere in Áras Uí Dhálaigh away from the hurly-burly of the Four Courts and gardaí who bustle into criminal trials with people handcuffed to their wrists.</P>
    <P>It is my suggestion, if we are to recognise the need to deformalise these court structures, taking nothing away from the criminal justice system and the need to get at the truth, that there is no particular reason court cases involving criminal allegations of child sexual abuse should not be heard outside the precincts of the ordinary <Col N="1300" /> court system and dealt with in the less formal atmosphere of the family court system.  Indeed, if we are talking about a child giving evidence through a television link in a criminal trial in the Four Courts or the Central Criminal Court it would be my suggestion that the television link should not be in that building.  There is no reason the television link could not, for example, be in Arás Uí Dhalaigh, if we are talking about Dublin, or somewhere else.  I also suggest there is no reason we should bring the child into the Four Courts building. Indeed, children should be kept out of that building.  This can only add to the upset and the distress.</P>
    <P>I make the same point in relation to the south and west of the country.  I do not know what courthouses the Minister is thinking of designating for the court link &mdash; he might reveal this to us &mdash; but while some of our courthouses are in fairly good repair, others are in a dreadful condition and lack basic facilities and consultation rooms.  Again, I suggest if we are to have criminal trials of this nature in the Circuit Criminal Court and in other courts outside the Dublin area, it would defeat the purpose of the television link if we were to require a child to go into the court building and simply sit in another room.  These television links should be provided outside the basic court structure.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill there are two matters which need to be dealt with.  In the context of Part III it is important we take out of the court proceedings the feeling of intimidation a young person or child may suffer.  I would equally argue in regard to cases of sexual abuse or rape, if it is appreciated that someone under 17 years of age should be given special facilities in giving evidence through a television link, that consideration should be given to providing a television link where it is alleged that sexual offences, such as rape, were committed against someone over 17 years of age.  A woman over 17 years of age who has been raped will find it an appalling event to have to walk into a courtroom and give evidence while being watched by the person she <Col N="1301" /> has alleged raped her.  If it is justifiable to provide a television link for a 16 year-old why is it not justifiable to give this facility to an 18 year old?  We need to seriously consider that matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of creating a less intimidating atmosphere in giving evidence we have to maintain a balance and make sure that in prosecuting such cases we do not in our enthusiasm to provide the necessary protection for children, women and girls create a situation where the presumption of innocence is reversed to a presumption of guilt.  We have to ensure we do not within our criminal justice system create a situation where as soon as anyone makes an allegation of sexual abuse or rape it is instantly assumed, and the law acts on the assumption, that the person who it has been alleged has offended has actually offended.  I have no doubt that cases have arisen from time to time where false allegations were made.  I have come across this in the family law area where a bitter dispute between a husband and wife over the custody of a child did lead on occasion to a parent making very serious but false allegations of sexual abuse against the other parent.  This was done for the simple purpose of destroying that parent's reputation with a child or children and to stop that parent being granted visitation or access rights to a child when the other parent has custody. There have been such instances and, indeed, there are court judgments on them.</P>
    <P>There have also been instances where when health boards sought to take children into care allegations of sexual abuse were made which were subsequently established to be incorrect when the matter was determined within our courts system.  Therefore, we must be careful when providing protection for children and women who have been raped or sexually abused that we also preserve a balance and not tip it over to such an extent that we have serious miscarriages of justice which result in people being sentenced to terms of imprisonment for acts they have not committed.  All the remarks I will make on this Bill will be <Col N="1302" /> based on the two premises, the need to provide protection for children while preserving a balance and not turning our criminal justice system on its head and creating a presumption of guilt whenever an allegation is made.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need to create a less intimidating atmosphere in court proceedings, I wish to refer to the Law Reform Commission's final report of 1990 on child sexual abuse.  Their suggestion in relation to the facilities which should be provided for a child is somewhat different to the suggestion made by the Minister, that we simply have a televised link in the Four Courts.  I presume that envisages a child sitting in one room in the Four Courts and the trial proceeding in another room.  There would, however, be the inevitable danger that if the child leaves the room at the wrong time he or she might bump into the person who has been accused of a criminal sexual offence.  The Law Reform Commission in their report, quote with some approval an extract from a report of the Scottish Law Commission which refers to the use of the television.  They stated:</P>
    <P>From the technical point of view the important features of the systems which we have seen are, first, that they are entirely automatic and do not require the attendance of camera operators and technicians, and second, that they provide both the judge and counsel with an opportunity to watch not only the child but also others as well. So far as the child is concerned, he or she is placed in a room near to the court room.  That room is carpeted and simply but agreeably decorated and finished.  The child sits at a table, accompanied by a parent or other supporting adult, and facing the child is what appears to be an ordinary domestic television set.  In fact the set will have either a concealed camera built into it, or a small camera clipped on top of it.</P>
    <P>It is my suggestion that the pleasantly carpeted room should not be next door to the courtroom where the trial is taking <Col N="1303" /> place.  If we are to provide a technical facility there should be some distance between the two and if we are going to implement this system we should do it right.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 12 (3) which states that when evidence is being given through a live television link, through which presumably the child will see the person asking the questions, neither the judge nor the barrister or solicitor concerned in the examination of the witness shall wear a wig or gown. Given that this is the first legislation which will curtail the enthusiasm of the Bar Library in relation to the wearing of wigs and gowns I should put it on record that solicitors do not wear wigs.  I have come across the occasional old fashioned solicitor in rural areas who is still somewhat taken by wearing a gown but, presumably, the only type of wig a solicitor wears is a toupee.  However, we are talking about the type of wigs which barristers traditionally wear and I welcome this provision in the legislation.</P>
    <P>It, of course, mirrors the provision we included in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  Whereas the provision in the 1989 Act is widely obeyed by most judges and counsel, it is still not obeyed throughout the country. I get reports that some Circuit Court judges have a psychological disability in relation to taking off their wigs; there are also barristers who, physiologically or psychologically, find it difficult to come to terms with not wearing a wig.  I have not been in the courts of judges who have this difficulty in regard to wigs and, no doubt, if I appear there wearing my lawyer's hat my presence will not be greeted with a round of applause or too much enthusiasm.  There are also members of the Bar Library who find it difficult not to wear their wigs and gowns.  There should be an express provision in this legislation to the effect that a failure to disrobe should invalidate a trial.  There is a different legal terminology which I am trying to think of but we should put in an express penalty of which everyone will be conscious.  I do not think that any <Col N="1304" /> judge would like to see a sentence handed down for child sexual abuse &mdash; or any other sexual offence &mdash; overturned by the High Court or another court because the judge felt it was necessary to sit in court wearing 17th century regalia.  No member of the Bar Library could justify that.</P>
    <P>It was assumed when the 1989 Act was passed that, at the very least, the Judiciary would comply with it without having to suggest any form of penalty.  I am not suggesting that judges should be sent to jail or fined but there should be a provision in this Bill stating that if a trial took place in circumstances where wigs and gowns should not be worn &mdash; and where they were worn &mdash; the result of the trial should be rendered null and void by a failure to comply with the provision. That would resolve whatever remaining psychological difficulties there are within the judicial mind or the Bar Library about the wearing of wigs and gowns. Indeed, if I had my way, I would ban outright the wearing of wigs and gowns <i>in toto</i> for all court proceedings.  I do not know to what extent wigs and gowns add to the cerebral rumblings of the legal profession or to the dignity of court procedures but I suggest that if Members of this House felt the need to continue to wear the regalia worn in the House of Commons at the turn of the 18th century, we would be regarded as odd.  I do not know why the legal profession think it necessary to wear wigs and gowns.  I have never been ill at ease in a courtroom without one or incapable of representing the interests of clients.  Let us have this provision in section 12 (3) but also provide some sort of penalty to ensure that it is complied with.  The Minister should take his courage in his hands and put a provision in this Bill &mdash; or in a future Bill &mdash; which, once and for all, abolishes the wearing of wigs and gown for judges and barristers.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is particularly important.  As I understand it, it is probably designed to implement a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission contained in paragraph 7.26 of their report on page 78 where there is a reference to a &ldquo;child examiner&rdquo;, although we do not refer to <Col N="1305" /> this in the Bill.  Section 13 provides for an intermediary in certain circumstances to conduct the cross-examination of a person where that person is accused of an offence, which is mainly a sexual offence or one of violence, and if the person is under 17 years of age and giving evidence.  It says that the court may, on the application of the prosecution or the accused, if satisfied that, having regard to the age or mental condition of the witness, the interests of justice require that his cross-examination or re-examination, or any part thereof, be conducted through an intermediary, direct that any such examination be so conducted. I have some reservations about this.  I am fully in favour of using the television link but the Minister should clarify section 13.  How will it work?  If someone is accused of a serious offence, of an assault or sexual assault, and their counsel has instructions to cross-examine someone to elicit the truth, and that person is denying that he or she has committed this assault, if a series of questions is to be put to a witness to tease out the truth, will the counsel for the accused whisper questions to an intermediary who will ask them in exactly the same language?  Will the counsel for the accused provide a series of written questions for the intermediary to put to the witness?  In what way can the questions be followed up?  If a reply comes back that no one has anticipated, how does the instant cross-examination take place?  I have already said I am concerned about some of the pressures put on people who have been the victims of these appalling events but there is substantial concern that we could, by doing that, wrongly send people to jail for offences they have not committed.  I do not know how this proposal in relation to an intermediary will work in practice and I have considerable worries and reservations about it.</P>
    <P>The intermediary is to be a person appointed by the court who, in the opinion of the court, is competent to act as such.  Will the intermediary be a member of the legal profession?  Will it be a social worker, a barrister, a friend <Col N="1306" /> or relation of the victim?  Presumably it will not be a friend or relation of the accused.  What qualifications will an intermediary have?  Will it be an ordinary GP?  Should it be a child psychiatrist? What is their function?  Will they repeat questions which the prosecution or the defence want to ask?  When this Bill is passed I should not like to see that there are sections in it which are unworkable; we can bring Part III into force by one ministerial order or not bring it in at all because of defective provisions.  I have no doubt that this is well-meant, and I am not criticising the Department, the Minister or the draftsman.  However, there are substantial problems in regard to the application of that in a court trial provision.</P>
    <P>I presume that the provision is designed to deal with the recommendations contained in page 78 of the report of the Law Reform Commission. Paragraph 7.26 of the report states:</P>
    <P>It will take time to train examiners, whether they be lawyers acquiring psychological skills or vice versa. However, the law should provide at once that, although cross-examination by one's own lawyer would continue to be the norm for the time being, the court should have power to appoint an examiner, for special reasons, on the applications of the DPP.</P>
    <P>We recommend that the accused should continue to be entitled to cross-examine the alleged victim himself or through his counsel or solicitor at the deposition stage and (when the presence of the child is required) at the trial, except where the court is satisfied that, having regard to the age and/or mental condition of the alleged victim, the interests of justice require that the cross-examination be conducted through a child examiner, in which event the examiner would be required to put to the alleged victim any question permissible under the rules of evidence requested by the defence.</P>
    <P>Child examiners should be experienced in interviewing children and <Col N="1307" /> specially trained in child language, psychology and the relevant law with particular emphasis on the law of evidence.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we are going to implement this proposal.  So far as I am aware, we do not have such people.  I do not see how it can work.  I do not see how it would be less intimidating for a child examiner, so called, to put a question than it would be if the lawyer put exactly the same question.  The approach here is that lawyers should be put under a specific duty in cross-examining somebody who is alleged to be a victim of such an offence to have regard to the tender years of the victim.  Indeed, courts will control the approach of a lawyer in cross-examination when dealing with young people if there is a perception that what is happening is merely an attempt to upset someone who is truthfully giving evidence rather than getting at the truth. We are trying to prevent young people and children who have been the victims of abuse or assault from being frightened by the legal system and lawyers.</P>
    <P>I have a very real and serious concern that section 13, though well intended, first, will not work and, second, may be unconstitutional and violate Article 38 of the Constitution in the context of the due process provisions.  I would also be seriously concerned that if this section came into force and it was applied, and someone was convicted of a sexual offence &mdash; who should rightly be convicted because they actually did it &mdash; did not find that the charges against them were set aside on appeal due to a higher court taking the view that either this section could not operate in the way it did or that it was unconstitutional.  I believe there is a real problem with this section. While I believe the Law Reform Commission meant well by it, I am not convinced this section will work.  I am assuming in everything I said that this section comes out of paragraph 7.26 of the Law Reform Commission's report. Perhaps the Minister will clarify this point when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> I wish to refer to another suggestion in the Law Reform Commission's report which I presume is not intended and which does not seem to fall within the wording of this Bill.  On page 68 of the report the Law Reform Commission talk about the presentation of evidence through a surrogate witness.  They say, &ldquo;... this would represent so radical a departure from the norms of our system of criminal justice that the commission does not think it either practical or desirable to recommend it&rdquo;.  That was a quotation from the original working paper.  They say in page 70 of their report: &ldquo;Nothing we have heard or read since publication of the Consultation Paper has modified our original strong view against the use of surrogate witnesses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Obviously a surrogate witness would be someone who gave evidence instead of the young person.  Clearly this suggestion is not being implemented &mdash; and it is right that it should not be implemented &mdash; but I am not sure what an intermediary can do.  Could intermediaries go off on their own line of cross-examination? Could they be controlled by the defence or by the prosecution in the questions they ask?</P>
    <P>We will have to look at this section very carefully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I felt it was right to make these remarks in order to give the Minister and his Department an opportunity to have another look at this section.  There is a need to tease out this section considerably more.  If the Minister intends to keep the section in the Bill, a great deal more substance will have to be given to it.  For example, it is not even clear who will pay for the intermediary.  Will the intermediary be paid by the State?  If, as a lawyer, I represent someone who is the victim of sexual abuse, the State will be prosecuting, the alleged offender will be defending and the victim would not have a right of appearance or audience before the court through their lawyer.  What will happen if the victim's parents say they want their daughter to be questioned through an intermediary?  Can they ask the court to do that?  Do we have to wait to see if such a request is sought by the <Col N="1309" /> prosecution or the defence?  I cannot imagine a defence lawyer ever seeking that facility.  This matter will have to be teased out as it is dangerous and could give rise to huge problems.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to section 15 which deals with the use of video recordings as evidence at a trial.  This section will require an amount of teasing out on Committee Stage.  I do not want to turn Second Stage debate into Committee Stage debate but I want to put down a marker on this section.  Section 15 (1) (b) provides:</P>
    <P>a video recording of any statement made by a person under 14 years of age (being a person in respect of whom such an offence is alleged to have been committed) during an interview with persons who are in the opinion of the court appropriately qualified for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Although this section applies to general assault, it is specifically designed to deal with the area of sexual assault.  I want the Minister to clarify what is meant by people who are &ldquo;appropriately qualified for the purpose&rdquo;.  There has been a huge problem in this area in the United Kingdom; there has been a smaller version of this problem in Ireland.  I wish to pronounce an interest in this issue in the sense that in recent years I have appeared in court cases on behalf of parents in circumstances where there have been allegations of sexual abuse and it has emerged that those allegations were made on very flimsy grounds.  Indeed, in some instances it emerged that there was no basis for the allegations made and that conclusions were reached by so-called professionals which should not have been arrived at.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this in the context of taking the view that we do not have a problem with child sexual abuse, we do, and it is a growing problem.  To a lesser extent than they did in England, in the social work professions and certain elements of the medical profession, we suffered from a particular problem which was that until the mid-eighties everyone assumed there was no such thing as sexual <Col N="1310" /> abuse in Ireland.  When we realised we had such a problem, this led certain professionals to assuming that if an allegation was made it always was true. When allegations were made, instead of trying to ascertain whether a child had been abused, validation procedures were adopted.  A validation procedure is a procedure to confirm the prejudice you already have.  In other words, you are told someone has done something and you do everything possible to validate it, that is, confirm that everything you have been told is right as opposed to investigating whether what you have been told is right.</P>
    <P>In the context of using videos to record interviews, the Law Reform Commission seem to envisage a professional individual, perhaps a social worker with special training, accompanied by a female garda, conducting a questioning session.  Traditionally the video recordings which have been made and used extensively in family law cases behind closed doors in our courts have involved medical personnel &mdash; some of whom have been qualified child psychiatrists and some of whom have not been using something called an &ldquo;anatomical doll&rdquo; by way of play to ascertain whether the method of play used by a child with a particular anatomical doll indicated that the child had sexual knowledge.  If the child had sexual knowledge it was assumed that the child had been sexually abused.</P>
    <P>This type of procedure can be used in two ways.  It can be used for what are known as therapeutic purposes, that is, on the assumption that a child has been abused and as a therapy to help unblock from the child's mind the experience the child has gone through, to assist the child in coming to terms with that experience and to determine what type of future care is necessary for the child.  Alternatively, the procedure can be used for forensic purposes.  The difficulty both in England and Ireland is that there has been an addiction to the therapeutic approach. For example, these procedures are used on the assumption that someone has been abused.  This leads to the problem whereby professionals, be they social <Col N="1311" /> workers or medical personnel, put leading questions to children and, intimidated by adults, children may give the answer they feel the professional is seeking.  That has led to false conclusions being drawn of sexual abuse in a number of cases. Judgments of the High Court have resulted in committal orders being made and children subsequently released.  I have been involved in some District Court cases where children were taken into care precipitately by health boards on the basis of allegations that were subsequently established to be totally untrue.  This arose as a result of the so-called therapeutic use of anatomical dolls.  The Law Reform Commission dealt with this matter in some detail in their consultation paper and their final paper.</P>
    <P>Section 15 needs to be addressed.  We need to make it quite clear that in so far as video recordings are to be used they should relate to a procedure whereby a person with the necessary professional qualifications engages in a forensic procedure that expressly rules out putting leading questions to a child, a procedure which is designed in a very sensitive and informed way to elicit the truth.  The Law Reform Commission in their 1990 report deal with this issue, which should be addressed in this legislation.  They refer to the difficulties that have arisen and state:</P>
    <P>In the Consultation Paper, we considered the controversy and debate that has arisen in relation to the reliability and status of testimony elucidated by professionals from children suspected of being sexually abused. We pointed out that many workers in the area of child sexual abuse had modified their clinical techniques using the assistance and advice of the courts and legal experts so that the interviewing in many cases was more acceptable to the courts.</P>
    <P>That applied in the English experience following a large number of cases in which the evidence was highly unsatisfactory. The report also stated: &ldquo;We <Col N="1312" /> also set out a summary of the stages of interviewing and the modified structured interview now in use in Great Ormond Street Hospital in London&rdquo;.  The Law Reform Commission in their original consultation paper provisionally made the following recommendation, which they now say is their final recommendation:</P>
    <P>At no stage in the investigative process in relation to child sexual abuse prosecutions should the child be subjected to leading questions.  This exclusion of leading questions should apply also in non-criminal cases where an issue of child sexual abuse arose.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are dealing primarily with criminal prosecutions although it will have a knock-on effect in the sense that in a prosecution in the criminal area the methodology used to determine whether there has been abuse may have civil implications for the future welfare of the children concerned.  There is a very special need to include in this Bill a provision implementing the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission against the use of leading questions.  That is of particular importance and is an issue that needs to be addressed fully and promptly in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A case was taken in the Supreme Court in which I was involved where a care order made in favour of the Eastern Health Board some years earlier was set aside.  In that case there was a combination of physiological examination and use of anatomical dolls, and the Supreme Court sought to set out guidelines as to how courts should approach these matters in future.  In this case there was a video available of the interview that had taken place but the court did not look at it and the Supreme Court said that was quite wrong.  That case was reported in 1990 and two judgments were given by the Supreme Court, but I will not detain the House by going into the details.</P>
    <P>All the concerns that arise from the different types of interviewing techniques, the possibility of putting words into the mouths of children, or indeed of <Col N="1313" /> adults drawing conclusions from children's play that may be unwarranted are very well illustrated in a special series of law reports which detail the difficulties experienced in the Great Ormond Street Hospital.  In the 1987 family law reports there are in the region of ten detailed court judgments detailing all the problems with the techniques as they were operated and the difference between a therapeutic and a forensic approach to interviewing children.  It seems the intention of section 15 is to bring into play these interviews and to have them used as evidence.  Therefore, we must be very sure that professionals do not draw conclusions from play techniques that are unwarranted and that they do not, by leading questions, make incidents that are innocent look a great deal more worrying than they are.</P>
    <P>What I do not understand is why we have not taken into account in this Bill the recommendations of the Pigot Committee, which are also contained in the Law Reform Commission's report.  The Pigot Committee make specific recommendations designed to ensure that we promptly address this issue.  There is talk of providing a code of practice, and this would have direct application not only to how the video recording of evidence is operated but what should happen with regard to an oppropriately qualified person taking statements.  I suggest that we incorporate the Pigot Committee recommendations in regulations to be made under this Bill.  Paragraphs 7 and 8 of these recommendations should be specifically taken on board as part of the statutory provisions of the Bill.  Paragraph 7 states:</P>
    <P>Video taped interviews should be conducted as far as possible in accordance with the rules of evidence which govern the examination-in-chief of witnesses in court, which it is designed to replace.  Thus, leading questions should be avoided.  &ldquo;Where children are concerned the courts already allow some latitude in this area depending upon the child's age and understanding. We think the important point <Col N="1314" /> is that interviewers should never be the first to suggest that a particular offence was committed or that a particular person was the perpetrator.  We do not believe that the courts would exclude fairly conducted interviews for purely technical reasons or because of the inclusion of occasional insignificant leading questions.  Nevertheless, it should be remembered that crucial leading questions which relate to the central facts of a case must be avoided wherever possible.  This may well result in the exclusion of the interview at court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say under the heading &ldquo;Anatomically Correct Dolls&rdquo;: &ldquo;A code of practice should make clear that such aids should only be used to help the child to establish details with which he or she may have verbal difficulties once the general substance of a complaint is clear&rdquo;.  There are other Pigot Committee recommendations which the Law Reform Commission say we should take on board, but I will not go into them now.</P>
    <P>There is insufficient substance in section 15 to ensure, first, that the section will work and, second, that leading questions will not be asked during interviews that may limit the usefulness of a video or that could result in wrongful convictions taking place.  We must deal with that matter.  Subsection (2) states that any such video recording shall not be admitted in evidence if the court is of the opinion having regard to all the circumstances, that in the interests of justice the video recording concerned or that part should not be so admitted.  I am concerned that if procedures about no leading questions, about the way in which the matter must be approached and about it being a forensic procedure rather than a therapeutic procedure, are not set down clearly, then there will be a trial within a trial every time a video tape of an interview of his nature is made featuring a young child who has been the victim of abuse.  Suggestions will be made that leading questions have been put, that the video is prejudicial and that this should not be used.  If the originating court does <Col N="1315" /> not find in favour of the defendant the case will be appealed.  Instead of the videotaping of interviews being a procedure to deformalise court proceedings, to take the pressure off young people and to ensure that those who commit sexual offences are properly dealt with in the courts and that the courts have the facility to determine guilt and innocence and pass sentence, we could create a bureaucratic nightmare and not facilitate the bringing to justice of those alleged to have committed an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also reflects a Law Reform Commission recommendation.  There is very little the Law Reform Commission have said in his regard with which I disagree but I have reservations about section 17.  Provision is made that when a person under 17 identifies an accused in an identity parade or other identification procedure the presumption will be raised that the identified person is the person who committed the offence in question. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will be aware that many unfortunate people picked out at identity parades for having committed an offence have subsequently been discovered to have not committed that offence.  It appears that section 17 turns the identity parade procedure into a method of creating presumption of guilt rather than innocence at the start of a trial.  In the administration of our criminal justice system we should have learnt by now that sole reliance on identity parade identification in the determination of the alleged perpetrator of an offence can be a very dangerous and injudicious exercise.  Turning such reliance into a presumption of guilt creates even greater difficulties.</P>
    <P>I emphasise our need to ensure that we make trials of this nature much less horrific for those who have been the victims of abuse and assault.  However, we must not deal with those matters in a way that could result in our sending to jail people who should not be in jail.  The presumption of innocence must not be taken away.  I wonder whether section 17 might present constitutional difficulties <Col N="1316" /> which is the last thing we would want to happen.</P>
    <P>Section 18 extends all of those provisions to persons who suffer from a mental handicap.  I welcome those additional protections.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be misunderstood in what I am saying.  I welcome many of the measures in the Bill.  I am trying to indicate to the Minister that for some provisions to be operational and work properly the Bill needs to be teased out and given more substance.  Unless that is done there will be difficulties with one or two aspects of the Bill.  There has certainly been a need to provide a more humane approach in dealing with sexual offences that come before the courts, in particular as they affect young people, and towards taking some of the horror out of the courthouse atmosphere.  Part III is most welcome in so far as that is its intention.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the competence and compellability of spouses and former spouses to give evidence.  I do not intend to spend nearly as much time on this measure as I did on Part III.  The provisions contained in Part IV are long overdue.  For some time we have needed to move away from the 19th century legal position that made spouses as witnesses incompetent and not compellable in several kinds of trials.</P>
    <P>One curious aspect is the reference to judicial separations or divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i> The Bill makes a differentiation between the position of a spouse who has been separated by decree of judicial separation and the position of a spouse who has not.  To put it in simple terms, when a decree of judicial separation has been granted a spouse may be compellable and, in certain circumstances, when a decree of judicial separation has not been granted a spouse is not compellable. In the context of marriage breakdown, only a small proportion of couples whose marriages fail go all the way through our courts to get a separation decree.  Many separation proceedings are issued, very often because either the husband or the wife do not accept the reality that the marriage has <Col N="1317" /> broken down and resist the conclusion of some kind of amicable arrangement whereby the couple can separate without having to go through the court system. However, in many instances, even when separation proceedings have issued, before the court is required to make a decision, the husband and the wife realise they are better off reaching agreement, resolving their own difficulties and maintaining a degree of control over the result than they would be if they allowed the case to go before the court for a judge to make a decision, with all the extra expense and upset that would involve. The reality is that many more couples separate by concluding what is known as a deed of separation or a separation agreement than by getting a decree of separation.  In so far as the Bill deals with judicial separation and divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, it seems to me the legislation should provide for the same legal position following the conclusion of a deed of separation as for a decree of separation.</P>
    <P>Another curious issue is that the Bill makes no mention of nullity law.  The Law Reform Commission stated that if a decree of annulment were granted, making a marriage void, then there was no marriage and that would give rise to no problems.  If a decree were granted in respect of a voidable marriage, nullifying it, I am not sure what is the position with regard to compellability.  For example, if an offence was committed by a husband prior to the High Court making a decree of annulment and then the High Court made a decree of annulment of a voidable marriage, at that stage would the wife be a compellable witness, or is she not compellable in that the offence was committed before the court decree was granted?  It might be a little esoteric to raise that matter at this stage but it should be examined when we are trying to tidy up the legislation.  Those questions arise under sections 19 and 21.</P>
    <P>Other general recommendations by the Law Reform Commission are not, so far as I can tell, taken on board in the Bill, although some of them do not necessarily require legislation.  Page 81 of the report of the Law Reform Commission states <Col N="1318" /> that the court should admit the use of anatomical dolls and other demonstrative aids to testimony.  I do not know whether specific provision needs to be made for that in legislation.  Paragraph 735 (c) refers to the provision of books, games and various other facilities designed to make the rooms that children wait in a good deal less intimidating.  They say that similar provisions should be made for excluding from the court persons not involved in the case as are made in the context of rape cases.  In terms of other sexual abuse cases, I am not sure the Bill excludes from attending at court people who might otherwise attend to observe the court proceedings.</P>
    <P>On page 84 of the Law Reform Commission report there is a reference by the commission to special care being exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions in selecting prosecuting counsel in child sexual abuse cases.  It goes on to say that in the case of the appointment of independent representatives of children in such cases the introduction of a panel system might be considered.  It says the legal profession should give serious consideration to adopting special codes of practice relating to representation in and conduct of cases involving children. The profession should also consider ways, including the possibility of a certification system, of ensuring that lawyers involved in such cases have appropriate training and experience.  The same should apply, they suggest, to judges.</P>
    <P>If the Minister did not want to legislate for lawyers I would have hoped that he would at the very least have urged the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society to provide for the type of special training the Law Reform Commission is talking about.  I am wondering whether we should say something about that in this Bill.  Just as we provided in the Family Law (Judicial Separation) Act, 1989 for certain codes of conduct by lawyers dealing with family law cases, it would seem to me that there is certain merit in taking on board what is said there.  If the Minister took on board what is said there and certain members of the legal profession became specialists in <Col N="1319" /> these areas, it might get rid of the need for this examiner, this intermediary, that I spoke about earlier, whose job would be exceedingly difficult, putting questions to a child in circumstances where he was acting either on behalf of the prosecution or the defence.</P>
    <P>There is one matter about which I am extremely mystified.  There was a court case ten days ago about which you and I expressed considerable concern.  It was a case in which a father was facing 14 charges of incest before Waterford Circuit Criminal Court and substantial oral evidence was given by the daughter. Without the father being called to give evidence the judge gave the jury a direction to return a finding of not guilty.  The daughter had said in her evidence that the man who had sexually interfered with her was her father.  Counsel acting for the defence said that they were not accepting that as evidence and the judge gave a direction.  I am not a criminal lawyer, and I do not pretend to be an expert in criminal law, but I am told that if the birth certificate had been produced in court with the accused named as father that that of itself would not necessarily have been sufficient.  I like to stand outside the legal profession on occasions, even though I am involved in it, and anyone outside the legal profession would say there was a lack of commonsense in what happened in that case. Once this girl went into the witness box and said that this man was her father it was for him to go into the witness box and deny that and for the jury to reach their decision.  If there was a birth certificate and if this girl had been residing in the family home throughout her childhood with this man who had, throughout her childhood, appeared to be her father, it would be reasonable for the jury to assume that he was her father.  However, he never went into the witness box and the jury was directed to discharge him.</P>
    <P>I tried to raise this issue on a number of occasions in this House.  Thankfully the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was finally successful last Thursday in getting the Adjournment Debate that I had been <Col N="1320" /> unsuccessful in getting and there were widespread newspaper reports to the effect that the Minister for Justice said that this problem was resolved in the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992 which is before the House.  There is only one possible section that I can see where this issue is remotely addressed in this legislation, unless I am seriously missing something. Section 4 deals with the admissibility of documents.  Generally, I welcome what is said about the admissibility of documents and at this stage I have no particular issue to raise on the generality of Part II though there are one or two aspects that will need to be tidied up on Committee Stage. I do not want to delay the House by going into that at this stage.  Section 4 says:</P>
    <P>In this Part &ldquo;business&rdquo; includes any trade, profession or other occupation carried on, for reward or otherwise, either within or outside the State and includes also the performance of functions by or on behalf of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any person or body remunerated or financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas,</P>
    <P>In section 5 there is provision for the admissibility of certain documentary evidence. I suppose the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths is paid for by the Oireachtas for performing a function in so far as he is involved in birth certification. However, I think it is stretching it to say that that provision addresses the problem that arose in that incest case in Waterford.  There are specific provisions in the Status of Children Act, 1987 that in certain circumstances when birth certificates are produced certain presumptions arise.  I am not even remotely convinced that this Bill addresses the problem that arose in the Waterford case.  Perhaps it is the Minister's intention to bring in an amendment on Committee Stage.  It is a criminal law evidence Bill and it seems there would be no difficulty in inserting a specific condition in the Bill to provide that if a birth certificate is produced before a court that there will be a presumption <Col N="1321" /> that the person named as mother is the mother of the child named on the birth certificate and that the person named as father is the father of the child named on the birth certificate unless there is evidence to the contrary.  In other words, the presumption would be that the person is the father and a balance of evidence should be provided.  One cannot simply say that one is not the father.  If we actually brought into force the genetic fingerprinting legislation that problem could be addressed.  I cannot blame this Minister as he has only been in office a few weeks, but I criticise the Government in relation to the Forensic Evidence Bill, 1990.  If that had been law before that incest case was heard and if the person alleged to be the father had raised a doubt as to whether he was the father of the girl who had suffered alleged offences of incest, the court could have asked for genetic fingerprinting and it could have been established whether this man was or was not the father.  We passed the Bill 14 months before the trial.  We did not bring it into force so the facility was not available to the court.</P>
    <P>I do not see where in this Bill we address that issue.  I saw only the newspaper report because the Official Report is not yet available and the Minister may have been misquoted, but my understanding of it was that the Minister, when responding to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on the Adjournment debate last Thursday, said that this Bill addressed this problem.  This Bill does not address the problem.  The Minister repeated it yesterday on RTE.  He was wrong.</P>
    <P>I am greatly alarmed that the Minister did not even refer to the problem on Second Stage.  The case received so much public notoriety and so much comment on a cross-party basis from people who had nothing but a genuine concern to ensure that this sort of mess did not happen again, that one would have assumed there would at least have been a paragraph in the Minister's speech pointing out that this issue was addressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>If it is addressed by various sections in Part II, it is addressed in a particularly <Col N="1322" /> lugubrious way and it seems, from the general reading of Part III, that even if it provided for it being admissible it can be objected to in any case, and then we are back to the same problem.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude on this issue by saying that I hope an amendment will be put forward by Government to address that evidential problem in incest cases. There is absolutely no reason a necessary provision could not be included in the miscellaneous section of this Bill to address the problem.  I can assure the Minister that an amendment will be tabled by Fine Gael to address the problem. As the Minister said, this is not a contentious Bill.  I have no doubt that the Minister and the Minister of State are as anxious to address this issue as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I are.  I hope a very clear, unambiguous section will be included in Part V, the miscellaneous provisions, to ensure that the events that took place in Waterford ten days ago are never again repeated in our courts, that whenever a young woman comes forward alleging she has been the victim of the most appalling sexual offences, having given evidence in court and having gone through the stress and upset of that, she does not watch the person whom she alleges is the guilty party go free on a legal technicality without ever giving evidence. That is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>I have probably over-stayed my welcome through the indulgence of the House in the remarks I have made which were somewhat lengthier than I had originally intended.  But I feel very strongly about these issues.  I and the Fine Gael Party are very committed to ensuring that we have the necessary legislative changes. My colleague, Deputy Cotter, our party junior spokesperson, brought forward a very well argued discussion document on the whole are of child sexual abuse.  We are very anxious to enact legislation that will take us into the year 2000 and that properly addresses the issues. Despite the appalling numbers of cases of child sexual abuse being uncovered by our health boards, only a very small number results in criminal prosecutions. <Col N="1323" /> We must ensure that our law is properly framed and adequate to allow such prosecutions to take place.  We are anxious to ensure that the law we enact in this area is workable while preserving the balance about which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>A final matter of curiosity the Minister might address when replying &mdash; and to which I will refer very briefly &mdash; arises under the provisions of the section dealing with evidence given by spouses.  We are a rather strange country in a number of ways.  In Ireland at present we probably have the highest numbers of couples living in a state of criminal bigamy compared, proportionately, with the total number of couples living bigamously in any other EC country.  We have the Roman Catholic Church granting decrees of nullity in circumstances in which civil courts cannot grant them.  Apparently parish priests in different parts of the country are quite happy to remarry people after church annulments.  There are a number of couples who have remarried in such circumstances, whose marriages are recognised in the eyes of the church but are bigamous in the eyes of the State.  Then there are people whose marriages have broken down, who do not have the facility of church annulments but who board a plane to England, Haiti, The Bahamas or even places like Mexico, for a couple of weeks, somewhere they think will facilitate them, and get decrees of divorce that are not recognised, remarry, return here and live in bigamy.</P>
    <P>One question our Census of Population has not yet posed is: Are you a bigamous couple?  I suspect that if we began prosecuting all of the people truly living in a criminally bigamous state at present there would be sufficient criminal prosecutions in that area of the law to keep our courts completely blocked up for approximately ten years.  No doubt it would lead to an enormous expansion of the legal profession of specialists who do nothing but work in the area of bigamous cases.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons there have been virtually no prosecutions that have been successful in this area to date has been <Col N="1324" /> the anomalous position concerning the laws of evidence.  If I am a husband, my wife gets a church decree of annulment and marries someone else, she has gone through the ceremony, the Garda know about it, the local community know about it, the Director of Public Prosecutions knows about it and want to bring a prosecution for bigamy.  Under the law as it obtains I cannot give evidence against my wife because I am not a competent witness to give evidence that my wife is now in fact committing bigamy with someone else.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the provisions of this Bill will resolve that problem, that the Irish solution to the Irish problem of turning a blind eye to bigamy has been that spouses have been incompetent witnesses against the other spouse when that spouse engages in a bigamous marriage. The provisions of this Bill, in rendering all spouses competent in criminal prosecutions brought against their spouses, lift the block against spouses giving evidence in bigamy trials.</P>
    <P>What I want to know is: what will the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions do after the provisions of this Bill become law?  Are we to embark on a whole series of bigamy trials or will a blind eye be turned?  What will be the position if the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions does not do his job?  In recent years there have been some instances with which the Minister of State present will be familiar.  I think there was one in Limerick &mdash; but I could be wrong &mdash; of the first spouse trying to bring a private prosecution for bigamy, then discovering they could not get past the District Court because the only evidence available was their own and they were not competent to give it.</P>
    <P>If that is gone it seems to me that, even if the State continues to turn a blind eye, the provisions of this Bill will leave all of those people, who have gone through those second ceremonies of marriage, vulnerable to private prosecutions at the hands of their first spouses.  If nothing else the provisions of this Bill will require us to look at our marriage <Col N="1325" /> laws and, very rapidly, at the issue of divorce.  If we do not, no matter what the view of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General, the product of this Bill will be a number of bigamy criminal cases inevitably institutied by spouses who feel abandoned, deserted, who were greatly hurt by the fact that their spouse has gone through a second marriage.  I do not believe anybody has realised that this is one of the implications of the provisions of this Bill. It is as well that we know it is because, in making spouses competent in this way, the block and the barrier in this area is lifted.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will regard my comments as constructive.  They are designed to ensure that we enact a very good Bill. This Bill is a good deal more complicated in its implications than may have been apparent from some of the public comment in recent days.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that, with a view to processing it quickly, with a view to ensuring that we do the job properly, we should take Committee Stage in a Special Committee of the House rather than within this Chamber.  That does not mean it need take weeks or months but it would provide the facility of getting the Bill enacted at a time when perhaps the Finance Bill and Social Welfare Bill will be dominating this House.  By taking it in Special Committee we would be able to tease out its implications in a non-party, non-political, non-partisan way ensuring that the best possible measure is eventually enacted into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well on behalf of my colleagues.  I know he is sufficiently competent to deal with the subject before us.</P>
      <P>Probably this is a Bill which could best be dealt with in the manner advocated by Deputy Shatter, that is in Special Committee, because it is a minefield.  Indeed we Members could deal with it most effectively on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Act of 1908 is the basic law governing this subject we have had to wait all that time to discuss it.  It is ironic <Col N="1326" /> that we are updating the main law set under British rule in 1908.</P>
    <P>Since we are privileged to have in the new Minister a practitioner I might climb on my hobbyhorse and appeal to him in the strongest terms possible to do something about the condition of our courthouses nationwide and in some instances, about their absence.  In my own town we do not even have a courthouse to cater for 25,000 people and probably over 60,000 in the hinterland.  The court sits in an old schoolhouse and there are no acoustic or amplification systems, yet today we talk about satellite TV and the most modern technology one can imagine.  We are talking about putting courthouses on a TV link while the majority of them do not have amplification, adequate heating or the basic requirements for consultation.</P>
    <P>Even in the High Court, barristers have to talk to people out in corridors, in alleyways and even out on the footpath. That is an appalling situation in the largest and most important court of the land. While we should update the law, we should spend a bit more time updating the courthouses.  The Minister who is a law practitioner in a provincial area, will appreciate the points I am making, as will my other two colleagues.  I appeal to the Minister not to forget about this aspect in his work in the Department so that law practitioners will be able to deal with people as they should be dealt with, as human beings, whether or not they are guilty.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party support this Bill and we hope it will receive a speedy passage through both Houses.  Sexual abuse has become a very important national debate.  All parents are very conscious of this problem but it is difficult to understand how it has suddenly become such a problem.  We tend to blame unemployment for everything that happens and for every crime committed.  We say that if we did not have so much unemployment we would not have so much crime.  The whole question of sexual abuse has suddenly been brought forward in most difficult circumstances.  Now people are prepared to come forward and <Col N="1327" /> admit to being sexually abused.  Perhaps because it is getting so much publicity people are beginning to speak about these things which they were reluctant to speak about in the past.  We must examine why the problem has suddenly become such a major problem.  I do not know the solution to the problem.  I know that we have Law Reform Commission reports going back to 1985, but a study has not been carried out, for example, by the Department of Health or the health boards on the root cause of the problem.</P>
    <P>The health boards have to play a part in this.  As with courthouses, health boards are overloaded and under-funded and in the majority of cases they are not too efficient.  If work is to be carried out by the health boards under this Bill are they equipped either financially or with the manpower to carry out that work?  I have grave reservations about that. When replying, will the Minister explain how he sees health boards operating within the context of this Bill?</P>
    <P>I have reservations about a number of sections.  Section 12 refers to giving evidence through a television link by persons under 17 years of age.  It would be better to improve and update court facilities rather than introduce modern technology.  It is important that people should go to court in a court atmosphere. After all, this Bill deals with serious crime entailing serious penalties.  We must have an atmosphere in which people can get a fair trial, so that they will not be tried by TV or video.  They should be tried in the circumstances appertaining to a court. Will the Minister say how he sees a person giving evidence virtually on television, and how it will work?  I know young people are more competent today to deal with videos, computers and all sorts of electronic gadgets, but we are not talking about electronic gadgets but about a person being put on trial for a very serious offence.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about all of this.  Will the Minister spell out specifically how the system will operate?  If a child witness is in Dublin can the witness go on TV link in Dublin while the case is <Col N="1328" /> heard in Waterford or Dundalk?  Will the courthouse be like this Chamber, for instance, with a video link out in the smoke room?  I have very grave reservations about people giving evidence perhaps 40 miles away from where the court is sitting.  They might think they are doing a video recording rather than giving evidence as a result of which a man or a woman will face a serious term in jail.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section on wigs and gowns.  It is about time we eliminated them.  They are the flashiest part of courthouse paraphernalia.  They are a hangover from the colonial days of British rule and they should have been kicked out long ago.  I welcome the provision which eliminates these.  It can be intimidating, not alone for children but for adults, and that practice should be completely eliminated. I do not think the legal profession would have any great objection to that, and perhaps the Minister will comment on this in his reply.  Solicitors do not wear wigs and gowns when appearing in the District Court and I do not see why they should be worn in any other court.  I cannot see what they achieve other than to intimidate those appearing before the court.  The judges should not be treated differently; they should dress in the normal fashion in order to put people, whether young or old, at ease.  Going to court is a difficult enough experience without having to cope with the added difficulty of legal regalia.</P>
    <P>We should be careful in enacting this Bill.  It is a minefield.  We should hasten slowly to enact a number of the provisions in the Bill.  One of the most important features of Irish law is that a person is constitutionally innocent until proven guilty.  It would be very dangerous if the law were loaded against the accused because very often innocent people go to jail, as we know.  The practitioners of the law know that better than anyone.  Very often the guilty go free but we must always maintain that a person is innocent until proven guilty and we must ensure that the legislation is not loaded in such a way as to take that fundamental and constitutional right from anybody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> It is for that reason that I am worried about section 13 which provides for the giving of evidence through an intermediary. Will the Minister spell out what exactly that means?  Does it mean that a social worker may be hired by the court and that he or she will interview the accused or, indeed, the witnesses?  How will the evidence be put to the court by that intermediary?  What qualifications will be required to act as an intermediary? How can we be sure that the intermediary will not give his or her version of what he thinks the witness is saying?  When you are put on the witness stand, the judge and jury can see and hear what you have to say.  However, when an intermediary is involved, does this mean the young person who has been sexually abused speaks privately to the intermediary who, in turn, gives evidence in the witness-box?  Or does it mean that both will come into the witness-box and that the intermediary will speak on behalf of the young person?  A number of very important points needs to be clarified and I would be very worried that this provision could be very badly abused.  It would depend on an enormous number of factors: it may have religious or political implications, there could be implications depending on which club the person was a member of, etc.  Will the Minister please spell out in more detail the implications of this section, as I do not think that this has been spelt out in sufficient detail.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about section 18 as it relates to the mentally handicapped. I have had a number of dealings with the mentally handicapped and I was the first chairman of one of the largest organisations for the mentally handicapped in my own town.  I am not too sure that we can depend on the evidence of a mentally handicapped person when it may mean that somebody will have to spend the next couple of years in gaol.  I do not say that with any disrespect to the mentally handicapped.  I have worked all my life with people who are mentally handicapped and that is why I make that point. Will the Minister indicate how he envisages this will work in practice?  Does he envisage that a mentally handicapped <Col N="1330" /> person can be fair to the accused when giving evidence?  Could a mentally handicapped person be directed by a third party to say things in a particular way?  I am not too clear on that point.  I think this opens up a minefield and I would like the Minister to spell out the matter in more detail.  Deputy Shatter also made the point that words could be put into the mouths of children.  I am a father and a grandfather and from my experience dealing with children I know very often children, unlike adults, can be directed in a particular way.  Is there a danger that this legislation will be based on the words from the mouths of children?  Are there any safeguards within the court system to avoid that happening?</P>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in expressing my concern at the problem that arose recently in Waterford.  It was very unfortunate. The position is that when you go to court, you go to win.  The accused hopes to win his case and not to have to go to gaol and it is the job of the defending solicitor or barrister to achieve that end on their client's behalf.  The accused must have an equal chance before the law.  In this case the accused got off on a fluke, a serious technicality that needs to be redressed.  Instead of the Members of the Opposition tabling an amendment, I suggest that the Minister amend the Bill to deal with this unfortunate situation. As this occurred in Waterford, it will arise elsewhere, in Dublin, Cork or somewhere else, and it is important that the Minister takes this opportunity to amend the Bill, and we would all support him.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Labour Party will be supporting the swift passage through the Dáil of this much needed legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, on his appointment to this new and challenging portfolio and I congratulate Deputy O'Dea on his appointment as Minister of State in the same Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it, the Bill looks rather technical, especially to non lawyers, but it covers a number of matters of immediate concern and importance, for example, child abuse and the laws of evidence <Col N="1331" /> relating to it.  Clearly the Bill introduces some much needed changes in the laws of evidence in our criminal justice system. Only last week we saw an example of overly technical rules of evidence preventing what might otherwise have been a successful prosecution in an incest case.  Other Members have spoken out on this case and I echo their concerns. However, we should be careful not immediately to jump to conclusions on hearing secondhand accounts of cases. There is definitely a need to modernise some of our archaic rules of evidence, but in doing so we must not destroy those elements of fairness, due process and other safeguards which have been developed to protect the accused person.</P>
    <P>The hearsay rule is one of the most technical of all rules of evidence.  It has in the past prevented the introduction into evidence of perfectly reliable records simply because it was not possible to show that the person who recorded the information had personal knowledge of that information.  It would also prevent the admission of such records where it was not possible to identify who exactly had recorded the information.  I have come across a British case, DPP versus Myers, which highlights the shortcoming of the hearsay rule and identifies it in a very clear cashion.  Cars were at issue in this case and the shortcoming of the hearsay rule was identified when it was seen as not possible to admit records of car chassis numbers into evidence because it was not possible to produce the particular employees who had recorded the chassis numbers.  Baffling to the layman, these situations do little to encourage public confidence in our criminal justice system and they undermine respect for the law.</P>
    <P>The admissibility of certain types of documentary evidence should assist in ridding us of some of the most anomalous effects of the hearsay rule.  If there is a reliable procedure for creating a record or making a document it should be possible to recognise the probative value of that document or record.  In today's world computers are generally used to <Col N="1332" /> record information and they are here to stay.  To exclude much of the information stored in computers from use in a criminal prosecution because of the hearsay rule would be to ignore the practicalities of modern life.  Obviously a court has to be satisfied that the document is reliable and authentic.  It would be wrong to allow documentary evidence to be used to overcome the requirement of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, this Bill will protect the accused from any potential unfairness.  Section 8 gives a discretion to the trial judge to exclude any documents which he believes in the interests of justice ought not to be admitted.  Our judges are very well equipped to make this type of decision, relying on their experience of criminal trials.</P>
    <P>Our legal system must be able, given the wherewithal, to adapt to changes in society.  In recent times we have become well aware of the potential for abuses in the business world.  Technology has brought a potential for a vast array of new and complicated types of crime.  We hear stories of computer hacking causing enormous problems for companies. Banks and other financial institutions are confronted with fraud involving electronic transfers and abuse of computers. It is essential that we make the necessary amendments to our laws to allow prosecutions to deal with this type of dishonesty. The Bill certainly assists in this process but it should not stop there.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention, for example, to the Larceny Act, 1916, which is inadequate to deal with many of these new crimes.  Under the present law there is difficulty prosecuting even such common crimes as cheque book and credit card fraud and false accounting.  As a matter of urgency new legislation is required to broaden the definition of crimes of dishonesty to take into account the reality of today's society.  I note the Government's awareness, as reflected in the Minister's speech, that when the Law Reform Commission make their recommendations on the law of dishonesty the implementation of changes in the law in respect of dishonesty should receive top priority.  No section of the community <Col N="1333" /> should regard itself as one step ahead of the legal process.  This is especially so in the case of the modern phenomenon of white collar crime.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it easier for tourists who have been victims of crimes to give evidence.  Everyone shares a sense of outrage and disgust at some of the crimes that tourists have been subjected to in recent years, particularly in our capital city.  How can we project the image of a friendly country and people when some of these very welcome visitors are attacked on our streets?  There have been suggestions in the past that some of the individuals responsible for the attacks were taking advantage of the fact that their victims were unlikely to want the trauma of returning to the Irish courts to give evidence at trial.  Why should the foreign visitor who has had a bad experience in our country have to go out of his way to let the law follow its course? Allowing these victims to make statements which can be admitted in court without the necessity for the witness to attend the court is essential.  In more serious cases it would also be possible under section 28 to allow the foreign witness to give evidence over a television link-up.</P>
    <P>Important as these new provisions are, they will not of course erase the bad experience of a mugging or an assault from the mind of the visitor or of his or her relatives.  If we are to protect our vital tourism industry and the image of our country which has been so carefully nurtured, we must do all we can to prevent crime against foreign visitors.  In addition to the measures in the Bill, we must ensure that an adequate number of gardaí are on the streets during the peak tourist months.  We have attractive and interesting cities and we must do all we can to ensure that they are safe not only for tourists or non-nationals but for every citizen.</P>
    <P>Part III will assist the courts in dealing in a more sympathetic way with young victims of crimes of sexual abuse.  It will also allow young witnesses to give evidence in a less threatening environment. <Col N="1334" /> Section 12 makes provision for the use of a live television link through which the evidence can be given.  Child abuse is something which for too many years was swept under the carpet.  It is probably more widespread than was imagined.  The child victims of this ugly crime must be given every assistance and understanding. They should not have to see the face of their tormentors while giving evidence.</P>
    <P>Appearing as a witness in court is a difficult experience for most adults.  How much more nerve racking it must be for these children.  In addition to the live television link-up, provision is also made for the introduction into evidence of video recordings of a previous live television link at the time of the preliminary examination and also of the video recording of any statements made by a child under the age of 14.  There are appropriate safeguards allowing the court to take into account the circumstances in which such recording took place and to decide on occasion in the interests of justice that some part or all of the recording should not be admitted in evidence.</P>
    <P>Part IV makes some important changes to the old rules which prevented a spouse of an accused from giving evidence for the prosecution.  Section 20 makes the spouse a competent witness in all cases, either for the prosecution or for the accused.  This new provision obviously covers situations where that spouse is volunteering the evidence. However, it is necessary in some situations that the spouse be compelled to give evidence and section 21 provides this compellability in the case of crimes of violence or sexual offence against a spouse or children of the spouse or of the accused or against any person under the age of 17.  A spouse giving evidence against an accused may come under enormous pressure not to give evidence.  It is important that the courts do not leave it up to that spouse to make the positive decision to volunteer to give evidence.  If everyone involved knows that there is no element of choice in the matter, it will hopefully take some of the pressure off the spouse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> In accordance with the general thrust of this Bill, Part V makes it easier for children to give evidence in criminal cases where they do not understand the significance of the oath.  The old rule that the unsworn testimony of a child had to be corroborated is removed by section 27.  It also removes the requirement that a warning be given to a jury on the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated sworn evidence of a child.  This is now a matter for the judge to decide in the circumstances of a case.  Again, this provision should allow the courts to be able to deal more effectively with the abhorrent crime of child abuse.  Adults who have abused children will not be able to exploit technicalities in the law to evade conviction.</P>
    <P>It is a sad fact that crimes of violence and sexual abuse are being perpetrated against children in families.  We must face up to the challenge this poses for us as legislators and ensure that our courts have the necessary powers to deal with these serious problems.  This Bill, following in the footsteps of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1990, shows the determination of the Government to do just that.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I am very happy to be given the opportunity to speak on this Bill this evening.  Like previous speakers I begin by congratulating Deputy Flynn on his appointment to this onerous position. I congratulate also Deputy O'Dea on his appointment as Minister of State. Both Deputies have been appointed at a time when the criminal statistics have shown a massive increase, having waned substantially in the eighties.  It is notable that in 1991 there was a 7.8 per cent increase in the incidence of recorded indictable crime.  From the years 1984 to 1987, inclusive, the incidence of indictable crime decreased as it did in 1989 with a small increase in 1988.  It is a cause of concern that the figures for 1991 <Col N="1336" /> showed such a dramatic increase of 7.8 per cent.  An ethos of evil apears to be developing in society at all levels.  Therefore, this Bill is welcome in so far as it tries to deal with some of the criminal activity that has been very difficult to handle in the courts and at the investigative level.</P>
      <P>I was privileged this afternoon to sit on these benches while Deputy Shatter offered his critique of the Bill.  He did not have a script but rather a few notes and, in my view, he gave a very enlightened criticism of the Bill.  I have no doubt he gave food for thought to the Ministers and the officials in relation to some possible difficulties that may arise unless they are examined and put right before we pass Committee Stage.  The House is very lucky to have a man of his calibre; his specialist talent is of enormous advantage and use to this House.  I was disappointed there was nobody from the press here to listen to him because they would have the basis for a very interesting story for tomorrow.  They would have been able to put fat on the bones of some articles we read in the newspapers over the past few days.  Sadly, the people of Ireland may well lose the benefit of Deputy Shatter's criticisms of the Bill.  I imagine the press were preoccupied with a report they got this morning and, as a result, this Bill will probably not be given the space it deserves in tomorrow's press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill attempts to deal with child sexual abuse and white collar crime.  I did a study on child sexual abuse in the autumn.  Child sexual abuse seems to have raised its ugly head in 1984 when there were 88 allegations reported to the health boards.  By 1989 the number of allegations reported to the boards had increased to 1,241 &mdash; those figures are official Department of Health statistics. Childline which had been initiated in the meantime took almost 6,000 calls relating to child sexual abuse during 1990 &mdash; that figure is derived from the ISPCC annual report of 1990.  The difficulty is that we do not know the extent of the problem we are dealing with but we can be certain that child sexual abuse existed prior to 1984.  Because of a new openness in <Col N="1337" /> society and a more open approach by individuals, the reporting of child sexual abuse has increased.  That is not to say the incidence of child sexual abuse has increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>I examined some American and Canadian research into this whole area because we do not have any such data here.  The Eastern Health Board have carried out some research but it is rather superficial.  When one looks at research carried out in the United States into child sexual abuse one will find some divergent results.  Various reports which I examined suggest that 8 per cent to 50 per cent of women, of a particular age who had been questioned &mdash; depending on who asked the questions &mdash; agreed they had been sexually abused as children.  That is an enormous divergence and one would have to say the figures are not trustworthy. They are not trustworthy, basically because the questioner would have to define sexual abuse and based on that definition he or she would then question people on it.  That is the reason there was such a wide divergence.  There is no agreement in the United States as to the basis for trying to produce empirical results from studies into this whole area. Child sexual abuse exists and is a major social problem.  I am of the opinion that it is a time bomb in society that has not yet exploded.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many vicious crimes of rape are committed week after week against young children and old women? How many of those crimes might not have happened if the perpetrators were identified as having been sexually abused in childhood and had received appropriate therapy?  I am of the opinion that many of these crimes would never have taken place because we have evidence to suggest that if the appropriate therapy is applied they can make a complete recovery. If victims are unable to get therapy they can suffer the most appalling disorders. In later life when they become adults this can lead to their being misfits in society.  They are unable to form lasting, personal relationships and tend to get involved in substance abuse, prostitution and various other criminal activities. <Col N="1338" /> Many do get married but very often their marriages are unsuccessful.  This leads to further criminal activity on the part of their children.  Indeed, experts have established that many abusers were themselves the victims of abuse.</P>
    <P>One of the things the Government should do at this stage is ask the social science department of one of our universities to carry out an in-depth study on child sexual abuse.  While the legislation before us is laudable, we need to know the reason children are abused and to establish statistics.  As I already said, this is going to lead to an enormous increase in juvenile crime and to criminal activity on the part of adults.  If we are not to lose control of this matter, and there are signs that we might, we will have to use all the resources at our disposal, both investigative and therapeutic, to come to terms with it.</P>
    <P>There is one sad fact and that is that the Child Care Act, referred to by the two previous speakers, is gathering dust at this time.  What is the reason for this? Literally, there are hundreds of children who have been the victims of abuse.  This has been proved and validated &mdash; the word used by Deputy Shatter &mdash; by health board officials and they are not receiving therapy.  That is a sad fact in today's awful world.  I would hazard a guess that the figure runs into thousands.  Many children are sexually abused each year and yet they do not receive the necessary therapy to allow them overcome the serious personality disorders they may suffer as a result.  The Government should look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I am lucky to be a member of the Select Committee on Crime.  I contend that this problem of crime cannot be tackled simply by putting legislation on the Statute Book, or by building special schools for young people, spending colossal sums of money in the process.  I am convinced that until we come to realise that there are children wandering the streets of Dublin who are not under the control of their parents and that there are parents who have no responsibility for the activities of their children, and come to terms with this fact, we will introduce criminal <Col N="1339" /> legislation from time to time in an effort to be more sophisticated than the criminals and to ensure that we take them into court and put them behind bars.  This is not good enough in today's world.  As a matter of urgency we have to adopt a pro-active approach in this area.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister of State and his senior colleague that they should seriously consider forming a partnership with the local community and the health boards in housing estates in Dublin, and in the bigger centres of population, in order to support families who are in serious difficulty, because the problem of crime begins with families who are unable to control their daily lives.  I am firmly convinced that if we establish a family support network right across the city of Dublin, in the first instance in those areas where it is needed, and then in other cities and large towns for which the crime figures are reported in the <i>Garda Review,</i> then the figures would show a massive decrease.</P>
    <P>We had a good discussion at the Select Committee on Crime today between 2.30 p.m. and 4 p.m. on this topic.  I was delighted that one of the experts who attended the committee today, and who has wide experience in this area, was the first person to agree with my thesis that we would be far better off pouring money into a family support network in an organised way in partnership with the local community and the health boards, because in that way we would ensure that children are properly protected and parents would learn how to manage their family units.  We would have a far healthier society as a result.  It was his view, and it is mine, that if we do not do this there will be anarchy in Dublin.  There is evidence that this is already happening but the problem is going to get worse.  It is not all that long ago when people could freely walk the streets of Dublin without fear, but people now tell us that this is no longer the case.  Indeed, some of my friends have been savagely attacked and robbed in this city while sitting in their cars at traffic lights.  There is vicious crime in this city and it can be related to poverty, <Col N="1340" /> deprivation and poor family circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has allowed me to paint the background to this matter because a particular set of circumstances in society can lead us to deciding that there is a necessity to introduce legislation.  I have tried, from my own experience and the research I have carried out, to give the Members of this House who are listening to me and anybody who cares to read the record later, an indication of the difficulties we are facing and are going to face in the future unless we do something more than just putting criminal legislation on the Statute Book which is designed to outsmart the growing number of criminals.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will initiate a discussion in Cabinet in an effort to set up a family support network in areas where it is needed. Any moneys spent in that area would be well spent.  Moreover, I am convinced that local communities would be anxious to get involved in such a partnership.  From my research I decided that the way to this would be to set up a pre-school play group supported by health board and Government funds in areas where poverty and other problems are leading to poor family circumstances, in an effort to get parents involved in support groups so that they can learn how to control their lives and exert influence on their families in a positive way rather than allow their children to roam free and become little criminals.  As they grow older they will learn more and eventually we will find in ten to 15 years time that the problem is out of control and legislation is not the answer.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to draw up a ten-year funding programme to develop and maintain the Irish railway network; to ensure the maximum usage of EC Structural and other funds with the objective of providing on the national rail network continuous welded rail and automatic computerised signalling facilities; and further calls on the Government to convert the National Roads Authority into a National Roads and Rail Authority so as to ensure equality of infrastructural funding between road and rail services.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on her appointment.  I wish her well and a successful tenure in a very important Ministry.  I know she has been reared in the tradition of politics and she would not expect me to be anything other than combative and to give as good as I get.  I assure her that any reasonable proposals she has which will reduce transport costs, give our economy a greater competitive edge <i>vis-à-vis</i> transport and develop our infrastructure will have my full support.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of total despondency &mdash; this arose before the Minister took office &mdash; that in the last tranche of EC funding, from 1989-1993, virtually nothing went to public transport.  Only £36 million was allocated to public transport which was for rail facilities in the commuter area of Clondalkin.  This sum represents less than 4 per cent of the total EC five year programme. If we look at the breakdown of the funding given by the EC, we can see that it was £818 million, and of this 75 per cent went to roads, a sum of £615 million.  Airports got 11 per cent of the total, a sum of £93 million, and seaports received £66 million, or 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that this huge error cannot be repeated.  This is symptomatic of the total neglect of the railways and the lack of any coherent, overall policy <Col N="1342" /> since 1987 by successive Governments in developing the railways.  It can even be argued that the Department of Finance have a hidden agenda to close railway lines, particularly in rural areas.  This policy has reached the end of its life because today's problems in regard to reliability and delays, which I will outline in some detail in a moment, will be the major safety problems in future.  Irish Rail have survived, despite the straitjacket of controls on capital and borrowing, on the basis of increasing journey times and slowing train speeds to ensure safety.</P>
    <P>As we all know, safety is a very important and sensitive issue.  At the last Question Time on this subject the Minister would not agree to publish a report. Therefore, I should like to reflect on some aspects of the report of the Kennedy Henderson Group from Surrey, which was submitted to the Government on 3 December last.  The report was commissioned by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the chairman of Iarnród Éireann.  I should like to quote three passages which are of particular concern to me.  The first relates to the executive summary at the beginning. It states:</P>
    <P>In summary, the following key conclusions have emerged from the study: in comparison to British Rail, Iarnród Éireann's safety performance would appear to be lower in key areas such as passenger and staff safety but the situation is confused by different reporting arrangements....  The condition of Irish Rail's assets is declining through lack of investment which is beginning to affect reliability.  Today's reliability problem could become tomorrow's safety problem.</P>
    <P>I should also like to quote from page 43 of the report because it deals with the relationship between the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications and Iarnród Éireann.  Regarding their investment policy it states:</P>
    <P>The issue of funding for investments was discussed with IE senior management. <Col N="1343" /> From this it was clear that the public finances climate dictated the amount available for IE for investment in the railways and so expedient requests had to be made using railway and engineering judgment.  Inevitably, this constrains requests for investments ... resulting in an ageing locomotive and rolling stock fleet profile infrastructure which becomes less reliable. ... It should always be borne in mind that today's reliability problem due to ageing equipment may become tomorrow's safety problem.</P>
    <P>Page 46 of the final part of the report in that regard states that Iarnród Éireann is neither absolutely safe nor absolutely unsafe.  A report which makes a statement of that kind is a matter of deep concern to me and my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are committed to an investment programme in the railways by utilising EC funds for the development of the railway track or, as it is known in the business, the permanent way.  In simple terms what is required is continuous welded rail; instead of the old fashioned jointed sections with wooden sleepers we should have concrete sleepers and continuous welded rail on all inter-city routes to and from Dublin.  This would replace jointed sections.</P>
    <P>We also favour automatic computerised signalling systems.  At present the electric token system is in place, a bizarre system whereby people hand on metal chains from station to station so that two trains will not meet on a single track, a practice which is over 100 years old.  We want a computerised or radio signalling system.  To provide this and continuous welded rail would cost £240 million at 1992 prices.  The simple breakdown is: £30 million for the Dublin-Sligo route; £90 million for the three Mayo routes, including Dublin-Galway; £30 million on the line from Tralee to Mallow and £30 million to finish the Dublin-Cork line &mdash; it is complete as far as Portarlington; and there would also be a sum of £30 million each to Dublin-Waterford <Col N="1344" /> and Dublin-Rosslare.  These figures are from reliable industry sources.</P>
    <P>The figure excludes the Dublin-Belfast line and I would like a commitment from the Minister in this debate regarding clarification of the Government's policy on the Dublin-Belfast line because it is a vital cross-Border link.  If any route qualifies for a high speed Euro rail, it is the Dublin-Belfast line.  A major study was done by the UK and Irish authorities in 1989 to evaluate the most cost effective investment strategy for the next decade for this line.  It concluded in its recommendations that the double track should be upgraded with new signalling to allow speeds of 145 kilometres per hour giving it a non-stop journey time between Dublin-Belfast of one and a half hours.  It recommended introducing high quality trains with a 50 per cent increase in frequency to nine trains per day in each direction.  This would increase passengers by about 40 per cent.  They also recommended making adequate provision for the carriage of larger international containers. The estimated total cost at that time was £72.5 million to be spent over a period of 45 years.  The southern share of this was £42.5 million with a sum of £30 million for Northern Ireland Railways.</P>
    <P>I understand that Northern Ireland Railways and Irish Rail have agreed a joint marketing programme and joint delivery so that they would have the same vehicles.  This is what we need.  The money is available.  I understand that the breakdown of the sum of £42 million would be: £33 million for track and signalling and £9 million for rolling stock. This is a crucial opportunity, when the Internal Market borders are removed in 1993, to make this a reality.  I regret to have to say that his proposal is still gathering dust.</P>
    <P>All of these proposals are eligible for 75 per cent EC grant aid under the Regional Fund and the Cohesion Fund. The next tranche of funding for the five-year period, 1994-98, inclusive, is to be negotiated.  We need to grasp this money which is being made available.  I understand from discussions I have had with Commission officials that all this money <Col N="1345" /> will go to transport and environment related projects.</P>
    <P>Another reason we believe there is now a need for a new policy in relation to railways is the EC Directive on railways which is intended to relieve railway companies of the financial responsibilities for infrastructure and which will improve the position of the railways.  It will be necessary for public service obligations to be more clearly defined.  The purpose of this Directive is to introduce greater clarity in the relationship between railways and the State.  It is vital that Ireland operates within this new EC Directive.  Railways are receiving such enormous resources across the EC that they are now talking about privatising them.  Therefore, there have to be new regulations.  They see the separation of track from rolling stock and the transport rail operator as fundamental to this.  Whether or not we like it, it is now European policy to segregate the infrastructure.  What we are saying is that this investment programme clearly relates to the track.</P>
    <P>Any analysis of passengers purely on inter-city routes shows a strong, growing public demand for such services.  This entirely excludes all DART passengers and commuter rail services in the vicinity of Dublin.  This year there will be about eight million passenger journeys on inter-city rail.  This compares with 6.7 million passenger journeys in 1985.  There is a huge demand for these inter-city services. The Dublin-Cork line caters for about two million passenger journeys per year. In 1990 the number of passengers who travelled on the Dublin-Sligo line to a point west of Mullingar was 400,000. When we look at the detailed breakdown we can see quite clearly that despite delays and unreliability, Irish Rail have done a tremendous job &mdash; even with outdated rail cars, rolling stock and locomotives &mdash; in developing their services. They have shown a steady growth every year since 1985.  I have to say that the success of the DART, with a total of 25 million rail journeys, is staggering.</P>
    <P>The benefits of such an investment programme simply by utilising EC funds, means that over a ten-year period journey <Col N="1346" /> times can be greatly improved for all rail passengers.  For example, the journey on the Dublin-Sligo route can be shortend by some 40 minutes.  On each of the other routes &mdash; Dublin to Galway, Westport, Tralee, Waterford and Rosslare &mdash; journey times can be reduced by half an hour.  In addition, the elimination of stop-go repairs and temporary maintenance would mean a saving of £3 million per annum.  It is a comment on the present condition of the railway track that so much has to be spent on temporary maintenance.</P>
    <P>The other major benefit of such planned utilisation of EC resources would be to release Irish Rail revenue and resources for the development of their rolling stock.  It is estimated that some 80 locomotives &mdash; which pull the rail carriages &mdash; will be required over the next 12 years.  These cost, at present prices, £1.5 million each.  I am confident these locomotives could be funded without Government capital by Irish Rail out of their revenue if they were released from the burden of paying for the full cost of the infrastructure, the railway track.  To put it at its simplest, it is bizarre that Dublin Bus, with 800 buses, pay a mere £250,000 for the privilege of using the roadways in the greater Dublin area, whereas Irish Rail have to pay £45 million per year to maintain, not to speak of developing, railway tracks.  No other transport operator is discriminated against <i>vis-à-vis</i> infrastructure in this way.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have always favoured value for money in the context of public transport. Any breakdown of the subvention of £80 million will show that the public service obligation was £21 million; a once-off payment of voluntary severance last year was £3 million; financial charges &mdash; debts which arise because the company are not financed on an equity basis &mdash; were £11 million and over £45 million, over half the amount, went on maintenance or renewal of the track, signalling and gates.  It has to be acknowledged that since 1984 the State subvention has been reduced in real terms from £100 million to £80 million <Col N="1347" /> this year.  Passenger numbers on inter-city rail services have increased to eight million and there is a total of over 25 million passenger journeys per year.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations in Irish Rail have not been satisfactory.  There have been poor inter-union relations and a number of serious disputes over the past 12 months.  The company have about 5,700 employees.  There has been a history of rivalry between SIPTU and the National Bus and Rail Workers' Union.  A recent Labour Relations Commission report recommended the need for a new approach by both management and unions through the setting up of a joint industrial council, chaired by an outside, independent person.  The Government should immediately ensure that these recommendations are implemented and the council established.  It is also important that all aspects of this report are implemented to improve the competitiveness and performance of Irish Rail.  This would include a new disciplinary scheme, especially in the area of safety; a new code of practice on inter-union relations and an internal system for dealing with collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are proposing a ten-year corporate plan for Irish Rail to deal with the new pressures arising out of the liberalisation of bus competition and the improvements in the road infrastructure. The Newtownmountkennedy by-pass and the Shankill by-pass on the Dublin-Rosslare route and the Athlone by-pass have meant that by standing still the railways are losing ground rapidly.  The new bus competition Bill which the Taoiseach has promised this session, and which will increase the competitive pressures of bus passenger services, will also all add to the strain on the railways.  All these problems mean that we must now have a corporate plan for the railways.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael favour the clear inclusion in the Public Capital Programme, including EC finance, of railway infrastructure on an equal basis with roads.  One of the most pathetic aspects of the Government's performance over the past four years has been their failure to apply for <Col N="1348" /> even one penny of available EC funds to maintain and develop our inter-city rail services.  I know for a fact that Irish Rail made a detailed submission to the Government in 1987 seeking inclusion for EC funds and that when the submission was sent to Brussels without any reference to railways the Commission sent it back and said it did not want a roads plan, it wanted an integrated transport plan.  There is a concept in this country that the Department of the Environment are a spending Department and that the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications are an administrative Department.  This concept is wrong and until such time as we have one transport Department instead of the Department of the Marine dealing with shipping and ports, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications dealing with aviation and shipping and the Department of the Environment dealing with roads, traffic and haulage, we will have no coherent transport plan.</P>
    <P>No finance was allocated to inter-city mainline railway routes in the EC funded operational programme for 1989-93.  This is in spite of the fact that all over Europe the highest priority for expenditure on transport infrastructure has been on high speed rail.  It will be the responsibility of Irish Rail to pay, out of their own revenue, for improvements in their rolling stock, including rail cars and locomotives. Such a policy framework will allow for a new marketing programme for Irish Rail whereby they can develop a new attractive product and join in the evolving movement towards a high speed rail network.  Fine Gael's objective is to ensure that these goals become a reality. Lamentably, the Government have shown no inclination or interest in this topic.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Government's amendment which I have just received. As usual, it contains the typical congratulatory, complacent nonsense which we so often see in Government amendments to Private Members' motions.  We do not want a further study, a series of analysis or paralysis: what we need is <Col N="1349" /> investment and action.  Everyone who understands the railway sector knows what needs to be done.  In simple terms, we believe that the track should be segregated from the rolling stock, that the transport company should be segregated from the infrastructure, and that Irish Rail should get an even break.</P>
    <P>Anyone who reads the safety study will know that investment is the key to this problem.  There is a golden opportunity in the doubling of the European funds in that the money for roads, airports and seaports is being handed to us on a plate. All that is needed is a little imagination and commitment.  With such commitment Irish Rail will respond and the railways can be restored to their former strength.  We inherited a very sound railway system from the British and we should not throw it away through penny-pinching and neglect.  I ask all sides of the House to support this motion to ensure that investment in Irish Rail becomes a reality so that passengers can enjoy the best and most modern European railway service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday, 3 November 1862 the first train arrived at the still unfinished Sligo railway station.  I have been studying the original timetable and, making due allowance for stops at the 22 stations on the line from Dublin, the train, run by the Midland Great Western Railway, travelled at a faster speed than did the Irish Rail train from Sligo to Dublin this morning.  After 130 years that is not progress.</P>
      <P>The arrival of the first train was naturally an occasion of great jubilation.  The <i>Sligo Chronicle</i> of the day reported that:</P>
      <P>The temporary platform was crowded by the beauty, wealth, and respectability of Sligo, while the very line itself was thronged by thousands of persons anxious to catch the first signal of the approaching locomotive....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The band of the Sligo Rifles was in attendance and executed some choice selections of music with great taste and <Col N="1350" /> judgement, much to the gratification of the assembled spectators....</P>
    <P>They had a great day in Sligo or the <i>Sligo Chronicle</i> had a great reporter.  I suspect it was a combination of both.</P>
    <P>Recently there was another major gathering at Sligo railway station, but his time there was anger not jubilation among the assembled spectators.  This was a protest meeting about the way things now are on the Sligo-Dublin rail link.  It was part of a campaign led by Sligo Chamber of Commerce and Sligo Corporation to save the line from death by slow strangulation.  The manner in which this campaign was supported and is being supported by the entire Sligo population and backed up by towns and communities right along the line to Mullingar reflects the frustrations at the inadequacies of the service and the fear that the line would be closed entirely.  It also reflects a welcome determination by the people of the area that they will no longer settle for being second class passengers.</P>
    <P>Delegations were sent to Dublin and met by the present and previous Ministers for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  The word was that special funding would be made available for the Sligo line.  Indeed, when I raised the matter in the House the previous Minister told me that on the very day he was meeting Irish Rail to see what could be done for Sligo.  In the end only £2 million out of a total of £45 million was provided for track renewal, by coincidence the very same amount that was taken away from the Sligo line the previous year when Irish Rail ran short of funds in more favoured areas.  That £2 million will renew exactly seven miles of track.  At that rate it will take 20 years to complete the job of a continuous welded rail to Dublin, the kind of track that now exists elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What happens in the meantime?  For safety reasons the maximum speed of the trains was reduced last year to 50 miles an hour over long stretches.  This year it is down to 40 miles an hour and next year it will be 30 miles an hour.  That will be <Col N="1351" /> the speed at which one gets home, that is if there is not a breakdown.</P>
    <P>That is no way to run a railway.  That is why we need the ten year corporate plan for Irish Rail being proposed by Fine Gael.  That is why Fine Gael favour the clear inclusion in the Public Capital Programme, including EC finance, of money for the railway, infrastructure on the same basis as for roads.  Within that ten year programme I would, of course, be seeking priority for the Dublin-Sligo line, not because we want preferential treatment &mdash; indeed we would settle right now for the service at present in operation on the Cork line.  Unfortunately we have reached the stage where we cannot even utilise the hand-me-downs from the Cork line because the track would not carry them.</P>
    <P>The Sligo line cannot wait for ten years.  Unless given priority there will be no line in ten years time.  It will have been killed not by any decision of the Minister, the Government or Irish Rail, but as a result of people being driven from it because of its slow pace.</P>
    <P>For peripheral areas ease of access will be essential in the new Europe.  For us in the north west, the periphery of a periphery, it will be vital.  Yet we seem to be getting scant consideration in Government planning, other than a few badly needed by-passes on the N4.  The nearest a Euro route will get to us is Kinnegad.  A proper railway line should be provided, thereby utilising the Structural Funds as they were intended.  With continuous welded rail, automatic computerised signalling, and decent rolling stock &mdash; I am not talking about the continental super trains &mdash; the journey between Sligo and Dublin could be cut by 40 minutes.</P>
    <P>The Government did not apply for one penny of EC funds to develop and maintain our inter-city rail services.  The sustaining of our railway network is vital to the whole country, and no part of the network is more vital than the Sligo line. Yet we know that the first part of the network designated for the chop if the Government do not provide the funds is <Col N="1352" /> the link between Mullingar and Sligo. There is little use in the Minister saying it will not be closed.  If the Minister adopts this plan and provides the money it will not be closed.  Otherwise it will die of slow strangulation.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult time for the northwest and the west.  This area has faced almost continuous crises from the time of Cromwell and the Great Famine through successive waves of emigration, but always the resilience and determination of the people and a love of the land ensured survival.  That determination is still there as can be seen from the response to the bishops' initiatives. However, this time survival will be more difficult.  Proper railway links are an important factor for farming, tourism, lifestyle and social reasons as well as for pensioners with free travel.  The approach has been outlined by Deputy Yates.  In the new open Government I ask the Minister to be generous and wise and accept this plan.  The one thing we do not need is another study.  Everyone knows the facts.  They have been clearly outlined.  Deputy Yates has put forward a plan but perhaps the Government will put forward a better one.  What is needed is action and not a further study.</P>
    <P>From his knowledge of the history of the Dáil the Acting Chairman will be aware that the Sligo train was the transport used by the then Deputy Jinks to return to Sligo on a famous occasion, thereby missing a division in this House, prolonging the life of a Government and adding a new word to the English language. I sincerely hope that when it comes to the vote on this motion tomorrow night my colleague, Deputy Brennan, will not be on the Sligo train but will be with me in the lobby, thereby dramatically underlining the determination of all the people of Sligo to ensure the future of the rail link.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, which I have not had the opportunity to do in the House.  I wish her the best of luck in her very important Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Yates for giving me a <Col N="1353" /> few minutes of his time.  I support the motion in his name and that of Fine Gael calling on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to draw up a ten-year funding programme for the proper, efficient and maximum use of the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to say that the Irish rail system has been on a downward spiral for a considerable number of years. Under the existing rail structure and finances it is not possible for our rail system to compete against the massive developments taking place in road transportation, and the increasing use of air transport.  Because of outdated facilities and a lack of funding, as outlined by Deputy Yates, the rail system is simply not able to compete.  One realises the inadequacies of our rail system when one considers the time it takes to travel by train from Paris to Nice or from London to Glasgow.</P>
    <P>For any rail system to be accepted and used by the public to a point that even approaches commercial viability, it must be safe, efficient, reliable and cost effective. Serious questions arise in connection with many aspects of the Iarnród rail system.  No fault can be attached to many of the staff working on the lines or on existing trains within Iarnród because they are labouring and have laboured for many years under a great degree of handicap.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's own constituency there was the recent spectacle of sections of the line from Athenry to Tuam to Claremorris being lifted.  Spurious evidence was given by Iarnród personnel as to the reasons for lifting those sections and their replacement.</P>
    <P>As one who uses the western rail line weekly, I should like the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to say how much is spent on the improvement and upkeep of the line from Dublin to Westport and the spur line from Claremorris to Ballina.  Is it true that a significant amount of the money laid aside for improvement of that section of line was used in golden handshakes for persons retiring from Iarnród Éireann?  I should like the Minister to answer that question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> When one considers that after the 1850s there were rail links to Clifden and Achill and the tourism potential of those areas, and given the vast numbers of tourists using similar lines in north Wales and the Snowdonia region, I believe the fare structure of CIE and Iarnród Éireann needs to be looked at.  There is a great difference between the price of return fares from Dublin to the west and from the west to Dublin and no one has given a rational explanation for that.  Hundreds of students from the west of Ireland attending third level colleges use the train every Sunday evening.  Does the Minister know that it is cheaper for a student to avail of a return fare from Westport to Galway &mdash; that is, travelling from Westport to Athlone to Galway &mdash; than a return fare from Westport to Athlone? Why?  Because the measurement of the line in distance used is the old system from Claremorris to Tuam to Galway, a system which is no longer in operation. The fare structure is outdated, antiquated and needs to be examined.  Even the use by students of student cards for reductions in fare does not apply given the special incentives operated at times by Iarnród Éireann on various lines.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for passengers to book a seat on a train, as can be done in many countries in central Europe that have very inferior facilities.  I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has ever stood at Heuston Station on a Friday evening and witnessed the mad scramble down Platforms 3 and 5 from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m., with people desperately seeking a seat on a train.  I have seen people standing in great discomfort until they reached Athlone.  As Deputy Yates pointed out, that is because we are not using the Structural Funds as they should be used.  This open Government should examine that aspect under the ten-year plan proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In the organisation's 1990 report, the chief executive of Iarnród Éireann stated that while the group increasingly moved towards improving the commercial efficiency of its operations, the significant infrastructural costs of the rail network <Col N="1355" /> and the continuing need to modernise the road vehicles and railroading stock required ongoing investment of funds on a level that could not be generated from operations.  The Government should take note of that clear statement and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>Certain questions have been raised down the years, and I am sure that the Minister has heard them.  Iarnród Éireann, with a magnificent site for development on the far side of the Shannon, built a new station on the Dublin side of the Shannon.  If an Iarnród Éireann engineer were to say there were structural faults in the main bridge across the Shannon then, with one stroke of the pen, all the rail services to the west could be knocked out.  In her reply to the debate, I should like the Minister to state clearly that there is no thought and no scintilla of evidence that the western rail link might at any time be terminated and that it is the conviction and commitment of the Government to improve and update the line from Dublin to Westport, and the spur line from Claremorris to Ballina.  I also support Deputy Nealon's claims for the Sligo line.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that during the EC Council of Transport Ministers' meeting of 17 December 1990 plans were drawn up for the overall development of rail systems up to the year 2010.  Those plans involved the construction of 5,600 miles of new rail track that were capable of facilitating speeds of up to 220 miles an hour in continental Europe and also the upgrading of a further 9,000 miles of track.  Here in Ireland, we have a rail system that is now so antiquated and under so much pressure that today's train from Sligo takes longer and travels at a slower rate than the trains did almost 100 years ago.  That is an indictment of our system.  It is patently obvious that our rail system has been on a downward spiral for too long.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take action. She is a western Deputy and should understand these matters.  There are a number of reports already available and there is sufficient information in the <Col N="1356" /> Department at her disposal.  I support the call by Deputy Yates and the Fine Gael Party that the Government adopt a ten-year restructuring plan and do so now. Action is needed.</P>
    <P>The Government say that tourism numbers need to be doubled within a number of years but to reach this goal they must realise that increasing numbers of young people travelling from within Europe use the rail system but they will not use our rail system if it is run down consistently, as happened for several years.  It is possible to move more people per hour by train than by any other system, and one has only to witness the response to special offers by Iarnród Éireann by large numbers of people who rush to use the trains because of the comfort provided, because one can meet people, one can rest or one can work on the trains.  If the rail system is to be taken into account in a modern, efficient economy, then I trust that this Government, intent on making their name in a short time and comprised, as they are, of &ldquo;a temporary little arrangement&rdquo;, will see to it that the call of Deputy Yates and the Fine Gael Party for a ten-year funding programme to develop and maintain the rail system, is put into operation immediately.</P>

Tá súil agam gur mar sin a leanfaidh sé, agus ar ndóigh bheinn ag súil go mbeadh díospóireacht bhreá, bhríomhar idir an bheirt againn ar chúrsaí iompair.</P>
    <P>At the outset I wish to take this opportunity to categorically reject allegations that the Government have a hidden agenda to close down the railway network, or any part of it, by stealth or through deliberate lack of financial support. Nothing could be further from the truth and such allegations are clearly contrary to all the facts.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I find the motion in the name of Deputy Yates particularly ironic in view of the policy towards the railway adopted by his party when in Government and encapsulated in the document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> page 62, paragraph 343, which states:</P>
    <P>A package of retrenchment measures will be implemented on the passenger rail side; this will not affect the existing carriage replacement programme but will mean that there will be no new substantial investments in railways and there will be strict cash limits on other expenditures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Fine Gael Party's about-turn on railway policy as enunciated here this evening.</P>
    <P>The level of Exchequer support towards the railways over the years has been very substantial.  Total direct State support to the railways amounted to over £940 million between 1980 and 1991.  In addition, capital investment of almost £230 million was made by CIE in the railway network over the same period. The Exchequer subvention to CIE for 1992 amounts to £108 million of which £90 million is being allocated to Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>Of the £90 million which will be received by the railways this year, £45 million will go to the maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure, that is to say the trackwork, signalling, stations, bridges and so on &mdash; the physical basis on which railway services are operated. <Col N="1358" /> The other £45 million will go to support the operation of socially necessary services which cannot operate on a fully commercial basis, and to make interest and other exceptional payments, including £10 million in respect of interest on the loans taken out to finance the development of the DART system.  I should add that, apart from the DART interest, the deployment of the Exchequer support is a matter for CIE and Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Public Capital Programme for 1992 provides for capital expenditure of £17.8 million by Irish Rail on investment in new rolling stock, signalling equipment and other essential rail related infrastructure, including projects which qualify for funding under the Operational Programme on Peripherality.  Again, the allocation of these resources to specific programmes and projects is a matter for Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>When viewed against the severe financial constraints on the Exchequer in recent years, the level of State support which has been, and continues to be, provided to the railways is clear and incontrovertible evidence of the Government's commitment to the railway network.</P>
    <P>The financial situation which faced this country in 1987 required resolute action and difficult decisions on reducing public expenditure.  Public transport, in common with other sectors has had to bear the impact of reduced availability of Exchequer funding.  In these circumstances it has been necessary for Iarnród Éireann to cut their cloth according to measure and to seek economies wherever possible.  Indeed, I welcome this opportunity to commend Iarnród Éireann on their performance in recent years, which have seen passenger and freight volumes increase.  For example, in 1990, the company recorded over 25 million passenger journeys &mdash; the largest number of passenger journeys recorded since rail services were first introduced in Ireland.  In addition, productivity and output per employee has increased by 10 per cent since 1987.</P>
    <P>However, it is now over ten years since <Col N="1359" /> the last major review of the rail network, which was the McKinsey report of 1980. Since then there has been a resurgence of interest in the railways, particularly in Europe with the development of new technology and a recognition of the valuable role which the railways can perform in terms of reducing road congestion, more efficient movement of people and goods and preservation of the quality of the environment.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is generally accepted that significant investment requirements in railway plant and equipment will arise in the coming years.  It was against this background that my predecessor informed Dáil Éireann last December that in the light of the level of support for the railways since 1980, and the substantial future investment requirements for the system an urgent strategic study of the future investment needs and resources required for the rail network is being undertaken.  This study is being carried out at present by CIE in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Finance.  As a first step, the study will address all the major issues including the options for the future of the railway network, and the costs, investment requirements and funding possibilities in relation to all these options.  I have requested that this study be completed as soon as possible.  Once this work has been completed, I will consider whether any further work, either by way of the appointment of a railway commission, engagement of consultants, or some combination of both, is desirable before bringing the matter before the Government.</P>
    <P>The results of the strategic study will form an integral element in the formulation of an investment programme for the railway.  I intend to pursue the possibilities of EC assistance from the Structural Funds and the proposed Cohesion Fund for such an investment programme. This should not be interpreted as an either-or situation involving diversion of funding from roads investment.  Roads are an essential part of proper transport planning.  However, I am determined to <Col N="1360" /> ensure that public transport receives a significantly greater share of EC funds for investment than in the past.</P>
    <P>Major public transport infrastructure improvements take a considerable time to plan, finance and implement.  The current Operational Programme on Peripherality focuses largely on the roads network.  Deputies will recall that, when the programme was being prepared during the late eighties there was a great deal of public concern about the condition of the roads network and it was clear that very significant investment in roads was a necessary priority.  Much has already been done to improve our roads network and, further major investment is needed.  Clearly, however, the time has now come to raise the profile of public transport in terms of EC funding &mdash; not least because such investment also helps to secure full value from the roads network by preventing congestion.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that public transport is not being ignored under the current operational programme.  There are a number of major public transport projects under consideration by my Department in conjunction with the EC authorities, for ERDF assistance under the current Operational Programme on Peripherality.  These projects include the provision of a commuter rail link on the south west rail corridor &mdash; including Clondalkin &mdash; upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast rail line, some work on the restoration of the Harcourt Street line and the development of a rail link to the Belview Harbour development at Waterford. The development of commuter rail services on the Maynooth line has already been completed, involving the opening of four new stations, while work on the replacement of freight gantry cranes at Limerick, Sligo, Cork and Dundalk stations has already commenced.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on these projects between now and the end of the existing operational programme will be sufficient to secure a full drawdown of the ERDF allocation for public transport projects available under the Operational Programme on Peripherality.  If any savings arise elsewhere on the operational programme <Col N="1361" /> it may be possible to divert such savings to work on mainline track renewal.  My Department will continue to monitor the programme with that possibility in mind.</P>
    <P>I should mention also at this point that the Government have approved investment by CIE of up to £18 million in 17 new railcars for use on suburban lines. This investment will enable Irish Rail to improve the quality of their suburban commuter rail services.  The expenditure will be funded entirely by CIE from a combination of their own resources and commercial borrowings.  I understand that a contract for the new railcars will be placed shortly and that delivery of the new rolling stock is expected by early 1994.  The new railcars will be introduced into operational service shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment recently, including this evening, about the safety of the rail network arising from a confidential report jointly commissioned recently by my predecessor and the Chairman of CIE.  I want to avail of this opportunity to again emphasise to the House that the consultants have concluded that the railway is being operated to an acceptable level of safety. However, their report also includes a number of recommendations for action to improve safety standards in Irish Rail. The majority of the recommendations relate to more vigorous application of rules and regulations, training and improved work practices.  I am advised by the Chairman of CIE that implementation of the report's recommendations is already in hands.</P>
    <P>The Chairman has also assured me that safety continues to be Irish Rail's main priority and will not be compromised. He has also stated that the company are continuously striving, as a matter of policy, to improve the quality of service and standards of safety on the railway. In this regard, I have been informed by Irish Rail that every mile of track on the rail network is inspected at least twice weekly.  Any defects found on inspection are reported and arrangements are made for their immediate repair.  Maintenance <Col N="1362" /> personnel are located strategically throughout the rail network for this purpose. The chairman has confirmed to me that Irish Rail at all times operates services on a basis designed to ensure optimum safety standards.  In addition, I have been assured by the chairman of CIE that Irish Rail have detailed and extensive procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of railway services at all times, as required under the Transport Act, 1950 and other relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the concern of the people of the midlands and the west generally about the future of the rail network in these regions.  Again, I am happy to confirm that there are no proposals before myself or my Department for the closure of any rail lines including those in the west.  I have been advised by the Chairman of CIE that following a review of their track renewal programme earlier last year Irish Rail deferred some elements of work on the Mullingar-Sligo segment of the Dublin-Sligo line.  This resulted in some speed restrictions being applied to some sections of the line.  The distance of line where these speed restrictions apply varies between half a mile and one mile.  These restrictions have added ten to 15 minutes to the journey time between Dublin and Sligo.  The Chairman of CIE has informed me that maintenance on the line is continuing and that Irish Rail will be spending £2 million this year on track renewal on the line.</P>
    <P>As regards the future of the railway, I wish to emphasise that I see an important role for rail services in the development of any future investment strategy for public transport in Ireland.  We must be conscious of the importance of the railway in European terms, notwithstanding the geographic and demographic differences between Ireland and the European mainland.  There is much to be learned from the European approach where plans are already well advanced for the development of a trans-Community high speed rail network and a trans-Community combined transport &mdash; i.e. road and rail &mdash; network.  Ireland has been availing of the opportunity presented by these developments to <Col N="1363" /> emphasise the importance of the rail network for us and the need for investment assistance from the EC to help develop our network.  I will be continuing to strongly endorse this approach in the context of discussions with the EC authorities both in relation to future Structural Funds and in connection with the Cohesion Fund which, as Deputies will be aware, was agreed under the Maastricht Treaty to provide assistance specifically to environmental and transport projects in the four peripheral member states &mdash; Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland.  It is possible that this fund may come onstream as early as 1993.  I am determined to do everything possible to secure the maximum possible assistance under both the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to help put in place a modern public transport network which should see us well into the next century.</P>
    <P>The proposal for the development of a national roads and rail authority has already been dealt with recently in detail by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, in the context of the Second Stage debate on the Roads Bill, 1991.  I understand that Deputy Yates indicated during the debate that he would be tabling Committee Stage amendments to convert the National Roads Authority into a national roads and rail authority.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage debate on the Roads Bill will, no doubt, provide an opportunity to discuss the implications of this proposal in detail.  Therefore, I will confine my comments at this point to a general response.  I am not at all convinced of the merits of this proposal. The purpose of establishing the National Roads Authority is to provide a single purpose organisation to get on with the task of urgently developing the national roads network.  The National Roads Authority will have a full brief in co-ordinating and providing a single focus for over 30 local authorities which currently have responsibility for national roads.</P>
    <P>We already have a single organisation responsible for railways.  I am not convinced <Col N="1364" /> there would be any advantage to be gained from a transfer of railway responsibilities to a road and rail authority.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I share the view recently expressed by the Taoiseach in reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Yates, that the key to the coherent implementation of Government transport policy is co-ordination.  Rejigging the allocation of functions may solve one set of problems only to create another. Assigning road and rail functions to one authority, in the view of Fine Gael, might solve some problems.  Unfortunately, it could also make it more difficult to pursue a coherent public transport policy.  There could also be a downside for national roads, diverting the proposed National Roads Authority from their single-purpose mandate to get our national roads into shape.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I urge the House to support the Government amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Yates has greater commitment to the national scene than his colleague Deputy Nealon who is fighting his corner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a very constructive discussion of this overall topic to date.  We must remember that the future of our rail network is of vital importance to the country generally.  I believe also that the Minister's commitment, spelled out here a few minutes ago, will be enormously important in future years, in that there are current discussions in Europe of a whole range of funding relating to transport costs in particular.  We carry more than our fair share since our average transport costs constitute 9 per cent of <Col N="1365" /> total product cost as compared with 4.5 per cent in the case of our European counterparts.  It is in an attempt to reduce those costs somewhat that the Government, and in particular the Minister, are studying all aspects of transportation of merchandise and passengers.</P>
    <P>I like the Minister's balanced approach, particularly looking to the future and at the European scene, at what is taking place there, ascertaining what we can learn from that.  It must be acknowledged that major mistakes have been made in regard to rail, rail design and programming.  Major changes are taking place, some occasioned by the advent of the Channel Tunnel in the provision of cargo villages and so on.  I welcome the Minister's approach which is not one of jumping in blindly and saying: Let us spend £300 million or £400 million. Rather this study being undertaken will be of enormous importance to the future of our economy.</P>
    <P>Any discussion on the rail system or on the road network will have to centre on the availability of finance. If we are to bring our transport system up to date major investment is required.  We must recognise the honest commitment of the Government when we discuss this type of funding and service.  Deputy Yates referred to welded rail and proposed spending about £240 million.  Welded rail is not a new thing.  It is fairly common and the general public are aware of it. Credibility and commitment are a factor in discussing huge sums of money.  In write-ups Deputy Yates still gets credit for being one of the architects of <i>Building on Reality</i> in which it is stated that a package of retrenchment measures would be implemented on the passenger rail side and that this would not affect the existing carriage replacement programme but would mean that there would not be any substantial investment in railways and strict cash limits on other expenditures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What year was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was Deputy <Col N="1366" /> Yates's programme when he was in power and only a moment ago he proposed spending £240 million.  There is a credibility gap there.  The approach of the present Minister is more credible. She is willing to look at the European scene and what is happening there and she will look for money from Europe when we are ready, when we know what we want.  In the past money was spent on projects that turned out to be white elephants.  We do not want a repeat of it. We need a study.  It is difficult to combine all transport services.  It is ten years since the whole transport area has been looked at properly.  We should not leap forward blindly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates said that despite funding given to Iarnród Éireann their figures have increased magnificently.  It has proved that there was perhaps a need to trim sales in certain areas.  A greater turnover of passenger numbers was achieved with what is available.  Iarnród Éireann also have to earn their credibility and they are doing it magnificently.  The DART service has been a great success. That is the sort of programme we need. We should look at the national scene and get away from Sligo and local services like that.  The Minister has identified four areas in which she is working with a view to providing major transport projects. That is what we want.</P>
      <P>The Government's target is to double tourism figures.  This will happen with the advent of a radically changed rail system. The change will come in a programmed, consructive fashion.  It will not come about by somebody throwing a suggestion into the Dáil Chamber without professional back-up except the technical back-up of a reporter from <i>The Sligo Tribune</i> or something like that.  We are committed to carefully husbanding public funding and we have a commitment to go to Europe.  Future investment will come largely from European funding but it will only come with the aid of a careful, positive programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who worked in the placing and replacement of the equivalent rail tracks for cranes, I worry about the throw-away remark that the railway was <Col N="1367" /> not absolutely safe.  The chairman of the company commented that here we were talking about work practices and areas that do not need large expenditure. Deputies should not make remarks which would worry passengers using the service. Iarnród Éireann are doing a magnificent job and they deserve our support. Deputy Yates said that Fine Gael believed in value for money.  How could the Deputy expect to get value for money as a result of top-of-the-head proposals and throw-away remarks?  We need the careful, constructive approach of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Many of the items required such as carriages are being bought in.  This is being done to a large extent within company budgets and not just by subvention requiring the taxpayer to put up another £100 million.</P>
    <P>A while ago people were talking as if no funding was going to the railways. Total direct State funding to the railways amounted to £940 million between 1980 and 1991.  That is a lot of money by anybody's reckoning.  The money needed is being given.  As a semi-State employee for many years I know that State and semi-State companies do the job where possible.  I do not believe in wasting money.  We have now got to a point where Iarnród Éireann are using money to the best advantage.  The increase in passenger numbers is proof of that.</P>
    <P>This debate has given the Minister an ideal opportunity to nip in the bud the suggestion that there will be rail closures. The Minister categorically stated that there will be no closures.  There has been mischiefmaking with regard to the Sligo line.  People have been worried because they are in a fairly isolated area and the rail service is the only main transport they have.  I am delighted that the Minister has used this opportunity to assure us that there will be no closures.</P>
    <P>This is my first opportunity to support the new Minister in any of her proposals. The amendment is ideal.  A strategic study is what is needed.  I fully support it and I recommend the amendment to the House for adoption.</P>

      <P>I preface my remarks by extending a hearty welcome to the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in her new portfolio, an important one in which we are all interested.  The Labour Party support this Private Members' motion proposed by Deputy Yates.  We in the Labour Party have a long tradition of commitment to the principle of a proper and efficient public transport service. The reasons for this are generally well recognised.  Such a public transport system provides equal access and mobility and is used by those who because of age, health or income are prevented from driving private cars.  Rail transport is the least polluting mode of transport and is environment friendly. Indeed, Iarnród Éireann have an excellent tradition of safety.  We have a deep interest in those factors.</P>
      <P>The importance of the Private Members' motion &mdash; and it has not come a day too soon &mdash; is that it focuses on the urgency and necessity of bringing our rail service up to an efficient standard.  At this time &mdash; I am sure the Minister is aware of this through her contacts with staff at all levels of administration and maintenance &mdash; there is real concern that the existing engines and carriages are being driven into the ground because of the inadequate system of replacement.  It was really worrying to hear the Minister say that although the decision to purchase new rail cars had been taken and the order placed, they will not be delivered until 1994.  The existing rolling stock will have to travel millions of miles in servicing the travelling community.  That is a matter of great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sligo rail line was mentioned already tonight.  The reality is that if information on the serious situation of the line were not coming from the board of management the Sligo people may not <Col N="1369" /> have activated themselves to demand that the Minister and the Government recognise the serious condition of the line and eventually Sligo would have been left without a rail link.  When maintenance work on the line had been reduced to the extent that the speed of trains had to be controlled, that acted as a deterrent to the growth of passenger numbers and the consequent growth in revenue.  I am pleased to note that a decision has been taken to properly restructure and maintain the rail link from Dublin to Sligo.</P>
    <P>We have problems in Kerry also. Doubts and concern have been expressed over a period about the future of the Mallow-Tralee line.  Part of the rail line has been welded, but that operation was suspended.  This creates doubts as to whether Iarnród Éireann have in mind a real and permanent future for that section of the rail network.  I hope they have because any attempt to downgrade that section of the line would have disastrous consequences for the business and commercial communities and the tourism potential of the area.  The people of Kerry do not forget.  In the mid-fifties a decision was made and implemented to close three branch lines: the Headford-Kenmare line; the Farranfore-Caherciveen line and the Tralee-Dingle line, which served very isolated communities. When we look back at those closures we regret that not only was the rail service suspended but the decision was taken to lift the railway tracks.  Had they been left in place they could now be used for the benefit of the community and used for tourist drives and such activities.</P>
    <P>The retention of every mile of existing railway network is absolutely essential for our status, and our commercial and tourism life.  Many counties have suffered as Kerry did &mdash; Cork, Clare and the western counties.  The backbone of the railway line should be maintained with vigour and determination and the necessary moneys should be expended on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated she proposes to seek advice and commission a study on the rail service.  At this time it is an urgent necessity to replace the depleted rolling stock.  That is absolutely essential.  Many <Col N="1370" /> trains leaving Dublin on Fridays for the west or south do not have catering facilities. This discourages many people from using the rail service.</P>
    <P>Having met with people I tabled a question asking the Minister to arrange with Iarnród Éireann to have a ramp at all railway stations in order to cater for wheelchair users.  We have all seen that people in wheelchairs have to be physically taken from the chair and put onto the railway carriage.  We believe that should not be necessary.  It would be a simple matter to have a mobile ramp at each of the principal railway stations to cater for the handicapped persons requiring a wheelchair so that they would no longer need to be taken physically from their chair and put onto the railway carriage.  This would demonstrate that our rail line agency were conscious of the needs and problems of all travellers, not only the physically fit.</P>
    <P>We support the call for an intensive ten-year plan for the rail service. However, at the outset it is essential that much of the existing rolling stock is restored.  Let me impress on the Minister that it can take a long time for studies and reports to be finalised but the urgent requirement is for rolling stock and engines so that the level of service that operates on the principal lines can be maintained without further deterioration. The staff are concerned that a deterioration will take place unless there is a relatively early replacement of engines and carriages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague in extending best wishes to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on her appointment as Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  I had the opportunity to address questions to her as Minister for Communications but our exchange was more confrontational than it has been tonight.  The task facing the Minister is indeed a daunting one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to some aspects of the Minister's speech.  Expenditure between 1980 and 1991 amounted to £940 million. That must be considered in the context of what has been spent on the road network. <Col N="1371" /> Has a comparison been made of the capitation cost per passenger as between those who travel by road and those who travel by rail?  There is a substantial claw-back by way of tax and PRSI from rail employees.  There is also the plus factor represented by the tourists who use the railway system.  Taking account of all those factors we are getting good value for money, despite concern about the state of the permanent way.  The motion calls for welded track on the national rail network.  There are stretches of the permanent way where it is not safe to travel fast and efficiency falls because of the necessity to reduce speed.  I hope this matter will be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned a 10 per cent increase in productivity since 1987. In a situation where the plant is to a large degree antiquated and past its best days, it is quite significant that they have managed to achieve this increase in productivity. People have responded in an effort to ensure that the railways become more efficient, although I would imagine that there is some demoralisation due to the treatment they have received from successive Governments.  I regret that there was some argy bargy across the floor as to who was or was not responsible.</P>
    <P>Local issues are very important.  There is a certain affinity between people who use the network and the system itself. Prior to the closure of the Cork-Bandon line, every signal box, signal post and level crossing was freshly painted and in top working condition.  The case for its closure was presented on the basis of cost.  This was the greatest outrage of all time.  We had the same on the Macroom line and in west Cork.  I welcome the Minister's statement that there will be no further closures.  Concern has been expressed about the Cork-Cobh line, which is important for several reasons. It provides a commuter service between Cobh and Cork city.  A heritage centre is being built in Cobh which we hope will be a massive tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>Every train which travels to Cobh must stop at Fota Island which provides <Col N="1372" /> wonderful facilities.  The park there is a tremendous attraction.  If there is to be any resurgence in industry, particularly heavy industry, in the Cork Harbour region, it is essential that the Cobh line be maintained.  I am very happy at the Minister's assurance.  The Minister is fortunate in that tourism is also part of her brief, as well as Communications. She might tackle the problem with regard to the Youghal line and bring it back into service.  There is great tourism potential in east Cork.  Youghal was at one time the major attraction for people living in Cork city because there was a convenient and cheap method of transport for the 32-mile journey.  The manner in which the line has been allowed to run down is criminal.  I hope the Minister will address this problem in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>There are six points to this motion.  It calls on the Government to maximise EC funding and other funds and to construct a national network of continuous welded rail with automatic computerised signalling facilities.  The motion also calls on the Government to convert the National Roads Authority into a National Roads and Rail Authority and calls for an equality of infrastructural funding between road and rail services.  I compliment the Minister on her assurance that there will be an equality of funding.</P>
    <P>If there is a deficiency in the motion, which we are supporting, it is the absence of any mention of the bus service.  CIE came into existence because the services provided at that time wre not deemed to be adequate.  There were two or three rail companies in operation which were not profitable and the likelihood of their survival was very slim.  There was a multiplicity of small road transport companies which were not providing the service required by the public.  I cannot see why Deputy Yates does not mention the bus service in his motion.  There is a linkage between the rail and bus services because they are under the umbrella of CIE.  The bus company is now providing a service which in the past was provided by the railway companies.  The future of Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath should have been included in the motion.  Concern <Col N="1373" /> has been expressed by employees of the bus companies about deregulation. This is effectively the privatisation of the bus service.  The motion is praiseworthy and I welcome the expression of concern about the railway but we should have gone the whole way and addressed the total problem.</P>
    <P>Regarding the ten-year funding, the Minister and Deputy Dennehy have indicated that the bulk of this funding will come from Europe.  Many people are depending on EC Structural Funds and I hope the well does not run dry before we have the opportunity to tap that valuable source.  When the funds come on stream they must be used in a prudent manner. Deputy Yates envisages the Structural Funds being used to provide automatic computerised signalling facilities.  If that will make the system safer, by all means let us have it, but by far the most important factor is the rolling stock replacement. I welcome the provision of 17 rail cars but these are to be used on suburban lines.  People who travel on the main lines complain about the poor quality of the rolling stock.  I regret that the total funding is going to the suburban lines.  The person who has to travel a distance will suffer the greatest inconvenience because many of the carriages are out of date and are not properly heated.  They can be most uncomfortable in the summertime due to lack of proper ventilation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fennell has given notice to the Chair of her intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of breast implants and if the Minister for Health will indicate his Department's policy on breast implants in view of the US Food and Drugs Administration's findings.

      <P>As this is my first time to meet the new Minister for Health I <Col N="1374" /> wish to congratulate him and wish him well in this very difficult time and in a very difficult Ministry.  The question of breast implants has been ongoing for some months and originated with the decision of the US Food and Drugs Administration to suspend the use of silicone gel breast implants because of reported difficulties by some women and a number of court cases taken because of these difficulties.  Many of the difficulties occurred many years after the operation. Silicone gel implants have been used for almost 30 years and are used for both cosmetic surgery, to enlarge the breast size, and for rebuilding breasts after mastectomy due to breast cancer.  I have no statistics on the use of silicone gel in Ireland or the reasons for breast implant surgery.</P>
      <P>In the US where one million women had implants, 80 per cent were for cosmetic reasons and 20 per cent resulted from breast cancer.  Of the 6,000 British women who have had implants the majority were for reconstruction after necessary surgery.  The use of silicone was suspended by the United States Food and Drugs Administration when it was feared that seepage of the gel into the breast could cause a range of auto immune diseases, including one which is fatal.  Now the suspension has been lifted in the US, but not totally after a thorough investigation.  Last month the use of silicone gel was approved in strictly limited and closely monitored cases.  In the UK it appears there is a similar limited use.  I would like to know how many Irish women have had breast implants over the years and for what reasons.  Can the Minister ascertain if breast implants are safe?  Should they be used for any purpose? Can women with implants which would have been inserted some years ago feel confident that there is no danger to them?  I believe it is important to reassure women on this matter.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank the Deputy for her kind words and let us hope they will be prophetic words.  I am very glad the Deputy has afforded me an opportunity <Col N="1375" /> to clarify the position in relation to silicone gel breast implants.  As the Deputy said, the United States Food and Drugs Administration in January of this year requested a panel of medical experts &mdash; the general and plastic surgery devices panel &mdash; to investigate the possible health risks associated with silicone gel in breast implant operations.  Pending the outcome of this investigation the food and drugs administration recommended a suspension of silicone gel implants in breast implant operations.  Plastic surgeons here in Ireland suspended the use of silicone gel breast implants until the United States review had been completed.</P>
      <P>I understand that the general and plastic surgery devices panel unanimously recommended to the Food and drugs administration last week that silicone gel breast implants should be confined to women who require breast reconstruction and that limited trials should take place to study women who choose the implants for cosmetic purposes.  In making their recommendations, the panel indicated that there was a special medical need for women with breast cancer, and certain other conditions to have access to breast implants under clinical protocols while expressing a concern about the risks represented by these implants.  While the panel considered the possible link between certain immune-related or connected tissue disorders and the implants, the panel indicated that there was insufficient data to reach a conclusion on this matter.</P>
      <P>The current position is that while the food and drugs administration are not bound to accept the panel's recommendations they will be carefully considered by the food and drugs administration in reaching a final decision which is expected to be announced by 20 April of this year.  My Department are monitoring the situation and will study the final recommendations of the food and drugs administration when they become available.  In the meantime, I understand plastic surgeons in Ireland are continuing to suspend the use of silicone gel in breast implant operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> I wish to inform the Deputy that the use of implants in Ireland dates back over 20 years.  The Eastern Health Board provided them free of charge to women with medical card entitlements under the provisions of the Health Act, for cosmetic purposes.  I remember writing about them at the time and I must confess I did not agree with them.  I should also inform the Deputy that for other EC countries the moratorium has been as follows: the United Kingdom has indicated there is no basis for advising a general change in practice in the UK pending consideration of the advice.  The decision on whether the patient should have surgery should remain with the medical adviser; in Holland the approach has been similar to that of the United Kingdom; Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Greece have examined the matter and have decided to take no action in relation to it; in Spain a political decision was taken to prohibit the marketing and use of silicone gel implants; in France a working party was set up to examine the matter and they are expected to give their conclusions shortly; in Italy the use of silicone gel breast implants has been suspended for 90 days; Portugal are awaiting the results of the food and drugs administrations review and in the meantime surgeons will make their own decisions in regard to their patients.  There has been a different response in each of the EFTA countries.  In Austria a moratorium, similar to that recommended by the United States Food and Drugs Administration has been put in place.  In Ireland, silicone gel breast implants have been voluntarily suspended pending the full review of the United States Food and Drugs Administration.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have information on the number of implants which have been carried out in Ireland since they were first introduced but I will ask my Department if we can get any information and, if so, I will be glad to give it to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne has been given permission to raise the matter of the delay in allowing work to commence on the sewerage scheme in Muine Bheag, County Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Teachta Wallace as ucht bheith tofa in a Aire Stáit.  Tá siúl agam go mbeidh saol taitneamhach, tairbheach aige in a phost nua, ach ní saol fada mar ní bheadh sé sin oiriúnach dúinn sa bhFreasúsa.</P>
      <P>I am very greatful for the opportunity to raise this serious matter in relation to Muine Bheag sewerage scheme.  We live in an era where day after day new regulations regarding pollution are being sent out by the Department of the Environment. For many private individuals it can be quite expensive to fulfil these regulations in order to avoid prosecution. Therefore, what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  In the case of the Department of the Environment they should not ignore their own regulations.  That is why I suggest that the delay in giving the go-ahead to this scheme should be a source of serious embarrassment to the Department who tell everybody else how to behave.  In this context I should say that county councils are often accused of being polluters and even if this happens to be true it is grossly unfair since the Department of the Environment provide the money to ensure that work can go ahead to maintain proper standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Muine Bheag is a town with a population in excess of 3,000 people and is at present, going through a very difficult time because of the overloading of septic tanks designed decades ago to accommodate hundreds and not thousands of people.  This is of serious consequence considering that the beautiful River Barrow flows by the town and any overflow of raw sewage, because of the overloading of the septic tanks, is indefensible.  The blame rests squarely with the Department of the Environment. <Col N="1378" /> On 19 April next, it will be eight years since the Department officially acknowledged the necessity to provide this treatment plant.  Long and tedious work was undertaken to get to the stage where on 7 May 1991 tenders were accepted by the county council and submitted to the Department.  Since then the county council officials have waited for clearance while taking the flack for the Department officials and this is the Department who set the standard in controlling pollution right across the country.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair eight months after a company made an offer to do work for a given price that they are still expected to have their workforce on hand when it suits the Department of the Environment to call on them.  This must indirectly lead to higher costs for the Department because what company can afford to keep on staff in the hope that at some date in the future they will get the go-ahead to do the work?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State in his reply will give me a date on which this work will start.  It will be to his Department's advantage to avoid being accused of gross hypocrisy in seeing the pollution in his brother's eye while failing to see the mote in his own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks and good wishes and for his offer of support to me and my Department in the future.  I fully subscribe to the view that the sanitary services programme plays a major role in meeting the needs of communities throughout the country and in the protection and improvement of our environment. Adequate supplies of pure and wholesome water and acceptable levels for the disposal of sewage and water borne waste are a vital objective of the Government's environmental action programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1989 over £277 million has been invested by the State in the water and sanitary services programme.  This year there is a capital provision of £72.5 million which at a time of overall budgetary <Col N="1379" /> difficulties is evidence of the Government's continued commitment to the development of the services involved. Considerable progress has been made in bringing new and improved water and sanitary services to County Carlow.</P>
    <P>In regard to Muine Bheag, I understand that the existing treatment and collection systems are overloaded and that the proposed sewerage scheme provides for an improved sewerage scheme network, pumping stations and treatment works with effluent receiving full secondary treatment before discharge into the River Barrow.  Approval of the contract documents for this scheme issued from my Department in April 1990.  Tender recommendations for a number of contracts, including civil works, pumping plant and sludge dewatering plant have been submitted by Carlow County Council.  The need for the Muine Bheag scheme has been established and a decision on the council's tender recommendations is being considered having regard to the existing level of commitments under the water and sanitary services programme as a whole.</P>
    <P>I expect the water and sanitary services capital allocations to local authorities for 1992 will be finalised very shortly.  In addition to meeting the very demanding requirements of the existing construction programme the scope for approving tenders for new schemes will be considered. I can assure the Deputy that the Muine Bheag sewerage scheme will form part of this examination and I will let the Deputy know the outcome at that stage.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Browne in wishing the Ministers well.  I wish to discuss with the Minister of State a very bizzare case.  It concerns a young lady who reported for her driving test at the appointed time.  The driving tester inspected her car and decided that the insurance disc displayed on the windscreen which had faded was illegible.  The young lady then produced her insurance <Col N="1380" /> policy to verify that she was insured but the tester refused to countenance this and promptly failed her.  She has now been forced to reapply for a new test and pay for it.</P>
      <P>I request the Minister of State to do two things: first, to offer this young lady a new test at no additional cost given the trivial nature of this matter and, second, to investigate the matter to see if this silly decision was made on a number of occasions, perhaps by this tester, and caused other people who had applied for tests some distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The road traffic insurance disc regulations, 1984 provide that the insurance disc required to be exhibited under the regulations shall not be exhibited where the figures or particulars are illegible or where the colour has been altered by fading or otherwise. This requirement is brought to the attention of all driving test applicants in the appointment notice which issues.  The notice also states clearly that unless the requirement is met the test will not be conducted.  In these circumstances I can take no action in the case mentioned by the Deputy.  I should add that faded insurance discs are replaced without charge by the insurance company concerned.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his well deserved promotion and wish him every success.  As a Deputy, I travel a great deal through Sligo and Leitrim.  In the whole area I know of no more dangerous junction than where Cairns Road meets Pearse Road on the approach to Sligo town and unless traffic lights are provided a serious accident is inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this hazard the absence of traffic lights results in a regular back-up of traffic on Cairns Road even at the slackest times of the day.  The trouble is that Pearse Road is exceptionally busy and long straights on both sides of the <Col N="1381" /> junction means that traffic moves at considerable speed with very few gaps. Surely this is a junction which qualifies for traffic lights under all criteria &mdash; traffic volume, vehicular directional counts, vehicle speeds, accident records and sight conditions.  Despite long agitation and a continuously worsening position we have no traffic lights.</P>
    <P>I am aware that until recently there were no written proposals for traffic lights from Sligo Corporation with the Department of the Environment.  In that respect I have to accept that to a certain extent we may have been barking up the wrong tree.  I hope the Minister of State will now be in a position to tell the House that the Department are approving the traffic lights for Cairns Road and Pearse Road in Sligo and providing a 100 per cent grant for the work as Pearse Road, the N4 is a national road.  Unless he does this, sadly but inevitably there will be a serious accident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of traffic lights is a matter for the local authority concerned acting at the request of or with the consent of the Garda Commissioner. I understand that discussions are under way between Sligo Corporation and the Garda Commissioner on the need for traffic lights at this location.  Sligo Corporation have submitted proposals in this regard to my Department and have applied for a grant to carry out the works. These proposals are the subject of the discussions between Sligo Corporation and my Department and the corporation have been asked to submit a revised estimate of the cost.  Traffic lights provided on national roads with the Minister's approval qualify for 100 per cent grants.</P>
      <P>I expect the local authorities will be notified shortly of their road grant allocations for 1992.  Pending the determination of these grants I cannot comment on the possibility of an allocation for any particular project.</P>

      <P>The people of Callan, County Kilkenny, are getting deeply impatient and frustrated at Government inaction in relation to the need to provide <Col N="1382" /> a by-pass for their town.  In 1989, there was a great sigh of relief in the area when the Minister for the Environment included this project as part of the operational programme on transport, 1989-93, so that EC funding could be procured for this important project. However it appears that promises have yet to be fulfilled.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment asked Kilkenny County Council to draw up a road design which was submitted for approval in March 1991.  However, following the local elections in June 1991 the pace has slowed considerably as has traffic through Callan.  At that time Government politicians were tripping over one another in a disgraceful fashion to announce that work was about to proceed. However, the necessary approval for the compulsory purchase of land was the subject of a public inquiry last November, but the Minister has still not made up his mind whether he will accept the proposal.  It is not good enough for the people of Callan; in fact, the town effectively comes to a standstill at Bridge Street when two trucks meet.</P>
      <P>The trucks going from Waterford to Dublin travel through Callan now because they will not encounter difficult railway bridges which are on the more traditional route between Waterford and Kilkenny.  Traffic from west Waterford and Clonmel bound for Dublin use the Callan route, particularly since the completion of the Kilkenny ring road 12 years ago.  It is not unusual to experience up to an hour's delay in traffic at Callan with the passage of this heavy traffic through the town.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the county council, Councillor Tom Maher, is a local man, he is attempting to keep the lid on the issue and to keep the anger of the people at bay.  He is succeeding, to a limited extent, in this regard.  However, the residents of Callan, especially those living in Bridge Street, have had enough and nothing short of an announcement that work will proceed in 1992 will satisfy the people of the area and Kilkenny County Council.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>A decision in relation to the order will be made as soon as possible.  However, because of the Minister's quasi-judicial function in the determination of the order, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the scheme at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to a serious problem of the long waiting lists for orthodontic treatment for young schoolgoing children.  This has been a major problem for many years.  I appreciate that the Government over the past number of years have invested in the region of £6 million to try to alleviate the problem.  Unfortunately, it has not done so and I understand that one consultant orthodontist was appointed late last year. However, that is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list is growing rapidly; many children leave primary school without having had the opportunity to receive treatment. I am sure the Minister is fully aware of the problems and difficulties to which I refer.  While I appreciate and understand that the Minister's predecessor endeavoured to alleviate the problem, unfortunately a solution has not been found. In my constituency I am aware that literally a couple of thousand schoolgoing children have been awaiting treatment for years and, as I said, many of them leave school without it.  The Minister has a responsibility in this regard and it is up to him to resolve the problem through the Eastern Health Board.  Something <Col N="1384" /> must be done very soon to tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>In 1990 and 1991 the Government made available a special additional allocation of £3 million specifically for the development of adult dental and orthodontic services because of the high priority which they attach to these services.</P>
      <P>The allocation by my Department to health boards for 1992 includes a repeat of the special provision in respect of the continuing development of dental services for adults and the improvement of orthodontic services.  Significant improvements have been made in the level of orthodontic services in the Dublin area as a result of the additional moneys made available to the Eastern Health Board.  In that area a total of about 2,250 children completed orthodontic treatment in 1990 and 3,660 children were undergoing orthodontic treatment at the end of 1991.</P>
      <P>Despite these significant improvements, waiting lists for treatment are still at an unacceptable level.  Following the resignation of the board's consultant orthodontist, they are now making arrangements with the Dublin Dental Hospital for two joint appointments of consultant orthodontists.  These appointments were recently advertised and when they are made it will considerably improve the service levels for orthondontic treatment provided by the board. The provision of necessary orthodontic treatment will continue to receive a high priority and I am keeping the position under regular review.</P>
      <P>I will examine the question of in-house training of dental surgeons in orthodontic treatment for which there is a growing demand, and the waiting list for which, as I said earlier, is at an unacceptable level.</P>

      <P>The Protocols on the statutes of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Monetary Institute, which are part of the new Treaty on European Union, provide that, before the end of 1992, decisions on the seats of the ECB and the EMI shall be taken by common accord of the Governments of the member states at the level of Heads of State or of Government.</P>
      <P>While there has been some public comment about possible locations for the ECB and the EMI, no formal proposals have yet been tabled in the appropriate fora, nor have these matters been discussed in any detail by the representatives of the member states.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the decisions in question are likely to be taken in the context of an overall agreement on the seats of a number of other Community bodies, the locations of which remain to be decided.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 39, 69 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies are, no doubt, aware that the degree of integration of the European Community at present cannot be compared with that which exists in a mature federation such as the US.  As the perception of common citizenship and shared responsibility which is an essential pre-condition for large-scale distribution of resources is not yet established in the Community, it would be premature, at this juncture, to be making proposals for increasing the financial resources base of the Community to a level appropriate to a federal union like the US.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> Irish policy in this area is directed at a progressive extension of the role of the Community budget.  The recent proposals in the Delors II package, which envisage an increase in the own resources of the Community from 1.2 per cent of Community GNP now to 1.37 per cent in 1997, are a step in this direction.</P>

      <P>I have absolutely no reason to believe that there was any breach in the strict confidentiality that has always characterised my Department's preparation of the <Col N="1082" /> budget measures and of the related budget documentation.  However, if the Deputy considers that he has any evidence to the contrary, I would ask that he place it in my hands, and I will see to it that it is immediately investigated.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I would point out that in the weeks before any budget there is always extensive speculation in the media about what it is likely to contain, and that since a wide range of options is covered in the speculation, some of the forecasts will inevitably be correct.  The 1992 budget was no exception, and I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the commitment in the reviewed <i>Programme for Government</i> that the tax reform programme would be carried out at no net cost to the Exchequer through &ldquo;...a systematic curtailment of the vast range of exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax rates on a phased basis...&rdquo; inevitably led to a particular focus in pre-budget speculations, this year, on the options for reducing or eliminating such reliefs.</P>

      <P>Third World agencies already enjoy a measure of VAT relief under the terms of VAT Refund Order No. 21.  This Order entitles non-profit making philanthropic organisations to reclaim the VAT paid on the purchase or import of goods which are exported for use in the organisation's humanitarian, charitable or teaching activities abroad.  There is no restriction on the type of goods which can benefit from this relief or the level of VAT which can be recovered.  I have no proposals, at present, to extend the scope of this scheme, nor do I propose to provide tax relief under the covenant scheme for contributions to such groups.  As well as being costly in themselves, any such concessions would be bound to lead to calls for similar treatment for charities working in Ireland who are doing equally important and praiseworthy work.  I <Col N="1083" /> would also remind the House that charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners, including those engaged in Third World relief work, enjoy wide ranging exemptions from most taxes here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I have examined the question of an amnesty of this kind, having regard to the advantages that could ensue for interest rates and tax revenues should it succeed in attracting back funds diverted outside the State in the past, in order to evade taxation.  That examination highlighted two major difficulties, such that the possibility of its being counterproductive in these terms has to be considered.  First, an amnesty confined to funds abroad would entail a substantial inducement to persons with undeclared funds within the State to transfer these abroad, in order to avail of such an amnesty.  Secondly, if the scope of the amnesty was wide enough to overcome the difficulty, it could prove a major impediment to the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners to tackle tax evasion and to collect outstanding arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the Government have no current plans to introduce such an amnesty.  Rather, the Revenue Commissioners will be given additional powers to help detect evasion.  I should point out that the feasibility of an <Col N="1084" /> amnesty does not hinge on the existence of the remaining exchange controls, which I intend to abolish by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>A total of some £7 million has been allocated and expended to date in carrying out the scheduled works of the Bonet catchment drainage scheme.  Works were suspended in January 1992 so that the only remaining expenditure to be incurred will be in respect of any additional fishery rehabilitation works which might arise and in the settlement of outstanding compensation claims which would be impossible to accurately assess at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 215 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criterion used in the identification of ASIs has been outlined in the reply to Question No. 115 answered on 12 December 1991.  The matter of compensation was dealt with in the replies to <Col N="1090" /> Question No. 66 and Question No. 198, answered on 19 November 1991, and 18 February 1992 respectively.</P>
    <P>Identification as an ASI does not in any way prevent or restrict the rights of people to sell their land so there is no question of compensation arising.</P>
    <P>There is a constant programme of survey and re-examination of ASIs and, as a result of such work, new areas may be identified, existing areas may be increased or indeed may be reduced or even eliminated altogether.  These changes arise from additional information in relation to the particular site or changes that have occurred to the site.</P>
    <P>It has not been the practice to notify landowners other than in response to inquiries.  This procedure has been reviewed by the Interdepartmental Committee on ASIs.  The report of this committee was delayed to await the outcome of a High Court action.  Judgment has been handed down by the High Court but has been appealed to the Supreme Court.  I have asked the Attorney General to assess the implications of the High Court judgment.  When this assessment has been completed, I will submit the report to the Government.  In the meantime no decision has been taken as to whether the report will be published.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 71, 77, 80 and 110, 119, 124 and 181 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 73b of the new Treaty on European <Col N="1092" /> Union signed by the representatives of member states on 7 February provides that &ldquo;all restrictions on movement of capital between member states and between member states and third countries shall be prohibited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware, however, that according to Article 73d, this provision is without prejudice to certain specific rights of member states, including their rights to continue to apply their own tax laws and to take all requisite measures to prevent infringements of national law and regulations, in particular in the field of taxation.  In view of this, the new Treaty should have no direct implications for Ireland's tax system.</P>
    <P>However, I recognise that, with full liberalisation, the potential for movement of capital, whether out of or into Ireland, will be significantly greater than in the past.  The nature, direction and scale of actual flows will, of course, depend on the interplay of the many factors which enter into the decisions of investors.  These include comparative interest rates, the rates of return on various investments, perceptions of exchange and other risks, the relative cost of funds as well as the position as regards taxation.  I am still considering all the possible consequences of the complete exchange liberalisation which will exist in relation to other member states from the end of this year.  In particular, as I indicated in my Budget Statement, the implications for future revenue from the deposit interest retention tax, and possible measures to deal with that situation, are under examination in my Department, and any necessary legislative changes will be provided for in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the Irish financial institutions, we have to accept that the creation of a single Community market will result in increased competition throughout the Community.  I am confident, however, that our financial institutions will respond positively to the challenges and opportunities offered by the Single Market.</P>

      <P>The tax code provides for a variety of penalties, including fines and prison sentences, for offences connected with tax evasion in whatever way it is carried out. These penalties apply generally including evasion through an offshore company.</P>
      <P>Sections 500 to 521 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provide for a range of monetary penalties for failure to make a return of income or profits or for fraudulently or negligently making a return. Also, section 94 of the Finance Act, 1983, defines a range of &ldquo;revenue offences&rdquo;, some of which would be committed where a person engages in tax evasion through an off-shore company.  Fines ranging up to £10,000 and prison sentences of up to five years may be imposed for such offences.  The defined offences include failure to supply information, failure to produce records or aiding and abetting such acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated clearly in my budget speech on 29 January, tax evasion is of concern to me and the Government. <Col N="1095" /> Considerable action has already been taken in recent years to tackle the problem. In the budget I announced new initiatives designed to ensure maximum use of the staff resources of the Revenue Commissioners in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming Finance Bill will contain a number of further measures to strengthen the hand of the Revenue in pursuit of tax evaders.  Their powers to seek information from taxpayers, their agents and third parties will be strengthened. Penalty provisions are also being reviewed.  Currently these issues are being considered in the context of the Finance Bill and I cannot at this time give details of any of the specific measures being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on current decisions and assumptions they estimate that about 604 jobs will be lost in Customs and Excise following the completion of the Internal Market on 1 January 1993. The impact of the Internal Market changes falls unevenly on Customs and Excise locations.  Understandably areas with a heavy customs preventive work element will suffer most.  The Revenue Commissioners recognise that the Dundalk area is in this category along with a number of other areas such as Waterford and Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners are endeavouring, with the co-operation of all the Civil Service unions, to find work for all the surplus <Col N="1096" /> staff in their present locations.  As I said in my budget speech, it is essential that the surplus Customs and Excise staff are used to the maximum in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance.  Full co-operation and flexibility will be required from the staff unions to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have outlined a wide range of proposals aimed at reducing the surplus figure.  Included in these proposals is the involvement of Customs and Excise staff in new areas of work which will arise post-1992 and which have the potential to provide substantial employment opportunities.  One such area involves the collection of Community Intrastat statistics and the VAT information exchange system.  The Government have already decided to give Revenue responsibility for this new work which will generate over 100 jobs. The commissioners have also made proposals to Government for a major role for Revenue in the administration of a new motor vehicle taxation system and the Government's decision on this matter will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>Pending the Government decision on motor vehicle taxation and the completion of the necessary negotiations with the unions concerned the commissioners have not yet decided where to locate the administrative centres for the new work areas in question.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the Dundalk areas, being one of the areas which has a particularly severe surplus staff problem, will be high on the list of priority locations for new work, or any other option, which will alleviate the problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee has been established chaired by an Assistant Secretary of my Department, to co-ordinate the views of the Departments concerned with the Delors II package.  It will ensure, through the interdepartmental committee on EC matters chaired by the Minister of State for European Affairs, that as the negotiations proceed Ireland's stance will be fully co-ordinated, that the Government will be kept informed of developments and any necessary Government decisions sought as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Government welcome the main thrust of the recent Commission proposals, which we regard as a good starting point for the negotiations. Our main concern will be to ensure that the ceiling on own resources will be adequate to cover the expenditure envisaged, in particular, the cost of <Col N="1099" /> reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, a substantial increase in the Structural Funds and a sizeable new Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>The extent of financial aid which will be available to Ireland clearly will depend on the outcome of the negotiations.  The Commission has proposed that there should be an increase of two-thirds in the resources made available to the Objective 1 regions through the Structural Funds and that, taking account of the new Cohesion Fund, there could be a doubling of the overall resources for the four countries covered by the new fund, i.e. Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 92, 104, 116, 125, 128 and 180 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> In 1986 the operations research section of my Department carried out with actuarial advice, an examination of the emerging cost of public service pensions. The examination showed that costs would not rise significantly during the following 25 years and that, while costs would rise significantly in the following 15 years, they would remain a relatively small proportion of total public expenditure.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of making &ldquo;adequate provisions&rdquo;, it is not clear what is in mind.  If it is being suggested that formal pension funds be created, my position would be that such funds would not be appropriate in the public service. A principal objective of funding is to provide a secure basis for the pensions of employees and they are therefore an appropriate mechanism in the private sector.  In the public service the necessary security is adequately met by the State's permanent and continuing commitment to discharge its obligations as they arise. In this connection, I would also point out that the general rule in other countries is that pay as you go is the financing system.</P>

      <P>In 1988 the Government introduced the tax clearance system in respect of grants, subsidies and similar type payments from State and public authorities.  The basic aim of this system is to ensure that individuals who benefit from public grants or subsidies have their tax affairs in order.</P>
      <P>As from 1 September 1991, the tax clearance system was extended to include all grants and subsidies over £500, other than payments under the guarantee section of FEOGA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of grants between £500 and <Col N="1102" /> £5,000 the applicant must indicate on his grant application the tax district dealing with his affairs, furnish his tax reference number and indicate that, to the best of his knowledge, his tax affairs are in order. In the case of grants of £5,000 or more the applicant is required to produce a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to increase the threshold of £500 above which the tax clearance procedures apply.  However, I am examining the procedures as they apply to applicants for headage payments who are also in receipt of certain means-tested social welfare payments and expect to make an announcement about this matter shortly.</P>

      <P>The increases in road tax announced in my budget speech will take effect from 1 April 1992 and will yield £27.5 million in 1992 and £36.7 million in a full year.  The additional revenue from these increases is being used to help fund a number of initiatives in relation to the motor trade including a reduction of the tax on petrol by about 9p per gallon from 1 May 1992, a reduction of the initial excise duty on cars up to 2012 cc from 21.7 per cent to 20 per cent and the abolition of the initial 6.5 per cent excise duty on certain commercial vehicles.  Quite apart from the <Col N="1103" /> beneficial effects for the motor trade and the savings for purchasers of new private cars and commercial vehicles, it has been calculated that for most motorists doing average annual mileage, the savings on petrol costs will cover the increased road tax payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The restoration of the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell Canal is being carried out under the powers conferred by the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990.  The works are being undertaken by the Electricity Supply Board who were delegated the functions of the commissioners in relation thereto by order of the Minister for Finance made pursuant to section 5 (9) of the Act.  The resolution of matters relating to the construction of the work is therefore a matter for the ESB and the landowners concerned.</P>
      <P>There are two elements of compensation to landowners, one relates to interference during construction work and this is being paid by the ESB.  The other relates to compensation for land compulsorily acquired.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are engaged in the compulsory acquisition of lands required in connection with the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compulsory purchase procedures prescribed in the Act have been followed in relation to three of the four sections into which the project has been divided and a number of claims for compensation in respect of the lands involved have been received from landowners concerned. These are being processed in accordance <Col N="1104" /> with the relevant provisions of the 1990 Act and other legislation pertinent to compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>In assessing the compensation payable to any person the Commissioners have regard to the market value of the land being acquired together with such other matters as severance, injurious affection and disturbance.  Any benefit to a holding arising out of the development must also be taken into account.  In this connection negotiations are ongoing with the various claimants, or their agents.  I am aware that farmer representatives have expressed disquiet at the level of compensation being offered for the land being acquired.  Indeed I have agreed to a request for a meeting to discuss the matter and I expect to meet with them later this week.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland that in dealing with the claims from landowners for compensation they are very concerned to ensure that the claimants are dealt with in a fair and reasonable manner, in particular that realistic settlement offers are made and that matters are processed expeditiously.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the commissioners many of the claims which have been submitted on behalf of the landowners are totally unrealistic and this is contributing to the difficulty of reaching settlement. The commissioners have had difficulty getting a breakdown of the amounts claimed but it would appear from the information that is available that there are large amounts included in them for elements which the commissioners do not consider to be justified.  The Deputies will be conscious that compensation payments have to be met from taxpayers' money and that the commissioners cannot settle cases at levels which they genuinely believe to be excessive.</P>
    <P>There are real and substantial differences of opinion between the claimants and the commissioners on aspects of the claims.  I hope these differences can be resolved in discussion between the two sides and I assure the Deputy that the commissioners will spare no effort in trying to reach agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> If, notwithstanding the best efforts of the commissioners, claimants are dissatisfied with either the amounts being offered or with the rate of progress of negotiations, it is open to them to have their cases referred to arbitration.  The provision for reference of cases to arbitration is available under the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, because of the concern to ensure that affected landowners would be dealt with fairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the budget measure on withdrawal of the exemption from corporation tax of certain trading profits of agricultural and fishery co-operatives from 1 April next, I do not consider that this will diminish their role in the rural economy.  The activity of processing farm products, other than for sale into intervention, will qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  As I explained in the budget speech, it is appropriate that the same taxation rules should apply to co-operatives as to other businesses.  The current exemption cuts across the creation of a level playing field in the domestic food processing sector and is inequitable in terms of competition <i>vis-à-vis</i> private traders in farming supplies who have to pay at the standard rate of corporation tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The withdrawal of the co-operatives' exemption as with other comparable <Col N="1106" /> budget measures must be seen in the context of the Government's commitment to tax reform as set out in last October's review of the Programme for Government, and also in the context of the continuing process of tax reform over recent years, which has seen the top rate of tax cut from 58 per cent to 48 per cent, the standard rate cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the standard rate band extended by nearly 60 per cent since 1987.  We now have a simpler, fairer and less onerous tax system, which will provide better incentives for work and enterprise and all businesses and all sectors will benefit from this development.</P>
    <P>It should also be stressed that the Government's approach, of extending the tax base by abolition/curtailment of special reliefs, has been recommended &mdash; and constantly urged on Government &mdash; by such bodies as the Commission on Taxation, the EC, the OECD and the National Economic and Social Council, and most recently by the Industrial Policy Review Group.</P>
    <P>In relation to the yield to the Exchequer arising from the withdrawal of the exemption, as set out in the Principal Features of 1992 Budget, this has been estimated at £1.5 million in 1992, and at £6 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind that the Houses of the Oireachtas should present its own Estimate to the Dáil.  A similar question was put on 11 December 1990 and the position has not changed in the interim.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept that any Department or Office should be exempted from the same constraints that apply to all other Departments and Offices.  All Estimates are considered by Government in the context of the economic and budgetary constraints to which the Government of the day must have regard.</P>

I can then take this response into account before the Government discussion on the Estimate.</P>

      <P>The Government are fully committed to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and to implementing the important social and economic policies contained in it.</P>
      <P>This commitment must, however, be tempered by the need to ensure that the programme's fiscal parameters are observed.  This was made clear in the programme itself which said that the aims of fiscal policy would continue to be the reduction of the national debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993 and as part of this to achieve broad balance on the current budget.  Fundamental to the achievement of these aims is continued firm control of our public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the budgetary circumstances facing us in 1992, it was simply not possible to implement all of the 1992 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> undertakings in full while at the same time achieving budgetary targets consistent with the programme.  It proved necessary, therefore, to defer or scale back some of the initiatives in the education area which were specifically intended to be introduced in full in 1992. <Col N="1110" /> Nonetheless, substantial elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> non-pay undertakings are being implemented this year.  I believe that in the end a fair balance was struck.  The core of the non-pay aspects of the programme was preserved while, at the same time, some elements were scaled down or deferred in recognition of the overriding need to protect the public finances.</P>
    <P>The 1992 commitments in relation to education which were intended to be implemented in 1992 but which were scaled back or deferred are set out in the following schedule.  The schedule sets out the original measures in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the element of the measure which is going ahead and the element which has been deferred.</P>
    <P>Given the budgetary circumstances the £4 million provided for in the budget for <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>-related education initiatives is no small achievement.  It is the Government's firm intention to implement the other measures outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as budgetary circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>I met the public service unions on 17 <Col N="1113" /> January last to put forward, on behalf of the Government, a revised package of measures on public service pay.  That package was designed to address to the maximum extent possible, the concerns of the public service unions having regard to current budgetary constraints and the Government's budgetary strategy as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, and in the Programme for Government.  I am now arranging to place in the Oireachtas Library copies of the statement which I issued after that meeting which sets out the full terms of that package.</P>
      <P>On 17 January 1992, the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions decided to suspend the day of action scheduled for 28 January 1992, and to consult the various individual public service unions about the package of measures which I put to them, on behalf of the Government.</P>
      <P>On 27 February 1992, the Public Services Committee wrote to my Department indicating that they had decided that the position which I outlined to them at our meeting of 17 January 1992, constituted a basis for suspending their campaign of action on the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pay terms in the public service.</P>
      <P>This has facilitated the restoration of normal relations and the resumption of the dialogue between the Government and the public service unions.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my budget speech last <Col N="1114" /> January, I am presently examining all the possible implications for DIRT of the capital liberalisation programme.  Whatever action is judged necessary will be provided for in the Finance Bill.  It would be inappropriate for me to speculate on the outcome of that study before the work is completed and final decisions have been taken on the action required. I would like to once again reassure the House that it is not anticipated that the changes will have any effect on this year's revenue receipts.</P>
      <P>In February 1989 the European Commission proposed a 15 per cent EC-wide withholding tax on interest income.  This proposal was not implemented because of strong opposition from several member states.  Although this directive has not been formally withdrawn by the Commission, it does not now seem likely that agreement will be found in the time-scale which is set for capital liberalisation. Indeed, it has to be said that even if such a measure were agreed, the issue of capital movements to tax havens outside the European Community would still have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>In any case, what falls to me as Minister for Finance of this country is to examine the implications of the liberalisation of capital movements for this country and to consider what measures we can take to preserve our revenue to the greatest possible extent.  As I have said, my proposals in this area will be contained in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 131 together.  I am satisfied that the banks, building societies and other financial institutions will be in a position to compete effectively in the completed internal market in the Community.  To this end, the Government have been committed to a programme of liberalising financial markets, promoting more effective financial supervision and opening up the opportunities for providers of financial services to compete effectively with each other.  I would refer the Deputy in this regard to the major programme of legislation in the form of the Central Bank Act, 1989, the Building Societies Act, 1989, the Insurance Act 1989, the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1990 and the Finance Acts dealing with the establishment and operation of the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the financial services sector should maintain and expand employment as it has done in recent years.  The ability of the sector to compete is supported by the success of the IFSC and by the positive expectations of the financial services institutions in Ireland regarding the long term impact of 1992 on employment which were revealed in the 1990 EUROPEN report on 1992 and the financial services sector.</P>
      <P>It is up to each financial service sector, however, to put in place the necessary measures to enhance competitiveness and to do so urgently.  We have seen, for example, the main building societies in recent times extend the range of their financial products, form new business relationships with the providers of other financial services and strengthen their managerial resources.  These are the appropriate and encouraging moves by the societies to respond to 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the impact of European <Col N="1116" /> Union and European Monetary Union on building societies.  I see no need to convene a meeting of building societies on this issue.</P>

      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency was established on 3 December 1990 by order of the Minister for Finance as provided for by the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990.  At the same time the Government by order delegated to the Agency the functions of borrowing money for the Exchequer, managing the national debt and related matters.  The activities of the Agency relate to these functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the secondment of personnel, 27 officers of the Department of Finance were seconded to the Agency <Col N="1117" /> on a temporary basis with effect from 3 December 1990, for a period of up to three months each.  The secondment arrangement ended in March 1991.</P>
    <P>On the question of new staff, the Agency has a total complement of 53 staff; 25 former civil servants and 28 staff from outside the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied with the performance of the National Treasury Management Agency to date.  The Agency was established to bring increased specialisation to the Exchequer borrowing and debt management operations, so as to ensure that debt service costs were kept as low as possible.  I am satisfied that the Agency is achieving this objective.  The 1991 budget included a target of £40 million for savings by the Agency on debt service costs this year. This target was achieved and in addition the Agency was able to take advantage of favourable interest rate movements to achieve further savings of £56 million in 1991.  The 1992 estimate for debt service costs takes account of £50 million savings to be achieved by the Agency.</P>

      <P>The joint Ireland and Northern Ireland INTERREG programme involves EC aid of £58 million from the three Structural Funds and will make a valuable contribution to overcoming the special problems of the Border areas both in the context of the completion of the internal market of 1992 and in the context of their relative isolation within the country. Furthermore the Border areas, like the rest of Ireland, benefit from the Community Support Framework through <Col N="1118" /> which the EC Structural Funds support programmes geared to preparing for Ireland's entry into the Single Market as well as furthering the general aim of improving economic and social cohesion within the Community.</P>
      <P>I have sought and will continue to seek a substantial increase in the aid from the Structural Funds to be made available to Ireland when the current arrangements expire at the end of 1993.</P>
      <P>The issue of the location of institutions and specialised agencies of the EC in the various member states has been the subject of discussion in the Community. This discussion has concentrated on the choice of member state for the site of new specialised agencies and the choice of a permanent seat for the European Parliament.  The Government are of course seeking to have new EC agencies located in peripheral countries such as Ireland.</P>

      <P>Appointments to posts on the joint staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas fall to be be made by the Ceann Comhairle.  In most instances such appointments are made on foot of competitions held by the Civil Service Commission or in line with well-established promotion procedures which are well-established in the Civil Service.  In the case of a small number of grades, notably services officer and services attendant, the Ceann Comhairle is empowered to make unestablished appointments without the involvement of the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>Since 1987, the only competition for posts as services officer or services attendants was held in April 1991, as a result of which 12 new staff in these grades have been appointed to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection was made following <Col N="1122" /> interviews of candidates listed by FÁS to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  All candidates were registered with FÁS and were known to be immediately available for employment.</P>
    <P>Four of the 12 candidates appointed were former military personnel.</P>
    <P>Three of these were appointed as services officers on 6 May 1991, their dates of discharge from the Defence Forces being September 1990, 31 April 1991 and 13 May 1991 &mdash; in the case of one appointee who took up duty while on pre-discharge leave from the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The other person concerned was appointed as a services attendant on 9 September 1991.  He was discharged from the Defence Forces in 1983.</P>
    <P>No open competition for appointment to the usher grade was held in recent years.  However, a competition confined to staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas who had a minimum of two years service was held in 1991 from which five appointments were made.</P>

    <P>These prosecutions relate to failure to make returns or produce accounts in respect of income tax, corporation tax, residential property tax or VAT.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners reached substantial monetary <Col N="1123" /> settlements involving recovery of the evaded tax and mitigated interest and penalties with defaulting taxpayers in those years.  Many of these defaulters had their names published in Iris Oifigiúil and the Revenue Commissioners' annual reports for those years.  I had been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this latter approach constituted the most effective sanction against tax evasion in those years.</P>
    <P>I referred in my Budget Statement to the Government's concern regarding the instances of tax evasion which have come to public notice in the past year.  The Government's approach here is to give the Revenue Commissioners greater anti-evasion powers.  Accordingly, I will be bringing forward measures in the Finance Bill to give the Revenue Commissioners greater powers in relation to information regarding taxpayers' affairs. I will also be taking steps to create a more realistic and effective penalty regime.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as a consequence of the introduction of self-assessment, they are moving to a more pro-active policy in relation to prosecution action.  Seventy-seven convictions with monetary penalties were secured for failure to make returns in 1991 and, in 1992 to date, there are already 400 cases awaiting a court hearing. In addition, the Commissioners have recently established liaison with both the Garda Fraud Squad and the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to bringing forward for prosecution cases involving serious tax fraud.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the combination of all these measures will have a major deterrent effect on persons who seek to evade their tax obligations.</P>

    <P>National Parks and Wildlife Service</P>
    <P>Burren</P>
    <P>Provision of visitor centre.  The EIS has been published and is available for public comment.  It would be premature at this stage to comment on the project pending the public's response.</P>
    <P>Wicklow</P>
    <P>Provision of visitor centre.  The EIS for Wicklow determined that the project would not have a significant impact on <Col N="1130" /> the environment.  This was accepted by the planning authority and I believe that the scheme should now proceed.  Work would be completed in 1993.</P>

    <P>Royal Canal</P>
    <P>The canal has been restored to navigation between Blanchardstown and Mullingar.  The restoration of the stretches between Blanchardstown and the River Liffey will be completed within the next year.  Substantial progress is also being made west of Mullingar, with most of the channel now dredged as far as County Longford.</P>
    <P>Grand Canal</P>
    <P>The canal, including the Barrow navigation, is already navigable.  The emphasis on this canal is the repair of embankments generally and the improvement of water supplies.</P>
    <P>A national waterways visitors' centre is being built in the Grand Canal Docks, Ringsend.</P>
    <P>There is also under way an extensive fish stocking programme which will develop both canals over the next few years as top class fisheries.</P>
    <P>Ecological surveys have been carried <Col N="1131" /> out on both canals to identify and preserve worthwhile botanical features and to ensure that their potential as corridors of nature is fully realised.  The development of long distance walking routes will also be an important part of this programme.</P>
    <P>Shannon Navigation</P>
    <P>1.  It is our intention to provide additional mooring facilities at a number of points along the navigation and to maintain the existing ones to a very high standard.  New works are now in progress at Terryglass (Lough Derg) where the existing pier is being substantially extended and Banagher where the harbour is being enlarged.</P>
    <P>2.  Work is about to commence on the restoration of that part of Lough Allen Canal giving access to Lough Allen and some work has already been done to the River Suck extension to Ballinasloe.  It is hoped to complete the remainder of the work over the coming two years.</P>
    <P>3.  On the Erne navigation rock shoals near Belturbet will be removed and the short channel known as the &ldquo;Foalies Cut&rdquo; will be deepened facilitating the passage of vessels to Belturbet.</P>
    <P>4.  A preliminary examination of the extension of the Erne system as far as Killeshandra had already been carried out.  It is planned to make a more detailed study of the proposal to enable the Commissioners prepare an acceptable scheme of works.</P>
    <P>5.  The Shannon Erne Navigation is programmed for completion in mid to late 1993.  As soon as the contractors have fulfilled their contractual obligations the waterway will be operated and maintained by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>6.  It is proposed to introduce new bylaws for the control and management of the navigation system in time for the commencement of the new boating season.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have commissioned a study by external consultants to report and advise on other waterways which have the potential for development <Col N="1132" /> or restoration and which could be included in the network of inland waterways. It is hoped that the report which is at present being considered by the Minister for Finance will form the basis for planning and development over the next ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>Other Projects</P>
    <P>National Museum</P>
    <P>A programme of refurbishment of the roof of the National Museum, Kildare Street, which is expected to commence later this year, will be completed in 1993.</P>
    <P>National Library</P>
    <P>Works are nearing completion on the provision of an exhibition room, lecture room and micro-form reading room in the National Library.  These works form part of a larger refurbishment programme of works within the library complex.</P>
    <P>National Gallery</P>
    <P>A major refurbishment programme, concentrating on the 1968 wing of the National Gallery, involving some one third of the exhibition space in the gallery, is at an advanced stage of preparation. Those works should take some two years to complete.</P>
    <P>Custom House</P>
    <P>The landscaping of the grounds of the Custom House are nearing completion. This together with the major stonework restoration project completes the external upgrading of this prestigious landmark.</P>
    <P>Botanic Gardens (Curvilinear Range)</P>
    <P>A programme of works to faithfully restore the Turner Glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens, utilising original materials while updating facilities for public and staff alike, is expected to commence later this year and take some 18 months to complete.</P>

      <P>Among the objectives of the Community under the new Treaty on European Union are the promotion of sustainable and non-inflationary growth and a high level of employment.  Under the Treaty, member states are to conduct their economic policies with a view to contributing to these and other objectives of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community policies are already making a substantial contribution to Ireland's growth and employment performance. Under the Structural Funds, for example, the Community is providing a substantial volume of support for the development of our economic infrastructure, an activity which is of vital importance if we are to combat successfully the disadvantages inherent in <Col N="1134" /> our peripheral location.  The Community is also supporting our efforts to deal directly with the unemployment situation, for example, through its involvement in co-financing the recently announced initiatives on the training front.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to avail of every opportunity to impress upon my colleagues in the other member states the need for their every action to support the growth and employment objectives set out in the Treaty.  However, while Community support is important, our economic well-being and employment prospects are in the long-run determined primarily by domestic policies and actions.</P>

      <P>I assume that the EC plans to which the Deputy refers, is the Commission's draft RETEX initiative.

      <P>The draft RETEX initiative was formally referred by the Commission to the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee for the Development and Conversion of Regions and is I understand currently being examined by them.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Commission hope to be able to formally adopt this initiative in the coming months, with co-operation of the above bodies.</P>
      <P>I welcome the draft initiative in principle but there are a number of aspects to the current draft which require clarification. My Department has been engaging in ongoing discussions with the Commission in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have consistently underlined in the context of EC discussions that Ireland is one of the member states where the textile and clothing industries are of particular significance and thus the EC authorities are well aware of the sensitivities of these sectors for us.  I should, however, point out that the clothing sector accounts for 6 per cent of industrial employment in Ireland and not 60 per cent as stated in the question.</P>

However, the container is located on private property where it was placed by a local business and utilised by it as a store.  The Commissioners of Public Works who have responsibility for the Royal Canal under the Canals Act 1986, have made representations to the owners to have the structure removed but these have been unsuccessful.  They have also raised the matter with Dublin Corporation Planning Department in regard to possible breaches of the planning regulations.

      <P>The area which it is hoped to eventually include in the Wicklow Mountains National Park comprises approximately 33,000 hectares (81,500 acres).  A total of approximately 12,600 hectares (31,100 acres) is under the direct control of the Office of Public Works and comprises former Forest Service and Coillte Teoranta lands and other lands purchased from private landowners in the area.  The balance is in the hands of private landowners.  Private land will included in the national park only if the landowners agree to either dispose of the lands or to enter into management agreements with the Office of Public Works.  The expansion of the national park is also dependent on funds being available for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The national park does not contain any private lands and thus there are no private residents within it.  I cannot say how many people are in fact permanently resident within the eventual target area for the park.  The area is however very sparsely populated and as I have already mentioned no private lands will be included in the national park unless by way of management agreement with the specific consent of the owner in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy appears to be under the mistaken impression that the national park will have large numbers of residents <Col N="1159" /> within it.  It may be that he is confusing Irish national parks, which accord with internationally accepted criteria laid down by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), and those in use in England and Wales which do not meet the criteria and are categorised as &ldquo;protected landscapes&rdquo;, not as national parks, by the IUCN.  Consequently the question of consultation with local interest groups must be considered in the light of the fact that the national park will be comprised entirely of lands owned by, or under the control of, the State as is required by the international criteria for national parks. The park itself will be managed in accordance with these criteria.</P>
    <P>I propose however to set up an advisory committee representing local and national interests with whom major policy matters could be discussed.  The Wicklow Mountains Consultative Committee, established by Wicklow County Council to consider a development and management strategy for the Wicklow Mountains and on which local and national interest groups are represented, may be the most appropriate body to fulfil this role in regard to the Wicklow Mountains National Park.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 to 203, inclusive, and 205 together.</P>
      <P>The contract for the construction of the Great Blasket Island, National Historic Park, Visitor Centre at Dún Chaoin, County Kerry, was placed on 6 February 1991.  I am quite satisfied that this was the correct decision.</P>
      <P>The consultants did not consider it necessary to recommend many ameliorative measures in their environmental impact statement for the Dun Chaoin Visitor Centre and most of these had already been incorporated in the scheme. The EIS did recommend that the Office of Public Works and the local community explore the possibility of providing parking for coaches within one to two kilometres of the site.  This would mean that coaches would drop off passengers at the centre and return after a predetermined period for collection.  This proposal was discussed by the Office of Public Works architect with the county engineer who did not favour it.  He considered that this would lead to a duplication of any possible visual intrusion and he strongly favoured the retention of the proposed bus-park at the visitor centre site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following were the recommendations <Col N="1163" /> of Kerry County Council in relation to the new centre at Dun Chaoin following the statutory consultation under S.84 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963.</P>
    <P>1.  The external elevations of the Sli shall be finished in native stone.</P>
    <P>2.  The roof of the Sli shall be of natural slate.  Other roofs of the development shall be finished in lead or other suitable material for low pitched roofs and shall feature seams as shown on the photographs of the model submitted with this consultation.</P>
    <P>3.  The colour finish of the rendered surfaces of the development shall be neutral in tone and shall be agreed with the planning authority either prior to painting or before the application of any permanently coloured rendering.</P>
    <P>4.  The layout of the development within the site shall be in accordance with the details indicated on Drawing No. 189062/5.</P>
    <P>5.  Field patterns shall be retained within the car parking area as shown on the layout plan.  Where new fencing is required, it shall be of sod and stone and shall match existing fencing.</P>
    <P>6.  The car parking area shall be constructed with properly consolidated material and shall be finally surfaced dressed with bitumen and crushed native stone.</P>
    <P>7.  Pathways shall similarly be finished in crushed stone.</P>
    <P>8.  The two vehicular access points to the site shall be set out in accordance with the layout plan, with traditional sod and stone fencing and native stone piers.</P>
    <P>9.  The development shall be provided with a RBC type sewage treatment plant and a tertiary treatment peat filtration bed in accordance with Drawing Nos. 2109/4, 2109/5 and 2109/6.  The sewage treatment facility shall be maintained in satisfactory working condition at all times.</P>
    <P>10.  Screening shall be provided throughout the site particularly in the car and coach parking areas by the liberal planting of native fuchsia hedging to the satisfaction of the planning authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> All of these recommendations have been accepted.</P>
    <P>The elected councillors, together with the senior staff, of Kerry County Council considered the Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed visitor centre at Dun Chaoin and submitted the following comments:</P>
    <P>1.  A visitor centre incorporating the facilities proposed is entirely appropriate for Dunquin and the decision to establish such a major project here is warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>2.  An early examination of and decision on the comments made in response to the EIS is requested so that the project may proceed without any undue delay.</P>
    <P>3.  Given that the proposed development is located in an area of prime special amenity, the visual impact of the devlopment should be minimised as far as possible and every effort should be made to keep it from being obtrusive on the outstanding landscape quality of the area.</P>
    <P>4.  Regard should be had for the vernacular architectural tradition to the greatest extent possible and we feel that this can be incorporated to a considerable extent within the existing overall design.</P>
    <P>5.  Greater use of native stone and slate and perhaps over a greater area of the actual buildings is very strongly recommended. This is in line with previous council suggestions at the earlier consultative planning stage.</P>
    <P>6.  Greater screening, landscaping and mounding is recommended to reduce the visual impact of the development.</P>
    <P>7.  The provision and siting of the coach park is seen as requiring particularly sensitive treatment.  Further examination and consideration of this aspect of the project is strongly recommended.  The recommendation at paragraph 5.8.5 of the EIS is not seen as necessarily being the desirable solution.  Council staff would be available for further consultation on this matter.</P>
    <P>The views of the EC Commission were not sought in relation to the Environmental Impact Statement nor has any <Col N="1165" /> submission from the Commission been received.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance sanctioned the expenditure on the construction of the visitor centre at Dún Chaoin on 5 February 1992.  In view of the fact that the Environmental Impact Statement endorsed the project, specific Government approval was not necessary.</P>
    <P>The final report on the wave monitoring study has not yet been received. This will be a technical report and will not be published but will be available for inspection by persons with a legitimate interest in it.</P>
    <P>A working party consisting of representatives of the Office of Public Works and of Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid have been meeting regularly since April 1989. The Fondúireacht contains local residents and in this way there has been constant liaison with the local community.</P>
    <P>In addition, there has been a number of meetings with officials of Kerry County Council and with individuals and groups representative of Dún Chaoin.</P>
    <P>Two public meetings were held.  One on 22 October 1989 when the various site options were set out and the other on 24 November 1990 when a model of the proposed visitor centre was exhibited.</P>
    <P>A number of meetings were held with representatives of An Taisce's Kerry branch and formal meetings with Coiste Forbartha Dhún Chaoin were held in February and June 1991.  A meeting was also held at the latter date with Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne and with local boatmen.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to establish an advisory committee for the management of the new centre.  There will be local representation on this committee.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works own one house and plot of land and a share in the commonage of the Great Blasket Island. This represents approximately 4 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>The question of any road widening in the Slea Head-Dún Chaoin Valley areas is a matter for the local authority.  The Office of Public Works have made no proposals to them in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> No decision has yet been made about the provision of new landing facilities on the mainland nor on the provision of any new type of boat service.</P>
    <P>No consultation took place with Bord Fáilte regarding the siting of the new visitor centre at Dún Chaoin.</P>
    <P>The proposal to build the visitor centre at the chosen site at Dún Chaoin has received the approval of the local authority. I concur with the decision to build the centre there.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works marketing is concerned with the promotion of public awareness an appreciation of the parks, monuments and other heritage areas under their management and not with interpretative centres as such.  Interpretative centres have been provided at some of these places to manage public access and to enhance the quality of the visit by informing and stimulating interest.  Marketing is carried out on a number of levels.</P>
      <P>At local level, promotional fliers are distributed by the centre itself and by local tourist offices.  They are also circulated to tourist accommodation, B &amp; B's, guesthouses and hotels.  The opening arrangements for the various sites with visitor services are placed in local papers and newsletters on a regular basis.  This marketing is done in close association with the relevant regional tourism organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a wider level, advertisements are placed in the &ldquo;what's on columns&rdquo; of the national papers, in guide books and guide maps and in other relevant publications. Exhibitions and special events such as heritage day, together with the many <Col N="1167" /> Office of Public Works publications, both general and site specific, also help to create a greater public and tourist awareness of the extent of Ireland's rich heritage.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works work closely with Bord Fáilte in the marketing of the heritage sites under their mangement. Over the last 18 months a joint approach has been taken by the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte, local authorities and the regional tourism organisations in the development of a strategy for heritage tourism in Ireland.  As part of this approach a major visitor survey of heritage attractions was carried out in 1991 and was fully participated in by the Office of Public Works.  Joint visitor surveys will be carried out on a regular basis in the future and will help in the development of co-operative marketing of heritage attractions.</P>

      <P>The scheme for the proposed visitor centre has been accepted in an independent environmental impact statement and has been approved of by the Planning Authority, Wicklow County Council.  There has been extensive public consultation in regard to this proposal stretching back over 12 months.  There is a danger that unless work commences on the project shortly the funding for the project will be lost.  In the circumstances, there seems <Col N="1168" /> no justification for delaying the projects further at this stage.</P>
      <P>Wicklow County Council asked to defer construction of the centre pending a report of interpretation in Wicklow. The interpretation plan for the new centre will not be finalised for some months and the conclusions of the report will be taken into account.  There is accordingly no need to defer construction works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 to 211, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works referred the Ringsend Visitor Centre to Dublin Corporation's planning department for <Col N="1169" /> their observations under section 84 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, on 7 March 1991.  The corporation replied on 18 April 1991 stating that they had no objection to the project subject to two conditions: 1, that the external finish of the proposed services building on the quayside should match the main display centre building; 2, that adequate provision be made for access for the disabled and other persons with restricted mobility.  The centre meets these conditions.</P>
    <P>The site in the water body was chosen as the Office of Public Works do not own any of the existing buildings around the basin.  The decision to build over the water obviates the need for very expensive land purchases and, additionally, gives a focus to the larger inner basin which no longer has any of its former significant boat usage.  The location complements the existing IDA craft centre complex on Grand Canal Quay and the design incorporates many of the architectural themes of the area.  Having regard to the function of the building, which will be to publicise and disseminate information on all aspects of inland navigations in the care of the State and in the process to foster enthusiasm for their care and conservation, the siting of the centre over the water is considered particularly appropriate.</P>
    <P>The decision to develop the centre in the basin was widely publicised and has been generally well received by the local community.</P>
    <P>An environmental impact statement was not commissioned as the project was below the thresholds specified for the commissioning of such studies and the commissioners were satisfied on the basis of their own research that the building would have no harmful effect and would in fact be beneficial to the local environment.</P>
    <P>The completion of this project and the opening of the visitor centre will assist in the rejuvenation of a degraded area and encourage considerable visitor numbers. The development poses no threat to the fabric of the canal system.  It has already served as catalyst for several private <Col N="1170" /> sector redevelopment schemes on derelict property in the area and it heralds the likely transformation of this area over the next few years.</P>

    <P>It is not possible for me to say at this stage the amount of EC aid which will become available to the harbour authorities with projects included in the Operational Programme on Peripherality during 1992.  I will, of course, seek to maximise the amount of EC aid paid to the relevant harbour authorities in 1992, however, this will depend on the progress made and expenditure incurred by the harbour authorities.</P>

Examples of specific matters which are currently receiving particular attention include the work of the inter-departmental group dealing with urban crime, the arrangements for the investigation of serious fraud, the development of community policing both urban and rural, the development of a new prison facility at the Curragh, converting the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds to a semi-State body, implementation of the video recordings legislation, implementation of measures agreed at EC level to give effect to article 8A of the Single European Act, etc.  I would stress that this list is by no means intended to be exhaustive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Equal opportunity has been receiving particular attention in my Department in <Col N="1183" /> the context of staff training and development. Last year, a number of line managers participated in workshops on the theme &ldquo;Managing Human Resources &mdash; the Equality Dimension&rdquo; which examined how the application of equal opportunities could be more fully integrated into their day-to-day management responsibilities.  I intend that further measures on these lines will be taken this year and that the promotion of equal opportunity will be incorporated into training programmes, where appropriate, with a view to increasing awareness and consciousness in the area of equality.</P>
    <P>As regards promotion, I will continue to ensure that there is equality of opportunity at all stages of the promotion process and that suitably qualified women and men have equal access to higher posts in my Department.</P>

      <P>Garda records show that 6,830 alarm calls were received in the Louth-Meath division during the 12 months period ended 29 February 1992 and that over 97 per cent of these were false.</P>
      <P>The very high level of false calls in the Louth-Meath division is a reflection of the situation being experienced countrywide. This means that the alarm systems in question, which were intended as a useful instrument of crime prevention, are now, by and large, operating in a way which hampers effective crime prevention. False calls can be due to carelessness, equipment failure or faulty installation/maintenance.  The high incidence of false calls during the usual opening and closing hours of business premises highlights the element of carelessness involved.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have been looking at the problem and examining how it is dealt with in other countries.  They have also engaged in consultation with the security industry.  The commissioner has now put proposals to my Department for a new policy to deal with the problem. The details of this policy are being finalised at present and I intend to make an announcement shortly in the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have comparative data of the kind mentioned by the Deputy.  It is generally accepted, however, that our peripheral island location imposes on Irish exporters additional transport costs by comparison with their competitors situated on the <Col N="1202" /> European mainland.  For example, the European Commission in its report &ldquo;One Market, One Money&rdquo;, made some calculations of the scale of the penalty imposed by distance from the centre of the EC trading block.  The study concluded that the penalty varies by a factor ranging from 1.9 for Athens to 1.8 for Dublin, 1.6 for Rome and Lisbon and 1.4 for Madrid.  These figures are for capital cities and take no account of time taken to travel from, say, Galway to Dublin which will add considerably to the capital-to-capital penalties.</P>
      <P>The reduction of these cost disadvantages is one of the principal objectives of the current EC-assisted Operational Programme on Peripherality which provides for a range of improvements in our road, rail, air and sea transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The policy, which I will be maintaining, of securing increased competition and efficiency in the various sectors of the transport market in respect of both internal and international services is also aimed at providing the optimum levels of service for transport users at the lowest possible cost.</P>

      <P>The Government are extremely concerned about the plight of the young homeless and have initiated a range of developments to provide additional hostel places and other services for the young homeless throughout the country. The aim is to ensure that, as far as possible, each health board will be self-sufficient in terms of the availability of residential placements.</P>
      <P>Over 40 additional residential places are being provided in the Eastern Health Board area.  A ten-place emergency hostel for homeless girls is already available. Other developments include a new therapeutic unit for difficult adolescents in County Kildare and a new residential home for boys in South County Dublin. I expect these to be in place within a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New residential and hostel facilities are also being developed at Cork, Limerick, Athlone, Sligo and Galway.  These will result in approximately 30 extra places. In Cork a purpose-built residential centre at Shanakiel Road is now complete and will open shortly.  A new residential facility is being developed near Limerick but it has been delayed by planning objections.  In Athlone, Sligo and Galway, new hostel facilities for the <Col N="1206" /> young homeless are being developed by local voluntary groups with the support of the relevant health boards.  Additional places were also recently made available at Stranorlar, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Funding has also been provided for other services dealing with young homeless. For example, the Southern Health Board is developing a specialised foster care programme for adolescents; a neighbourhood youth project has been established in Galway; an `After-Hours' social work service aimed specifically at the young homeless will be introduced shortly in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act 1991 provides a statutory framework for the development of child care services, including tackling the problem of youth homelessness.  It is my intention to bring into operation this year most of Part II of the Act which contains many of the preventative and service-delivery provisions.  In particular, it is intended to implement section 5 of the Act which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to provide accommodation for young homeless people up to the age of 18 years.  I am confident that the commencement of this provision together with the various service developments which I have outlined will go a long way towards reducing the problem of youth homelessness.</P>

This is in line with the development plan for acute hospitals in the region, which the board adopted in March 1988.

Children in creches where one of the other children contacted meningococcal meningitis were also given antibiotic treatment.  Classes in schools were not treated but, where it was felt appropriate, very close friends were treated.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board <Col N="1216" /> are currently considering an application for a licence in respect of a vaccine against haemophilius influenza type B. (HIB).

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the question relates to national roads in respect of which full cost grants are provided by my Department. In the case of maintenance works on these roads, grants are allocated separately for surface dressing operations and for ordinary maintenance works such as delineation, signs, drainage, winter maintenance and road repairs.  Details of unit costs for surface dressing operations are returned annually by local authorities so that any significant variations can be identified.  However, simple comparisons as between local authorities cannot readily be made because of variations in the level of preparatory works which arise in individual cases.  Comparative cost statistics are not sought in respect of ordinary maintenance works for which grants are allocated on a road mileage basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strengthening and improvement works are generally carried out on a contract <Col N="1225" /> basis following open competitive tendering and, given the number of variable factors that arise, direct comparisons of costs in different areas have little meaning.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Research Unit carries out surveys, on a regular basis, of the skid resistance, road profile and pavement strength of the national road network. The results of these surveys forms an input to the determination of the annual road grant allocations.</P>

      <P>Statutory undertakers such as ESB, Telecom Eireann and Bord Gais Éireann have statutory powers to open public roads without a licence from the local authority.  However, section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 (as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987) enables prescribed local authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers and others for the purposes of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption.  In September, 1988 regulations were made prescribing Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation as authorities which could exercise these directive powers and my Department has recently written to all other local authorities asking if any of them wish to be so prescribed.  It is an offence to contravene a direction under section 101D, with fines of up to £1,000 on summary conviction or £50,000 on conviction on indictment.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also in place in Dublin to ensure the advance notification of planned works to enable them to be co-ordinated as far as possible.</P>

      <P>Under Directive 88/449/EEC, Ireland is required to have in place a system of compulsory roadworthiness testing for all light goods vehicles, including vans, over four years old, with repeat tests every two years, not later than 1 January 1995.  About 50,000 such vehicle are involved.  To meet this deadline, it is necessary to phase in testing starting with light goods vehicles over seven years old <Col N="1232" /> from 1 January 1993 and those over four years old from 1 January 1994.  This will give rise to about 25,000 tests per year.</P>
      <P>There will be a range of tests covering 53 items, including brakes, steering, suspension and lighting.  For a vehicle to pass a test, each of these items will have to be in such condition that it complies with the relevant road traffic regulations relating to construction, equipment and lighting of vehicles.</P>
      <P>Appointments as authorised testers of light goods vehicles will be made by those local authorities who are also licensing authorities.  To be considered for appointment, an applicant will have to have premises and equipment suitable for the carrying out of all the tests required. My Department is at present preparing guidelines on premises and equipment for use by licensing authorities in assessing applications.  I hope to be in a position to issue these guidelines later this month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337 to 351, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The widespread presence of landmines throughout the Cambodian countryside is undoubtedly a major hazard to the safe return of the thousands of refugees from Thailand to Cambodia.  This very serious problem is fully recognised by the international community and by the United Nations.  The UN is putting measures in train to ensure that border crossing points and routes are cleared of mines and other hazards, in accordance with the terms of the comprehensive political settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC), which is currently <Col N="1235" /> preparing the ground for the larger United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia (UNTAC), had its mandate expanded by the Security Council on 7 January 1992 to add training in mine-clearance and the initiation of a mine-clearance programme to its original mine-awareness function.  Assistance in demining will also be a priority of UNTAC when deployed.</P>
    <P>UN Security Council in its Resolution 745 (1992), adopted by consensus on 28 February 1992, formally established UNTAC and requested the UN Secretary General to deploy UNTAC as rapidly as possible.  It is the Secretary General's intention to begin deployment in April-May. Ireland wholeheartedly supports the efforts of the Secretary General in this regard.  No request has yet been received for the participation of Irish personnel in UNTAC.  Two Army officers are at present serving with UNAMIC.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General has estimated the cost of the UNTAC operation at approximately $1.9 billion.  A detailed budget is expected to be presented to the UN General Assembly within the next few weeks.  The cost will be borne by UN member states on the basis of assessed budgetary contributions.  On the understanding that member states meet their assessed portions of the cost, the operation in Cambodia will be adequately funded.</P>
    <P>In the latter part of 1991, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Programme launched their programme for the repatriation of Cambodian refugees, to be financed by way of voluntary contributions.  This operation is expected to continue until the end of 1993 at an estimated cost of $116 million.  To date, approximately $37 million has been contributed to the operation, leaving a shortfall of approximately $79 million.  The Secretary General intends to launch a separate appeal for the further financing of the operation and has indicated that if there were to be a shortfall in funding, he might recommend alternative financing arrangements.  The question of an Irish <Col N="1236" /> contribution to this operation is under consideration.</P>
    <P>The deployment of UNTAC will ensure that the four Cambodian factions, including the Khmer Rouge, will be constrained to comply scrupulously with all the terms of the UN Peace Plan.  It is hoped the involvement of UNTAC in the administration of the country will also act as a brake on corruption.</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 745 also decided that it was vital that elections be held in Cambodia by May 1993 at the latest.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for those who believe that those responsible for the unspeakable horrors which took place in Cambodia should be answerable for their actions before an appropriate tribunal.</P>
    <P>As my predecessor stated to the House on an earlier occasion, the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide provides for the possibility of trial by an international penal tribunal.  However, this remains only a theoretical possibility, since there is at present no international penal tribunal with jurisdiction to try persons for genocide.  A role for the International Court of Justice exists under the convention but only in the case of a dispute as between states parties to the convention. This condition cannot be fulfilled until a Cambodian government in a position to be a party to such a dispute is in place.</P>

Her application for grants under the 1991 suckler cow premium scheme is being processed at present and payment will issue shortly. She has been deemed ineligible for grants under the 1991 special beef premium as she did not have the animals on which she applied for premium earpunched as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme.

      <P>The new arrangements are similar to those which apply under EC Regulations to people who have mixed insurance in a number of different EC member states. A similar formula applies under various reciprocal agreements on social security to which Ireland is a party.</P>
      <P>I believe that these arrangements represent a fair and equitable basis for the treatment of people with mixed insurance records.</P>
      <P>People qualifying for the new <i>pro rata</i> pensions are also eligible for additional benefits such as free electricity, free television licence and free telephone rental.</P>

      <P>My immediate legislative priorities include the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill, 1992, to give effect to the recent budgetary and other measures recently announced, and the completion <Col N="1262" /> of work on the statutory instrument providing for payments to those persons affected by the delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7 on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.  Continuing simplification of the social welfare legislation and the various schemes will also be a priority with me.</P>
      <P>On the administrative side it is my intention that the social welfare services office would build on the work already done and develop the social welfare delivery services so that they become more efficient, modern and accessible and having due regard for the dignity of the individual.</P>
      <P>Among the areas where I would like to see substantial progress are the following: the further extension and development of information technology particularly to local offices; the localisation of services leading to a situation where people can deal with the whole range of social welfare services at a single contact point; and the continuation and development of control, e.g., in the area of PRSI compliance measures so as to reduce the level of abuse.</P>

      <P>The part-time job incentive scheme is designed to allow long term unemployed persons to work part-time for up to 24 hours a week while receiving a flat rate allowance instead of their unemployment payments.  The scheme was introduced on a pilot basis in September 1986 and was extended nationwide at the end of 1988.  The allowances are currently £35 for a single person and £58 for a married person with a dependent spouse.  There are 319 persons participating in the scheme at present.</P>
      <P>Persons accepted onto the scheme are taken off the live register and participation is limited to one year.  Statistics are not maintained regarding the average number of weeks spent on the scheme in cases where participation lasts for less than a year.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to the extension of the free travel scheme to the person concerned and to people in similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all residents of the State aged 66 years or over.  The general purpose of the scheme is to encourage elderly people to avail of travel services within the State, particularly at off-peak times.  The scheme has been extended progressively over the years for certain categories of people under 66 years.  It now applies also to registered blind persons over 18 years and to certain categories of disabled persons under 66 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department or a health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned is under 66 years of age and does not fulfil any of the <Col N="1265" /> current conditions or entitlement to free travel.  Accordingly it is not possible to award him a free travel pass.</P>
    <P>There would be a very significent cost in extending the free travel scheme to the persons in the circumstances applicable in this case.</P>

      <P>The major legislative and administrative priorities of my Department at present are:</P>
      <P>Industrial Relations &mdash; the Labour Relations Commission, established in January 1991 under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, are expanding their range of services to include a comprehensive industrial relations advisory service for employers and workers.  The commission have prepared a code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures in essential services and are preparing further codes in other areas.</P>
      <P>A review of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, as agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Occupational Safety and Health &mdash; a phased review of existing occupational health and safety legislation is being undertaken by the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  Arising from our membership of the European Community, the Authority will be putting forward proposals for a range of <Col N="1270" /> secondary legislation to meet obligations which must be fulfilled by the end of 1992.  The Authority will continue to give priority to measures for the prevention of occupational accidents and diseases particularly in the new entrant sectors of fishing, farming, education, health services, hotel/catering, retailing and warehousing.</P>
    <P>A national liaison committee have been established to co-ordinate activities for the European Year for Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work. The year runs from March 1992 to March 1993 and is a major EC effort to raise awareness among workers and employers of ways to combat hazards in the work-place.</P>
    <P>Manpower and Training &mdash; a White Paper on manpower policy is in the course of preparation.  The White Paper will take account of the Green Paper on Education and the recently published report of the Industrial Policy Review Group.  I am hoping to publish the White Paper in mid-year.</P>
    <P>A review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, and the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, is being undertaken in accordance with the Government commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Two new schemes to reduce unemployment and increase the level of in-company training have been launched. The employment subsidy scheme aims to provide 15,000 employment places and the job training scheme aims to provide 10,000 training places.  Both schemes will be administered by FÁS.  The existing manpower and training programmes run by FÁS and CERT will continue, subject to review where necessary.</P>
    <P>A new standards based, as opposed to time-served apprenticeship system has been agreed and the funding arrangements for this new system are under discussion with employers.  It is hoped to have the new system in place from next September.</P>
    <P>European Social Fund &mdash; co-ordination of applications to the EC Commission in relation to assistance for the vocational training and aids to recruitment <Col N="1271" /> schemes contained in the eight operational programmes in the Community Support Framework for Ireland. My Department are also co-ordinating the human resource aspect of EC initiatives known as NOW, EUROFORM, HORIZON and INTERREG.  Preparations have started in relation to EC support for our human resource development programmes after 1993.</P>
    <P>Employment Rights &mdash; a Bill to amend the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, is at an advanced stage of preparation and it is hoped to bring it before the Oireachtas shortly.</P>
    <P>A Bill is being prepared which will propose to create an entitlement to leave from employment for adoptive mothers.</P>
    <P>Arising from commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, work has commenced on legislative reviews including the holidays and conditions of employment legislation and the employment status of agency workers. The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, is also being reviewed in the context of implementing an EC Directive on the contract of employment relationship.</P>
    <P>My Department are responsible for servicing the EC negotiations on the proposal by the Council for Directives concerning organisation of working time, protection of pregnant women, posting of workers abroad and the protection of young persons.</P>
    <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department will continue to enforce the worker protection legislation, employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  In addition, other enforcement activities continue including the processing of cases of employers' failure to comply with Employment Appeals Tribunal decisions or to otherwise meet their obligations under conditions of employment legislation.</P>
    <P>Employment Equality &mdash; legislation in the equality area is being examined and I expect to be in a position to shortly seek Government approval for the drafting of an amending Bill.</P>
    <P>Redundancy and Insolvency &mdash;<Col N="1272" /> administrative procedures to ensure speedy and efficient payments of entitlements under the Redundancy Payments and Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The issue of equal opportunity is one which I intend to continue to promote in my Department.  My Department support the equal opportunity policy and guidelines for the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>In line with that policy, my Department have already taken various initiatives to promote equal opportunity among staff, including the organisation of (i) a number of seminars on management and equality and (ii) assertiveness training modules for staff in various grades.</P>
      <P>With regard to future actions, I am considering further ways of developing equal opportunities in my Department. One proposal that I have in mind is that my officials will discuss shortly with staff representatives an outline of a more detailed departmental policy in this area.</P>
      <P>Finally, with regard to the Department's promotion policy, promotion of staff, both women and men, is on the basis of merit and ability.  Consistent with this policy, qualified women continue to benefit from promotional opportunities in the Department.</P>

      <P>The EC Charter of Fundamental Social Rights was adopted in the form of a solemn declaration by 11 Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Strasbourg on 8 and 9 December 1989.  It postulates a set of principles relating to social rights and does not purport to offer a shorthand version of legislative programmes.  The charter envisages initiatives being taken to implement these social rights in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity which implies that action at Community level is only warranted where it has added value and where there is a need for such Community action.</P>
      <P>The charter does not involve the imposition of a unified system on member states and this is reflected in its many references to national laws, collective agreements and to other practices which exist or are currently in force at various appropriate levels in the member states of the Community.  Consequently, it is inappropriate to view the objectives enshrined in the charter as necessarily requiring legislative action at the European Community level.</P>
      <P>In view of the nature and content of the charter it is not possible to arrive at an estimate of the costs which might arise as a consequence to any initiatives to give effect to any of its principles in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the charter, the European Commission was invited to submit to the Council of Ministers possible initiatives which fall within its powers, with a view to the adoption of legal instruments for the effective implementation, as and when the Internal Market is completed, of those rights which it considered relevant to the Community's area of competence.  The Commission's response took the form of an action programme which features 47 separate initiatives, not all of which come within the jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eight of these represent legal instruments which have already been adopted <Col N="1274" /> by Council, a common position has been agreed on four such instruments while 16 proposed instruments are currently the subject of technical discussion in the Council's social questions working group.  A total of 14 measures have yet to be submitted to the Council by the Commission.  A further five items which have been submitted by the Commission comprise reports or communications on which no further action is required by Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to the Community Charter as a basis for achieving a strong social dimension to complement the economic objective of completion of the Single Market and we are co-operating constructively in examination of each proposal submitted to the Council under the Commission's action programme. Our approach is to examine each such proposal on its merits seeking to achieve a fair balance between desirable social progress in the interests of workers and the capacity of employers and Governments to undertake the corresponding obligations.  We assess each proposal by reference to its implications for employment in Ireland which remains the main priority of the Government.</P>
