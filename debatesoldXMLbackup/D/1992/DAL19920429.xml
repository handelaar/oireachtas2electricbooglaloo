      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach about the promised legislation to provide for the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty?  The ratification of the Treaty is very important for this country for a number of sound economic and social reasons.  Would the Taoiseach agree that in the best interests of the passage of this legislation he should desist from impromptu and ill-considered comments on the matter?  Will he allow those who wish to put forward serious arguments in favour of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty to do so without his assistance?</P>

However, if they insist on getting information, it is my duty to respond to such requests.</P>

      <P>One point that is very much in order is that until recently we understood the Attorney General has a clear constitutional position.

I would ask the Taoiseach to arrange to bring forward the debate on the Estimates for the Taoiseach's Department and particularly the debate on the Estimates for the Attorney General's Vote so that we could properly debate in this House the conflicting advice given by the Attorney General.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had commenced my contribution at approximately 6.50 p.m. yesterday before the House adjourned this debate.  I had made the observation that the Minister's long and comprehensive Second Stage opening speech was a document that had been written in three parts. The first part was a fairly reasonable and objective assessment of the Irish economy's performance to date and its prospects for the next year.  The second part was the rhetorical exposition of the Government's position policy in relation to the question of employment.  The third part, which was a substantive part of a long speech, was a description in detail of the Finance Bill.  There is little or no connection between the three parts of the Minister's speech and I intend to explain why.  Yesterday I quoted from the Minister's speech as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in the final analysis, there is only so much that any Government can do. They can make a key contribution by ensuring that their broad policy stance is conducive to employment growth. We have done so.  They should ensure <Col N="1900" /> that, in its detail, Government policy minimises any disincentive effects on private effort and enterprise.  We are doing so, not least through the substantial tax reforms in this and recent budgets.  They should provide leadership on growth oriented policies. Again, we have done so.  But in the final analysis our progress will be determined by how well the private sector uses the opportunity so created.  In the part, it has shown that, given the right conditions, it can create a significant number of new jobs.  For example, between April 1987 and April 1991, net non-agricultural employment in the private sector rose by over 70,000.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I want to say the Labour Party do not share the philosophical view articulated so clearly by the Government in the Minister's speech in the paragraph I have just quoted.  If this country needed evidence of the capability of the Irish private sector to create the level of employment necessary to deal with the highest level of unemployment in the entire European Community then, surely that evidence is all around us.  Good as many components of the Irish private sector are, and good as is the managerial ability of many companies and their professional staff to perform well in a highly competitive international market, it simply is not good enough.  That is no reflection on the private sector in general or, indeed, on some of the outstanding companies within it.</P>
    <P>For any Government, but particularly for a Fianna Fáil Government, to rely so exclusively now on the private sector to create the level of economic activity and growth which in turn will consequently lead to employment creation, is very naive.  I cannot but wonder at the continued wagging of the dog by the tail of the Progressive Democrats in relation to this particular area of economic policy.</P>
    <P>I said on a previous occasion there is now broad economic and political consensus inside and outside this House on the need for us to operate within a very tight fiscal environment where budget deficits, borrowing and recourse to easy <Col N="1901" /> spending are no longer an option that is available to the body politic in Ireland. There may from time to time, be temptations on all sides in relation to that.  We have learned, however, the cruel lessons of profligate spending which started in 1977 and which of necessity had to be slowed down through the eighties with a great degree of both physical and political pain.  I do not think any practising politician inside this House or any person charged with involvement in the social partnership outside this House, particularly through organisations such as ICTU, FIE, CII or the IFA, want to go back down that road because we have all learned the costly lessons from the past.</P>
    <P>To simply throw our hats at the economy and say, as a Government or as a Legislature, there is little or nothing we can do other than to create the right conditions for the private sector, is an abrogation of what this country is capable of doing and what this Government should be doing.</P>
    <P>At the outset I want to say clearly that I do not agree with the Government's opening thesis.  However, we are in Opposition, and confronting the Minister with a counter philosophy would be of little benefit to constructive debate because the Minister or his Government would disagree.</P>
    <P>What I propose to do is to take the Minister's own terms of reference, the Minister's own starting point which is not unreasonable, and test this Bill against the standards he claims he has set and which he asserts are being met by the measures in the Bill.  I can find nothing in this long Bill that will create one additional job.  I hope the Minister will come back to that on Second Stage or, more productively, on Committee Stage because I do not believe he is not interested in job creation.  I believe he is passionately committed to creating jobs but perhaps he is a prisoner of a Cabinet that will not let him do it the way his instincts would want him to.  I am, therefore, open to challenge in the claims I will make about this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me quote the Minister's assertions written by the Department of Finance <Col N="1902" /> and authorised by the Minister that the climate for enterprise is being created within this Bill.  He said, &ldquo;It should ensure that in its detail Government policy minimises any disincentive effects on private effort and enterprise.&rdquo;  Let us look at what the Government have done in respect of the DIRT and the provisions for the special savings accounts.  There is little or no alternative economic activity at present that will guarantee a gross 10 per cent return after tax to the establishment of the special savings account proposed by the Government.  There was a time when unearned income attracted a higher level of taxation because it was unearned and did not produce employment for other people but, of necessity, the Minister has brought in a mechanism which is excessively cautious and will not meet the requirements in the paragraph I quoted.</P>
    <P>I could accept the argument that caution must prevail as we move through the uncharted waters of 1993 to protect the Irish banking system which has not yet suffered the rigours of international competition in the same way as other areas of the Irish economy, if the Minister recognised that this would not improve the climate for investment, for risk taking and for enterprise and did certain other things in the Finance Bill to encourage people to use the tax system in a way that would enable them to take risks and to invest.  That would be a fairly reasonable approach within the philosophical framework that the Minister has set for himself. However he has not done that.  On the contrary, every tax shelter that was established over a period of time to encourage people to invest some of their income to produce additional jobs has been systematically eliminated.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Noonan estimated that approximately £37 million had been saved by the elimination of these tax shelters. Many of them cost the Exchequer very little.  Their elimination from the Finance Bill speaks volumes about this Government's desire to eliminate any incentive for investment and any encouragement to take risks.  It is, therefore, totally at variance with the Minister's <Col N="1903" /> philosophical assertion when he set out the ideology upon which the Government's policy is based.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to give specific details. The Minister has rowed back in one area, but with a miserable and mean attitude which defies explanation.  Perhaps he will take note of my concern and offer a reason in due course.  I had a priority question to the Minister in relation to the employee share option scheme where there were about 80,000 beneficiaries, not necessarily 80,000 individuals because in some cases there was evidence to indicate that the same person had bought on a number of occasions.  The Minister did not cover this provision in his budget speech and he has now decided to bring it back but at a reduced level from £5,000 to £2,000.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why this limit has been cut from £5,000 to £2,000.  Either it was right to leave it out or it was right to leave it in, but reducing it by approximately 60 per cent is the argument of Solomon in reverse; it is maintaining face for somebody in some Department who wanted to eliminate it and responding to the considerable lobby that came at the Minister from all sides, some of them quoting the words from the booklet that was issued last summer.  A compromise was reached.  The limit is now £2,000 instead of £5,000.</P>
    <P>Is this some kind of internal debate within the Department of Finance?  Did an official or the Minister feel he had to assuage certain lobbies?  Why reduce it from £5,000 to £2,000?  Why not take it out altogether or leave as it was?  What would be the savings?  Why alter the regime?  Perhaps the Minister will respond to that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other changes the Minister made in regard to employees although I would have preferred if he had left the limit at £5,000.  The second change the Minister made relates to benefit-in-kind on cars for sales representatives. We will have to deal with that matter in some detail on Committee Stage as the &ldquo;autophobia&rdquo; of the Civil <Col N="1904" /> Service, as someone described it, will have to be teased out once and for all.</P>
    <P>The changes the Minister made in relation to public houses have a certain degree of rationality about them that is infinitely preferable to the arbitrary valuation base originally proposed in the budget.  However, I would like the Minister to explain the reason he decided to impose an additional once-off cost on the more substantial pubs without phasing it in or giving advance notice.  If a public house is at the top of the range &mdash; many Dublin pubs would be at the top of the range with a turnover of £1 million &mdash; it will have to pay an extra £60 per week given that the cost of a licence is to be increased from £100 to £3,000, a substantial increase.  Given the sum the Minister is likely to collect &mdash; from memory, approximately £2 million &mdash; if we phase it in over two to three years the pubs which are not doing well at present will be able to respond more easily and readily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes more sense. Depending on the way their accounts go the revenue raised should be looked at. While I welcome the Minister's intervention I would like to see the Government systematically analysing the revenue that could be generated from all the licenses we offer for trading purposes in our economy.  They are instruments which have a high value if we take, for example, the exchange value of taxi licences.  We may find that this is new sources of revenue for the Exchequer but it should be collected in such a manner that we do not disrupt the existing pattern of trade.  The changes should be introduced in such a way that the market can absorb them without distortion and transitional difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes and modifications <Col N="1905" /> the Minister made in response to the suggestions in the budget debate and it would be churlish of me not to recognise them.  I recognise also that the preparation of the legislation to deal with the new regime post-1993 will impose enormous pressures on the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.  Therefore, I will be as sympathetic as I possibly can.  I do not think any of us expect the Minister to get it 100 per cent right in year one; we are entering unchartered waters and if this does not work next year, we must reconsider it. Our society is too small, our governmental system is too compact and the constraints on the public service are too severe to allow us the luxury of indulging in false debate and antagonism as we are about to enter a period of prospective prosperity but which nevertheless will be fraught with difficulties.  That point has to be made not only to the Minister but to those behind him who put in place the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the philosophy of enterprise the Minister claims underpins many of the Bills provisions.  I cannot find any measure that will create a single job. The Minister deleted provisions which would encourage investment such as the tax shelters which were available in the past.  Tax shelters can produce loopholes which are exploited to the point where the system is abused but this cannot be used as a philosophical argument against providing incentives.  It is a very good argument in favour of closing off loopholes in the first place as the human condition will legally exploit any possibility in order to maximise its own private return.  That is the way most societies operate.  We should not be surprised therefore if people perform and operate in this manner.</P>
    <P>Another incentive arbitrarily removed in the Bill was the tax concession for holiday homes.  The Government are attempting to promote the tourism industry and are boasting about the amount of money they are likely to get under the cohesion package and the Structural Funds.  They state that much of this money will be used to underpin tourism <Col N="1906" /> infrastructure which in turn should lead to the creation of employment.  Of necessity, most of the projects the Government are investing in are large scale infrastructural projects to attract tourists from continental Europe.  Those tourists will use and pay for facilities which, in the main, will be run by private operators.  It makes no sense therefore for the Government to have a policy of investment in tourism infrastructure if it is not matched by one of investment by the private sector in tourist facilities.</P>
    <P>Section 24 was one of the few remaining provisions which encouraged such private sector investment in holiday homes and facilities to upgrade privately run operations around the country.  One project in County Wicklow is about to come to a standstill.  In deference to the conventions of this House it would not be proper to mention the names of those involved or give the details but I can cite the case as an example.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate if our interpretation is correct.  The project in question involves the construction of an equestrian centre, with residential accommodation, at an approximate cost of £3 million.  They received the necessary certification from the Revenue Commissioners and Bord Fáilte of their eligibility for tax concessions which, in part, will be abolished following the passing of section 24.</P>
    <P>Two problems arise.  First, section 24 is a mistake because it will kill off new projects which have not yet reached the stage of certification and are the subject of negotiations with Bord Fáilte or the Revenue Commissioners.  There is a real problem in that the people who gave an undertaking to invest approximately £3 million, £1 million of which has already been spent, now find that any costs incurred after 24 April will not be eligible for tax deductions.  There is nothing in the section to indicate that this section will only apply in the case of new projects and not to projects in the course of construction.</P>
    <P>There is a clear and well established precedent in this House, as part and parcel of the culture of our democracy, that you cannot have retrospective legislation, <Col N="1907" /> that people who enter into activities which are legal on a particular day and in good faith undertake investment decisions and commitments contractually in relation to expenditure in the belief that a certain tax regime, among other things, prevails at that time cannot, subsequently and retrospectively, have the regime under which they made certain critical economic decisions whipped from under their feet, removing the logic of the investment decision in the first place. Will the Minister confirm that the operation of section 24 will apply only to projects contemplated after 24 April and that projects currently on site, which have been properly certified and stamped by the relevant authority, will not be affected?  Because this matter has been brought to my attention I feel obliged to mention it because my understanding is that the 20 or 30 workers on site will be given protective notice from next Friday, 1 May.  Perhaps somebody in the Minister's office would clarify this matter for me?</P>
    <P>There are many other such projects contemplated or being looked at and many will not go any further because the economics of tourism relative to the cost of money and the cost of the provision of the standard of services required will not stand up given the scale and length of our tourism season unless there is some degree of either grant or tax incentive, in other words, unless there is something which promotes private effort and enterprise. This is a clear disincentive to private efforts and enterprise, notwithstanding what the Minister asserted in his speech.</P>
    <P>In the Bill which was circulated the Minister did not refer to the extension of the deadline for either the completion of the designated areas or the financial services.  I am happy that in his speech the Minister did so.  I appreciate the time constraints under which the Department were working &mdash; it is not a criticism &mdash; but I had prepared notes prior to the Minister's speech in this respect.  I note that the final date for designated areas is May 1984 and I think a different date <Col N="1908" /> applies to the Custom House Docks site. Whatever about that development which is <i>sui generis</i> and which, in addition to the broad array of incentives open to it similar to the designated areas, it also has very attractive financial incentives of a different kind and an executive promotional authority in the form of the Custom House Docks Development Authority promoting it, which should be allowed to go its own way, I earnestly request the Minister to think again about the final deadline he has given in relation to the timetable.  The benefits of the designated urban areas tax regime can come into play when the building is complete. The gestation period for any building of the scale which would operate there &mdash; a small, mixed commercial and residential or a separate side by side operation &mdash; is nothing like 12 or 15 months.  Between planning permission and planning appeals the norm for most proposals needing planning permission in the Dublin inner city area is much longer than the people in the Department of the Environment or the Department of Finance fully appreciate and understand. I speak unashamedly about the area I know best but I am sure this is true in relation to the larger urban areas in Cork, Limerick and Waterford and, to a lesser extend, in Galway.  An extension to May 1994 is not enough if it is to be the final deadline.  We have had the designated areas concept now since 1986 and it should be extended to 1995 or 1996 at which time we could examine a whole new set of incentives.  At that time whatever will be developed under that tax regime will have been built and we should then do away with those kind of interventionist mechanisms and think afresh in the light of the experience and knowledge which we would have acquired.</P>
    <P>The Minister is familiar with the committee on the economy of Dublin which met in the Mansion House under the chairmanship of the Lord Mayor which Alderman Michael Donnelly of Fianna Fáil, the previous chairman of the committee, attended.  The officials from Dublin Corporation indicated that they had made submissions in the first instance <Col N="1909" /> to the Department of the Environment about extending the deadline.  Anyone in the construction industry will confirm that the deadline for the final operation of the regime of tax incentives for the urban designated areas in May 1994 is too tight.  There is an attitude within some official thinking that if we keep the deadline tight we will bring forward investment now and that, of necessity, next year we will announce that we will add another year.  That has a certain logical appeal to people who do not know the process fully.  There is uncertainty in the market and an oversupply of retail and commercial office space which has been well documented.  The lead-in time is too short, nothing will be gained and no significant investment will be made in the urban areas by virtue of threatening to have the cut-off point in 1994 instead of 1995 or 1996.  The Minister should seriously consider nominating 1996 as the deadline which would mean that the system would have been in place for ten years.  At that stage there could be a whole new package based on the experience of how the old regime had functioned.  The acquisition and assembly time of sites is very time consuming as there could be three or four different ownership interests in relation to one building.  It is quite different from the normal green field type operation.  I know there are very good people in the Department of the Environment and Dublin Corporation who have had experience in these matters.  However, the construction industry have a fair view regarding constraints and difficulties and they should be consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's intervention and I know he is right.  When George Redmond was the very effective assistant city manager in charge of planning &mdash; he is now retired &mdash; at any one time, before designation was introduced, <Col N="1910" /> there was always far more by way of planning permission documents in existence than there was economic activity.  I do not know the reason but that was the case.  People get planning permission &mdash; they do not necessarily pay their architects the fees due &mdash; and then hold it for some reason or another, not exclusively economic or related to market conditions; there can be other factors.  The argument that many planning permissions of the designated areas status are not moving at present and therefore an extension of the deadline from 1994 to 1996 will cause delay is not necessarily true.  First of all, the designated status and the tax concessions that it conveys will not of themselves make an uneconomic proposition viable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Institute of Taxation stated in a detailed paper published about three months ago, that will also bring forward investment.  It does have the incentive impact that the Minister talks about.  It will not transform the market demand, because the market demand is absolute and outside of that kind of consideration, but it will distort its location and the timetable of its delivery. In reply to the Minister's assertion that the Bill is an incentive to effort and enterprise, I argue that to simply impose May 1994 as the final cut-off date will not have the desired effect.  For that reason, I strongly urge that the matter be reconsidered. The Labour Party may table an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage, but I am giving the Minister, through the Chair, the benefit of time for consideration in advance of Committee Stage in that the constraints of time may not allow us to go into the issue in great detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the taxation of co-operatives as another area of incentive and <Col N="1911" /> enterprise in private growth.  I have to confess that there are not too many agricultural co-operatives in the constituency of Dublin South-East.  Indeed, our last few allotments were terminated fairly recently.  I therefore speak on this subject with less direct experience than on the previous one.  It is obvious that as the co-operatives become more involved in the agribusiness sector of the economy they will have a bigger productive role to play in the creation of wealth and the harnessing of private investment.  By and large, the performance of co-operatives in the Irish agricultural economy in terms of job creation and job consolidation and in longevity in terms of their contribution to Irish society is in marked contrast to that of the beef barons.  The added value in food processing that the large, publicly quoted agricultural co-operatives have made is dramatically different from that which the beef barons can point to.</P>
    <P>The changes within the EC that will occur in the Common Agricultural Policy and the changes in world agricultural pricing that will result from the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations will of themselves put severe pressures on agricultural co-operatives.  I should have thought, therefore, that introducing the co-operatives &mdash; and, as has been said, they are not all large &mdash; into a full frontal taxation regime of 40 per cent would be done more sensitively and with more caution.  We know the Irish farming culture and that farmers' attitudes to grants and to the payment of taxes are diametrically opposed: grants should be received and tax should not be paid.  It will take time to change that culture, but it is slowly changing and that change should be encouraged.  For the benefit of the additional revenue that the Exchequer will gain, I cannot reconcile the way in which the regime is proposed and the reason that it is proposed, against the Minister's assertion, contained in his speech, that private effort and enterprise should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The change proposed to wear and tear allowances has been welcomed by people in the business of leasing equipment, <Col N="1912" /> mostly to small businesses who find it difficult enough to get equity capital and find it very difficult to get loans from banks at reasonable rates and on reasonable conditions and who therefore avail of leasing opportunities on good terms from various leasing companies to get the basic equipment to run their operations, the industrial equipment to carry out processing, the vehicles necessary to distribute goods and the office equipment for administrative work.  The shift in the regime to 15 per cent on a straight line over seven years with the final year at 10 per cent has been welcomed in the sense that it is a regime more easily understood and computed.  However, the seven year period of leasing as set out in the wear and tear allowances does not fit in with the market practice operated by standard leasing companies in terms of the duration of leases in that the market conditions for leasing hire suggest a period of between three and five years, with a five-year maximum.  I hope that the Minister will respond to this point.  For the life of me, I cannot understand the way in which a Government so committed to the ideology of the market and a Department so versed in the knowledge and the intricacies, if not the mystical attractions, of the market have not decided to fit a taxation regime in terms of a time limit to the lease period that normally operates in the same market.</P>
    <P>Again within the philosophical framework that the Minister set for himself in his speech, perhaps he will say whether in the course of reviewing the wear and tear allowance the Department considered what the market was actually doing and the way in which a tight fit and an economic fit could be achieved between those who are offering leasehold finance and those who are trying to run the system, that is, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners. The view expressed to me by specialists and professionals in this area is that the benefits to small companies of leasing as against purchase or hire purchase that did exist have now been eroded and people will be enticed or encouraged to question why they should <Col N="1913" /> lease when they could buy at nearly similar prices.  That might appear to be a good thing on the surface, but, in fact, for many people it will tie scarce capital into the buying of equipment when they could lease and hire the same equipment at a time when they need to focus their capital on other areas.  The wear and tear allowances provision does not seem to have been properly handled by the Minister within the objectives set for the Finance Bill as an incentive to employment.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak briefly about banks and financial institutions.  The change in the bank levy and the proposal to make it dynamically interactive with corporation tax is a good measure.  It introduces a degree of relationship between banking performance and the levy that might perhaps have been absent previously.  There is an incentive for banks when they make profits and pay tax on them to offset those profits against the bank levy.  Now that the banks have extracted their pound of flesh from the IBOA, perhaps they will be in a position to make the kind of profits here that they could be and should be making and which most of their small business customers believe they are making, in a way that would work positively with the bank levy in the manner set out in this Bill.  There is a good deal of merit in the change that has been made, linking in a dynamic way the bank levy and corporation tax.</P>
    <P>With regard to benefit in kind taxation, I suggested that there seems to be in the minds of some public officials a kind of auto-phobia, that benefit in kind in relation to access to motor cars is something that should be rigorously attacked. That is not the only type of benefit-in-kind. If we are to move towards a regime which will tax benefit-in-kind and fringe benefits, everything must be on the table. I note that the Minister is committed to introducing a provision in the second Finance Bill for 1992 to deal with the complex area of fringe benefits.  Some of us have read some of the complex documentation to which the Minister referred, particularly that relating to Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside my ministerial pension, <Col N="1914" /> my biggest benefit-in-kind as a result of being a Member of this House is my pension. My index linked pension on top of the public pay escalator is something one could not buy on the open commercial market.  Three BMWs given free over my 46 years working &mdash; if I continue here for another 19 years &mdash; would not equate to the value of the benefit-in-kind any Deputy would acquire here after eight years service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how long one lives on pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  The public pay salary bill will go up by at least 8 per cent this year.  Lest anyone think I am attacking civil servants, we too are part of the public sector.  Many people in the social partnership have their salaries and conditions linked to the public sector and they, too, are in this area.</P>
      <P>Benefit-in-kind associated with conditions of employment in a particular area affects everyone.  The apprentice working in a butcher shop can come home with sirloin beef without paying the full market price.  Somebody working in the travel agent business will have access to cheaper holidays and people working in clothing shops get a chance to buy seconds.  Every employment has a fringe benefit depending on the nature of the job.  Politicians and civil servants have fringe benefits with regard to pensions. The provision does no just relate to cars, unless one is a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public sector pay bill, including our salaries, increased by 8 per cent in 1990, by 9 per cent in 1991 and it will increase by 9 per cent in 1992 while inflation on average was from 3 to 3.3 per cent.  If we are to go after benefit-in-kind and fringe benefits, we must be prepared to go all the way and look at the imputed cost of pension entitlements for public servants.  The taxation system already does that with regard to bank officials and others who have access to subsidised mortgages and loans.  If somebody gets a subsidised loan at 3 per cent, he is assesed as having benefit in kind of 7 per cent, bringing it up to 10 per cent.  There is a <Col N="1915" /> proposal in this Bill to increase this to 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister is no doubt aware that in relation to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations and the attitude to public sector pay and conditions there is a growing feeling in the exposed market sector that attention is being focused on only some aspects of benefit-in-kind.  If we want to promote enterprise, effort and incentive, why do we have to hammer only benefit-in-kind associated with somebody only getting a 1.6 litre or a 1.8 litre motor car as part of their remuneration package?  The sentiments expressed by the sales representatives on the question of benefit-in-kind go deep.  The Minister should take note of what I am saying because this problem will only surface in the second Finance Bill when we look at the question of fringe benefits.</P>
    <P>This is all predicated on the view that if one taxes all fringe benefits as income we will get a more equitable base.  That is correct in theory but by introducing this measure, we may not get the desired economic effect of effort, enterprise and employment creation which in turn underpins the idea of tax reduction for personal income.  The ideology of the Progressive Democrats is that if you reduce personal income tax it will release monetary energy into the economy, which will have a big employment impact, that anything that would enable us to reduce personal income tax is to be encouraged and that, therefore, no holds should be barred in the scrutiny of benefits-in-kind and fringe benefits.  That seems to be the intellectual pyramid of the arguments.  The base on which that pyramid stands has not been proved.</P>
    <P>We now have lower levels of personal taxation than we had for a long time and we have continually rising unemployment. Britain, the nearest market we can look to in terms of a political economy we can evaluate, went down that road and produced a situation in which many people had a lot of cash but the spending of that money did not result in the creation of significant extra <Col N="1916" /> employment within that society.  If the object of the exercise is the reduction of personal income tax resulting in more jobs being created, then there is no objective evidence available to me that proves that case.  That is not to say that everyone of us would like to have to pay less personal income tax; of course we would. I am not saying that I am against the reduction of personal income tax but I am not arguing for its reduction on the basis that that would create more jobs because there is nothing to suggest that would be the case.  Therefore, we must separate those two points.</P>
    <P>On the question of benefit-in-kind and taxation, it is essential that the Government realise that if the object of the exercise is to promote effort and enterprise, getting people committed to their jobs and the maximisation of employment <i>vis-à-vis</i> their jobs, seeking markets abroad, this aspect is indeed important.  For example, I can foresee a possibility that benefit-in-kind would focus on some of the fringe benefits attached to travel.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  Most of us who have had to travel and be away from home from time to time &mdash; as part and parcel of our work abroad &mdash; have telephoned home, spoken to our wives and families, on occasions reassuring our parents; in other words just maintaining contact. Maintaining that level of personal communication harmony in our private lives is a desirable objective but it is essential if a long distance sales person is to be of a frame of mind that will enable him or her to undertake a committed day's work the following day.</P>
    <P>That poses the question: is such a private telephone call to the wife, husband or mother deemed to be a benefit-in-kind, to be taxed, or will it be deemed to be a legitimate cost associated with the commercial activities of a long distance sales person?  I suspect there is a very austere view that would separate one from the other, at which point one begins to lose the argument.  Certainly one will begin to lose people's enthusiasm, those who want to go abroad to promote/sell goods and services for our economy.  I use that example to illustrate a point that <Col N="1917" /> overall fringe benefits and their role as a motivation to perform above the odds is much more than the crude calculation of external income brought onto the pitch so that it can be quantified, given equivalent monetary value and, consequently, taxed.  If the Minister's objectives are to promote private effort and enterprise, then the psychological/factual role of those fringe benefits in encouraging people toward private effort and enterprise should be assessed before the baby is thrown out with the bath water.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes introduced in the patent income sphere because, from my knowledge, I understand there has been a small amount of abuse in this area particularly on the part of people in the unique position of being able to control both the ownership of the patent and the distribution of the product, those who could engage in transfer pricing.  The proposal to limit such activity to the coffers of the company but not enable it spill into the pockets of the individual is a good one.</P>
    <P>However, I would warn the Minister that, in abolishing a benefit that has been exploited to the point of abuse &mdash; I use my words advisedly &mdash; albeit on the part of a very small number of people, because only a very small number are capable of manipulating the price of the value of the patent to the point at which they can actually extract in any meaningful sense &mdash; illustrates that it is a devise that clearly did not work in promoting innovation and enterprise since it has been in existence since the mid-seventies with little or no impact, but its concept theory is not necessarily wrong.</P>
    <P>I should have thought a contravailing measure would have been inserted elsewhere in this Bill to cover that aspect.  I know the Minister has not entirely abolished it and that it remains in the case of companies but, if private enterprise and effort are to be the engine that characterises the privisions of this Bill, I contend the Minister has simply knocked another element designed to promote private enterprise and it has not been substituted by anything else.  Therefore, <Col N="1918" /> it can be clearly seen that the baby has been thrown out with the bath water.</P>
    <P>At this moment the Government have consultants examining the possibility of constructing a science park in the greater Dublin area that would tap into the intellectual energy and creativity of people in our third level institutions, that is those in TCD, UCD and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  As the House will be aware the concept of a science park is that of an industrial estate with brains, which is probably the best way one could describe it, attached to a university; that is not to assert <i>ipso facto</i> that always one will find brains in a university.  The idea is to harness the intellectual energy of pure research into its practical application in a manner that might result in creative products that could be exploited commercially for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>Some of the greatest exponents of the science park concept have been the Israelis who have harnessed the intellectual energies of their universities into very productive spheres in science parks visibly associated with their universities.  For example, we have one in Limerick, in Plessey, associated with Limerick University, a very progressive go ahead one. Among all the other requirements of those science parks to get up and running there will be the need for some replacement of the patent income, some incentive for the individual scientist, lecturer or researcher to pursue his or her field of study above and beyond the norm, perhaps that of a particular idea or theory that can be turned into a manufacturing success.  If the Minister is committed to private enterprise and effort I contend he has closed one door but I do not see that he has opened another anywhere else.  I would invite him to consider that in the context of the philosophical objective.</P>
    <P>I have not gone into the question of petroleum taxation in any great detail because of its complexity and because there was a time constraint not merely on the Government in the production of this Bill but also on the Opposition in their endeavour to digest it.  There is something extraordinary about petroleum exploration here, the fascination <Col N="1919" /> it has both for politicians and punters, if I may use that phrase, Sir, conscious of your occasional weaknesses in that area. One stockbroker told me that in the early eighties the Irish stock market, a very small one, was able to raise something of the order of £100 million of speculative money for oil shares.  Probably they would have been better off compiling a syndicate for the national lottery; certainly they would have had better times had they gone to Cheltenham for three days or up to Leopardstown.</P>
    <P>If one examines the figures for the various quoted shares and sees the &ldquo;highs&rdquo; of £6, £7 and in some cases, £10, one will realise the money was there but now the share prices are down to single figures, in pennies, and that market has disappeared.  Perhaps it smacks of the national lottery syndrome.  Perhaps it is associated with so much of the literature of the western world &mdash; the &ldquo;get rich and strike it rich&rdquo;, in Klondike, in Alaskan or Californian terms.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that there is this perception that there is a golden bonanza out there.  We have endeavoured on different occasions in this House to devise a tax regime to promote oil exploration and investment in addition to the clear indication that there is an investment market out there that would regard oil shares with the degree of fairy-like belief that transcends all market probability, which nevertheless rushes ahead to invest.  We still do not have a taxation regime that works to the point that we achieve significant levels of exploration that would reduce our dependency on imported oil and produce on-shore oil here.</P>
    <P>Since there is at present no tax revenue or yield from this activity, I am prepared to suspend judgment on the operation of the petroleum taxation regime and the changes being proposed in this Bill because, in fairness, the previous regime did not produce any kind of activity. Therefore, any change which would result in any such activity should be carefully examined.  We will have to come back to the point either on Committee <Col N="1920" /> Stage or at a later stage when we have seen how it functions and operates.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposed income and capital tax changes.  Contrary to most people's beliefs, expectations or hopes, income tax will increase this year in real terms and the level of tax paid by most people &mdash; there will always be exceptions &mdash; will increase.  Whatever about the mandarins in the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance, most people regard PRSI and income tax as two similar inter-connected taxes. There is little if any distinction now made &mdash; there is certainly none made in the minds of ordinary citizens &mdash; between PRSI and tax.  Our analysis indicates &mdash; this figure may be verified by the Minister in his reply &mdash; that the total revenue take for the year 1991-92, including PRSI, will increase by approximately 7 per cent at a time when inflation will be 3.5 per cent. In broad terms, the Minister is taking more rather than less tax.  Consequently, the framework set out by the Minister in page 7 of his speech about giving encouragement to private effort in enterprise will not be brought about as a result of this tax proposal.</P>
    <P>Having made that broad general point on a macro scale, I wish to focus on the aspects of the personal income tax and capital gains tax proposals.  With regard to personal income tax, it is clear, and will become clear when the employment committee are up and running, that there is a severe threshold barrier for people who are currently on social welfare and who have the possibility of getting employment for a wage of between £120 and £180 per week, depending on their personal circumstances, in that the taxation barrier at the point of shifting from social welfare income to employment, albeit at low wages, is too high and the associated penalties in transferring from dependency to employment make it impossible for a large number of people to cross that barrier.  For example, there will be loss of entitlement in relation to the benefits-in-kind associated with people on social welfare &mdash; access to reduced rents if you are a local authority <Col N="1921" /> tenant, access to medical card entitlement, etc.  It would appear that the taxation system is preoccupied with people at the top end of the scale who are paying a lot of tax.  The Progressive Democrats tail is not wagging the Fianna Fáil dog at this stage but lacerating it.  However, when one looks at the official figures given for people paying the top level of tax this number is minuscule.  Nevertheless, the concern still seems to be with them rather than with the people who pay low levels of tax.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say, as he can legitimately do in his reply, that as a result of this year's taxation provisions in the Finance Bill so many people will be taken out of the net altogether.  This precisely reinforces the very point I am trying to make.</P>
    <P>I believe we are trying to create a culture where the maximum number of people possible can be at work, where everybody who is at work pays some tax and where the more you earn the more you pay.  The idea that there is a very large gap or threshold between the payment and the non-payment of tax on your income depending on whether you are at work or on social welfare is a self-imposed internal impediment to employment creation in our society; it is the engine which is driving the black economy in our society.  Everyone in this House, including no doubt the Acting Chairman, have tangible and direct anecdotal experience of these things.  By virtue of our job and our obligation to mix, meet and listen to people the anecdotal experience of a politician is different from that of someone who happens to be in business or a particular area of employment.  It is an experience which has great statistical validity and, therefore, should be listened to.  I will criticise the Bill severely in this area.</P>
    <P>Like many other thousands of organisations, the Labour Party made a pre-budget submission.  I know that these have a certain status in the Department of Finance irrespective of who happens to be Minister for Finance.  We have to find a way within our taxation regime not only to reduce the overall level of <Col N="1922" /> personal income tax which is too high as a proportion of income, notwithstanding the alleged impact it might have on job creation, but to ease people back into paid employment and paying tax.  We are not doing this at present.  I am not sure I have an instant set of answers which I can offer the Minister.  However, I have some ideas and the people working for the Labour Party on the research side have some ideas and suggestions about the introduction of a low level of tax.  It could very well be argued that we had such a tax before.  In fact, it was the Labour Party in Government who took it out.  I think there was an introductory tier of 25 per cent.  Perhaps in the light of our experience now &mdash; I have no hesitation about being open to learning from our experience, mistakes we have made or changes in conditions &mdash; we should be looking at such a rate of tax for the first £1,500 or £1,000 of earned income.</P>
    <P>Unless we do something very dramatic, a young semi-skilled person in their mid-twenties with one or two dependent children is destined in the present climate to permanent unemployment in our society. Indeed these frightening figures are contained in the Minister's speech, which may not necessarily be the fault of the Government &mdash; it is too easy to lacerate them.  Notwithstanding the job creation efforts of the private sector, due to the demography of our society on the one hand and the continual shedding of agricultural labour on the other we are going to have an extra expenditure of £25 million in this year's budget because of the increases in unemployment.  Many of the people who will be laid off or become unemployed will be condemned to a period of long term permanent unemployment unless we change the entry point of taxation for them.  Many of the jobs being created on the margins pay that level of salary and, therefore, will run into the threshold to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The other area of personal taxation which the Bill confines itself to is capital taxation.  I am amazed at the way in which the Government, who have again asserted their commitment to the promotion <Col N="1923" /> of private effort in enterprise as a key feature of this Bill, have seen fit to change the sliding scale of capital taxation from 60 per cent to 30 per cent, which was the original sliding scale as I understand it.  There is now a flat rate of 40 per cent which means that in some cases the incentives are not as great.  I am not sure if this change is based on the review of the Government's experience or the Revenue Commissioners' analysis of the performance of this tax.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what philosophy brought about this change.  Is it a mania for mere arithmetic simplicity?  Certainly I could understand it coming from anybody with responsibility for running the Revenue Commissioners in that it would make everything simple and clear, would reduce the level of computations and so on, but if that is the explanation let us hear it.  There was a dynamic in the idea that if you made a quick killing on a capital gain you paid 60 per cent tax but the longer you held the investment the greater the risks and, therefore, the higher should be the reward.  In that case the tax was at the rate of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for that argument, which I can understand.  It means that people will be prepared to make a capital investment for a period of time because there is an in-built incentive and it may take a number of years for a particular project to mature.  By holding the investment for three, four or five years less tax is paid.  Now the tax rate is 40 per cent on a 24 hour and on a four year investment.  I do not understand the logic behind that.  There may be a reason that is self-evident but it is not evident to me.  Perhaps the Minister can reconcile that with the comments in his speech about private enterprise and effort, but there is no incentive to private effort and enterprise in that change.</P>
    <P>Car registration tax is one that all of us reluctantly recognise as being necessary. The revenue base of society has to be protected.  As a result of the open market from 1993 we will get some tangible benefits, but we will also have to pay some <Col N="1924" /> costs.  However, we cannot afford to pay all the costs at the one time.  None of us likes to pay more than we need for certain things, but the ordinary citizen recognises that we must pay car tax.  The Minister and politicians did not receive many representations in relation to this matter. That shows that people understand that this tax must be paid.</P>
    <P>There are other points I would like to put on the record of the House.  They have been highlighted by people who have assisted us in evaluating this long Bill.  Many people who have watched Finance Bills progress through this House have come to the conclusion that one cannot understand the thinking behind many of the provisions unless, as it were, one understood the conditions of the labour ward at the time the Bill was born.  It is true to say that the minds of the &ldquo;parents&rdquo; were elsewhere; there was much going on in the Fianna Fáil Party as to who was going to be leader and what would happen in that much troubled political party.  We saw more evidence of that yesterday and this morning.</P>
    <P>Professionals in the field of taxation and economic management put forward a view I invite the Minister to consider and respond to.  This Bill can be characterised as a bookkeeping exercise.  It has, by and large, been drafted by civil servants for civil servants because in their mind the eye was off the ball and the Minister's energies were elsewhere. Many technical complexities had to be included, some of which were referred to such as the DIRT and VAT changes.  It is the largest Finance Bill we have had in a long time, if not the largest in the history of the State.  Considering those factors this was an opportunity for the Revenue Commissioners and Finance officials to set the record straight and clean the slate of many minor provisions that took up much time, were an aggravation and, in some cases, a source of annoyance to some people in the public service.  That view has been expressed and no doubt the Minister heard it from others.  It is in the interests of this body politic that that view be refuted or responded to.  Otherwise the credibility <Col N="1925" /> of this House will be somewhat diminished. I invite the Minister to consider this matter and respond in due course.</P>
    <P>Last year on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill I tabled an amendment to the capital acquisitions tax code to deal with anomalies in relation to people who are in second unions, those who are living as brother and sister and those who are living under favourable private arrangements under which if the owner of the property dies the consequences of the present capital acquisitions tax regime can be quite substantial.  The Minister's predecessor gave an undertaking to consider this matter in the context of this year's Finance Bill, but I regret it has not been dealt with.  I am not holding the Minister responsible for that.  I recognise there are many pressures on him at this time, but I am giving notice that I will again put down an amendment on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House much longer but I would like to outline my concern about this matter in which I have a personal interest because I am partly affected.  My attention was drawn to the matter by virtue of a letter from a constituent who had been married, got an annulment from the Catholic Church and entered into what was for her a second, totally bona fide sacramental marriage. She had the good fortune to have a child and was living happily in Dublin 6.  It was brought to her attention by her accountants that in the eyes of the State they were a man and woman living together but for the purposes of law, and capital acquisitions tax they were strangers.  The house which they jointly held was not in joint ownership, a slightly different legal tenure and was, for ease of arithmetic, valued at £100,000.</P>
    <P>This woman was told that if her husband died and left, as any husband would, the balance of his interest in the house to her she would be deemed to be in receipt of a gift to the value of £50,000 from a taxation stranger.  These people are practising Catholics and to them it was more important that they were deemed married in the eyes of the Church than in the eyes of the law.  Under the <Col N="1926" /> existing taxation regime this woman is entitled to a gift of only £10,000 tax free and she must pay capital acquisitions tax on the remaining £40,000.  Being employed in the public service on an income under £20,000 she would not be in a position to pay the tax and under the rules and regulations of the Revenue Commissioners, she would have no option but to sell the house.  I do not think anybody in this House would argue that this is acceptable or should be the consequence of our law.  It is a totally different case if a neighbour or somebody else dies and leaves you £50,000 in his or her will and you would then have to pay tax on £40,000 out of the £50,000 at the current rate of capital acquisitions tax. The validity of paying capital acquisitions tax in that case is totally different from people who, for all intents and purposes, are living as husband and wife.  Yet the rigours of the law and the taxation system which currently prevails require the events that I have just described to come into play.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Finance was very reasonable on this point because at this stage it is not a matter of philosophical dispute but the way of getting round the problem.  I accept that it is a fair principle that our taxation law should reflect the legal basis of society and not try to lead it.  I accept also that the law in relation to marital breakdown, separation and subsequent second unions is still in the process of being reformed. When we were discussing this very matter on Committee Stage last year, the then Minister for Finance could have reasonably anticipated that the White Paper on marital breakdown would be published shortly and this could have created a sufficient signal to enable the Minister for Finance to anticipate to a certain extent the implementation of the recommendations in the White Paper and consequently make changes in the law.</P>
    <P>The White Paper has not yet been published and the indications are that it will be some time before it is published &mdash; I am not fishing for information &mdash; because the Minister has enough problems from the fundamentalists without driving them <Col N="1927" /> mad altogether with proposals to introduce divorce.  There would be a stampede of cumann members from the fundamentalist wing of the Republican Party.  Quite understandably until the issues of the right to travel and the right to information are resolved, the right to divorce will not be put on the agenda by this Administration.  One can reasonably expect that the White Paper will be delayed until after the Final Stages of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this question, because it is not going to go away.  It is becoming increasingly relevant because of the nature of our aging society.  Many people who entered into these unions are now reaching the stage in life when inevitably one of the partners may die of old age, and then the taxation factors will come into play.  <i>Apropos</i> the whole question of marital breakdown and divorce &mdash; my own personal position is a matter of public record &mdash; the trigger that ultimately brought about change in divorce laws in Italy and Spain, both Catholic countries like ourselves, was the question of property and the inheritance of property by one generation from another. Indeed the divorce rate in those countries has stabilised and is very low compared with that in the US or in Britain.</P>
    <P>I can give another example of a problem which will have to be resolved by the Minister for Finance because he has responsibility for the public service. Should a teacher of other public servant die, her husband could apply to the Department of Education for the widower's pension but in the case of the couple I mentioned where they are married in the sacramental sense but not in the eyes of the State, the Minister for Education could not award a widower's pension because it would have to be awarded to her first partner, even though her first partner could have long since gone.  That is another component of the difficulties those in second relationships have to face.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to examine this problem and deal with it as best he can.  I <Col N="1928" /> think he can act quite reasonably without breaking the convention that was understandably asserted last year by the then Minister for Finance that taxation should reflect social law rather than lead it.  In this particular case for the reasons to which I have already referred it would be timely, and it would not necessarily be stepping outside the confines of our present position, if capital acquisitions tax could accommodate the circumstances I have referred to.</P>
    <P>I now wish to raise some other points which have been brought to my attention. There are provisions to increase the powers of the Revenue Commissioners which were referred to briefly by Deputy Noonan, and I now wish to put on record my party's view on these charges.  If two or three years ago a Minister for Finance had indicated that additional powers were to be given to the Revenue Commissioners there would have been an outcry.  Depending on the party spokesperson, the outcry would have been hysterical, very loud or very strong, undoubtedly it would have been very loud.  However, two things have happened in the meantime.</P>
    <P>First, those who have no discretion in the amount of tax they pay have become increasingly incensed at the level of tax evasion they read about.  They can read about the judgments against certain individuals for very substantial sums of money in the Sunday newspapers.  Most people in business cannot understand how someone can run up a debt of between £50,000 to £200,000 to the Revenue Commissioners having regard to the regular inspections of their books and the VAT inspections they have to comply with.</P>
    <P>Second &mdash; I made this point very briefly yesterday during Deputy Noonan's contribution &mdash; the revelations of taxation malpractice that have emerged from the various inquiries, the inquiry into the Greencore scandal, the Telecom inquiry and the Beef Tribunal, and the difficulties that officials acting on behalf of the Revenue Comissioners had in terms of access to information and documentation would not have been considered normal <Col N="1929" /> but now they have been recorded.  This has changed the mood and the attitude of the public and therefore the political climate has changed; this disposes public opinion to allow the Minister to give the Revenue Commissioners those powers on one very important understanding &mdash; that it is the other side of the element of trust implicit in moving towards a system of self-assessment taxation.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of citizens will pay tax on the nail in accordance with what they legitimately assess themselves to be liable for.  There will always be some area of doubt or speculation because of the ambiguity of some activities.  The vast bulk of citizens want to be law abiding, want to pay their tax and want to have their accounts up to date and correctly lodged with the relevant authorities.  There will be a minority who will not do that and who will avail of every opportunity to evade tax.  We have seen some evidence of that.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of what we are doing and I am sure the Minister for Finance is conscious of what he is asking us to do.  As people responsible for the administration of power we are asked to give to the Minister for Finance, and in turn to the Revenue Commissioners, what can only be described as draconian powers to intrude into the privacy of individuals for the purpose of ensuring that they pay tax.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned those powers are given in the knowledge that they are necessary, based on the level of tax evasion on the one hand and the degree of obstruction that has become more widespread. Therefore, they are legitimately being given to the Revenue Commissioners to counteract those abuses.  If, however, the Revenue Commissioners do not handle those powers with utmost sensitivity and confine their application, in the final analysis, to people to whom all previous types of inquiries, admonitions or directives have so far failed then the climate of political acceptability in which the powers are being given will be changed. I have to say that the language used by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to their standard communication to ordinary <Col N="1930" /> citizens is unbelievably heavy and abusive.  In my own case I got a demand for a tax payment, the first time I had received the demand, and basically it was inviting me out to the O.K. Corral by High Noon on Friday, within about 48 hours, if I had not paid up.  Subsequently I spoke to one of the officials in the Revenue Commissioners and I was given the explanation that the computer was programmed to write this type of thing. It must be the most ill-tempered computer in the world, programmed by the crankiest set of programmers one could imagine.  Now that they are being given extra draconian powers, the necessity of which is not to suit them, they have to be countervailed by a recognition that the vast majority of people want to pay tax, want to pay it on time and do not want a tax liability hanging over them, particularly one they had not known about. There is a number of other points that could be raised more effectively on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point about training because that is a very important aspect.  Often we expect people who have not been trained to interpret our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his intervention.  In fact, I did not make reference to that point.  It was an omission on my part.  In the course of arguing for that point the Minister had indicated that training would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make reference to slot machines and the tax of £100 on the various video machines which are being used increasingly throughout the country. Representations have been made to me that in the seasonal caravan park area, where these machines are used by way of a distraction for the rainy days, when the weather prevents children and parents from being out and about, the sum of £60 which is being proposed is too high. Revenue will not accrue because the machines will be taken out and in any event we are talking about a caravan season which is no longer than three months.  One should make a distinction <Col N="1931" /> between slot machines and those machines which are in permanent arcades of amusement, with which we are familiar, and those in holiday locations. The revenue will not be forthcoming because the machines will not be provided, thus reducing facilities in caravan parks.  In terms of equity if you accept that the season is three months for a caravan park or a similar type facility the levy should be proportionate, should be 25 per cent of the total cost and as a consequence closer to £25 than £60 &mdash; £60 implies a 60 per cent tourism season.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on the Bill and I have confined myself to the objectives which the Government have set.  In my view the Bill will not create any additional employment.  From that point of view it is a major disappointment and we will be opposing it on Second Stage.  Many of the measures which existed for employment creation have been taken out and have not been replaced by other measures of employment creation even if the original measures which were removed were ones which had become the instruments of abuse over time.  I do not understand the thinking of the people who put this Bill together.  I cannot see the correlation between this kind of economic thinking &mdash; it does reflect a form of economic thinking &mdash; and that epitomised in the Department of Industry and Commerce and which is contained in the recommendations of the Culliton report.  Those components will have to be explored in some detail at another time.  We are facing an employment crisis and this Bill will have to provide for the funding of additional unemployment to the tune of £25 million which is the estimate of the increase in the live register.</P>
    <P>The two subsidy schemes to which the Minister referred are no substitute &mdash; within the terms of reference of the Government's own ideology and that of their junior partner &mdash; for economic activity that could be stimulated by a Finance Bill which would protect sources of revenue as we move into 1993 and which would promote incentives to create <Col N="1932" /> additional areas in which the private sector could invest.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of underpinning the commercial State sector by providing equity capital for companies such as Bord na Móna and providing a certain coherence in the expenditure of the State companies such as An Bord Gáis and the ESB, and in the area of incentives for the commercial sector generally of semi-State bodies to find new markets and to promote new activities, there is a poverty of thinking running through this Bill.  I should like to give the Minister one example that could possibly be used. There is no reason £2 million could not be taken of the IDA allocation for current account support and reassigned to the Department of Foreign Affairs in order to enable that Department to open up new embassies in Budapest, Prague, along with the embassy in Warsaw, not simply for the purpose of preparing ourselves for the entry of the three countries concerned into the European Community, which event will probably take place by the end of the century, but also to enable us to vigorously pursue the market opportunities there at present in a way that the IDA cannot do because of the system they operate.  There is a whole raft of areas for job creation and job consolidation that are crying out for equity participation directly by the State or indirectly through the banks, and there is nothing in the Finance Bill that encourages that or makes it possible.  There is a naïve belief in the private sector to the exclusion of a viable commercial role for our public sector.  On top of that, that naïve belief in the private sector is then contradicted by the removal of many of the incentives that are set out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be introducing a substantial number of amendments on Committee Stage and I hope we will have an opportunity to debate them. However, I would have to express considerable disappointment at the lack of imagination running through this Bill, its failure to address the many problems we have and the lost opportunities that it undoubtedly represents.</P>
    <Col N="1933" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have a chance at long last to welcome this Finance Bill.  It will do the job it is intended to do, which is to underpin and support the objectives of the budget.  It will help to maintain the consistent growth rates achieved in the past number of years and will continue the positive trends in the other major sectors of our economy, that is, the control of our debt ratio, the control of rates of inflation and borrowing for public expenditure.</P>
      <P>There were words of criticism yesterday at the length of the Minister's contribution on this extensive Bill.  Having sat through three times that length today it is obvious that there are many issues involved.  I would question whether two hours spent at the initial stage will be in any way helpful in teasing out the Bill.</P>
      <P>It was widely forecast that this would be a large and complex Bill and extremely difficult to put together because there are and will be major changes throughout Europe and at home in the coming 12 months.  What is important is that it helps to highlight the underlying objectives of the Government since 1987.  Both Governments have had a consistent policy and those policies are being maintained throughout the Bill.  A great deal of work had obviously been put into this Bill and I hope that, when Deputy Quinn states that it is the largest Bill ever, it is not as a criticism, because the Bill is proof of the amount of work that has gone into it.  The Minister also pointed out that because of the monetary changes to take place and the technical aspects of currency control etc., it will be essential to have a second Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the two previous speakers, Deputies Quinn and Noonan, and I thought Deputy Noonan's words sounded familiar, and on checking the record of the House for 23 April last year it seemed that the wordprocessor had jammed on a programme because Deputy Noonan had made the same dismal forecasts then as he did yesterday. He said that there would be no growth, that there was no control over our finances and he criticised the cutting of the rates of income tax paid by the PAYE <Col N="1934" /> sector in particular.  Both he and Deputy Quinn were consistent in that they both got it wrong last April.  They forecast zero growth rate but the actual outturn was 2 per cent against a forecast of 2.5 per cent. We must look at their forecast for this year in the context of their previous forecasts.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to what they said should be done under a number of headings. Both of these Deputies were key personnel in the Government of the mid-eighties, so we can examine their achievements at the time.  Backbench Deputies, like myself, did not have the experience of being able to change the course of events at national level and are not responsible.  However both Deputies Quinn and Noonan were directly responsible for what happened in the mid-eighties. Our national debt did not start in 1982.  Our national debt doubled and it was Deputy Noonan who supervised much of that aspect of our economy.  His opinions now must be measured against his own previous record.  There is a credibility gap.  He has consistently forecast a zero growth rate over the past three years.  He has consistently criticised the cutting of the tax rates to be paid by PAYE workers and other provisions that we have been implementing in a positive fashion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn stated that it has been impossible up to now to put a correct tax regime in place for the oil research and petroleum area.  That is why the Minister has devoted so much of the Bill to getting that right.  It is important for our energy requirements and our economic wellbeing that we should have a proper tax regime that would encourage exploration. I hope that the Whitegate refinery will gain from the new initiatives and that it will be refurbished and upgraded. Whitegate is not just an essential source of employment but the source of an essential commodity for the country.  I hope what the Minister has done here will help to secure the future of Whitegate and that money is spent on a major development there.</P>
    <P>The forecasts of Deputy Quinn and Noonan must be examined in the context of their previous forecasts.  They have <Col N="1935" /> consistently got it wrong and I have brought along a number of the records which show that.  In nearly all cases the targets set by the Government were exceeded and on each occasion Deputies Quinn and Noonan got their forecasts wrong.  Deputy Noonan in particular is prone to doing this; it seems he cannot get away from this negative approach and continues to harp.  At least Deputy Quinn had one or two positive comments to make.  While I accept it is their job to oppose &mdash; if I was on the other side of the House I, too, would probably be critical of the Bill &mdash; they should recognise that positive progress has been made.  They should recognise also that good things have happened that changes have been made and bear in mind what the position was in 1987 when we took over.  While that is a highly emotive issue and it is easy to claim that the national debt was doubled and the economy was in a shambles in 1987, there was no growth and we were moving backwards.</P>
    <P>Like every other commentator, I accept that our primary task is to create employment and that all our energy should be devoted to achieving that objective.  Deputy Quinn was extremely critical of the Minister and kept referring to what he had to say in his speech.  In his speech the Minister pointed out that between April 1987 and April 1991 net non-agricultural employment in the private sector rose by over 70,000.  When Deputy Quinn and others comment on the increased PAYE tax take they must consider this factor &mdash; an extra 70,000 people are now paying income tax.  We welcome this.  These jobs were created through hard work and after the Government had taken some initiatives.</P>
    <P>There are many other initiatives which were ignored by previous speakers.  For instance, the enterprise development scheme has been introduced on a pilot basis in 12 areas.  Public agencies have got involved in this scheme and have made the necessary arrangements. People have made the point to me that this does not count, but it should be noted that £60 million is being set aside in 1992 <Col N="1936" /> for this scheme.  This positive point should be highlighted on all sides of the House.  I hope that during the year we will take some practical steps to improve the present position.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that those at work are treated fairly.  That is the reason I strongly welcome the further reduction in the rates of income tax.  It is incredible that Deputy Noonan criticised the cut of 10 per cent in the tax rates paid by PAYE workers made by both this and the previous Government.  He also criticised the cuts in both the higher and standard rates.  I wish to draw the attention of PAYE workers to the fact that Deputy Noonan has consistently criticised, during the past two years and again yesterday, cutting the rates of tax paid by them.  He argued that the rates should not have been cut.  I would like to know if this is the collective view of the Fine Gael Party or just the view of Deputy Noonan.  Perhaps the next speaker will have something to say about this.  Deputy Noonan said yesterday that this Bill will benefit no one and that the rates should not be cut.</P>
    <P>I find Deputy Quinn's view on this issue fascinating.  Both this and the previous Government have removed thousands of people from the tax net, I think the figure is approximately 180,000, but a short while ago Deputy Quinn stated that no one should be exempt &mdash; I understand that this is in conflict with the view of his own party &mdash; and that every person at work, regardless of income should pay tax.  I find this view fascinating considering that we have consistently stated that so far as possible those in the lower income bracket should be exempt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan stated that the cuts will make no difference but this is not correct.  The major package of income tax reliefs as outlined in the early sections of the Bill will cost the State £280 million in a full year and result in the marginal tax rates being reduced for over 700,000 taxpayers.  Therefore it is not true to say that they will make no difference, and such a comment should not be made by a spokesperson on Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan was scathing in his <Col N="1937" /> criticism of the way young people spend their hard earned cash.  He mentioned that they spend their money on records. This amounts to gross interference and is something we could well do without. They have earned their money the hard way and they are entitled to spend it any way they wish.  The last thing we need is that kind of Fascist approach to the way people spend their hard earned money.</P>
    <P>Radical changes have been made in the tax regime, including self-assessment to which Deputy Quinn referred in his closing remarks.  These changes are being implemented in a fair and positive fashion.  However, the change to a self-assessment system has been criticised in particular by the tax inspectors' union representatives at their annual conference at which they trotted out figures which are incorrect.  Last month when the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners attended the Committee of Accounts as a witness he informed the committee that under the old system the ratio in relation to errors was 3:1, and because decisions were made on the basis of assessments he accepted that the ratio would always be 3:1.  This proved to be very demoralising for the public.  Indeed, I have the figures here for last year which show the total amount of arrears and the amount that will be collected.  As I said, the ratio in relation to errors under the old system was 3:1 and that was the reason we had to change over to the self-assessment system.</P>
    <P>In an effort to police this system, certain changes had to be made.  Like Deputy Quinn, I welcomed these changes. The Committee of Public Accounts were given an assurance by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that they would help the compliant taxpayer &mdash; the 95 per cent of taxpayers who pay their taxes on time and who do not try to dodge or fiddle their taxes.  He also stated that they would have to change their approach to the language used in demand notices, to privacy for those who wish to question their bills and to policing the dodgers rather than the compliant taxpayer. These changes are being made by the Government and they are more than welcome. <Col N="1938" /> I want tax officials to spend their time chasing the small percentage of taxpayers who are fiddling the system, not the taxpayer who is complying with the law, and we have been given an assurance that this will happen.</P>
    <P>Changes are needed in the structure which will allow checking of company records and various other matters.  This is the big area in which fraud and tax avoidance took place and I welcome sections 210 to 226 which will provide major changes in this area and allow Revenue to chase rogues.  I do not believe that innocent people will be affected because the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has assured us that the system will be operated in a humane and sensible fashion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that proper training will be provided for the officials involved.  The Minister is right in saying that, very often, legislation is brought in and expected to be implemented by people who have not been trained in its requirements.  Things are changing very fast in the area of finance, particularly in regard to taxation. However, I welcome the changes, the cuts in the tax rate and the new approach to the &ldquo;compliant&rdquo; taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I am worried by the suggestions from Deputies Noonan and Quinn that we should not cut the rate of taxation for the PAYE worker and that we should not exclude people because they do not earn enough money to pay tax.  I disagree vehemently with those two suggestions. The question of public confidence in the taxation system, methods and offices is crucial because the person paying a bill legitimately should feel that everybody else is doing the same and that those who are not will be penalised.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are Members of the Committee of Public Accounts had the opportunity to raise many of these issues with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. I asked a question, which Deputy Quinn raised this morning: How can a company run up such large arrears? It was explained how quickly the figure can be arrived at in a large company because they may employ 100 people. <Col N="1939" /> When you take into consideration their turnover, PRSI, taxation, VAT and so on, it is obvious that the figure can accumulate very rapidly.  We must explain these facts to the public in a clear, concise fashion.  If a company owe £100,000 or £200,000 we must establish the duration over which it is spread, how many people were employed and a breakdown of the figures.  It is not enough to just give a gross figure because it is demoralising.  We need a morale boost for the paying public, which can be done if we examine the situation properly. Most of the figures are trotted out by people who say that we need more jobs in an area, it is used as a lever to exert pressure for extra tax inspectors, etc.  It is probably a fair strategy.  The practice existed because of the old system of estimation but we have been getting away from that and we must pursue the new programme very vigorously.  The scheme must be made as simple as possible for the taxpayer and we have had an assurance that this will be done.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy O'Dea &mdash; now a Minister of State &mdash; had proposals in relation to automatic returns for people on marginal rates of tax.  I hope we will pursue these proposals and that it will be automatic for people who have dropped out of the system over a number of years to get marginal relief the following years, although I know that can be difficult to operate in a practical fashion.  However, if the Revenue Commissioners are willing to simplify matters, it can be done.  At least we are moving in the right direction but it is important for the public to know how much is owed and, more importantly, who owes it.  Figures of that kind must be made available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn, while accepting the changes in sections 210 to 226, still described them as draconian powers. However, he said that his party would accept them while keeping an eye on the situation.  We will all keep an eye on the situation and if anyone finds an abuse of the system it is their duty to point it out and to challenge it.  The taxpayers, charter, which has been devised, should <Col N="1940" /> be implemented in as positive a manner as possible which would give the taxpayer the right to all this information.  They are the people who keep the State going and they have the right to know.</P>
    <P>One of my hobby-horses is the disabled driver's scheme.  When I came into this House I found that a person had to be almost totally incapacitated before he or she qualified for this scheme.  Changes were made in legislation which included hand amputees, but then we discovered that a person had to have both hands amputated before qualifying.  There are very few single hand amputees and I plead with the Minister to include them in the scheme because they are obviously disabled and must have their cars modified. It would not cost much to include that category.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred to decentralisation of offices, a topic very dear to my heart at present following the Taoiseach's announcement last Saturday that the Central Statistics Office would be decentralised to my constituency, Cork South-Central, specifically Mahon, providing approximately 450 new jobs in the offices plus the ancillary support services. There will be an estimated income of £8 million extra in wages for the area each year.  I welcome that unreservedly and I also support the principle of decentralisation generally.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that he would save the public £1 million by scrapping the decentralisation programme which was then in place.  In many cases sites had been purchased in various towns and cities throughout the country in preparation for decentralisation but the then Minister &mdash; or one of his colleagues &mdash; decided to scrap the programme for the sake of a saving of £1 million.  Contrast that with the feelings of the people of Mahon last week. The news that a major enterprise was arriving in their area was both a morale boost and a commercial boost.  That is the kind of progress the Government have been making.  Despite the fact that a Fine Gael Deputy and former Minister <Col N="1941" /> asked here about a month ago that the office go to Mahon, the reaction from one Cork Fine Gael Deputy at least was that the location of the office was a political scandal, that it was located on the wrong side of the city &mdash; another negative reaction.  I welcome the CSO to Mahon in Cork and hope that the decentralisation programme will long continue to expand to other areas.</P>
    <P>The designated areas scheme was mentioned yesterday.  I am a little critical of that scheme because of its previous record.  Tax concessions apply in areas identified under the scheme.  Yesterday Deputy Noonan took full credit for the scheme; in fact, I seem to recall him saying that he introduced it.  The scheme introduced by Deputy Noonan had the result in Cork in 1985 of an area being designated but not a penny being invested in the area afterwards.  At the time of designation the area was known as &ldquo;the golden triangle&rdquo; because people were mystified that just two and a half miles from the city such designation could be decided.  That political decision has not resulted in any investment in the area.  It is only now that the designated area scheme is becoming popular in the Cork area because, for political reasons, the wrong locations were identified back in 1985.</P>
    <P>To try to broaden the tax base, as recommended by the Taxation Commission and others, the Minister is suggesting various changes, including the abolition of tax shelters.  It is interesting that both Deputies Quinn and Noonan spoke about this issue.  I might add that they spoke about the issue in a very selective way.  This morning Deputy Quinn talked about the Financial Services Centre in Dublin.  Yesterday Deputy Noonan also spoke about the centre and concentrated his remarks in that regard on Shannon.  He said that tax shelters were not always wrong and pointed to the example of Shannon.  I ask Deputy Noonan to be a little consistent.</P>
    <P>For a long time I have been worried about the tax shelter provided to Shannon, particularly because of the unfair disadvantage in competition faced by <Col N="1942" /> other parts of the country.  In the past couple of months we have heard much about Shannon airport, the question of its fly-over and so on, but we have not heard about the unfair tax shelter that allows Shannon, and SFADCo specifically, to compete against other airports. The revised figures for public services for 1992 cause me concern in relation to Shannon.  For instance, under tourism and traffic development, £8.9 million will be made available to SFADCo mainly for promotion costs, staff costs and the general marketing of Shannon airport and related areas.  I am led to believe that at least part of the money is being used to encourage the promoters of charter flights to fly into Shannon when they would normally have taken their chance on the open market and would have gone to the area they wanted to visit.  Those people are being offered inducements to fly into Shannon and it is my understanding that the funding for the facilities made available is coming from the budget.  I am concerned that the funding for promotional activities is being provided by means of a tax shelter.  I ask Deputy Noonan why he considers that the tax shelter for Shannon is all right.  Is it because Shannon is in his area? What about the fate of areas such as Cork which have had to struggle at a great disadvantage?  In 1984, as Lord Mayor of Cork, I met the task force set up to try to compensate in some way for the loss of Fords, Dunlops and 37 other companies during 1982 and 1983.  I then pointed out that Shannon enjoyed an unfair advantage in its marketing budget.  Separate from the budget, the same area is benefiting from promotional activities.  Representatives from Shannon are able to operate from offices very close to Bord Fáilte, the IDA and other promotional bodies throughout the UK and in countries such as Germany.  It was initially envisaged that the promotional money would be used to encourage people from the United States to come to Ireland's main airport, Shannon.  I subscribed to that view 20 years ago.  I now say, to Deputy Noonan in particular, that the tax shelter for Shannon will have to be <Col N="1943" /> examined very critically.  Those who promote, work in and take business through Cork airport, for example, are not playing on the level pitch that we like to talk about.  They are not playing on the level pitch to the extent of the £26 million available to SFADCo under industrial development and they are not playing on that pitch to the extent of the nearly £9 million provided under tourism and traffic development.</P>
    <P>If a case were made that the money should be made available to promote the mid-west region I should examine that proposal and I should go along with it if it was good.  However, I should have to question the possibility of duplication.  I should also have to question provisions that would allow the description of expenditure, found in any company finance document, as &ldquo;other&rdquo;.  I question the allocation of £5,293,000 under the category &ldquo;other&rdquo; a sum that is not explained in any way.  At times the term &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; is used to explaind such expenditure.  I question such accounting and support of that kind.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, Deputy Quinn defended the tax shelter applying to the Financial Services Centre in Dublin.  If there is to be a SFADCo there will have to be a similar regional development body for areas of this country that are suffering.  There will have to be equality of opportunity, which does not exist at present.  I am not hung up in the &ldquo;Us versus Dublin&rdquo; lobby, I accept that any capital city will have unfair advantages in that assistance will seep in under almost every category.  That is the reason for my defence of this Government's decentralisation programme and my condemnation of the failure of the 1982-87 Government to do anything about that.  I do have to consider aspects of tax shelter arrangements and I do question whether it is right to pick out a particular area and work on that area only.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to change suggestions for the licensing of public houses.  Previous speakers have spoken about a lobby on this matter, I consider that it was a very genuine lobby. <Col N="1944" /> Those of us who considered the original proposals felt that they provided for a very crude mechanism to apply the Minister's intentions.  I subscribe to the Minister's intentions.  I recognise that he is trying to relate the value of a licence to the turnover of a premises.  Those of us who come from rural areas and the provinces pointed out the difference between a public house in central Dublin and one down the country.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's proposal.  The vintners in general do not have any qualms about doubling their licence fee. They are happy with what the Minister is doing.  Some of them have expressed anxiety about a tax rates certificate and having to have their affairs in order before getting a licence.  There should be a limit within which all of this has to be done but I totally support the principle which requires that everyone in business should have their tax affairs in order.</P>
    <P>With regard to growth rates and so on, we only dropped by a quarter of a percentage point from our forecast last year.  Exports held up and our general performance was excellent.  Our prospects are better now.  Those of us associated with the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary tier were aware of the stagnation in Britain because of the impending election.  The uncertainty affected investment and performance there.  The British economy is getting back on line and the London index has shown a rapid recovery over the past week or two.  We will benefit from that. The targets set out in this year's budget and incorporated in the Finance Bill will be met.</P>
    <P>The changes in the DIRT regime are essential because of what will happen at the end of the year and the changes seem to be accepted by previous speakers.  It is appropriate for Ministers to anticipate what will happen at the end of the year and deal with it at an early stage.  We should not run around like headless chickens as we did in 1986 and 1987. Despite massive unemployment there is not the same feeling of despair as existed during those years.  People know that <Col N="1945" /> efforts have been made and continue to be made to improve employment.</P>
    <P>Last year during the budget debate I suggested that we should reduce the unemployment figures significantly by, for instance, aiding the smallholder drawing social welfare to become an economic unit, so as not to have to rely on social welfare.  It was suggested that if we did that we would just be massaging the figures. There are other ways in which we can reduce the numbers on the live register, for instance through job sharing, where there is potential for the creation of up to 30,000 jobs.  The labour force survey showed that in the public and private sectors and in manufacturing industry 800,000 people are employed.  A large number of those people are anxious to share jobs.  There must be a programme supported with income tax incentives to encourage change.  If we take someone off the live register we will save on social welfare and gain in PRSI contributions.  Given that scenario we can spend a lot under the income tax heading to provide an incentive for job sharing. The potential in this area is massive.  I am aware of several dozen people who would welcome an opportunity to job share.  The Minister should look carefully at this proposal, because even if only 4 per cent of people in the workforce agreed to share a job it would create 16,000 jobs.  People should not say that that would be just massaging the figures on the live register.</P>
    <P>A retired colleague of mine spent a tremendous amount of time and effort working the proposals out.  If people shared jobs they could save on expenses like transport, child minding costs and subsistence costs.  That, coupled with an income tax incentive, would induce many people to job share.  There is no reason for delay in implementing my proposals. These proposals could be discussed by the committee on employment, with or without certain groupings, and I hope it will lead to a positive outcome.</P>
    <P>Our finances are related very much to the income from EC Structural Funds and so on over the past few years.  Despite criticism with regard to these funds, I <Col N="1946" /> assure the electorate that the money has been used extremely well.  Opposition spokespeople in Cork South Central, and particularly in Cork North Central, have suggested that Cork did not get their share of funds and that the Government mismanaged funds which were being siphoned off into Dublin and so on.  Over the past two months we saw changes in the thinking in the Cork area, because, for the first time, the local media have published figures relating to many projects being funded in Cork.  They have come out with a figure of £300 million spent in the Cork area for roads, bridges and our proposed river crossing, giving the lie to suggestions from across the House that these funds have been mismanaged. I would request that a fairly simple guide to the various programmes being undertaken with regional funding be published for public consumption because there is a great deal of confusion abroad about them.  I served on the monitoring committee representing the southwest region, representing Cork Corporation, when I discovered there was a massive amount of paperwork involved. The details of the programmes have been printed and have been adhered to since 1987.  The public should be made aware of exactly what is taking place at present and what will happen in the future under the terms of these programmes in their respective areas.  We should endeavour to produce some type of guidelines for each region.</P>
    <P>Of course there is always a temptation for Members of the Opposition parties, perhaps not to tell lies but rather fiddle about somewhat with the truth.  In turn, this leads to public morale being undermined or to people being disillusioned by the misuse of figures in this respect. Therefore it would be very worthwhile that a summary be produced and published of the actual spending on each programme in each area.</P>
    <P>The two main elements of reform contained in the 1987 Finance Act were the phased reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax with a parallel reduction in the accelerated capital allowance for industrial buildings, plant and machinery. <Col N="1947" /> As the House will be aware, the standard rate of 47 per cent was reduced to 43 per cent with effect from April 1988 and to 40 per cent from April 1989, with all of the other capital allowances and so on having being reduced under similar phases from 100 per cent to 75 per cent and then to 50 per cent.  At the same time the corporation tax structure was simplified to ensure that two rates only would apply after 1990, that is the standard rate and the special 10 per cent rate for manufacturing and certain other activities to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Parallel with those reductions the actual income tax paid has been drastically reduced.  Up to 1987 the electorate could never have visualised how the State could cut taxation rates since it had never happened previously in our history. While they have been reduced by ten to 12 percentage points, constituting the main thrust of taxation reform, these reductions have been criticised by Opposition spokespersons.  That type of negative, critical approach must not be allowed to continue.  Rather the Opposition will have to acknowledge that they got it wrong in 1987, 1988 and 1989 and perhaps the Government are right this time around.  I congratulate the Minister on continuing that taxation reform-reduction.</P>
    <P>I support the curtailment of tax relief in certain areas, such as tax shelters and so on.  No doubt on Committee Stage we will have a greater opportunity to discuss economic indicators and the finer points on which the provisions of this Bill have been based.  I look forward to that debate.  I fully support this Bill, the production of which has entailed an enormous amount of work and I wish the Minister well in its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the many contributions made so far on this Finance Bill.  I want to pick up a few comments of Deputy Dennehy.  In this respect it is regrettable that Members tend to engage in giving historic lessons, reverting to the past, because we can all revert to periods in our financial history <Col N="1948" /> and point the finger at certain neglect.  I prefer to be more positive and point the way forward.</P>
      <P>Much of the theme of Deputy Dennehy's contribution was a criticism of the remarks of my party's spokesperson, Deputy Michael Noonan, in defence of whom I want to take issue with a number of points Deputy Dennehy made.  For example, Deputy Dennehy accused Deputy Noonan of having an almost fascist-like approach to young people's indiscriminate purchase of records and so on.  When Deputy Noonan made that point yesterday I think he was referring to much of the money leaving the country, not necessarily creating jobs here.  It is important to put these matters into their proper perspective.</P>
      <P>In relation to Shannon and the tax haven there it must be said that that has been a success story vis-á-vis the creation of jobs.  In particular there has been the success story of Mr. Tony Ryan.  We should built on such successes.  In relation to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company there appears to be a certain amount of envy of its successes.  I might point out to Deputy Dennehy that SFADCo is entirely dependent on Government funding.  If the Government are really committed to regionalisation, the overall concept of subsidiarity, they should be building on the successes of SFADCo.  Therefore, it ill behoves Deputy Dennehy to knock SFADCo. Incidentally I might point out that SFADCo is not in Deputy Noonan's constituency as he represents Limerick East. Indeed there was a clear indication of the feelings about SFADCo in the recent marches in Limerick when up to 30,000 people marched in favour of its status, its importance as an economic lifeline in the area being recognised.  I would prefer to hail their successes.  Rather than a Fianna Fáil spokesman such as Deputy Dennehy coming in and criticising SFADCo it would be much better if he endeavoured to build on their successes in his region in Cork.  Indeed in relation to industrial policy they might well have a few lessons of benefit for the people of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to decentralisation I have to <Col N="1949" /> point out that I fully support its concept, that of locating people in various offices throughout the country, building up strong bases there vital for local economies and for cities such as Limerick and Cork.  We look forward to the arrival of the Revenue personnel to Limerick in the near future, they have already moved in to Nenagh and Ennis, giving the local economies a great injection.</P>
    <P>For example, Deputy Dennehy mentioned a certain Cork Fine Gael Deputy saying it was a scandal to locate in that region.  In our local patches, whether they be in Cork North-Central, Cork South-Central, Limerick West or Limerick East, we all like to attract the best possible facilities.  In that way it would have been most remiss of that Deputy not to have fought for his constituency.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, would have liked such location to have taken place in his constituency but, rather than engage in any triumphalism in such circumstances, we should all welcome such decentralisation no matter where it occurs.</P>
    <P>Any analysis of this Finance Bill must demonstrate how complex and comprehensive are its provisions, many included to prepare us for the forthcoming EC internal market.  In his introductory remarks the Minister said that his overall objective was to support the fight against unemployment.  It is questionable whether this can be achieved under the provisions of this Bill.  We are all aware that we now have in excess of 270,000 people unemployed with in excess of 30,000 people participating in various training courses, readily demonstrating how critical is the present position. For example, at the point at which we discussed last year's Finance Bill the unemployment figure stood at 246,000. When Deputy Dennehy referred to Deputy Michael Noonan having got stuck in gear, contending that his contribution was somewhat similar to that of last year, I might remind him that, having listened to his &mdash; that is Deputy Dennehy's contribution last year &mdash; I am afraid it was indeed similar to the contribution he made today in that it appeared to represent <Col N="1950" /> merely a lesson in history <i>vis-à-vis</i> past excesses rather than point to the future in a positive fashion.  We must acknowledge that the unemployment position has deteriorated since last year in that there were last year in the region of 246,000 whereas this year there are well over 270,000 people unemployed. Who could point to that as representing a success story?  It cannot be claimed that the Government have been successful in this area.</P>
    <P>Any analysis of this Finance Bill would demonstrate very few areas in which there are any incentives being given for the creation of additional employment.  I am talking about permanent employment. I am not talking about temporary jobs, training courses which, in many cases, do not lead to jobs; I am not speaking of social employment schemes; I am talking about long-standing, permanent jobs that will withstand the test of time. Any analysis of the provisions of this Bill does not point to the creation of such jobs.  Indeed some of the proposed taxation measures may well have the opposite effect, leading to loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>While reducing tax rates is desirable there has been no serious effort at achieving real tax reform.  Here again Deputy Dennehy got it wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>It is the member state currently holding the Presidency which, in the first instance, proposes the draft agenda for meetings of the European Council, which is normally circulated some days before the meeting.  The Deputy will, therefore, appreciate that at this early stage no such communication has yet been received.</P>
      <P>I should, however, recall that as agreed at its last meeting, two major items which will be discussed at the Lisbon Council meeting will be the Delors II Budgetary Package and EC Enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Delors II proposals are, of course, <Col N="1954" /> currently being examined by both the ECOFIN and Foreign Affairs Councils in preparation for the Lisbon Summit.</P>
    <P>On EC Enlargement, the Commission is currently working on the paper which it was asked to submit for consideration in Lisbon and I do not believe it would serve any useful purpose at this stage for me to comment on or to try to anticipate the contents of this paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that any enlargement of the Community should be vetoed by Ireland unless the Delors II Package which is a basic minimum so far as a federal budgetary Europe is concerned is accepted in full?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be totally inappropriate for me on behalf of the Government and the Irish people to state in advance the negotiating position I might take up on any particular issue at any summit.  That has always been the case and it is the best way of approaching the matter.  The question of any enlargement of the Community will, of course, be examined very carefully as to its implications for Ireland and the Community in general.  Somebody purporting to report on what President Delors said has hinted that the paper on enlargement might be a bit of a shock to the members of the Community when they see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that if the Community is enlarged without an increase in the budget all we will have is a glorified free trade area without the capacity to help either poorer citizens or poorer regions within the Community, that it is crucial from an Irish national point of view and the point of view of weaker citizens and regions throughout Europe that there be a substantial increase in the Community budget as a pre-condition to any further enlargement and that the Delors II Package must be accepted in full as a basic minimum?  The Taoiseach could do nothing but good for Ireland by indicating that position now well in advance of the Summit.</P>

It is extremely important that, as a member state, we would have a very definite view and set of proposals to put at the Lisbon meeting which will take place in a few weeks time.  As President Delors stated, Commission proposals could be a major intellectual shock to the 12 member states.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach what views the Government have on the enlargement.  It is important that the Irish people know specifically what line the Government are taking.  I would like the Taoiseach to tell the House what he will be stating at the meeting in relation to enlargement, considering that he is so familiar with the agenda on that issue.</P>

In view of the nervousness being expressed in Europe at this stage, and some second thoughts expressed by the German community in particular, are the Taoiseach and his Government concerned about the possible watering down of that amount of money?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of some member states in relation to the Treaty on European Union.  For instance, we are all well aware of the continuing increasing cost of the unification of Germany.  One of the reasons the member states found it impossible to accommodate our position in reopening the Treaty was due to the pressures that would be brought to bear and the changes that would be sought.  The position is as it would normally be when talking about increasing funds.  The larger states usually adopt this type of attitude.  It is a negotiating stance and one of which Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal have to be very conscious.  We must make the best of our negotiating position, as we have done in the past and, I have little doubt, we will do again in the future.</P>

Therefore, the drafting of the wording has already been done and it is simply a case of the Government having the common sense to publish it in the form of a constitutional amendment so that before the public vote in <Col N="1962" /> the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty they will know precisely the Government's intentions in this matter.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that common sense suggests that this should be done before the people are asked to vote on the Maastricht Treaty?  As a person who purports to be a man of common sense, would the Taoiseach not agree that this is common sense?</P>

      <P>I am, of course, a man of common sense and I approach this matter in a common sense and practical manner.  The right to travel and the problems associated with that stem from Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution and the Supreme Court's interpretation of it. Consequently this problem has to be resolved.  I have said continually that the Government will produce solutions to all the problems together and not deal with one part in isolation from another, as the Deputy is suggesting.</P>

      <P>In relation to the questions Deputy Bruton asked about the legislative programme, is the Taoiseach in all honesty telling this House that the Attorney General, the legal adviser to <Col N="1963" /> the Government, has been unable, since February of this year when this case took place, to actually give the Government options in relation to a constitutional amendment to provide for the right to travel and the right to information?  Is the Taoiseach honestly saying to this House that to date the Government have been able to come up with a formula to solve that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have continually said to the House, which I now restate, is that the Cabinet have a sub-committee which involves the Attorney General and other members of the Government in looking at the complexity of this matter in relation to information and the right to travel.  I accept what Deputy Bruton says: the wording of the right to travel is very simple, if you deal with it in isolation, but I can assure Deputy Bruton, and he knows this as well as I do, as I am sure does Deputy Spring, that the question of the right to information is not as straightforward and as simple.  Furthermore the interpretation of the right to life of the unborn and the right to life of the mother, as enshrined in Article 40.3.3, is complex.  The problem is in Ireland, not in Europe.  The problem is not and should not be linked to Europe and it is irresponsible to continue to link it to the Treaty on European Union.</P>

I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that his illustrious predecessor promised at the Ard-Fheis over 12 months ago that the then Government would introduce changes, the former Minister for Health promised changes and indeed the present Minister for Health has spoken on a number of occasions about changes.  I understand the programme to be what the Government intend to bring before the House this session.  As the Family Planning (Amendment) Bill is on the programme, may I ask the Taoiseach if he will give a firm commitment that the Family Planning (Amendment) Bill will be brought before the House before the summer recess?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government were very surprised at the reference in the Conference statement that:</P>
      <P>The meeting today noted with alarm that the right to life of the unborn does not appear to be on the Government's agenda at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was indicated by a Government spokesman on 14 April, commenting on <Col N="1970" /> the statement, the right to life of the unborn has always been on this Government's agenda.  The Government are continuing their search for the correct solution to the very complex problem posed by the Supreme Court decisions. We hope to address fully the objective that was in view when Article 40.3.3º was enacted, which I interpret, essentially, as being to uphold the right to life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
    <P>I take it that most reasonable people will agree that experience would indicate that there is every reason to take time to consider carefully all the implications arising from the judgements in this sensitive and emotive area.</P>
    <P>The Government's consideration is being advanced as rapidly as the nature of the issues permit.  In the meantime, it is necessary to press forward with ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The statement of the Conference of Bishops also referred to their apprehension that:</P>
    <P>There is a grave danger that we may find ourselves in a situation in which we would lose the capacity to provide effectively in our Constitution and legislation for the protection of the right to life of the unborn child.</P>
    <P>If this apprehension relates to the Maastricht Treaty, I have to say that it is based on a misunderstanding.  The European Community has no intention or wish to get involved in abortion in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty, of which Protocol 17 is a part, confirms that position. It would be a complete misreading of the Protocol to believe that it in any way &ldquo;freezes&rdquo; current Irish constitutional and legislative provisions, as interpreted by the courts.  Ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, together with Protocol 17, would in no way prevent us from further amending our constitutional provisions in this area, if we so wish.  Any amendment would, having regard to the content of the Protocol and the Solemn Declaration, have to respect rights to travel and information under European law.</P>
    <P>What is true is that any amendment <Col N="1971" /> of Article 40.3.3º, from its terms on 7 February when the Treaty was signed, would not enjoy the protection of Protocol 17, unless that was amended.  This is so, whether or not such an amendment of Article 40.3.3º was made before or after the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  Thus, as explained in my reply to yesterday's Questions, there would be no benefit, from the standpoint of the right to life of the unborn, in holding a referendum on the abortion issues before that on the Maastricht Treaty.  Those who suggest that we do so have failed to offer any logical reason for doing so.</P>
    <P>Our Community partners have made it clear that they are unable to agree to convene an Inter-Governmental Conference to make any change in the Treaty or Protocols until after the Treaty has entered into force, which will be on or after 1 January 1993.  But in the Solemn Declaration secured by the Government, all twelve member states have declared that they will be favourably disposed, following the entry into force of the Treaty, to extend the protection afforded by the Protocol to any future amendments of the Constitution, so long as such amendments respect freedom to travel and to provide and obtain certain information.</P>
    <P>Thus, far from the Treaty or Protocol causing a loss of capacity for Ireland to provide effective protection in its Constitution and laws for the right to life of the unborn, the Government have ensured, through the Protocol and the Solemn Declaration, that whatever constitutional position we have on abortion in Ireland, will &mdash; so long as it respects rights to travel and information under the Community Treaties &mdash; be protected from any law of the Treaties that might interfere with it, however remote such a possibility may be.</P>
    <P>From the standpoint of the right to life of the unborn, rejection of the Maastricht Treaty would be utterly counterproductive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has delivered a very interesting reply.  Can I <Col N="1972" /> take it from the reply that the Taoiseach is now telling the House that the referendum in the autumn will not only deal with the question of travel and information but will also deal with the question of the availability of abortion in Ireland?  If that is correct can the Taoiseach give a guarantee to the House that under no circumstances will a superior right to life of the foetus be given over and above that of the mother?</P>

      <P>The Deputy must be very forgetful if he cannot remember what I said consistently on this issue.  The complexities of the issues arising out of the interpretation of Article 40.3.3º are such that the Government have decided to deal with all of them together.  The Government subcommittee are deliberating on them.  As soon as their deliberations are complete the Government will make their decision and the public will be informed.  I will not anticipate at this stage what the Government will decide in such a complex area which involves the right to travel, the right to information and the substantive issue of the right to life of the unborn and the right to life of the mother.  Those are the complexities.  I will not anticipate what the Government will decide in due course when they have all the options in front of them.</P>

      <P>I am not asking the Taoiseach to explain or go into any detail in relation to the complex wording that may be required and, indeed, I can foresee how complex it might be.  I am asking the Taoiseach to make a statement of policy in the House with regard to the issues that now face us.  Will he indicate to the House that not only does he intend to have a referendum on travel and information in the autumn but also a referendum relating specifically to the issue of whether abortion will be available in Ireland?  If such wording becomes available, complex or otherwise, can he give a guarantee that it is the policy of the Government to give at least equal right to life and health of the mother and that <Col N="1973" /> there will be no superior right to life for the foetus?</P>

Would the Taoiseach not further agree that a formula which systematically preferred in our Constitution the right to life of the unborn child to that of the mother would stand current medical practice on its head, would not be accepted by those who agree with the Roman Catholic hierarcy and possibly by the vast majority of people in this country, and that the only other potential formula which would systematically prefer the right to life of the mother over that of the unborn child would be equally unacceptable to the vast majority of the people?  Would he therefore not share with me the conclusion that what was sought to be done in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution is not something that can be given practical effect in the Constitution as has been found in the United States and would he not agree, <Col N="1976" /> therefore, that the blindingly clear conclusion of everything we have been through in the past nine years is that this cannot be done constitutionally but must be done by legislation?</P>

      <P>The control of public service costs continues to be a key factor in this Government's economic strategy. As a result, all Government Departments are subject to restrictions on the recruitment of staff and the filling of vacancies. In such a situation, there is a requirement on all managers throughout the public service, including the Director of Consumer Affairs, to review existing work practices and set priorities in order to maximise the use of available resources.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's reply that there is adequate staff in the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, especially in view of the fact that so many EC directives on general legislation on the consumer area are not enforced in the way they should be.  It is because of the inadequate level of staff that there are inadequate levels of enforcement in respect of consumer legislation.</P>
      <P>With the Customs and Excise staff being redeployed as a result of the completion of the Internal Market, will the Minister not agree that he is getting an unique opportunity to allocate some of that surplus staff to the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade?  In view of the establishment of the small claims court and the proposal to regionalise this court and the office of consumer affairs, another opportunity is provided for the Minister to redeploy staff to ensure a regionalised system of consumer protection.</P>

It must be one of the very few offices in the public service where there has been an increase of such magnitude.  As I mentioned in the House before on this point which is raised at virtually every Question Time I reply to, it is almost the cause of some embarrassment to me that there is such a large increase in this office when there has been no increase or a diminution in numbers in other parts of my Department and other Departments where work of at least equal importance to this is being undertaken.</P>

    <P>So far as the people who are becoming available for redeployment from the Customs and Excise Service are concerned, obviously my Department would welcome the allocation of some of those people provided we had the means to pay for them, but we are not in a position to pay for them out of the existing salaries subhead.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 21, 25, 44, 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have been receiving representations for some time past on behalf of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry seeking to have restrictions placed on the importation of second-hand Japanese cars.  Such restriction of competition would clearly not be in the interests of the consumer.  In addition, our international obligations as parties to the GATT and as members of the European Community preclude the imposition of unilateral restrictions on imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of the SIMI representations in relation to Japanese used car imports is that the increase in these <Col N="1981" /> imports is a major factor in the decline in demand for new cars in Ireland.  In fact, the fall in demand for new cars worldwide is attributable to the prevailing recessionary conditions.  The Irish new car market, which enjoyed buoyant growth in the three-year period to 1990, suffered a decline in 1991 in common with other countries though of less severity than the decline in the UK car market.  Demand for new cars in Ireland can be expected to rise again as international economic activity gathers pace.</P>
    <P>Imports of Japanese second-hand cars account for less than 3 per cent of the Irish second-hand car market and, while these imports have injected an element of competition into the car market here, they could not reasonably be regarded as undermining the market for new cars in Ireland.  The most up-to-date statistics indicate that Japanese used car imports levelled off in the final quarter of 1991 and their share of total second-hand car imports has declined.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances I do not see any justification for the establishment of an interdepartmental committee as proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy reply.  Would he confirm that Ireland is the only country in the European Community which accepts these used cars from Japan and that the reason these used cars are being dumped &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; in large numbers in Ireland is that they are being forced off the road in Japan having failed stringent road tests and, consequently, that it is unacceptable and dangerous to allow them on Irish roads without checking them first?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that Ireland is the only country which allows used cars from Japan to be imported.  I understand that the importation of these cars into Britain is lawful but they are not imported in any significant quantities because second-hand car prices in Britain are significantly lower than they are in Ireland and the competitive situation does not require <Col N="1982" /> their importation.  Apart from Britain, Ireland is the only member state of the European Community where people drive on the left hand side of the road. Therefore, apart from Britain, Ireland is the only country where the question of imports would arise.  I do not accept that these cars are in any way dangerous or inferior.  It is a well-known fact that they are tested before they are exported from Japan and that they are found to be satisfactory and safe.  I am not aware of any evidence that they are in any way less roadworthy than corresponding cars of the same age originally imported here new from Japan.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the statements made by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to the effect that these cars have not been manufactured to European Community specifications, and that, therefore, it is incongruous that they should be allowed in here?  Would the Minister indicate to the House the basis for his information that these cars are tested in Japan and found to be satisfactory given that the information supplied by the society indicates the contrary, namely, that they failed to pass stringent motor tests introduced in Japan and therefore may not be driven in Japan, and they are being dumped here?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that they are unsafe in any way.  Apparently, it is the practice in Japan for consumers to change cars more frequently than consumers in Europe but, apart from any tests carried out in Japan, the tests which have been carried out in this country would seem to indicate that the standard of these cars is at least the equivalent of cars of a similar age which were imported new into this country from Japan.  The statement referred to by the Deputy that the cars are not manufactured to European Community specifications is misleading because they are manufactured to Japanese specifications which are at least the equivalent of European Community specifications and, in some instances, of a higher specification.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I take it the Deputies are referring to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which provides a framework within which companies experiencing financial difficulties, but considered viable in the longer term, can be put under the protection of the court.  The Act became operational on 29 August 1990 and has been availed of by 126 companies, according to the latest returns to the Registrar of Companies.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that the Act, which introduced a new concept in Irish company law generally, will continue to be reviewed as the need arises. In that regard, I should like to remind the House that some amendments have already been passed by the Oireachtas in the Companies Act, 1990, and commenced by my orders in December 1990 and August 1991.</P>
      <P>In relation to the collapse of the company to which I assume the Deputy refers, I would refer the House to my statement in this House on 8 April 1992, Official Report Volume 418, columns 1231-37.</P>

      <P>Part IX of the Companies Act, 1990, deals with the issue of placing companies under court protection while the company to which I am referring is United Meats Packers.  In view of the statement issue by the receiver last week that there were assets worth £35 million in the company, that liabilities of £50 million were outstanding and that the examiner was not in a position due to the lack of finance, which could be provided by the operation of a State rescue bank, to perform his duties properly under the Act, will the Minister confirm that it is necessary to amend section 285 of the principal Act to ensure that the suppliers of goods and services to that company will get preferential treatment in the event of a winding up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the details of the statement made by the receiver but if he said that there were assets of £35 million and liabilities of £50 million I do not dispute it.  However, the Deputy will realise that it is a commercial matter, not one into which I could &mdash; or should &mdash; enter.  Regarding his suggestion that an amendment should be made to the 1990 Act to ensure that suppliers to a company which goes into examinership are paid, the position under the Act is quite clear.  If the examiner certifies that goods he ordered and received were necessary for the orderly running of the company they get priority and are paid for.  That has been the case in the company mentioned, UMP, with the exception of a small number of payments which I understand were not made even though there was an instruction to do so by the examiner because an error was made in the office of the company concerned in listing the cheques for the examiner.  It was purely a clerical or administrative error and I understand the examiner &mdash; even though he is no longer acting as examiner &mdash; is seeking to make arrangements with the receiver to ensure that the small numbers of outstanding cheques, which I believe is about 150, will issue on one day.  As I said, it was purely due to an administrative error in the offices of the company that they were not paid in <Col N="1985" /> the normal way as a substantial number of cheques were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The examiner got permission to borrow £7 million from the bank but, subsequently, received only £4 million.  Will the Minister agree it is totally unacceptable that an examiner who received goods and undertook to pay for them did not subsequently pay for them?  Will the Minister also agree that that would be in breach of the Act and that whatever legislative changes are required must be introduced to ensure that people who supply goods and services to a company under examinership must be guaranteed payment, which did not happen in the case of United Meat Packers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that it did happen.  I am advised that the small number of unsecured creditors who remain outstanding will be paid shortly. Only a small amount of money is involved and the reason they have not been paid up to now is that an error was made in the office of the company.  The list of cheques for a whole day was not forwarded to the examiner or at least the cheques issued on a particular day were not included in the list forwarded to the examiner and, accordingly, the court. The fact that the examiner was authorised by the court to borrow £7 million and could get only £4 million does not have anything to do with the Act, the court or me; it is a matter of commercial life.  If an examiner is not able to raise working capital that is a fact of life and as a result of judgement exercised by the bank.  The Deputy will realise that he is arguing two incompatible principles because the reason banks might be reluctant to advance money to an examiner is that all these unsecured trade creditors will get preference over the banks. Indeed banks have made representations to me to that effect.  On the other hand, those who represent unsecured trade creditors have made representations to me that they should get priority over all banks.  From that point of view the two are incompatible and the law should <Col N="1986" /> leave it open to the court, if there is an irreconcilable conflict, to sort out where the priorities lie in that regard.  If we come down on one side or the other we will cause irreparable damage.</P>

      <P>The survey referred to confirms what I have been saying for the past number of years about the level of motor insurance costs in Ireland.  In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to the comprehensive reply which I gave to parliamentary questions as recently as Thursday, 5 March 1992 &mdash; Dáil Official Report, volume 416, No. 8, columns 1751-1766.</P>
      <P>Motor insurance rates in Ireland will be out of line with those of other countries in Europe as long as the extent and level of awards for injuries are out of line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the detailed answer to which the Minister referred.  However, the fact remains that the report referred to here shows that, for example, a young driver in Greece will get insurance for one-tenth of the cost in Ireland.  Is the Minister aware that in Britain a young driver can get insurance for, on average, three to four times less than here?  Is the Minister now saying that motorists, having been disappointed that the abolition of juries did nothing to lower insurance costs, will find that the advent of Single Market conditions will be a cause for no hope for drivers who are so heavily penalised by the cost of insurance here?  There are barriers at present to European countries offering insurance to people resident outside <Col N="1987" /> that particular country.  Will Single Market conditions offer any hope for improvement in the conditions experienced by drivers generally, young drivers in particulars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, premiums in Greece and Britain are only a fraction of what they are here. However, the claims and awards in those countries are only a fraction of what they are here, inevitably one reflects the other and will continue to do so.  As far as the opening up of the market is concerned, I understand it will take place at the end of November this year; it will no longer be necessary to be established here. However, as I pointed out to the House, it would be misleading to suggest to the public that that opening up will lead to a dramatic drop in premiums or anything of that kind because, irrespective of where the insurer is, if he is writing business in Ireland his premium rate will be determined by his costs in Ireland. Unfortunately, whether he is Irish based, German based or indeed based anywhere else in the Community, his costs will be higher than they are anywhere in the Community.  For that reason, his premiums are likely to be higher.  At present 70 per cent of non-life insurance here is written by non-Irish companies so we do not lack foreign investment or competition in the market.  I welcome the fact that there will be broader competition from the end of November but, nonetheless, the costs here are so high that it is unlikely that any foreign based insurer will be able to write policies at premium levels which are substantially below existing levels until such time as we get our costs and awards system in line with the rest of Europe.</P>

      <P>High Court awards is one factor.  This matter has been examined thoroughly by a Cabinet committee to which I referred, chaired by me, which met on numerous occasions in the past two years.  The Cabinet committee promoted legislation, some of which has already been passed and some of which I hope will be in the House shortly.  In particular, the Minister for the Environment will introduce within the next month or so a Road Traffic Bill that I hope will improve the enforcement of many road traffic requirements and strengthen those requirements in an attempt to reduce the very high accident rate in this country.  Within the next couple of months, the Minister for Justice will introduce a Courts and Courts Officers Bill, which, I hope, will make a significant contribution towards the reduction of legal and other costs associated with court cases.  Of course, that Bill will also make various other changes in procedure that are thought advisable to try to reduce the length and complexity of hearings in relatively simple cases.</P>

      <P>Order.  I am anxious to dispose of a few more questions in the interests of Deputies who are present and anxiously waiting for their questions to be dealt with.  Time is fast running out.  I ask for brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I point out to the Minister that none of the items in the list he gave is the ill he identified, namely, the amount of court awards.  I again ask whether the Minister proposes to do anything about that matter which he enunciated in his first reply as the cause of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider, as do a great many people, that the level of court awards here is much too high.  A recent report commissioned from Coopers and Lybrand concluded that personal injury claims in Ireland were more than four times higher than the level in the United Kingdom and that the proportion of <Col N="1989" /> motor insurance claims, which include personal injury compensation, was five times higher in this country than in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  I cannot put a stop to the awarding of large sums of money but I shall certainly seek to discourage it.  I am advised that for constitutional reasons we cannot impose a limit on the amount of awards made.  I am told that that would be found to be unconstitutional.  It is my hope that, on reflection, the courts will realise that the unusually high level of awards here is causing a severe problem for drivers, and young drivers in particular.  Of course, it is also causing a severe problem for employers in terms of employers' liability insurance and to people who hold public functions or events and find it very difficult to get public liability insurance as a result of the abnormally high awards made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that his reply about what motorists may expect in Single Market conditions will have the effect of a bucket of cold water, especially for those who need to use their cars as a tool of their trade?  The Finance Bill carries the prospect of a registration fee while motorists had expected cheaper cars, and now, in respect of the expectation of cheaper insurance, the Minister is essentially saying that the determining factor will be where the policy is written.  Is it not the case that in the United States, for example, the giant insurance companies have a uniform scale of fees and that fees are not determined according to the state in which a resident lives or carries out business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong in saying that I suggested that the determinant will be where a policy was written. That is not the case.  The determinant is where the risk arises.  In this instance, the risk arises in Ireland.  As far as compensation and damages awards are concerned, Ireland is an abnormally high-cost country.  Therefore, it does not matter where a policy is written.  The principal determinant is where the risk <Col N="1990" /> arises and what the cost of meeting that risk will be when the contingency arises.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to legislation likely to be introduced by his colleagues, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Environment.  Does he foresee a position where he in his own Department might introduce legislation that would have a beneficial effect for the consumer?  The Minister also referred to the unconstitutionality of placing limits on awards.  In the context of the Maastricht Treaty and future years, does the Minister envisage that difficulty remaining?</P>

      <P>Before the break I was talking about those taxation measures in the Finance Bill which will have a negative effect on employment.  Taxation has been discussed at length over the past two days.  There has been minimal effort at serious tax reform.  While the reduction in tax rates is desirable we still have a prohibitive tax regime.  Single people particularly pay high taxes on low incomes.  My colleague, Deputy Noonan, has already elaborated on the obsession of the Progressive Democrats with lowering tax rates but that has only a minimal effect when the personal allowances remain unchanged.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> I sympathise with those people who are earning £8,000 to £10,000 per annum especially married men.  Because of the erosion of their income by tax and PRSI it can be more advantageous for them to be on social welfare benefit.  Because of increases in social welfare benefits, in the past few years, an unintentional poverty trap has been created.  Many Deputies from rural constituencies are aware of companies in which the basic trade union wage is between £140 and £160 a week. The married men who work in those companies are heroes when one considers our social welfare regime.</P>
    <P>The system of self-assessment still needs to be improved.  Last year Deputy Rabbitte pointed out that the Tax Officers' Association in relation to the audit under the self-assessment system said that if they were to proceed with the number of workers they had at that time, a person would only be audited every 260 years.  I hope things have improved in the past year.  In the area of self assessment and taxation there is scope for improvement. The system needs to be monitored more effectively.  If extra manpower is provided in that section, there will be a great return to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister did not bow to the wishes of the Progressive Democrats in relation to the abolition of mortgage interest relief.  Over the past few years there has been a drastic reduction in the public housing programme and many young couples have to resort to private builders for housing.  Many of these people do not have a high income and place great reliance on mortage interest relief.  This relief is a positive incentive to many couples to buy their own homes.  Since it was introduced the relief was reduced from £4,000 to £3,200 for a married couple.  As I said, I am glad that the Minister has not succumbed to the Progressive Democrats demands for the abolition of this relief.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that the VHI is still intact.  It has encouraged many people to protect themselves.  The hospitals and the health care system cannot meet the demands without extra resources.  Under <Col N="2020" /> last year's budget many people were offered full free service in public hospitals.  Many people will not avail of this service because with the VHI they have a better chance of getting treatment at least in private hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government stated that a systematic curtailment of the vast range of exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary rates on a phased basis was required.  While this is a desirable objective, the Minister should be cautious and selective.  It would be wrong to over-react to the series of scandals we had in the famous golden circle saga by making sweeping changes without analysing the consequences of those changes.  The Minister in the budget and in amendments to the Finance Bill has recognised that although, it might be idealistic to make sweeping changes, the practicalities and their effectiveness have to be questioned.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in section 17 the Minister has reconsidered his decision to abolish the revenue approved share schemes which were introduced in 1982 which allowed shares to the value of £5,000 to be given, tax free, annually to employees. The abolition of this scheme was contrary to the spirit of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the encouragement given by successive Governments to workers to participate in their companies.  This type of incentive is given in other European countries.  It is ironic that the Minister should be out of step with these countries.  The foreign companies based in Ireland must have been amazed that what was acceptable in their own countries was not acceptable here.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have encouraged the concept of workers investing in their companies, leading to the necessity for an incentive of this nature.  The present Minister for Finance, formerly Minister for Labour, should have fully recognised the merits of this scheme since in his former portfolio, he would have been in close contact with many of those companies.  However, he has allowed this concession on a reduced <Col N="2021" /> basis with a ceiling of £2,000 which is to be welcomed.  I am pleased the Minister recognised the genuine lobby for its restoration albeit at a reduced level.  Since, it would appear, he has now recognised the importance of these schemes, surely he should have left the ceiling of £5,000? One may well question the amount of revenue yield for the Exchequer as a result of these changes.</P>
    <P>There are very few references in the Finance Bill, as there were in the budget, to farming.  However, I welcome the proposal for the claw-back of stock relief being increased from two to three years under the provision of section 20, which is as it should be.  Many of us will be aware of farmers on whom animal disease eradication had a dramatic effect and who no doubt, will welcome the Minister's proposals in relation to the claw-back of stock relief.  I endeavour to be positive and, on occasions, complimentary to the Minister because, as I said earlier, there tends to be too much romancing with history and not sufficient positive thinking for the future.  We can all talk of excesses engaged in relation to taxation generally on the part of previous Governments.</P>
    <P>The Minister's original budgetary proposals <i>vis-á-vis</i> company cars caused many private sector employees with company cars understandable anxiety.  The Minister has now amended those proposals because the road he had intended travelling would have led to many sales representatives reconsidering the value of a company car, might have encouraged them to replace such company cars with a generous mileage allowance from their employers similar to the tax-free mileage of public servants, in turn, leading to a consequential loss of revenue.  I doubt that the Minister was endeavouring to encourage such conversion in his original proposals but there was indeed that inherent danger.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the intensive lobbying forced the Minister to realise that the sweeping changes he proposed making in that area were not desirable. He has introduced certain modifications of those original proposals for which he <Col N="2022" /> must be applauded.  However, I doubt whether those modifications go far enough but, on Committee Stage, we will be afforded another opportunity to consider them.</P>
    <P>The Minister's budgetary decision to tax co-operatives at the corporation tax rate of 40 per cent led to an understandable furore among co-operatives because many of them had been exempt from corporation profits tax.  Naturally, when one introduces an amendment to impose a 40 per cent tax rather than a zero rating there will be much ill feeling. We are all aware that co-operatives made a huge contribution to many rural economies, in areas to which it would be extremely difficult to attract alternative industry or activity.  They now employ in excess of 16,000 people, playing a vital role in rural areas and the national economy.</P>
    <P>Looking at recent high profit returns of £10 million or more on the part of some of those co-operatives, no doubt the Minister said to himself this is an area that will have to be examined, which is understandable, but in recent times much of the income and profits of those co-operatives has been pumped into desirable research and development involving millions of pounds.  Such research and development is vital for those co-operatives since everybody encourages them to diversify and expand their activities abroad.  There are many successful examples, now household names, such as Kerry Foods, Golden Vale, Kerrygold and so on, whose success probably was achieved as a result of the relaxation in corporation profits tax which has obtained for a long time and which allowed those co-operatives to expand and diversify.</P>
    <P>One should always remember that inevitably the boards of directors of such co-operatives will be comprised mainly of farmers whose contribution over many years must be applauded, but there is the danger, in imposing an excessive amount of corporation profits tax on those co-operatives, the Minister may detract them from the true spirit of the co-operative of the past, when profits were reinvested <Col N="2023" /> in research and development. Henceforth there may be a tendency for them to depress their profit margins, possibly giving the farmers an extra few pence per gallon of milk, which may well be a temptation for the board of directors comprised mainly of farmers.  We look forward to exploring on Committee Stage Deputy Noonan's suggestion of another method that would yield the tax revenue required.</P>
    <P>It would appear the Minister has given some recognition to the importance of co-operatives in this Bill in that he proposes that their taxation be based on one-third of their trading profits this year, two-thirds next year and then on to the full rate.  The recent decision of such co-operatives as Dairygold and Avonmore to diversify into other areas of activity and their take-over of the UMP plants is very welcome.  We wish them well.  We hope that saga will be sorted out very soon <i>vis-à-vis</i> the receiver, examiner, farmers and hauliers and the payments they should receive, especially recoupment of expenses incurred during the examiner and pre-examiner period.  We want to see those co-operatives revitalised, those beef plants improved and the numbers of their employees increased.  I predict those co-operatives will render those beef plants successful.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of excesses engaged in by those plants in the past, witness to which is given in the current Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry. Everybody in rural areas will welcome the natural diversification of the activities of those co-operatives in taking over those beef plants and wish them well.  In the past Kerry Foods were responsible for approximately 10 per cent of beef production nationwide but, as a result of this takeover, 40 per cent of such production will remain in the hands of the co-operatives; a move that is much to be desired.  We are all aware that the monopoly which had prevailed in the past among a small number of companies led to certain excesses and the wrong type of approach, to the detriment of our reputation as a green country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> Every rural Deputy will be aware of the change in the pub licence being based on the rateable valuation.  That publicans resisted that change was understandable in that the Minister was treating all publicans equally on the basis of possession of a licence, based on a multiplier of seven of the rateable valuation.  Some years ago when singing pubs were the craze many publicans extended their premises.  Usually when one submits an application to a planning authority for the extension of premises the people first notified will be the Valuation Office one of whose officers will revalue such premises and naturally the valuation will be increased.  Because of the times we live in and with approximately 270,000 people unemployed and taking into account the price of a pint, the owners of many pubs had to improve their premises.  This is understandable because consumers will no longer tolerate shoddy premises, particularly if they have to pay £1.60 and more for a pint which in many cases, they can ill-afford.  Pub owners have upgraded their premises for many reasons but recently they have been talking about the profitability of the pubs decreasing.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Finance who is Dublin based frequents Dublin hostelries. As we all know from our visits to Dublin it is almost impossible to get a pint.  The position in Dublin is much different from that in the rest of the country. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, knows the position in her constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I visit hostelries too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I was saying the Minister probably knows the position in Castlepollard and other areas where there are small pubs.  I am sure that like me the Minister has heard publicans say that times are tough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are about 700 licences in the Dublin area catering for two-thirds of the population, whereas there are 10,000 licences catering for one-third of the population.  One does not have to be a mathematical genius to know where the money is &mdash; in the pubs in Dublin.  I <Col N="2025" /> represent a rural constituency and it is understandable that there would be reaction to the Minister's proposal.  The mandarins in the Department of Finance probably frequent Dublin hostelries because in drafting the proposal and advising the Minister, they seem to have shown no sensitivity to rural Ireland, from where they probably came orignially.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken into consideration the lobbying in this regard. Like everyone else, I was concerned about this issue as I had received many deputations on it.  The Minister has proposed a suitable modification so that in future the licence fee will be based on turnover.  This is the desirable way to approach the issue.  I hope this change will prove successful.  I know reservations have been expressed in regard to the amount the Minister hopes to raise from this change, and this will be the subject of further discussions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister has made appropriate changes to the proposals put forward in the budget.  I compliment him on some of the changes and look forward to further discussion on many issues on Committee Stage.  As I said, this is a very weighty document and I believe much of it has been influenced by EC regulations, etc.  We need the Minister to explain in more detail certain aspects of the Bill.  I presume this will be done on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I compliment some of the previous speakers on their constructive contributions. As I said earlier, there is no point in looking back; we have to look forward.  We also have to give recognition to the climate which exists in the business world.  Times are difficult for many businesses, particularly small businesses.  I am concerned that we will get carried away with the excesses of the scandals, golden circles, etc. &mdash; sagas which we all want to leave behind us &mdash; and brand businessmen as being cute and trying to evade taxation.  Many of these people work extremely hard providing valuable jobs and need encouragement.  In this Bill we need to achieve a balance and recognise those busineses.  Hopefully <Col N="2026" /> these aspects will be taken into account in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Finance Bill.  I compliment him for having met various groups since the budget was introduced to discuss the various proposals.  As previous speakers said, he has modified some of the proposals in the budget to good effect.  In introducing the Finance Bill this year the Minister was faced with the onerous task of further harmonising our VAT and income tax rates with those of other member states.  I compliment the Minister on what he has done in this area.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister dealt with the dismantling of frontiers of custom control for tax purposes by the end of 1992.  This is an issue of great concern to the region I represent.  County Monaghan and County Donegal have the longest stretches of border with the North and, as a result, there are more Custom and Excise officials in these counties than in other Border counties.  Many of these officials will be affected by the changes &mdash; there will be a surplus of 52 Customs and Excise officers in County Monaghan and a surplus of 16 Customs and Excise officers in County Cavan.  These officers will have to be accommodated in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though the Revenue Commissioners promised to get jobs for the surplus personnel as near as possible to where they live at present, very few jobs have been identified to date.  This is a matter of grave concern to public representatives from the area.  The only realistic solution to this problem is to transfer a section of the Department to the premises which will become vacant. Submissions to this effect have already been made.  A request has been made to transfer the collection of motor vehicle excise duties to the Customs and Excise officials and to locate the central office in the Cavan-Monaghan region.  I believe other areas have made similar requests but I doubt if any of them could make a better case than the area I represent.  I hope this work will be divided so that <Col N="2027" /> these officials will not have to leave the area.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the Agriculture staff who commute between Dublin and Cavan should be relocated in Dublin and replaced by the surplus Customs and Excise staff in the area.  It has also been suggested that personnel in the mobile patrols who will become redundant could be utilised to combat drugs, and VAT fraud.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years in particular a considerable amount of money has been spent installing new computer facilities in the centres in Castleblayney, Monaghan, Clones and Swanlinbar.  These offices will now become vacant.  I hope that work will be allocated to these areas which could be carried out by the surplus Customs and Excise officers.  A great deal of trauma will be caused to the families of these officers if they are transferred to other areas.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the urban renewal scheme and the change in legislation to close loopholes in the double rent allowances. However, I am more concerned about the designation of the urban renewal scheme.  I think the Cavan-Monaghan area holds the record for not having had any urban renewal schemes designated to it.  This area has suffered greatly in an economic sense over the past decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the only area which is left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the more important ones.  I hope this will be rectified in the designating of schemes in future.  It may be a political decision, but my constituency seems to get the wrong end of the stick from all Governments and that does not endear one to any political party.  The mapping office was decentralised to six different centres and our request for one of those offices was ignored.  That was regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the creation of jobs will continue to be the biggest task facing the Government.  The manufacturing and food processing industries are making <Col N="2028" /> great efforts to create jobs but there is a limit to what they can do particularly in regard to exports.  In the food processing industry in my area expansion plans have been considerably curtailed because there is not as great a demand for products. I welcome the recommendation in the Culliton report that there should be a national food plan.  That would help us capitalise on our low production costs. Certain industries must be examined, for example, poultry and meat production, with a view to engaging in more downstream processing.  There are problems of seasonality with food production in that at certain times of the year there is an excess of products.  This problem must be tackled if we are to be competitive in the export market.  We should ensure that our products are available all year.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report must give cause for concern from an educational and training point of view.  It states:</P>
    <P>Despite its enviable academic standards, the Irish education and training system has serious gaps when it comes to technical and vocational education and providing for the intermediate production skills that are crucial to industrial productivity.  Management training is also underused.  The shortcomings in this area are so pervasive that the existence of skill deficiencies are often not recognised by management until a direct comparison is made with best practice in other European countries.</P>
    <P>That is a reflection on our preparations for the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report is critical of the role of FÁS in training.  In that respect it states:</P>
    <P>Much of what it does falls better into the category of support for the unemployed than training.  With the notable exception of its apprenticeship programmes, a good deal of what FÁS does is seen to be of little relevance by industry.  Major institutional reforms seem necessary here.</P>
    <P>Again, this is a serious indictment of our training system and does little to help us <Col N="2029" /> in our efforts to secure finance from the EC Social Fund.  That will have to be tackled very quickly.  The report suggests that a new agency be established for the development of indigenous Irish-managed industry to bring together, in a more integrated way, the developmental and support services provided at present on a separate basis by the IDA, An Bord Tráchtála, and Eolas in particular.  It states that such an agency should provide a new impetus and focus for promoting the development of locally-based industry. It is time those agencies were amalgamated. There is need for streamlining in other areas also.  From my experience as a member of a health board, I am aware that much streamlining is needed in the health services and at Department level.  Agencies such as those I mentioned, provide substantial assistance and in future they will have to make a more indepth study of markets, requirements and projections before proceeding with projects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in VAT on technical assistance services and farm relief schemes to 12.5 per cent.  The farm relief schemes provides an essential service, especially for those working alone or those who are out of work through sickness, injury or for some social reason. Under the scheme employment is also created for many young farmers who do not have full time work on the farm and for young people who would otherwise be unemployed.  These people receive very good training.  The scheme is very effective. I also welcome the Minister's decision not to tax the artificial insemination service.  This full time very important service is aimed at improving the national herd and the quality of our stock, which is essential at a time of tight profit margins for many producers.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the fact that co-operatives have been brought into the tax net.  I would favour the exemption of a number of small co-operatives. I am not talking about the large plc's and those who are making substantial profits but the small co-operatives in country areas.  I know of six or seven such co-operatives in my constituency <Col N="2030" /> who provide a very good service. Any profit they make goes towards improving the service for the farmer. With the introduction of the LEADER programme those co-operatives will play a major role in ensuring that the programme will be a success.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Séamus Brennan was Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications he launched a tourism task force, consisting of representatives of banks, hotels, accommodation providers, unions and marketing sectors, to examine the potential of the tourism industry.  I understand that following discussions proposals will be put forward on this issue.  I hope a tourism plan will be devised for the country, with special recognition for areas with potential which historically have not been tourist centres. They would require that bit extra by way of help to ensure they are not left behind and that those counties with a stronger tradition in terms of tourism do not get most of the funding.</P>
    <P>We hear reference regularly to alternative farm enterprises.  We need to put in place a farm plan which will examine every area which has potential for generating jobs.  Some of the projects mentioned are flax, seed potatoes, horses, deer and rabbits but it is unlikely that any of those would generate sufficient employment to employ all those without jobs.  I hope this problem will be attended to in the Department as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has responded reasonably well to our suggestions and to the points we raised.  I am glad he responded to the representations from publicans and did not proceed with the proposal to base a publican's annual licence on a multiplier of seven of the rateable valuation of the premises.  To do so would have had a devastating effect on those publicans who expanded their premises in the belief they would attract the level of business they are failing to attract at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the contributions of Members on both sides of the House.  I was amused when <Col N="2031" /> Deputy John Dennehy, looking across the Floor with a somewhat jaundiced eye, said that Members on this side of the House were giving a less than positive welcome to the Finance Bill.  At the risk of incurring the wrath of the Deputy I have to go down that road a little further. Perhaps it is symptomatic of parties in Opposition that they do not see the budget or the Finance Bill in the same light as the Government or the Government backbenchers.  However, when I was sitting on the side opposite, we had to listen to the then Opposition's loud crys of &ldquo;bookeepers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thatcherism&rdquo;, &ldquo;accountancy&rdquo; speeches and so on.  I am afraid such slogans still fit because it can certainly be said that the Finance Bill is not innovative.  There is no flair to it.  It is simply a bookeeper's Bill, a statutory instrument which gives legislative effect to a budget which also had little flair.</P>
      <P>Because of the high number of unemployed, people were looking for inspiration from some quarter to alleviate the burden on those who are still at work and to alleviate the plight of those who cannot get work.  Everybody was disappointed. The Finance Bill which has come in the wake of the budget is equally disappointing. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, or the Members sitting opposite but that is the position.  If budgets produced in the four years prior to 1987 were regarded as &ldquo;Thatcherite&rdquo;, monetarist and so on, I am sorry to have to say that this year's budget was likewise except that it was even more bland than anything ever produced before.  It attempts to do very little and it is not innovative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not delay the House very long but I wish to make a number of points. First I refer to the taxation of co-operatives. If there is one area which has much potential for employment generation, it is the area of food production, an activity for which this country is well suited.  It is remarkable that there should be any move to increase the burden on that sector.  This was referred to by the previous speaker from the Government benches.  What is being proposed may be <Col N="2032" /> good from a bookeeper's or a financier's point of view &mdash; some colleagues may point out that certain loopholes are being closed off in that area &mdash; but we must remember that this is the area on which our economy relies to a large extent, first for food we require and, second, for the jobs that this area can provide.  Anything that impedes that process is not in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will not be remembered favourably for what he is proposing in this Bill in relation to the food sector.  I cannot understand where the suggestion came from in the first instance.  Colleagues from Munster and Ulster who are sitting opposite, in whose areas there is a strong labour force in the co-operatives, must readily concede that while this proposal may be a means of raising money for the Exchequer &mdash; that may seem laudable but it depends on the use to which the money is put &mdash; it is difficult to understand why we should be extracting funds from the co-operatives when they have the potential to reinvest those moneys for the benefit of the economy generally.  I cannot understand how the Minister can do this or how the Cabinet supported such a decision.  I only hope that this was a temporary lapse of concentration so far as both the Minister and the Cabinet are concerned but I am surprised that the backbenchers from the Government parties did not express more consternation because of the likely impact of this measure on such a positive industry.  I hope we will hear more about this at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>This country depends very largely on the co-operatives.  We depend on them to create employment opportunities and particularly in regard to what will happen after the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT reforms.</P>
    <P>It was a political objective of the Progressive Democrats when in Opposition to bring about a tax rate of 25 per cent, and to have a single band or two at most. They have exceeded all expectations because their partners in Government have assisted them in ensuring there will be in effect only one band &mdash; that is the marginal tax band at 48 per cent.  That <Col N="2033" /> may be further reduced to 45 per cent within a few years but by virtue of the nipping and tucking that takes place at budget time or in the Finance Bill, only those on social welfare or whose income is so low as to be untaxable will be taxable at rates lower than the upper rate.</P>
    <P>The theory in Government circles is that this is a very fine and positive effort to introduce a system that removes a number of people from the tax net.  So it is, but these people would no longer be in the tax net anyway because their incomes would be below what was regarded as taxable income.  It is the recorrection at budget time which threatens to bring them back into the tax net.  It is no credit to the Minister or any combination of Ministers of either party in Government that we are moving to a 25 per cent income tax rate because the number of people who will benefit at the end of the day will be insignificant and the bulk of the taxation will be gleaned from those in the higher band.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has made some modifications to his earlier proposals in regard to benefit-in-kind.  The original proposals were heavy handed because they were produced in a hurry and without sufficient consultation with the various interested parties and so on.  I can understand the reaction of these unfortunate people who have the benefit of a company car but who have to spend a great deal of time, at great inconvenience to themselves and their families travelling from one end of the country to the other. I can understand how they found it incomprehensible that a microscope should again pass over their area.  Incidentally, these people are the driving force in the economy in that they are involved in sales teams, promotions and all the things we said we should be doing more of in this country &mdash; promoting ourselves, our economy, our goods, etc.</P>
    <P>As a result the Minister for Finance, first in the budget, and then in the Finance Bill decided to have a closer look at them with a view to determining how he could take a little more from them in taxation.  I realise he has modified his budget proposal in the Finance Bill, but, <Col N="2034" /> nevertheless, a particular category was examined with a view to extracting more revenue and not with a view to making that group more efficient so that they could do their job more efficiently or that they could improve the economy or employment levels.  Whether at local or national level when a proposal arises the sole purpose of which is to raise money the impact can only be negative on the people on whom it falls.  If the proposal has a positive side and raises money and encourages something else of a positive nature, fine, that usually works but at local authority level as those of us who have served on local authorities know, whenever there is a proposal to impose tax solely for the purpose of extracting extra revenue, therein lies a problem, and many of us have received submissions from our constituents about benefits-in-kind, and understandably so.</P>
    <P>I hope the lapse the Minister suffered on this occasion and the unfortunate advice he took from some quarter will not recur; I also hope that in future he will have a more positive regard to the role being played by these people and the necessity to encourage people who work unsocial hours to make a greater contribution to the economy by being the driving force within it.</P>
    <P>I have often said before, and I have no hesitation in saying again, that one feature we should have in a Finance Bill would be the emergence of a positive tax regime.  I should like to devote a few moments to that issue.  Our economic position <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European partners and the members of the EFTA countries who are thinking seriously about joining us at present must be of some concern to the Minister for Finance, the Cabinet and both parties in Government because we are in a serious economic situation with particular reference to unemployment. The purpose of a budget and Finance Bill should be steered in the direction of creating a positive atmosphere which would ensure that it is more attractive to an employer to employ extra people, that it is equally attractive to a person who is unemployed to seek employment and, by combining the first two, we will arrive at <Col N="2035" /> a situation where this country will be a far better place in which to live.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the burden of unemployment on the employed group and the necessity to correct this imbalance in the near future.  I have said before &mdash; and it has been said by many others &mdash; it is about time we saw manifested in the Finance Bill that the number of people who are unemployed <i>vis-á-vis</i> the number of people who are employed is unsustainable &mdash; the number unemployed is almost 21 per cent.  It is unbelievable that we can expect to sustain this pressure on our economy from within for the foreseeable future.  If we cannot resolve that within the next three to four years, our problem will become worse. There is no sense in waiting for the demographic trends to resolve the problem for us; there is no sense in waiting for population numbers to drop and the problem will resolve itself.  That has been talked about in the past but it does not always work because there are other trends such as migration and other economies which can disrupt that.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister for Finance when next he is preparing a budget &mdash; if he ever does and I wish him no ill feeling when I suggest he might not &mdash; to give more time and energy to looking at ways and means of ensuring, by introducing financial inducements in the Finance Bill, that will make it worthwhile for employers to take on more employees and reduce their overheads in a positive way, without necessarily losing vast amounts of revenue.  It is generally accepted that the cost of providing jobs in this country is way above what it should be and what the country can afford.  Perhaps we should look at how we run things; we have all made mistakes in the past.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Quinn.  I see a consensus emerging in this House where all political parties have a duty and a role to play in dealing with our major national problem of unemployment. I strongly disagree with suggestions from any quarter that Fine Gael, the party I represent, have been <Col N="2036" /> other than positive in dealing with this issue.  Members will recall Fine Gael were the first party to look for a jobs forum. A jobs forum has a meaning which we all know about, but what we have been offered is a jobs committee, and there is a vast difference.  We had the New Ireland Forum which was successful and dealt broadly with a series of issues relating to a vital national issue.  It set out a framework and structures which could be followed at a later date.  How can one compare that with a committee of backbenchers &mdash; and I mean no disrespect to backbenchers who obviously will be well qualified to do their job and so on?  The two should never be confused.  I would hope Members on the opposite side of the House will not try to confuse that issue because, while the problems of this country in relation to job creation may be assisted by a forum, they certainly will not be resolved by a committee.  This is an area that the Minister for Finance could have addressed positively but he has not done so.  Apart from a quick example I will not go into details on the cost of jobs etc.  Let us take the example of a person who is unemployed, qualifies for various benefits and has a medical card etc.  That person would need to be paid about £50 a week more in employment to achieve the same standard of living, and that is without the assistance of a medical card.  There is obviously a serious problem here.</P>
    <P>There is not much reference in the Bill to taxation and the repatriation of profits which has been referred to many times in this House.  In the present economic climate I cannot understand why so much time is spent wondering why multinational corporations repatriate their profits and thinking up taxation systems to prevent them from doing so.  Let us, by all means, provide inducements to encourage them to reinvest in the country. That would be positive and could result in the employment of more people. Let us not introduce penalties that further encourage them to repatriate their profits.  Our first priority must be to try to reduce the numbers unemployed, not to figure out how the people who will <Col N="2037" /> provide these jobs are going to repatriate their profits.  It would be of greater benefit to the economy to have lower rates of tax, in return for which one could expect a greater degree of multinational investment in the country.</P>
    <P>We have approximately 100,000 jobs based on foreign investment at the moment.  We need double that and we need it in a hurry because all the other jobs likely to be created in indigenous industry will be created in the wake of such investment.  There is room for positive taxation measures in that area to encourage foreign investment and the retention of profits in the country afterwards, contributing to continuing employment and reducing the burden on those who are employed by reducing the number unemployed.  It is a simple equation.</P>
    <P>Here, I must become a little parochial. It behoves every one of us to be so now and again even Ministers from Wexford. Urban renewal has been a bone of contention in County Kildare.  It has registered the fastest population growth in the entire country but has consistently failed to gain anything whatsoever from the urban renewal programme.  I do not understand why the Minister has consistently passed it by and why nothing can be done even at this stage to extend the facility to County Kildare.  It is very important to do so for the reason that some of our towns and villages were built to cater for a much smaller population than they have at present.  Many of the older buildings, warehouses and so on, are due for renewal and would present very interesting openings for people with entrepreneurial spirit and flair and some investment capital.  Unfortunately, nothing like this has happened in County Kildare because we were passed by.  It is a sad reflection that in the case of a town that has shown the kind of population growth I have mentioned and that has seen a huge amount of new development, the Government did not see fit to set aside a sum of money for urban renewal which would balance the new development that has taken place and bring about the kind of development in the older <Col N="2038" /> areas that would be in keeping with the aesthetics of the area.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other issues that I wish to discuss.  One is in relation to valuations.  We all know the likely impact in both rural and urban areas of the Minister's proposals in relation to pub licences in the context of square footage and so on.  I note that the Minister has revised his stance.  I also note that he has left thresholds and bands to his own discreation in the future.  I would ask the Minister to be dissuaded from that course because the tendency in the future will be to try to raise money in this area without any regard to the negative impact of such action, which is that the cost would be passed on to the customer at best, and at worst a number of people would go out of business.  I do not see what benefit that would be to the economy. I therefore thank the Minister for reconsidering it, but give him no thanks for not going the whole way and departing from his earlier intentions.  Obviously his intention was to raise revenue rather than improve the industry, and that is a pity.</P>
    <P>He has made some improvements in response to the promptings of my colleagues, Deputy Noonan and others.  I would think there were some promptings from the backbenchers on that side of the House also, because I am sure they all have first-hand knowledge of the hostelries in their constituencies where they would no doubt have been updated on the dangerous developments the Minister was indicating in the budget.</P>

      <P>It would not be the first time they claimed all the credit but I am not so sure that they would be so anxious to claim credit for some of the issues being discussed in this House by the time they are implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an aspect of valuations I am concerned about.  I am not sure if it applies everywhere but I have become very much aware of it in my own constituency. If people improve their premises <Col N="2039" /> by adding an extension, for example, they immediately get a new valuation and in the same post a note from some consultant telling them how they can have their valuations reduced.  It is a huge burden on people to have to face the threat, year after year, or having a new valuation put on their premises.  This does not always follow on an increase in the square footage of the premises.  They might just have put on a new roof and the result is that their premises is revalued.  Also taken into account is the potential volume of business, the geographical location <i>vis-à-vis</i> the market, the position on a main street, whether it is in a mall, etc.  I find it difficult to understand why all the other taxation systems that are in place are not sufficient and why it is not possible to collect an equitable and just amount of taxation from the people in those premises.</P>
    <P>I recall that 25 to 30 years ago most shops in ours towns and villages were owned by the people running them.  However, during the past ten to 15 years there has been a tendency to either lease or rent property with the result that the turnover, in terms of wastage, is colossal.  If one takes a two year period in any town or village the majority of shopping units seem to change hands for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>In the old days it was necessary for the owner of the premises to put his business on a sound financial footing whereas now it is easier to get into business, which is a good thing, but it is much easier to get out or be pushed out.  The wastage in such units is huge.  The local authorities take the first shot at them by way of rates because they have no money and commercial rates are the only means open to them to raise money.  Therefore there is a tendency to value these units at the highest rate and to let the persons concerned protest later when the local authority can either reduce or increase the valuation.</P>
    <P>The other group who move in on the tenants are the owners who will probably increase the rent.  There is now competition <Col N="2040" /> between the local authority and the owners of the premises to see who can extract most revenue.  Unfortunately, they are killing the towns and villages involved.  Indeed the nearer one gets to a large city the worse the position becomes. Within 40 to 50 miles of Dublin, the pull of the city supersedes everything else with the result that a great deal of competition is created for the small shopkeeper. I am sure the same applies in Cork.</P>
    <P>The point is no one seems to be doing anything about this and unless something is done soon, the commercial areas in those towns and villages will either disappear or have no significance for the rest of the population.  The enthusiasm with which valuations in the commercial sector are pursued contrasts with the manner in which valuations are pursued in the residential sector.  If valuations in the residential sector are to be increased and updated, it will be necessary for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment to ensure that the rates support grant is commensurate with the revised and updated valuations.  The Minister is not well disposed to this idea and, as a result, the local authorities do it for him.</P>
    <P>The final point I would like to make relates to stamp duty.  There are a number of references to stamp duty in the Bill.  The time has come for us to recognise that stamp duty on housing accommodation for first time buyers, in particular of second hand houses, is prohibitive. While the proportion of stamp duty <i>vis-à-vis</i> the total cost is the same, because the value of property is on the increase the amount of stamp duty raised is also on the increase.  Five or six years ago it was relatively easy for a young couple who visited us at our clinics to buy a house but property values have risen in the meantime and an increased amount of stamp duty is sought and requested, legally.  Unfortunately, as a result, young people are being dissuaded from buying houses, in particular second-hand houses.</P>
    <P>This matter should be looked at.  I have asked questions in the House and I am <Col N="2041" /> aware that there would be revenue implications, but it is not a positive way of raising revenue as it does not encourage anybody to do anything.  All it does is take money out of people's pockets when buying property.  What I am asking the Minister to do is to raise the limits, if possible.  While I am aware that some modifications have been made, the time has come for us to do something more positive, in particular at the lower end of the scale.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would have been more positive and would have shown more flair in the Finance Bill this year as against last year, but then again he could not as it followed on on a budget which was anything but positive.  As I said, it reflects the criticism hurled at previous Ministers for Finance from this side of the House by the then Opposition. It never ceases to amuse me that when Deputies move from Opposition to Government benches they never seem to show the same foresight and vision.  I might never get the opportunity to sit on the other side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ag labhairt dom ar an mBille Airgeadais, 1992, ní mór dom béim a chur ar an bhfostaíocht agus ar an dífhostaíocht, mar is iad siúd na príomh ábhair atá ar ár n-aigne go léir.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil gá leis an reachtaíocht seo chun forálacha na cáinaisnéise agus chun na hathruithe a shocraigh an tAire a dhéanamh de bharr na díospóireachta ar an cháinaisnéis a chur i bhfeidhm. Molaim an tAire as ucht an méid a bhí le rá aige sna 43 leathnach dá óráid inné agus é ag tosnú Dara Céim den Bhille. Ní thuigim go mbeadh sé le rá ag Comhalta ar aon taobh den Teach nach bhfuil gach rud curtha isteach aige go soiléir. <Col N="2042" /> Is léir go bhfuil an mhuinín ag an Aire leanúint leis an sáir obair a tosnaíodh i 1987 agus a cuireadh ar aghaidh ag an dá Rialtas a bhí ann ó shin i leith.</P>
      <P>Overall, this Finance Bill marks a further stage in the Government's economic strategy of tax reform as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government and provides a statutory basis for the taxation measures introduced in the budget on 29 January.  It is also the legislative measure which outlines the provisions in the budget and other tax policy measures which the Government now consider necessary in preparation for the internal market.</P>
      <P>The simple objective of the budget was to support the fight against unemployment by a combination of soundly based public finances which are essential to sustainable growth and structural reforms aimed at ensuring that we get the best possible employment return from that growth.  My Opposition colleague referred to employment and unemployment towards the end of his contribution and he reminded the House of the jobs forum.  The attitude adopted by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and permeating the thinking of Deputies&mdash; including the Deputy present &mdash; was because they did not get their way, they felt the committee being set up to address this very serious problem was not something in which they could be involved, despite their continual posturings about unemployment.  Their credibility, low as it has been in the polls, will be further damaged by their inability to take part in the committee on employment set up by the Dáil.  They will regret their unfortunate error.</P>

      <P>I also heard a Deputy say today that we should not refer to the past.  I take inspiration from the past, profit by mistakes made in the past and put the experience to good use in the future.  The mistakes made by the administration in 1982-87 perhaps should be forgotten by them, that is their prerogative.  However, the restoration of confidence and the strength of the economy was made possible by the reduction of our dependence on borrowing, the control of spending and the easing of the tax burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We took the decisions which might have seemed to impinge <Col N="2044" /> unfairly on areas of activity, people or sectors but we courageously took them to put our economy on a sound footing. It is evident that we have been able to weather the storm of current difficulties in the international economy with much less damage than during similar experiences in the past.  It is essential that the overhang of debt must be reduced as rapidly as possible so that we can free more of our natural resources for our greater needs.  Having public finances in order is central to providing the proper climate for the creation of sustainable employment.</P>
      <P>Despite the general economic slowdown, Ireland's performance&mdash;last year in particular &mdash; was satisfactory.  A growth rate of 2 per cent was, in any language, a good performance when put in the context of the world growth of 1 per cent and a recession in the economies of some of our trading partners.  Despite all the difficulties we faced, employment in larger industrial establishments in the first three-quarters of 1991 was up by over 1,000 on average compared with the corresponding period in 1990.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal briefly with an area in which I was involved in recent times, that of tourism.  In 1987 we realised that it was an area of great potential for the creation of jobs and generating extra revenue.  We set ourselves targets, many people said they were ambitious and unattainable; they were ambitious but they were also attainable.  A recent independent survey commissioned by the Irish Tourist Industry Federation showed that Irish tourism grew twice as fast as the national economy in the past five years, contributing almost three-quarters of a percentage point each year to the national growth rate and increasing its share of GNP to almost 7 per cent.  I am convinced that tourism is Ireland's principal internationally traded service. It accounts for about 60 per cent of our total export of services and contributed more than £400 million &mdash; or about half the surplus on the overall balance of payments &mdash; in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism has been responsible for one in every three jobs created in the economy <Col N="2045" /> between 1986 and 1990 and it now supports one in every eight jobs in the service sector.  As I indicated, it is now five years since Fianna Fáil published their ideas of putting growth back into tourism.  In that document we committed ourselves to revitalising tourism as a top national priority.  We have done this and it was a privilege for me to have been part of that effort for five years.  Since then annual tourism numbers have gone up by 66 per cent, from 1.8 million to an estimated three million and foreign revenue from £650 million to £1.2 billion last year.  During that time considerable improvements have been made in our product range and there has been greater co-ordination in our marketing efforts, both of which have been central to the achievement.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to talk about the major EC investment in tourism. That investment is largely attributable to the implementation of the EC operational programme for tourism for the years 1989 to 1993.  That programme, involving more than £118 million from the European Regional Development Fund and more than £28 million from the European Social Fund, is concerned with the development and marketing of tourism and tourism amenities in Ireland to meet the demand from identified segments of the international tourist market, thereby enabling achievement of five-year sectoral targets for job creation and foreign revenue.  Total investment from national and EC sources under the programme will exceed £300 million by the end of 1993.  So far, 300 or more projects have been approved for assistance, involving more than £270 million, of which £85 million is being provided by the EC.  The administering agencies of SFADCo and Bord Fáilte are still assessing and evaluating applications.  I hope that in the near future there will be further announcements approving more projects.</P>
    <P>In addition to enhancing Ireland's appeal to overseas markets, the improvements already outlined provide an added boost to the thriving home holiday market, which is now worth about £360 <Col N="2046" /> million annually and for which I had special responsibility in recent times.</P>
    <P>The 1991 tourism performance deserves attention in that 1991 was a difficult year for the Irish industry because of the recession in our main markets of the United States and the United Kingdom and particularly because of the Gulf Crisis.  Instead of whingeing about such things, we in Government last year sought to counteract the problems by introducing several measures, including the allocation in the 1991 budget of an additional £1 million to Bord Fáilte for promotional marketing in the United Kingdom and continental Europe.  A further £1.25 million was also made available from the European Regional Development Fund at a special 75 per cent intervention rate for marketing campaigns in the United States and mainland Europe.  Those measures, together with the decision of Bord Fáilte to step up their marketing in continental Europe, ensured that the downturn forecast at the beginning of the year was more or less avoided.  Overseas numbers for the full year were within 2 per cent of the 1990 all-time record performance, and revenue for the first nine months was up by almost 7 per cent on the corresponding period in 1990.</P>
    <P>For 1992 we should aim to return to the double-digit figure gross.  All efforts are being concentrated to that end.  The tourism sector has proved its economic worth in recent years.  It has shown clearly the way in which it can contribute to wealth and job creation.  With that in mind, as pointed out by my colleague Deputy Leonard, a task force was again put in place this year.  That task force is similar to the task force established in 1987.  The task force are being asked to plan a strategy that builds on the achievements attained, maintaining vibrancy and growth into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of tourism, where we have been, where we are at and our hopes for the future, I should mention Expo '92 in Seville.  The Government decided to participate in the international exhibition in Seville this year, principally to continue to raise Ireland's <Col N="2047" /> profile on the world map as a tourist destination and as an ideal location for industry, with the focus on our young, well-educated population.  The Government have committed £3.5 million of national lottery funds towards that objective.  The event, which runs from April until October, has been billed as one of the most important attractions before we enter the new millennium.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, I should point out that Expo '92 is not merely a trade fair, it is a major cultural event and it will be a showcase for the best of Irish products, talents and culture.  The cultural programme will reflect the uniqueness, the variety and the creative quality of Irish talent and will include performances to support that from Siamsa Tíre, the Gate Theatre, De Danann and the Chieftains, to name a few.  All in all, 1992 should be an exciting year for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>All the achievements I mentioned were brought about by the co-ordinated activities and efforts of all sectors and players in the tourism industry.  Big and small, all sectors are being asked again this year to row in behind the national effort so that we may return to the double digit figures in 1992.  I acknowledge the contribution by those connected directly and indirectly with the success attained in the creation of badly needed jobs and in the generation of extra revenue.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that employment in the construction industry decreased, it must also be noted that in the same period employment in the financial services such as banking, insurance and building societies, was well above 1990 levels.  While details of the way the economy is performing this year are not available, there are hopeful signs. Exports were good in January, as was our industrial output.  Seasonally adjusted trade surpluses are almost the best on record, and consumer spending and building investment have shown a modest improvement in recent months.  It would be dangerous to become complacent following our success in controlling inflation but some satisfaction can be gleaned from the fact that Ireland has remained below <Col N="2048" /> EC levels on that score, despite the increase to 3.7 per cent in the year to February.  Wholesale price increase over that period, at 3 per cent, could be said to be modest.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the international economic outlook for 1992 remains uncertain.  At the end of last year both the OECD and the EC Commission forecast slow international recovery, with growth picking up by between 2 per cent and 4 per cent from last year's 1 per cent. Developments so far in the US, the German, the UK and the Japanese economies suggest that international economic recovery may be slower than envisaged.  The prospect of international economic recovery combined with the useful increases in the volume of public capital spending suggests some growth in investment.</P>
    <P>In the budget a number of steps were taken to combat raising unemployment, for instance, reductions in direct taxes which will improve incentives to work. This is the reward for enterprise and effort.  We have an agreement with the EC on the provision of substantial funds for a new development subsidy scheme and in company training.  I acknowledge the support of the FIE, other employer organisations and the ICTU for these schemes.  I add my voice to the appeal of the Minister to employers to participate fully in these schemes.</P>
    <P>There are area partnerships envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to combat long-term unemployment through training, education and enterprise development. These partnerships are now in place in 12 pilot areas.  The estimated cost to the Exchequer is in the region of £16 million in 1992.  We have a committee of Ministers assisted by a working party of officials and people from the private sector examining recommendations of the Industrial Policy Review Group and the Task Force on Unemployment.  It is accepted that there is only so much any Government can do.</P>
    <P>The Government have made a key contribution by ensuring that their broad policy stance is conducive to employment <Col N="2049" /> growth.  Government policy minimises any disincentive effect on enterprise.  It provides leadership and growth oriented policies, but in the final analysis progress will be determined by how the private sector deal with the opportunities created.  It has been proved that, given the right conditions, a significant number of jobs can be created.  The key to greater employment creation in the private sector is stronger investment and expansion.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance decided to review his proposals for the licensed trade in his budget, and that the suggestion that the liquor licence would be charged on the basis of rateable valuation has been modified.  The Minister is now providing for a turnover based system.  That is welcomed by all concerned. On foot of representations made to him on this issue the Minister accepted that his original proposal was inequitable. I am glad that as far as possible, holders of liquor licences will be treated fairly having regard to the conditions for the various types of licences involved. Section 135 of the Bill deals extensively with this matter.  I am sure this section will be welcomed generally by the trade.</P>
    <P>With regard to the licensed trade, I will refer also to the hours of trading.  A few years ago we extended the hours of trading for licensed premises.  It was indicated that this was to benefit tourists.  I always argued that tourists do not partake in late night drinking.  They prefer to retire early and rise early to move on to the next destination or, if they are remaining in one place, they prefer to be up and about to savour the leisure or other activities of the day.  The extension of the licensing hours encouraged patrons to go later to the local.  That was not to the advantage of the trade.</P>
    <P>Because there is so much employment in this area, we should consider eliminating hours of trading from the licensing laws.  It would probably take from five to ten years for the consumer, the publican and the trade to adjust.  It is not right that all pubs and licensed premises should close at the same time.  That contributes to traffic hazards.  I make this <Col N="2050" /> point in the light of experience.  The industry and the Minister for Justice, or whoever has responsibility for this area, should commence discussions on a sensible approach to the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies in those laws.  For instance, one of the better restaurants on the road from Cork to Dublin could not serve meals on the premises to truckers on Good Friday because it is a licensed premises.  The restauranteur had to erect a marquee in the car park to serve meals.  That is just one example of the problems which arise because of the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>There is confusion and bad feeling about bar extensions.  There have been confrontations between clubs, hotels, pubs and discos because of these extensions. It is fair to say that ours is a drink culture that needs to be examined.  I attended a seminar recently at which drugs were debated when an eminent contributor, much to the surprise of many paticipants, to put it mildly, indicated that our greatest drugs problem was alcoholism.  I am not saying whether I agree or disagree with this contention.  I merely draw the attention of the House to the fact that that statement was made at a recent seminar on the use-misuse of drugs.  Abroad the trade and the individual dictate the hours of trading; this step might be contemplated here.  I do not envisage that change will be effected over-night but the time has come for all concerned to take a close look at the present position.</P>
    <P>Since the main theme of my contribution is employment-unemployment we should take note of the many people, willing to work, who cannot obtain employment and those who are unable to work because of illness or disability of whatever form.  In order to cater for those people we must continue to be mindful of them and provide for them as we have been doing.  There are budgetary changes relating to the social welfare payments on which a significant proportion of those people depend.</P>
    <P>The principal element of the social welfare changes in this year's budget is a general 4 per cent increase in all weekly <Col N="2051" /> social welfare payments; a special increase to £53 for all short-term payments, including disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and the carer's allowance, constituting an increase of 6 per cent.  Because of the level of unemployment and the strain it imposes on families, especially with young school-going children, it is only right that the back to school clothing and footwear allowance be increased by £10 per child, bringing the full payment to £50 for each child attending second level school and to £35 for each child attending primary school.</P>
    <P>There is the introduction of an adoptive benefit scheme for women in employment; further improvements in the family income supplement scheme to help those at work on low pay from which it is predicted 7,200 families and 29,000 children will benefit.  Then there is the introduction, on a phased basis, commencing this year, of measures to give effect to an EC Court of Justice ruling on equal treatment which will be readily acknowledged has been around for quite a while. It is to be welcomed that the Department have established a special group to devote attention to that matter this year.</P>
    <P>It is further proposed that the age of eligibility for the preretirement allowance be reduced from 58 to 55, with a special increase in the adult dependant allowance payable with the old age non-contributory pension to remove an anomaly. There is also the extension of the free travel companion pass to certain pensioners and the extension of the over-80 allowance to invalidity pensioners with effect from April, giving them an extra £4.20 per week.</P>
    <P>I note also that, as a result of a recent change in the social welfare legislation, pensioners over 66 years of age will have the option of moving into accommodation more suited to their needs with the security of knowing they will retain their pensions.  Many elderly people live in houses that have been their homes for many years but which are no longer suited to their needs and which, in many <Col N="2052" /> cases, they are no longer in a position to maintain.  To date, such people faced the dilemma that, were they to sell their homes, they would lose all or part of their pensions because the capital realised from such sale was taken into account in means testing their pensions.  Faced with that dilemma many elderly people retain their homes often ending up in institutional care instead of living out their lives in comfortable circumstances in the community.  It will readily be appreciated that that recent change in social welfare legislation is to be welcomed particularly for our senior citizens.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to be somewhat parochial and refer to matters affecting the constituency which has elected me to this House in the past five general elections.  One of my colleagues mentioned the amount of money being expended on road infrastructure in Cork. For some time past public pronouncements on the part of publicly elected representatives, aided and abetted by some elements of the media, have continually informed the public that the Cork city area in particular was being denied &mdash; to quote some of their phrases &mdash; a fair share of the national cake.  With the turnabout in some of the comments of those elements of the media about which I speak, one would think that all the infrastructure and decisions relating to the Cork area occurred recently or that they had just awoken to that fact.  We have a good airport in Cork.  From the day its foundations were laid by the late Seán Lemass some 25 years ago there had been no other improvement generally in the Cork area.  However, in recent years, a huge amount of money has been spent on Cork Airport.  We have a fine terminal building, comparable with any other airport, with features that will not be seen elsewhere.  The runway has been extended, with landing and lighting equipment making it safer and reducing the number of diversions to other airports.</P>
    <P>There was a vociferous debate recently about the decentralisation issue, which decision was taken many months ago.  It was left to the local authority to submit <Col N="2053" /> suggestions for sitings, locations or size in the case of the building to house the civil servants of the Central Statistics Office being transferred to Cork.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government since 1987 to ensuring the continuance of a ferry link between Cork and Swansea ought to be acknowledged positively by everybody.  Last week an historical building in Cork was officially opened.  Five years ago this building was an empty shell, a concrete structure, with no funding left to refurbish it or complete the work.  Because a few of us saw a wider purpose for such a building than that for which it was originally constructed we were able to have it refurbished with £500,000 of EC funds for tourism and the help of FÁS trainees, with the approval of the local trade unions.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the allocation of funds from the European Regional Development Fund and ESF to various projects throughout the country.  I want to put it on the record that the largest single grant allocation under those programmes by the Department with which I was previously involved went to the very deserving heritage project in Cobh. Naturally I wish that project well.  I am sure that in a very short time when all the elements of the jigsaw puzzle are in place we will have the distinction of having an under-water tunnel.  Such a project has been in the offing since 1980 when the committee, of which I was chairman, decided that the best economic and aesthetical way to cross the River Lee at that point was by means of a submersible tunnel.  Due to indecision and shelving of the project from 1980 to 1987 &mdash; people tend to forget about those years &mdash; this project was not proceeded with.  Suddenly this project was placed on the shopping list of requirements for the area. Due to the positive commitment of local representatives we have progressed to the stage where work on a downstream crossing under the river will commence shortly.  This will be an added attraction to the Cobh project, Shandon and the Blarney Stone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to question fundamentally the usefulness of the annual budget circus with its obsessive secrecy and the subsequent Finance Bill ritual.  This ritual is a pale imitation which we have inherited from 19th century British-style administration and it is time to ditch it.  The attempts by Ministers to plan by incrementalism is pathetic.  It shows a grave contempt of the people's intelligence with all its hype which in reality makes little difference to most people's lives.</P>
      <P>In modern society where even children have spreadsheets, the whole apparatus of the State, the highly competent civil servants and academic economists should be able to plan out multi-annual rolling income and expenditure programmes.  I ask the Minister for Finance to reply to this point and to promise to get advice from the universities &mdash; as distinct from the supposed independent economists who, in effect, are stockbroker economists &mdash; from his own officials, and begin to construct a strategic plan for the economy which must include tax reforms. Even small fish firms have strategic plans. They plan out sales and investment over five-year periods.  Surely it is time the largest enterprise in the country, that is, the State, with its budget which is approaching a staggering £10 billion, began to use 20th century methods of accounting, planning and business expertise.  We should end the circus of secrecy, the artificial hype and the infighting in Cabinet for increases in favoured Ministers' Departments.</P>
      <P>The Government have correctly insisted that companies produce proper accounts.  It is time that the Government did the same.  The main financial indicator, the budget deficit, which mixes current and capital spending, should be reformed.  A company would write off capital investments over a number of years.  Surely the Government should do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also highly critical of the very <Col N="2055" /> definitions of &ldquo;capital&rdquo; and &ldquo;current&rdquo;. For example, is teachers' pay not capital spending, as it is investment in human capital?  Education pushes up future incomes and thus tax revenue.  Perhaps it is because too many educated Irish people are forced to emigrate that it is not appropriate to treat this as capital investment in Ireland.  Many countries, including Ireland, have cut their capital investment in the past decade.  Therefore, the network of the public sector has fallen in recent years.  New investment has not been sufficient to maintain the value of our capital stocks.  While this fall-off in Exchequer-funded investment has been mitigated, the drive to cut spending has regrettably led to the largest cuts in investment.  This is a major contributor to our high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Another area which the Government should face up to, if they decide to introduce 20th century methods into Government financing, is the inclusion of the capitalised value of future State pensions and social welfare benefits.  These rise as the population ages, and Ireland's population is suddenly no longer as young as it was a few years ago.  Furthermore, with our uniquely high mass emigration we are losing many of our young people.  In a normal economy these people would work, pay tax and contribute to these payments.  It is more important in our case to bring into effect good budgetary practice.  Therefore, our budget should be replaced with five year rolling plans. Proper account should be taken of real investment such as education.  There should be depreciation of investment over a period of years rather than in the first year and proper account should be taken of the real cost of privatisation through the loss of the future profit streams and loss of future capital gains. Proper account should be taken of the real cost of future pension and welfare costs, particularly with the loss of so many of our young people through emigration due to the failed economic policies <Col N="2056" /> of successive Governments since independence.</P>
    <P>The size of this year's Finance Bill, amounting to 232 sections and seven Schedules, spread over 246 pages, highlights the dreadfully inadequate way in which the House is asked to deal with vital legislation such as this and is eloquent testimony of the need for fundamental Dáil reform.  The Finance Bill ought to be one of the most important Bills to be processed by the Dáil each year.  Certainly, it is the one which has the most direct impact on the money in the pockets and purses of the electorate. Even for a normal sized Finance Bill the time usually allocated is inadequate &mdash; normally three days for Second Stage, two or three days or parts of days for Committee Stage and one day for Report Stage.  The result is that every year without fail many sections, sometimes whole chapters of the Finance Bill, are never discussed because of the use of the parliamentary guillotine.  The Minister for Finance frequently introduces substantial amendments, often new sections, on Committee Stage which are never given consideration by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is failing to fulfil its constitutional obligations to consider legislation. What results is in effect legislation by ministerial decree.  As a result of the amendments made in the Appropriation Bill before Christmas, which did not receive adequate consideration, the timetable for completion of the Finance Bill was tightened even further.  Second Stage must now be passed within five days of the resumption of the Dáil after the Easter recess.  The whole legislative process has to be completed in the Dáil and Seanad to allow the Bill to be signed by the President within four calendar months of the budget.  If the time allocated in previous years is repeated this year even less of this Bill will receive proper consideration due to its exceptional length.</P>
    <P>By lunch time on the second day of the Second Stage debate, the second Opposition speaker was still in possession. Therefore, it is clear that even fewer Deputies will have an opportunity to contribute <Col N="2057" /> to the Finance Bill than was the case in previous years.  The whole position is being reduced to the level of a not very funny farce.  If the Dáil is not to be reduced to even greater irrelevancy we must review the manner in which we conduct our business, especially in regard to the Finance Bill.  We accept that the Finance Bill is complex, but one must ask &mdash; I would like the Minister to deal with this &mdash; why it takes so long for the Department of Finance to draft the Bill.  I understand that in Westminster the Finance Bill is published simultaneously with the budget.  If we cannot achieve simultaneous publication why can we not move towards the objective of at least reducing the time lag between the budget and the publication of the Bill?  This would ensure that there is proper time for full consideration of an important Bill.</P>
    <P>The period between budget day and publication of the Finance Bill has become a password for negotiations between the Minister for Finance of the day and powerful vested interests in the economy.  There has been an accelerating trend in recent years which has seen the budget reduce to a mere bargaining counter between the Minister and his advisers on the one hand and powerful lobbyists and their expensive specialist advisers on the other.</P>
    <P>Whatever we may think of the Finance Bill, 1992, it is only fair to record that on this occasion the provisions of the Bill more or less faithfully reflect budget day announcements.  However, there are some exceptions and I will deal with them later.  On the substantive changes the Minister has appeared to resist the high paid lobbyists, and I unequivocally welcome that.  Unlike other Opposition speakers I welcome the apparent arresting of the trend because significant concessions by successive Ministers for Finance to powerful lobby groups are fundamentally anti-democratic and are to be deplored for a number of reasons. These concessions were invariably to the powerful and the wealthy who could command political or commercial clout and could afford the best professional advice. Concessions were never given to the <Col N="2058" /> weak, the marginalised and those in the poverty trap.  Whatever they were promised on budget day was what they got. For the weak and poor in society writ on budget day was immutable, but for those who had the money to retain expensive advice in the past they used the hiatus between budget day and publication of the Finance Bill to negotiate substantial concessions from the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>The effect of the concessions has almost always been to perpetrate some inequity in fiscal policy, which meant the unfair sharing of the tax burden.  It is an abdication of responsibility by Government to effectively hand over the framing of fiscal policy to powerful vested interests who have no obligation to the public good but who may have made hefty financial contributions to party political coffers at election time.</P>
    <P>Last year's Finance Bill was a very good example of this.  On budget day the then Minister for Finance criticised the extent of abuse of certain tax reliefs. Most trenchantly, he criticised the operation of the business expansion scheme, but by budget day he was forced to back off and substantially water down his announced intentions.  In this debate so far the same old arguments have been revised about the curtailment of the operation of the business expansion scheme. It is instructive to examine again the criticism of the operation of the scheme by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, when he said on budget day, 30 January 1991 in referring to the business expansion scheme: &ldquo;It is estimated to have cost around £40 million in tax foregone by the Exchequer in the 1989-90 tax year and it will cost a similar amount in the present tax year if action is not taken&rdquo;.  The then Minister for Finance quite correctly concluded that the BES as it was then operating was creating an unacceptable tax shelter.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of the Committee of Public Accounts are aware, from examining the relevant accounting officers on the special audit of the BES carried out by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, that it was admitted that it was difficult <Col N="2059" /> to precisely measure the loss to the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone but that the figure was likely to be not less than £100 million.  It is wrong and misleading for Deputies to go on pretending that there is no real loss to the Exchequer because the investment would never have taken place were it not for the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that real tax is foregone in this instance &mdash; this is income on which, because of the business expansion scheme, they do not pay tax which they would otherwise be required to pay, and there is a real loss to the Exchequer. It is disingenuous for some Opposition Deputies to come here and argue that if the BES were not there, the investment would not have taken place and the Exchequer would not be losing out.  That is not a proper understanding of the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>Those of us who believe in real tax reform realise that that means broadening the tax base and we cannot come in here and oppose new measures which are designed &mdash; however inadequately &mdash; to achieve that effect.  Many of these reliefs and tax shelters blatantly benefit the rich, the powerful, the better off, and penalise those who work for a wage.  They often act as incentives not to promote economic activity or generate wealth but to facilitate easy profits for the kind of sedentary activities deplored by Deputy Noonan last night.</P>
    <P>While I have some major criticisms of this Finance Bill and the economic policy complacency it reflects, I cannot agree with other Opposition spokespersons who have engaged with varying emphasis in special pleading in opposing the provisions designed to abolish or restrict tax reliefs and incentives.  Those of us who have consistently rejected the Progressive Democrats' policy for tax reductions and who have argued for tax reform since before the Progressive Democrats were a twinkle in the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. O'Malley's eye, ought to welcome progress towards genuine tax reform when it happens. I am not saying that the burden of <Col N="2060" /> taxation has been shifted off the shoulders of the PAYE sector in this Finance Bill, because that has not happened to any appreciable extent, but there are measures in this Bill designed to broaden the tax base.  One cannot have genuine tax reform without broadening the tax base.  It is wrong, therefore, to indulge in special pleadings for various interest groups who must invariably be impacted upon if the reform measures are genuine.</P>
    <P>Since budget day we have been treated to the customary high profile denuciations of some of the measures proposed. The louder some of these interest groups squeal, the more hopeful I am that at last we are making some real progress towards tax equity.  Even the most partisan financial commentators, not to mention business itself, acknowledge that over the years a plethora of so-called incentives, tax reliefs and tax avoidance schemes have grown up to enable profits to be sheltered from the taxman.  As long ago as the report of the Commission on Taxation, it was recommended that the broadening of the tax base be brought about through the treatment of all forms of wealth, capital gains and income as equally taxable.  The commitment to real tax reform of those who would now oppose the modest steps taken in this Bill must be suspect.</P>
    <P>The steps taken in the Bill to reform tax are essentially modest, but I welcome them nonetheless.  Anybody who purports to have argued in the past for the cause of the PAYE sector and the disproportionate burden of tax they bear or who have argued the cause of the trade union movement should now welcome these modest steps forward as the genuine beginning of tax reforms.  Real tax reforms is a question of distribution. Ideally you must broaden the tax base and reduce the burden on those tax compliant citizens who are predominantly but not exclusively in the PAYE sector who have borne such an unequal burden for so long.</P>
    <P>Those on PAYE have received only minimal relief in this Bill and then such relief as is being given is going disproportionately to higher earners.  For <Col N="2061" /> instance, the income tax changes will mean an extra £2,600 per annum for a married couple, with two children, earning £75,000 &mdash; and you, a Leas Cheann Comhairle and I know a small number of privileged people earning that amount and more who would seek to use methods outside this House to improve their annual earnings &mdash; but a married couple with two children, earning £10,000 per annum will receive a net gain of £100 per annum.  That is unequal and unfair.</P>
    <P>My colleague Deputy Byrne has pointed out that this Bill represents another instalment in the Government's assault on the insurance based social welfare system.  The recent Social Welfare Bill reduced the value of many benefits and restricted access for many claimants and now, with this Finance Bill, both unemployment and disability benefits will be subject to taxation.  Some people will ask why not?  While unemployment and disability benefits are threatened with a tax net, the same Bill provides for the opening up for the first time of special savings accounts.  These special savings accounts are designed for the filthy rich to facilitate the return of hot money from abroad and will be subject only to 10 per cent tax on interest earned and sheltered from scrutiny thereafter.  In effect this is another amnesty for the tax cheats. However, if the genuine small saver has a few bob in a bank or building society, the interest earned remains liable for deposit interest retention tax at the rate of the taxpayer's final liability for income tax on interest earned.  In other words, the couple who can afford to exploit fully the innovation in these so-called special saving accounts and can utilise it to the full by investing £100,000 will have a tax liability of 10 per cent on the interest earned.  No questions will be asked concerning the origins of the money and whether it attracted the normal rate of tax at the stage it was being accumulated, but one's life savings, on which full income tax was paid at the time the money was earned, in a bank or building society will remain liable for DIRT at 27 per cent.  This is, I submit, a disgraceful inequity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2062" /> On the question of income tax and tax reform I agree with the approach set out by the Minister for Finance in his introductory speech:</P>
    <P>It was never expected and never intended by the advocates of tax reform that widening the tax base and reducing tax rates would produce a lower tax bill for everyone.  On the contrary: it was always inherent in this strategy that there would be trade-offs between, on the one hand, improvements in the mainstream income tax regime and, on the other, curtailment of reliefs which benefit limited groups or sectors.  This was common ground among the proponents of tax reform, and was explicitly stated by, for example, the Commission on Taxation. As the Commission said in its first report: &ldquo;tax reform is a collection of measures, each of which affects some individuals adversely and others favourably.  Those who will not benefit are those who are over favourably treated under the existing system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If that is a genuine statement of the policy approach which the Minister for Finance intends to pursue, and I hope at a more accelerated rate in the next budget, it sums up the attitude of my party to tax reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct not only in quoting the Commission on Taxation, but he could quote the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The thrust of the campaign which brought 750,000 people onto the streets for tax reform was not to diminish everybody's tax liability but to bring equity into the system, to broaden the tax base, to get those who had wealth and capacity to pay their fair share; it was not to run down the public services or to limit the money available for spending on education and health.  That is something I have not heard articulated by an Opposition spokesperson so far in this debate.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I am not convinced that the Minister has embarked on the first step of a coherent and consistent plan of reform.  The special arrangement to which I have referred for hot money and <Col N="2063" /> big time savers betrays the old vulnerability to powerful vested interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister portrays a schizophrenic approach in seeking to marry the irreconcilables of genuine tax reform and the Progressive Democrats petulant demands for tax reductions for a privileged constituency.  The Progressive Democrats neurosis for twin tax rates of 25 per cent and 40 per cent have either infected the Minister or he feels compelled to nod in their direction.  The Minister should relax in the conviction that the public are no longer fooled by the simple equation that lower tax rates necessarily mean lower taxes.  People whose incomes mean that in equity, they should not be in the tax net or people who have been paying a grossly disproportionate share of their income in tax, are not so much interested in the tax rates as in the amount of tax they pay, how early they enter the tax net, how much of their income is subject to the standard rate of tax and at what point in their earnings do they become liable to the marginal rate?  It is absurd that a single adult becomes liable to income tax after earning just over £70 per week.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence I can find either inside or outside the country to support the Progressive Democrats notion that, if we implement the two-tier tax structure at either 25 per cent and 44 per cent or 25 per cent and 40 per cent, jobs would automatically follow.  Where is the evidence that job prospects will be enhanced?  It did not happen in Thatcher's Britain, it is not happening in John Major's Britain and following a pattern of regular tax rates reductions in Ireland over the past three years, it has not happened here.  In fact, the situation has got progressively worse.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, has made a start in beginning to treat all income the same for tax purposes. If he can be seen in the next budget to continue in that direction, it will be a significant boost to morale of the PAYE sector and other tax compliant citizens. Most PAYE workers recognise the necessity for good quality public services <Col N="2064" /> and they are prepared to pay for these services with their taxes provided they can be assured the burden is being shared in accordance with capacity to pay.  The Progressive Democrats formula will mean substantial savings for higher earners and the continued rundown of our public services.  I reject the jobs argument advanced by the Progressive Democrats as spurious and I argue that our economic well being will, instead, be determined by the competitive strength of the traded sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Clearly the manufacturing sector is the most important focus in the traded sector.  We should not be misled by growth figures and industrial output which derive largely from the enclave of foreign owned companies.  In Single Market conditions our competitive capacity will be tested and found wanting in many areas: one such critical factor, for example, remains the quality of our training for those in employment.  The attitude of many industrialists towards training, and the extent of investment in training, are inadequate.  An environment conditioned by the current focus of FÁS and dependent on grants and handouts will not enable us to meet Single Market conditions or create a genuinely competitive economy.'</P>
    <P>I do not think the debate on the Finance Bill should be permitted to glance over the significance of the Minister's commitment to introduce another Finance Bill in autumn or later in the year. It may seem that this is required only for reasons preparatory to the Single Market conditions; however, the deathly depressing unemployment figures which appear inexorably to be heading for 300,000 by the end of this year suggest that a mini budget may well be necessary.</P>
    <P>In addition I would draw the attention of the House to the Minister's casual remark where he assured Deputies that he is equally committed to maintaining discipline this year and will not be found wanting should the need arise.  This is a reference to what the Minister called the corrective action that he so decisively took last year.  I am afraid, and especially in post-Maastricht conditions, that that <Col N="2065" /> has an ominous ring to it.  It would be folly for anybody to believe that a mini budget holds out anything but the prospect of further cuts for those least able to bear them, the weakest in our society.</P>
    <P>Having criticised earlier those who came in here and indulged in special pleading, and having praised the Minister beyond the wildest expectations of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, I should like to engage in some special pleading in a few limited areas.  However, it is not special pleading on behalf of the rich, powerful and vested interest groups in our society but I should like to refer to one of the changes the Minister made in respect of benefit-in-kind for people who have the use of company cars.</P>
    <P>Where a car has become the tool of the trade for so many people, a necessary tool for presenting themselves at work not to mention commercial travellers and sales person who have to rely on the car, the concessions the Minister advanced are sufficient.  The tapering off relief concept which he has adopted does not have due regard to the imposition that this will be on a commercial traveller who is making his or her living using the car. The Minister should have made some effort to draw a distinction between the company car as a perk and the company car as a tool of the trade.  For the highly paid executive who drives into Mount Merrion and parks the car in a specially provided car park, and then drives home in the evening, the Minister's measures are fair enough but for somebody who chalks up inordinate mileage at considerable risk to themselves and who depends on the car to make a living, the tapering relief is inadequate.  I should like the Minister to consider examining that issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, if it is feasible, to draft an amendment that would take account of people who depend on the car for their livelihood.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea apparently thinks that is not possible.  I should have thought he had sufficient to occupy him in his own Department to leave the Finance area to those of us who are dealing with it.  Let him concentrate on the referendum and <Col N="2066" /> we will see if we can come up with something on company cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome the change introduced by the Minister in respect of profit-sharing schemes.  I attacked this on budget night when we discussed the Financial Resolutions because I thought the original idea behind the concept of profit sharing schemes in terms of improving competitiveness, of enhancing industrial relations and so on, in companies was basically a good one and I think the proposed abolition was the wrong step for the Minister to take.  The Minister has now reduced the annual value of any shares per employee to £2,000.  That has got the balance about right because, notwithstanding the strong protestations made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for example, to have this result achieved &mdash; and they probably would admit that the Ministers concession goes some considerable way towards meeting their complaints &mdash; the facts are that for whatever reason the schemes have not exactly been an unqualified success.  That is really why I support the £2,000 rather than the £5,000 ceiling.</P>
      <P>These schemes were used by those for whom they were never intended, and those for whom they were intended, i.e., the average worker, took them up only to a very limited extent.  I would not like to see the incentive removed; hopefully the take-up might be better in the future. However, I shed no tears because the higher ceiling has been removed and the fact that higher paid executives, who contrive to minimise their tax liability will no longer have access to this at the same rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to a different question of shares.  Section 14 deals with the income tax relief on interest on loans to acquire shares in a quoted company.  I welcome the Minister's decision in this regard. This relief was unfair, inequitable, exploited and abused.  The general anti-avoidance <Col N="2067" /> provision in this section in terms of the relief on interest on loans for the purchase of shares would seem to be in keeping with the overall thrust I mentioned earlier of clamping down on this type of tax shelter.  Yesterday the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Quoted companies have access to the stock market for capital and should not need the assistance provided by this relief in raising it.  In addition, quoted shares in general are valuable, tradeable assets and it is difficult to justify to ordinary taxpayers why they should provide a subsidy for their acquisition.  This is especially so, when, as the House is aware, interest relief for most people is confined to mortgage interest and is significantly restricted even for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more heartily.  That exactly is the view of ordinary taxpayers who strive to meet their tax liability.  This kind of subsidy, which is what it was, is not justifiable.  Indeed, the whole business of share options that people only come to exercise in the event of it being very profitable years hence was unquestionably a boon for those on the inside track and those with the money to avail of such perks.</P>
    <P>I welcome too the further restriction on section 84 loans.  I am very dubious about the traditional use of many of the section 84 loans.  The idea might have been that the advantage was passed on to the borrowing company by the banks thereby making capital available at a cheaper rate than would normally be the case, however, my view is that that kind of subsidy is not desirable in the context of industrial policy generally, and the recent Culliton report broadly supports that position.  I think the banks used it expertly to minimise their own tax liability. The further restriction here is welcome.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rate of tax chargeable on pension refunds is harsh.  I do not think it is comparable with the other areas in which I have referred where the Minister has engaged in restictions or <Col N="2068" /> abolitions.  The increase in the rate of tax chargeable from 10 per cent to 25 per cent for pension refunds is harsh.  The Minister will argue that tax was not paid at the time but, what we are talking about here is an employee who has been paying into a pension scheme for all his or her working life, and that payment would be matched by the employer.  However, the employee leaves that employment, he is entitled to a refund of his own contributions. There is a major inequity here and we are away behind the practice in some of the more advanced European countries where a portion, if not all, of the employers' contribution is also provided for.  In the absence of portability in many of the schemes, the Minister's action is especially harsh and in the absence of the ability to transfer from one scheme to another it is particularly severe.  There is no set of circumstances I know of where one can reinstate oneself in the position one was in by merely using a refund of one's contributions and seeking to purchase a new pension plan. The total refund would only purchase a fraction of the benefits one had under the orginal scheme.  For many workers in present day conditions who find themselves unemployed for reasons not of their own making, or indeed even where people leave employment, this will be a barrier and a further penalty which is unfair.  The Minister should look at this again.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new pensions Bill, when the measures promised mature, if they ever do, there will be provision for indexation for the future which is a very valuable consideration but until this happens this is a rather mean-spirited decision to gain a small amount of revenue.</P>
    <P>As a Minister from the Limerick area is in the House I feel I should make some reference to the following matter.  I do not know which section of the Department is responsible but I wish to refer to export sales relief and the Shannon arrangement.  I am glad the Minister has held his ground on this issue.  At what stage do we concede to the bullying we saw in this case?  The innocents abroad, <Col N="2069" /> when they saw a report in their Sunday papers three or four weeks ago, may have believed it was accidental.  There was a prominent report in every newspaper which referred to a particular gentleman who had to go into tax exile because of the harsh measures threatened by the Minister in the budget.</P>
    <P>I do not know, when the rest of us have to pay tax on every pound we earn and having regard to the inordinate benefits that gentleman and his company received over the years, whether we should kowtow to that kind of economic blackmail. I do not think we should nor do I think that the innocents abroad are aware that every reputable financial journalist in Dublin was rounded up, flown to Shannon and given the treatment before this appeared in the Sunday newspapers.  The average punter who pays tax probably thinks it was a matter of such moment that all these journalists were moved on the same day to write the same report, but that is not the way it happened.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has held his ground because I do not think someone like me can argue that the tax base should be broadened, on the one hand, and, when something like this is done, oppose that kind of measure.  I do not believe I can do that.  I welcome what has taken place and do not think it will damage the Shannon enterprise.</P>
    <P>As one would expect Deputy Noonan, having regard to the fact it is in his own back yard, made a trenchant defence last night of the <i>status quo.</i> He pointed to the job target of 1,500 which are in the process of being created at present, which are badly needed and which will be much welcomed.  He went on to say that the sky was the limit, that if we could continue as we were we would create 10,000 jobs in the same enterprise.</P>
    <P>We should take a look at poor beseiged Aer Lingus who, without any of these concessions, created more jobs in the TEAM project than this gentleman created in this enterprise in Shannon, that is without taking into account the position on the Naas Road at both Airmotive and Pratt and Whitney.  I do not know what the number is as I have not <Col N="2070" /> checked it but close to 1,000 jobs have been created in the TEAM project and between 600 and 700 jobs at Airmotive and I am aware that the plant I visited. Pratt and Whitney, which is a joint venture, is at the leading edge of technology in this area.  It is hoped to employ 300 or more there.  This amounts to an outstanding contribution by Aer Lingus without the benefit of the extraordinary tax shelters made available at Shannon.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 26 April, the financial editor, Des Crowley, commented as follows:</P>
    <P>GPA Chief Tony Ryan has once again outmanoeuvred the tax authorities by getting future dividends paid in advance to the tune of over £23 million.  This is behind the payout announced to shareholders in a recent GPA document.</P>
    <P>As pointed out previously in these columns, as a result of going public, Ryan was threatened with a reduction in his tax-free dividend, which is around double that of ordinary shareholders. In addition, Bertie Ahern announced that he was going to start taxing these Shannon tax-free dividends.</P>
    <P>To head off both eventualities, Tony Ryan has managed to get the company to pay three years' dividends (discounted) before the tax and public offering deadlines.</P>
    <P>To invite me to cry for Mr. Ryan and his enterprise at Shannon on the basis of that information is unfair as one is either going to argue that all wealth, capital gains and income should be taxed alike or not.  While I welcome the generation of that wealth at Shannon &mdash; neither I nor any other body is qualified to say how much of it is being reinvested in Ireland &mdash; I do not think we should structure our tax code in order to continue the tax shelter enjoyed there over the years.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that I cannot agree with the denunciation of the Finance Bill as anti-risk, anti-enterprise and anti-employment &mdash; these charges have been made in the House &mdash; by virtue of the fact that a Minister for Finance has finally <Col N="2071" /> taken some modest steps to close off this plethora of incentives, tax avoidance schemes and tax shelters which have formed part of the tax code for so long and which have enabled those with commercial clout to employ expert tax advice and other professional expertise to minimise their tax liability while the rest of us have to pay for the maintenance of public services.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister did not go further because if he had done so this would have been in perfect keeping with the report of the Culliton review team which looked at this matter in the context of industrial policy and job creation.  They argued in favour of refocusing the money we are spending under industrial policy and came out against many of these tax shelters, hidden subsidies, relief and various schemes.  The Government seem to have taken the broad thrust of that report on board as have the Opposition parties. When this happens it should be welcomed for what it is.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 18 which deals with the question of restrictive covenants. It is interesting to note the difficulties these covenants caused in the case of Greencore.  Even when they are perfectly legally deployed there is the inequity which is referred to and I am happy they are gone.</P>
    <P>The major defect in the budget, from the point of view of people who look to it &mdash; and all the hype surrounding it &mdash; with an expectation of some improvement in their own conditions, is the failure of any specific measures to stimulate employment.  I do not know how any Government, in the face of the endemic unemployment crisis, can continue to argue that if only we get the climate right jobs will come.  That theory has been tested but jobs have not come.  The Progressive Democrats, admittedly, are more vocal in arguing that all you have to do is to get the tax rates right and jobs will be created.  As I pointed out, that did not happen in Thatcher's Britain and it is not happening in John Major's Britain. After three years of a pattern of reductions in the tax rates here, the situation <Col N="2072" /> is getting worse, in fact we are climbing inexorably &mdash; not to the figure of 282,000 people which the Minister mentioned in his speech &mdash; but to the figure of 300,000 people unemployed, which is a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>To continue to argue that this problem is due to the recession in the United Kingdom and the United States is an excuse rather than an explanation or a policy to tackle it.  There seems to be a complacency engendered by orthodox economists &mdash; who have been wrong so many times before &mdash; that, if we wait until the end of the decade, the young people coming on to the labour force will have greatly diminished, the population bulge, demogaphically speaking, will have diminished, and in the interim the recession will have lifted in Britain and the United States, making it possible for us to get rid of some of our surplus labour.  That seems to be the hope and I do not believe that a Government of any hue can provide for 300,000 people unemployed and for the total number of social welfare recipients for whom we must provide in this small economy and, at the same time, make any improvements in or even maintain the level of public services.</P>
    <P>How could any Minister bring in a satisfactory budget if almost 300,000 people are unemployed and one million people are living at or below the poverty line, dependent on social welfare of one kind or another?  Given our present demographic structure, the number of old people and the number of young people at school and our limited workage population in between, 300,000 unemployed makes balancing the books virtually impossible.  We must balance the books because, as has been said &mdash; and the matter will be debated at greater length next week &mdash; little or no reference has been made by any Government spokesperson to the fiscal regime which we will have to implement here next year. The disciplines imposed by the Maastricht Treaty will inevitably mean further cutbacks in public spending.  Already the Exchequer borrowing requirement has risen for the first time since the mid-eighties <Col N="2073" /> but that situation will not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The budget was an opportunity for the Government to introduce some innovative measures to put some of our people back to work so that they could contribute their share of taxation.  It has not happened, which I greatly regret.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on one of the biggest Finance Bills ever to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Finance has an unenviable task ahead of him in trying to bring in two Finance Bills this year in order to incorporate the obligations which are thrust upon him and us as a result of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Minister on Second Stage outlined his proposal to introduce a second Finance Bill in the autumn as a result of the various decisions which will be made by Heads of Government and Ministers at future Heads of Government meetings. It is important to outline some of the history on which the current Finance Bill is based and to look at the economic prospects for this year which would have shaped the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international economic outlook for 1992 remains somewhat uncertain. Last December the OECD and the EC Commission forecast a slow and modest international recovery with growth picking up to 2 per cent or more from about 1 per cent last year.  Developments so far this year in the major economies &mdash; the US, Germany, the UK and Japan &mdash; suggest that international economic recovery may be somewhat slower and more modest than earlier envisaged.  Most economic commentators now agree that perhaps the forecasts in December was a little wide of the mark and too ambitious. Information on how the economy is performing so far this year domestically is still scarce but there are some hopeful signs.  Exports turned in another strong performance in January and the same applies to industrial output.  The seasonally adjusted trade surplus was one of the best on record.  Consumer spending and building investment indicators for <Col N="2074" /> the recent few months show some tentative signs of a modest improvement.</P>
    <P>While we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent about inflation, which rose to 3.7 per cent in the year to February last, it is some consolation to note that it is still one of the lowest levels in the EC and that wholesale price increases have been somewhat more modest over this period, at approximately 3 per cent.  Tax returns and employment levy receipts for the first quarter of 1992 point to employment holding up reasonably well; PAYE receipts for the first quarter were almost 10 per cent ahead of the first quarter for 1991; training and employment levy receipts up to early April were over 10 per cent ahead of the same period last year.  Both these figures suggest that the continuing rise in unemployment reflect a growing labour force rather than falling employment.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned the obligations and disciplines which the Maastricht Treaty will place on us.  The Government are fortunate in so far as the corrective measures taken since 1987 make their job and that of the Minister for Finance somewhat easier.  The year 1991 saw further general improvement in real incomes but weaker confidence internationally and continuing high interest rates, although much of this translated into higher savings rather than higher spending.  The knock-on effect is that VAT receipts were somewhat constrained by the fact that the public thought it better to save than spend. Despite all the difficulties we faced, employment in large industrial establishments in the first three quarters of 1991 was up by over 1,000 on average compared with the corresponding period the previous year.  While we are doing relatively well in regard to employment creation, one of the major problems we will have to face is that of unemployment. The Government have put unemployment at the top of their agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate last night I was referring to the dramatic reduction in the institutionalised population and the move to community treatment.  We should not take it that mental illness will be eliminated when we close large institutions. Mental illness will remain with us but, because of the immense progress made in the therapeutic area, a substantial number of cases can be treated in the community.  That brings its own problems.  A substantially increased investment in psychiatric community nursing care is of vital importance.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the degree of concern among responsible organisations and individuals about the discharge of numbers of long-stay institutionalised patients.  It is true that many of those patients have made remarkable progress.  Many of them are extremely happy in the community or living with relatives, but there are signs that a number of them, especially those in our cities, live in unsatisfactory accommodation and have a level of security well short of the required standard.  In preparing new proposals supervision and the standard of care for discharged patients are of vital importance.</P>
      <P>There must be increased resources to provide for a massive expansion in community psychiatric care services.  At present the general level of that community care is restricted to a five-day week.  Mental illness cannot generally be controlled or treated on the basis of a five-day week nursing structure.  I appeal to the Minister to keep that in mind when drafting the new proposals, which will take our services for the mentally ill into the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made by Deputy Fennell in calling for an appeal board will, in accordance with the programme set out last night by the Minister, remain valid <Col N="2076" /> for some time because it is predicted that involuntary admissions will remain a feature of our service.  While that is the case we need to ensure that every psychiatric patient has recourse to an independent body if he or she feels the detention is unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the consensus expressed here last night about the need for new mental treatment legislation and a review generally of our mental health services.  I join with the Minister for Health in welcoming this opportunity to debate the issues which must be addressed in new legislation.  I commend Deputy Fennell for her interest in the welfare of the mentally ill.  I respect her wish to provide greater legal safeguards for mentally ill patients in psychiatric hospitals.  Unfortunately, the Government cannot accept this Bill as drafted because it does not deal in a comprehensive way with mental treatment issues and because some of its provisions are outdated.</P>
      <P>New legislation should provide comprehensive safeguards for detained patients which reflect our society's concern for the welfare of the mentally ill. A mental treatment Act must conform with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and accord with the United Nations principles on the care of the mentally ill.  It should also provide a firm foundation for the development of psychiatric services into the next century. Deputy Fennell's Bill, I am afraid, falls short of the comprehensive safeguards we would all wish to see for the mentally ill.  The provisions would not conform with our international obligations under the European Convention nor implement the recommendations of the UN principles. It does not provide a new legal framework for the management of the psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Deputy's objective may not be a comprehensive overhaul of the legislation in this area and that she is primarily concerned with remedying the most obvious and serious <Col N="2077" /> defects as she sees them.  I can sympathise with this view but there are so many strands to this whole complex matter that it is extremely difficult to look at one or two specific aspects of it without considering the matter in the whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell's Bill deals with just four issues in relation to the detention of persons in psychiatric hospitals.  These are: the number of doctors signatures on a detention order, review of detention orders, information to be given to patients on being detained and the right of detained patients to take civil proceedings against any person involved in their detention care under the 1945 Act. I would like to examine the provisions of this Bill under each of those headings to explain why it cannot be accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>First I shall take the number of doctors' signatures required on an order.  Section 3 provides that two registered medical practitioners shall sign every reception order detaining a person in a psychiatric hospital.  The explanatory memorandum to the Act says that the purpose of this section is to remove the disparity of treatment as between public and private patients in detention procedures.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether Deputy Fennell is confusing the different stages in the procedure for detaining a mentally ill patient.  The first stage is the application by a relative or interested person to the medical officer of a psychiatric hospital to have a person detained.  The second stage is the recommendation by one or two medical practitioners, who are usually general practitioners, that the person should or should not be admitted.  The number of doctors who must give a recommendation depends on whether the patient is a public or private patient. The third stage is the decision by the medical officer of the psychiatric hospital to detain the patient.  All these stages must be completed before a person can be detained under existing law.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Fennell's Bill is proposing is that the distinction between public and private patients at the second stage of medical recommendation would remain but that two doctors would be <Col N="2078" /> involved in signing the detention or reception order at stage three.  Most public concern has been expressed not about the number of doctors who sign the detention order but about the number of doctors who should recommend that a person be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>The next item I wish to refer to is the review of detention orders.  The issue of safeguards for detained patients has, however, moved much further than the number of doctors who recommend detention or sign the orders.  It is no longer acceptable that the decision to detain is an exclusively medical one.  In most European countries, the decision to detain a person in a psychiatric hospital is either a function of the courts or each medical decision is subject to review by an independent administrative body.  The European Convention obliges that when a court is not involved in the decision to detain there should be review of each order by a judicial or review body.  This obligation has been elaborated in judgments of the European Court of Justice during the eighties, after the passing of the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981.  Any new mental treatment legislation will have to provide for a review of every detention order.  This review will provide an essential safeguard for all persons who are detained.  It will ensure that psychiatrists who sign detention orders are accountable for the decisions they take.  The experience of countries with review procedures is that very few decisions of psychiatrists to detain patients are overturned.  However, it is perhaps significant that the proportion of people who are detained is lower in these countries than in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell's Bill provides for the establishment of a mental health review board or boards.  The function of these boards would be to review the detention or conditional discharge of a patient if the patient makes an application to the board for such a review.  The board would also automatically review the detention of any person detained for more than two years.  The functions of the review board are the same as in the 1981 Act.  The main <Col N="2079" /> shortcoming with the functions of the review boards in Deputy Fennell's Bill is that, with the exception of those detained longer than two years, a board can only act on an application from the patient or other interested party.  For the reasons outlined, a review board with such a limited role would not meet this country's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Any future arrangements must provide for the review of every detention order, irrespective of whether the patient seeks a review.</P>
    <P>A second problem with the review boards proposed in Deputy Fennell's Bill is the grounds on which a board can order the discharge of detained patients.  The Bill provides that the board may direct the discharge of a patient if they are satisfied that detention and treatment in the hospital are no longer necessary in the interest of the person's health or safety or that, if released, the patient would not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to himself, hereself or to others.  I accept that the wording of Deputy Fennell's Bill is an advance on the 1981 Act but it still has major shortcomings.  Under this Bill the onus would be placed on the patient to prove that he or she no longer needs to be detained for treatmen and that if released, he or she would not act in a dangerous manner.  The onus should be on the person detaining the patient to say why there is good cause for detention. This major point needs considerable analysis before any final conclusions can be reached.</P>
    <P>I note, however, that Deputy Fennell does not specify any grounds in her Bill for a review board in reaching a decision in relation to a person who is conditionally discharged, and this is a major omission even allowing for the limited scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell's Bill has, with justification, not repeated the provision of the 1981 Act providing for an appeal against a decision of a review board to the Minister for Health.  Under the European Convention, a decision of a review board may not be overturned by an administrative <Col N="2080" /> or executive body.  However, Deputy Fennell does not provide any appeal in section 6 against a decision of a review board.  As with the review of the detention of a person detained longer than two years and of conditional discharge, there should be an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the review board.</P>
    <P>I would also question whether the idea of one review board per health board area is the most appropriate way to organise review of detention orders.  The 1981 Act envisaged more than one such board but perhaps we need to look afresh at this issue.  It is important that review procedures are consistent in every part of the country if they are to win the confidence of patients and practitioners. It would be extremely difficult for eight separate review boards to work in a consistent and coherent manner.  Deputy Fennell envisages that they would not even have a common secretariat but would rely on each health board for administrative support.  With eight different boards and secretariats, it might not be long before serious anomalies would emerge in the decisions of review boards.</P>
    <P>This is an important issue that should be addressed in terms of the efficient and acceptable organisation of review boards.  A national review board is probably sufficient if the personnel were drawn from the local board areas.</P>
    <P>Because of the need for consistency and the importance of being seen to be fair, it might be better to have a single review board with a small secretariat and a panel of people in each region who would carry out the work of the board. The regional panel would ensure speedy review and the single secretariat would facilitate a consistent approach to decisions at regional level.  The review provisions of this Bill are going in the right direction but they fall short of the comprehensive review procedures which are now necessary to reassure the public that no person is detained unnecessarily, and to bring out procedures into conformity with our international obligations. This is one of the reasons the Government cannot accept this Bill.  On <Col N="2081" /> information for detained patients I would now like to deal with section 9 of the Bill which repeats the provision of section 34 of the 1981 Act requiring the medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre to give a detained patient a copy of the detention order and to explain to the patient, both orally and in writing, his or her rights and entitlements under the Act.  The patient's right to information be safeguarded by legislation, but there may be more effective ways of ensuring that the patient is informed than by the provisions in this Bill.  Should it be the medical officer in charge of the hospital who is responsible for providing this information?  Is there a conflict of roles for the medical officer? On the one hand, he or she may be responsible for the decision to detain a person and, on the other, the same doctor is to be responsible in this Bill for informing the patient of his or her rights.  Will patients have confidence in such a system?</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands in the early eighties the difference between formulating the rights of psychiatric patients and the practical application of these rights was recognised. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, an independent foundation of patient advocates was created in 1981, with the support of the Dutch Government. The patient advocate's main task is to assist patients in safeguarding their legal rights, in finding solutions to patients' complaints, in giving advice about their legal position and, if necessary, by offering legal advice.  The work of the patient advocate is made possible through an agreement between each hospital and the national foundation. This agreement gives the patient advocate the right to visit all the wards and to talk to all patients who also have the right to contact the advocate.  In 1990 the national foundation employed 36 patients' advocates, working in 47 hospitals.  The work of the foundation is financed by the Dutch Government.  I am not proposing this as a framework for this country, but I mention it as an example of the way in which patients' rights can be protected and the different approaches <Col N="2082" /> one can adopt in seeking this worthy objective.</P>
    <P>There is a number of options for ensuring that patients are informed of their rights.  Another approach would be to involve voluntary bodies active on behalf of the mentally ill in this role.  A third option might be to make the health boards responsible for ensuring that patients are properly informed, with the proviso that no one who is directly involved in the procedure for detention should be assigned the task of informing patients of their rights.  Health boards could make use of a variety of means to ensure that patients were informed.  They might contract the responsibility to a voluntary body, appoint an information officer in the hospital or assign the responsibility to staff working in a separate service, such as community care.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with Deputy Fennell in the intention behind this section, it is too limited in scope and could give rise to conflicts of interest for medical staff.  On civil proceedings section 10 of Deputy Fennell's Bill repeals sections 259 and 260 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  Section 259 of the 1945 Act put a time limit of six months on any proceedings taken by a person who has been detained in a mental institution.  I am glad to say that this section is no longer on the Statute Book.  It was repealed by the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>Section 260 of the 1945 Act provides that a person who is or has been detained cannot bring civil proceedings against a person involved in his/her detention without the permission of the High Court. Subsection (4) of the section has been repealed by the 1954 Act to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>It is important to be clear to what section 260 refers.  It does not limit a person's right to seek an order of <i>habeas corpus</i> against his or her detention under common law or under Article 40.2.2 of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Section 260 applies to a situation where a patient who is or has been detained wishes to take proceedings against a person involved in <Col N="2083" /> his or her care under the 1945 Act.  Before a person can take such proceedings he or she must have the permission of the High Court.  The High Court must be satisfied that the person against whom the proceedings were taken acted in bad faith or without reasonable care.</P>
    <P>The intention behind the section was to protect staff involved in the case of psychiatric patients from civil suits in the courts which might arise from the mental instability of the patient.  I agree with Deputy Fennell that this issue needs to be looked at again in the light of modern standards of justice.  It is not a black and white issue.  However, it is perhaps instructive that mental treatment law in a number of jurisdictions has similar provision to that of section 260.</P>
    <P>There are a number of major issues relating to detained mentally ill persons which are not dealt with in this Bill.  I accept that the Deputy may feel that the specific issues she deals with are so urgent that they cannot or could not wait for overall legislation in this area.  Nevertheless, I feel that any Bill which will replace the 1945 Act must deal in a comprehensive way with all the important issues in the field of mental health.  This is another reason the Government cannot accept Deputy Fennell's Bill.  I would like to mention just a few more which include safeguards to protect the patient's right to consent to treatment.</P>
    <P>Under common law the administration of medical treatment to a person without his/her consent is unlawful unless the treatment is urgently necessary.  Consent may be given expressly or implied by conduct.  Valid consent implies that the person has been told about the nature and purpose of the treatment, is able to understand its nature and purpose and consent must be given without coercion or unreasonable influence.</P>
    <P>It has been widely assumed that if a person was involuntarily detained in a psychiatric hospital for treatment, he or she was not competent to decide whether he or she should be given treatment without consent.  That assumption has been challenged in a number of countries with <Col N="2084" /> the increasing recognition of the rights of detained patients.  Procedures will be required in new legislation to ensure that a detained patient gives express consent to medical treatment whenever possible or, if he/she cannot give consent or refuses to give consent, to define the conditions under which such treatment may be administered.</P>
    <P>Another issue which needs to be addressed in new mental legislation is the position of mentally ill offenders.  At present a judge has no power to remand an accused person to a psychiatric hospital for assessment or treatment; a judge cannot order that a convicted person be sent direct to a psychiatric institution for treatment.  The judge may only annex a recommendation for psychiatric treatment to a sentence of imprisonment. He or she may also suspend sentence if the convicted person seeks treatment on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric treatment is provided to prisoners by psychiatrists who visit the prisons on request or, where the illness is severe, by transfer to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum.  The advantage of this system to the health services is that a service is provided locally to the prisons with a specialist service in Dundrum with minimal demands on the psychiatric service. Unlike most European countries, prisoners are not admitted to the psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>These issues were addressed by the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons, better known as the Henchy Committee, after its chairman, Mr. Justice Henchy.  In their third interim report 1978, the committee commented that:</P>
    <P>many persons are dealt with by the Courts as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; offenders who are either not responsible (or not fully responsible) for the conduct charged against them or who, even if fully responsible for such conduct, are in need of psychiatric or other special treatments.  The inability or restricted ability, of the courts to order that convicted persons receive appropriate <Col N="2085" /> psychiatric treatment is a grave defect in the present state of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>The legal issues and service implications arising from any changes in existing law in relation to mentally ill offenders are complex and will require widespread consultation. The Green Paper will provide an opportunity for consultation and debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health spoke last night about the need to provide a new legal framework for the psychiatric services as they develop on the model recommended in &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.  The fundamental shift which has taken place in the delivery of psychiatric services from a service based on isolated institutions to one which is integrated with other health services and based mainly in the community must be underpinned by appropriate legislation. The Bill we are debating does not address this issue.</P>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, no longer provides a satisfactory legal basis for services designed to provide modern methods of care for the mentally ill.  It has been amended so frequently and so extensively that it is difficult to be exact about the legal responsibilities of health boards and resident medical superintendents. New legislation is needed to clarify the responsibilities of health boards in relation to mental health illness and to safeguard the rights of detained patients in our psychiatric hospitals.  The thrust of the Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill, 1992, is to safeguard the rights of detained patients.  As I have argued, however, the Bill does not provide adequate safeguards.  It does not refer at all to the management of the services. New legislation will need to be introduced to embrace the full range of issues reflecting the recent transformation in the delivery of our psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Connell, Minister for Health announced last night that the Government were examining a Green Paper on the development of services for the mentally ill and new mental treatment legislation.  The purpose of the Green Paper is to review progress in <Col N="2086" /> relation to the implementation of &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; and to propose options for legislation for the psychiatric services which will promote a psychiatric service of a high quality and protect the rights of psychiatric patients.  Publication of the Green Paper will allow interested parties to engage in full and open discussion on options put forward to adequately protect the rights of detained persons and measures designed to develop the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to avoid a repetition of the unhappy experience of the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981.  They are conscious of the need to achieve a consensus on the measures needed to safeguard the rights of detained patients and the framework for future development of the psychiatric services.  In relation to the former it is important to ensure that proposed legislation will fully comply with this country's obligations under the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>While the provisions of Deputy Fennell's Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill, 1992, are an improvement in the rights of detained patients, they are too narrow in scope and would not satisfy this country's obligations under international law.  It would be very inappropriate for us to consider the introduction of amending legislation which does not meet our obligations in this respect.  I regret that for these reasons the Government cannot accept this Bill.</P>
    <P>Instead I recommend to the House that it support the approach outlined by the Minister last night &mdash; that the Government propose to publish the Green Paper on mental health to initiate wide ranging debate and consultation on the issues involved in new mental treatment legislation. Following this consultation, the Government will announce their decisions in relation to new legislation prior to publishing a new mental treatment Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity <Col N="2087" /> to comment on the remarkable changes which have taken place and are taking place in our psychiatric hospitals, changes which demand a new legal framework. Perhaps the most dramatic advance in the treatment of mental illness was the introduction in the fifties of prescribing drugs to sufferers of mental illness. This drug therapy provided psychiatrists with the resources to treat some of the most profound psychiatric conditions.  This landmark development made it possible to reduce isolation as a method of treating psychiatric patients who might be a danger to themselves or to others.</P>
    <P>These advances, particularly in European countries, provoked many to question whether large impersonal custodial regimes with a lack of privacy and a lack of social and intellectual stimuli were the most appropriate or satisfactory form of care for mentally ill patients.  In 1953 the World Health Organisation envisaged the custodial role of the mental hospital changing and acting as a base for psychiatric services to a defined geographic area.  The progressive developments in psychiatric medicine paved the way for patients who were formerly long term patients in psychiatric hospitals to be discharged from hospitals and led to a growing acceptance of the concept of community care for the mentally ill.  The fundamental principles of comprehensive community mental health are now widely accepted internationally.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the driving force behind the significant and systematic shift from an institutional form of care for the mentally ill to community-oriented care has been the study group on the development of the psychiatric service who published their findings in the report Planning for the Future in 1984.  Their terms of reference were to examine the main components both institutional and community of the psychiatric services, to assess the existing services, to clarify their objectives and draw up planning guidelines for future development of the service with due regard to cost implications, to carry out such studies and to take part <Col N="2088" /> in such consultations as were necessary to assist this examination.</P>
    <P>The study group found that the psychiatric hospital was the focal point of the psychiatric service in most parts of the country, that large numbers of patients resided permanently in these hospitals and that many of them had lived there for years in conditions which were less than adequate because of overcrowding and capital under-funding.  In addition, the study group noted that staff and public attitudes had tended to concentrate effort on hospital care, as a result of which community facilities were relatively under-developed.  The study group also formed the view that hospitals were designed to isolate the mentally ill from society and that this isolation still persisted.  I wish to commend Deputy Fennell for bringing this Bill before the House.  It has enabled us to have a good discussion and debate on the issues concerned. It comes at a time when the Green Paper on this issue is with the Government.  I hope that arising out of all these debates and discussions that those of us in this House, including myself, who have had an interest in this matter will see real and lasting progress made, which I think is sought by all members of the House.</P>

      <P>I join with the Minister of State in commending Deputy Nuala Fennell for introducing this Bill and raising awarness and consciousness over the past year of how certain people have been victims of inappropriate detention in mental hospitals.  In her introduction to the Bill Deputy Fennell documented many heartbreaking cases which I believe appalled all of us.  If this continued, patients, particularly women, who have been treated like this would feel extraordinarily vulnerable.  I apologise for not starting my contribution by asking the permission of the House to share my time with Deputy John Browne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was because of such heart breaking cases that Deputy Fennell felt there was not only a real need for this Bill but a real urgency about it.  Therefore, while the Minister of State naturally made a case for not accepting Deputy Fennell's Bill, I think all of us would agree that this Bill could stand in its own right.  The Minister said that the Bill is not broad enough and does not meet all the international standards, but if the Bill is given a Second Reading we can work on the areas referred to by the Minister on Committee Stage.  This would enable us to strengthen the Bill.  We could even consider setting up a special committee to deal with any complex matters in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is appalling to think of the way in which these services have been allowed to be downgraded.  As both the Minister of State and Deputy Fennell said, we are not in accord with international standards in this area or the Human Rights Declaration of the United Nations, an organisation of which we are proud to be a member.  We make a very serious and generous contribution to the UN peacekeeping operations, but we need to study the UN conventions, the Declaration on Human Rights and the rights of women and children to ensure that not only do we have a high profile in terms of our peace-keeping activities, which we all fully support but that we can also stand proudly at the UN, and in Europe and say that we have introduced legislation which does not deserve any criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister rightly said, this area has not been reviewed or amended for many years.  Deputy Fennell pointed out that the objective of her Bill was to amend the 1945 Mental Treatment Act. Great strides have been made in medical procedures and particularly in the fields of psychology and psychiatry.  Thankfully we no longer treat those who were termed &ldquo;mad people&rdquo; as other than human beings who are suffering a deterioration of mental and emotional faculties and, therefore, need treatment. Certainly, they should not be segregated or stigmatised for the rest of their lives. I would like to think that the changes <Col N="2090" /> made in these areas will be taken into consideration in the preparation of a Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell pointed out the loopholes in the very real injustices against people in this isolated and vulnerable position.  The objective of her Bill is to provide greater safeguards against inappropriate detention in mental hospitals. Nobody could have believed that that type of enforced incarceration and total denial of a voice and of justice to a citizen could have taken place.  Deputy Fennell has been raising this matter for many years.  Yesterday she outlined a very dramatic and heartrending case.  It shocked all of us that in 1991 what seemed to be a Dickensian case arose where a woman was not alone denied protection within her family home but was wrongly placed in detention.  In such a case it is impossible to prove that you are sane and that you have been wrongly detained.  That is why we must be very careful and responsible in this area.  Not only are these people vulnerable but they are powerless once they are admitted to a mental hospital.  It is almost a catch 22 situation because to insist that one has been unjustly and wrongly detained sometimes seems to add to the diagnosis of insanity. That is something we must guard against resolutely.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that mental patients have the same rights as the rest of us. They must have full access to commital documents relating to them.  Due to the precarious position in which they find themselves we must positively discriminate in favour of these people who are denied the opportunity of making a case for themselves and who, if they were not detained and cloistered would be accepted as responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell highlighted something we all find unacceptable.  The last thing we should allow here is a two-tier health service with a difference between private and public treatment.  An urgent review is needed is this area.  Those who read this Bill I am sure will support the thrust of it.  It provides protection and support for the people concerned.  It would amount to civil rights for patients if the time bar of six months during which legal <Col N="2091" /> proceedings may be instituted for wrongful commital, and providing for normal access to the court for damages for false imprisonment, was eliminated.  Such a time bar is not just unnecessary; it creates an injustice which, considering what the person has gone through, is intolerable. We must ensure that these people have equal rights and access to courts and documentation.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concept of review boards and that the representation on these boards should be broadly based. They should consist not only of skilled professionals but also of compassionate lay people with experience and community care expertise.  Until such a structure is set up patients who have been treated in an unjust way will feel vulnerable. It is important that there be an objective board to which these people can make their case and that they be seen to be independent.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that it is only now we are attempting to amend the 1945 Act considering all the changes that have taken place and the hardship and injustice suffered by some people.  It is wrong to talk about review committees, Green Papers or reports, before drafting such legislation.  Legislation at the drafting stage will not include all the necessary safeguards and be free of anomalies and loopholes.  That is why the debate on Second Stage and, particularly, Committee Stage is so vital.  Committee and Report Stage debates are the backbone of our procedures in Parliament.  In the majority of cases a Bill undergoes a great process of change in the House.  I appeal to the Minister to use this Bill as a foundation on which he and the parliamentary draftsmen can build.  We accept that in drafting a private Bill a Deputy cannot avail of the expertise and drafting skills that are available to a Minister.  A tremendously strong arm of our democracy is that Private Members' Bills are allowed to be introduced and this allows us to debate urgent matters that may have taken a back seat because some of our most vulnerable, voiceless and powerless <Col N="2092" /> people are involved.  This Bill sets out to represent their views.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider seriously the tremendous boost it would be to the work of this House and to the rights and privileges of this House if a Private Members' Bill which was introduced in such a spirit of sincerity and which reflects a genuine need were taken on board.  Deputy Fennell had not the back-up resources of the parliamentary draftsman and I commend her on the amount of work she has put into this Bill.  She would be the last person to say that this Bill is perfect in every way but we can all say that it highlights the desperate injustice which can befall some of the most vulnerable people in our society unless such safeguards are written into legislation.</P>
    <P>May I once again appeal to the Minister, whom I know to be very compassionate and who recognises the thrust of Deputy Fennell's Bill, to use the Bill as the foundation for improving and broadening mental health legislation. The Fine Gael Party and Deputy Fennell, in particular, would be agreeable to accepting amendments.  We are not claiming that the Bill is perfect, but it is a great start.  With the level of support in this House for the Bill and with the aid of the Department's expertise, we could produce a very fine Bill and we would not have on our conscience the terrible injustice of incarcerating people who do not need treatment but who are totally isolated and powerless to fight committal when this happens to them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Nuala Fennell a thug an Bille seo os ár gcomhair agus a thug deis dúinn labhairt ar na fadhbanna a bhaineann le daoine a bhfuil galar meabharach acu.  Tugann sé deis dúinn freisin a fheiceáil nach bhfuil ciall ar bith leis an chóras sa Dáil seo, mar ní féidir le haon rud tairbheach teacht ón taobh seo den Teach.  Caithfidh an Rialtas na forálacha fiúntacha a thabhairt isteach.  Ach nuair a bheidh na comhaltaí atá thall ansin ar an dtaobh seo taréis <Col N="2093" /> cúpla mí, beidh athrú ar an scéal: ní bheidh aon chiall acu nuair a thagann siad go dtí taobh an Fhreasúra.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Fennell on this very important Bill which highlights the extreme suffering that some people have to go through.  While I welcome the sympathy which was expressed so ably by both Ministers, I am amazed that in 1992, we do not have a system whereby the Government will accept an Opposition Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, outlined a great many little things that need to be improved on but I ask why the Government cannot accept the Bill and table amendments on Committee Stage to make the necessary changes. What is wrong that the Government cannot improve on the Bill from their point of view?</P>
      <P>If Deputy Fennell can bring forward this Bill on her own why will the Government not support her with all their resources?  Also why do we only take on the worst aspects of the systems we copy? If Members of the British House of Commons who are lucky enough to have their Bills selected can be given all the resources available to the Government, why can we not adopt that aspect of British parliamentary procedure?  It looks as if we will talk about Dáil reform forever, but do nothing about it.  As an Opposition Member for the past two and a half years I find the system most unsatisfactory.  As I wrote in an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> one time, it is like asking Sean Kelly to win the Tour de France on a &ldquo;high nellie&rdquo;.  The system in this House is archaic, out of touch and not relevant to the nineties.  This is not the fault of the present Government but it is time we reformed the system and allowed for common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about a Green Paper on mental health but we will all be green in the face before anything will be done for the mentally ill.  There is no question of a Bill being introduced during the present term of this Government. The Green Paper may be produced but if it is to be of any value a great deal of time will be spent discussing it.  Then a White Paper will have to be published <Col N="2094" /> before the Bill is introduced.  I can assure the Minister that he will not introduce a Bill on mental treatment during the lifetime of this Dáil.  As I said when I spoke in Irish, after the next election we will be on opposite sides of the House and with a bit of luck we will be introducing this Bill and Deputy Roche's brains will be going to rust over here because he will be regarded as an obsolete article from Wicklow.  There will be no respect for the Deputy when he is on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Government have an excellent opportunity to amend this Bill introduced on Deputy Fennell's initiative, thus giving relief to the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>It could be said that Nero fiddled while Rome burned &mdash; perhaps it would be dangerous to say that Ministers were fiddling in the present circumstances &mdash; but it can be said that the Ministers are sitting idly by when they should be dealing with the foundations of a great Bill that should be accepted.  Richard Lovelace who died back in 1658 wrote lines that most people are familiar with: Stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage.  That statement was put in more positive terms later by somebody else: &ldquo;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder&rdquo;.  It all depends on how you look at things.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the high walls surrounding mental hospitals throughout the country were demolished many years ago.  This did a great deal for the public and for the patients in the hospital.  I have to admit that the high walls convinced me that the mental hospitals were prisons because you could not look in over the walls.  I am quite sure also that the mentally alert who were in the hospital were convinced that they were locked up too. After the walls were demolished people outside suddenly found that there were beautiful flower beds and lawns around the hospital and they were surprised to find that the patients were occupied so well in working on the flower beds and gardens.  That was the first chink of light into the mental hospitals, and I am glad that happened.</P>
    <P>From the architectural point of view, our mental hospital buildings may be considered <Col N="2095" /> a thing of beauty and a joy forever but they are so intimidating I feel they are not suitable for somebody who is ill.  The sooner we get people into houses which will provide some normality the better.  I know that the present policy document &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;, provides for people going out into the community.  This is helpful for the people who can live in the community.  But I wonder if these huge buildings, long corridors and big rooms help people who suffer from all kinds of phobias to recover quickly.  If these buildings were used for other purposes I would be happy; and if we had smaller buildings for those who are ill I would be happy, too.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to learn people could be admitted involuntarily to hospitals, as has been outlined by Deputy Fennell.  It is worrying that this can happen.  I was shocked even more to find that a leading barrister found herself in the position where she could be admitted to a mental hospital at her husband's insistence.  If she can be forced into hospital, what chance has the ordinary person who is not aware of his rights.  If Deputy Fennell did nothing else except highlight that situation, then she has done more than her share to highlight the difficulties facing mentally ill patients or, worse still, those who are not mentally ill but who can be regarded as such and can be locked up.</P>
    <P>At present we have a prisoner who has been pardoned, and we know how he must have felt.  How must a sane person feel who has been certified and admitted to a mental hospital.  If somebody from a mental hospital complains to us or talks about something that has gone wrong, we are inclined to say they would not be in the mental hospital if they were not unbalanced, but perhaps we should give more credence to what they tell us.</P>
    <P>The document &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; has worked effectively so far as community care is concerned where people have been sent out into hostels. One of the difficulties is that there is not a sufficient backup service.  That is no reflection on the staff of the hospitals <Col N="2096" /> who organise it but simply that we are living in a time of cutbacks.  The idea of six or eight people who are capable of living together in houses is a good one as it gives them a more normal life and makes them feel part of a family.  It must come as a shock to a person who has been in an institution for 20 years and is capable of looking after himself, to be regarded as an individual once again because institutionalisation has an appalling effect on people.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that in my county five, six or, perhaps, eight houses have been provided for such patients, many of whom we can meet on the street, and they are doing quite well.  The staff would like more money to purchase more houses, and that is something we will have to deal with.  I am glad the day has come when we no longer admit mentally handicapped people to mental hospitals. It should never have happened.  The mentally handicapped should not be in mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>There are two views on admitting people of a certain age to these hospitals. Sometimes the medical staff say their hospital is not the place for them but that the patient should be in a geriatric home; in another case a relative may say the patient should be in a mental hospital. Old people can be sick mentally as well as physically and they should be treated individually.</P>
    <P>As I am sharing my time, I will put the rest of my notes in my pocket.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne complained, and rightly so, about the way we conduct our business in this House and he said it could be ordered much better.  I feel &mdash; and I will <Col N="2097" /> not allude to it in greater detail &mdash; the problem does not lie in the House or with the Members but with our system of election.  In my opinion there will be no root and branch reformation of the way we conduct our business until there is a root and branch reform of the method of election to Dáil Éireann.  However, we can leave that aside for the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend Deputy Fennell for bringing forward this Bill because the treatment of the mentally ill is and has been on the lowest level of the public mind over the years and is the least fashionable area of medicine or of public health.  Compared with other areas, such as surgery, implants etc. it has been relatively neglected but this is not to say there have not been and are not outstanding people working in the mental health area, in our psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric institutions and now, increasingly so, in the community.  Not all mentally ill patients are ill all the time; there are remissions, improvements and some people recover completely.  This will be a long road and we will have to change public attitudes towards the mentally ill, their treatment and their acceptance as people in society with the same rights as everybody else.  I agree with the Minister that while Deputy Fennell has focused our attention on our relative neglect of mental health, her Bill is too narrowly focused.  It deals with 10 per cent of admissions to our psychiatric hospitals; the people who are committed under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>When reading Deputy Fennell's Bill today, I got worried about my own medical practice so much that I had to go back and check that what I was doing, and had been doing for the past 20 years, was correct both medically and legally.  I found that two doctors are required to admit a patient to a psychiatric hospital. This has always been my practice &mdash; and of everybody else as far as I know &mdash; for admission to public psychiatric hospitals. Normally the general practitioners who should know the patient will sign what is <Col N="2098" /> commonly known as Form No. 6 &mdash; the pink form &mdash; and so will the patient's nearest relative.  When the patient is taken to the psychiatric institution, the psychiatrist in charge or on duty will again examine the patient.  It is his or her signature on the form that admits the patient to hospital.  Ten per cent of all patients are admitted involuntarily.</P>
    <P>I gather the starting point for Deputy Fennell's Bill was the inappropriate or downright malicious committal of people to psychiatric hospitals.  While we should tighten our procedures, we cannot legislate for pure bad-mindedness or in-fighting in families.  That is not to say that we should not build safeguards into a Bill. One of the safeguards suggested by Deputy Fennell is the establishment of a review board.  That does not go far enough because the review would have to be at the instigation of named or designated people.  There should be an automatic review of the condition of anybody who is admitted as a longstay patient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for that in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see that.  This review should be carried out by outside people, not those working in the local health board area.  The chairman of the review committee should be a person of goodwill and commonsense who is in touch with what goes on in the real world but that is only a detail that can be worked out another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill should provide that appropriate treatment be given in proper surroundings, that the patient's rights are protected by a review committee or an outside specialist reviewing cases of long-stay patients, that patients are given access to their records and that there should be full discussion with them as to their rights.  The medical profession are often not the best at explaining to patients why what is being done is in their best interests.  In the area of mental <Col N="2099" /> health or psychiatry patients cannot be treated successfully without their full cooperation and their insight into what is being done.  I do not know if this can be encompassed in a Bill.  It may come down to the continuing education of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has promised us a Green Paper.  In an area of such medical and social importance we should move slowly.  That is not to say that the Department of Health should be allowed to sit back and do nothing until another Opposition Member or a Deputy on this side complains.  This should be a starting point, and we should not put the issue on the backburner.</P>
    <P>Mental Health affects everybody in the community and must be dealt with.  There are fields like child and adolescent psychiatry and people with a mental handicap. Such people can have psychiatric problems.  People with a physical handicap can have psychiatric problems.  In fact, one person can have a multiplicity of problems.  What we do again and again in medicine is to compartmentalise problems; we treat the disease and not the patient.  We should view the patient as an individual in his own right.</P>
    <P>There are other problems which are alcohol and drug related.  There are severely disturbed patients who, under stress, can break up family homes and cause horrendous problems in neighbourhoods, not to mind their own home. There are patients who are inappropriately treated.  One finds people being sent to prison who should be in a psychiatric institution and, as was mentioned by Deputy Browne, there are the elderly mentally infirm.  Our knowledge of this area is only developing and treatments are changing all the time.</P>
    <P>In the course of this contribution, Deputy Browne mentioned high walls around psychiatric hospitals all over the country.  I recall when a psychiatrist was appointed by the Eastern Health Board many years ago his first job was to knock <Col N="2100" /> down the walls around the institution. Within a few years the health board had to put up railings to protect the people in the hospital from the depredations of people from outside.  When one does one thing it often creates other problems.  It is no harm to recall that the original definition of what we call a psychiatric hospital was asylum where a person could get rest from the problems of the world, faoiseamh ó fhadhbanna an tsaoil.  We should never forget that part of the treatment of psychiatric patients.  Sometimes they need asylum or rest for a while and not on a full-time basis or anything like it.</P>
    <P>When we prepare a Bill we will need to beware of fashions in psychiatry. There are fashions in medicine and in psychiatry just as there are in any other walk of life.  We should draft a Bill that will focus on the patient and on the community but will not allow the diktats of fashion in medicine to push one way or the other.  If we are serious about this we should see that Dáil Éireann votes adequate finance for the treatment of the mentally ill and let us not be parsimonious about it.  Fine words are great but money is what is required.  Go raibh míle maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for sharing time with me.  I would also like to compliment Deputy Fennell on the Bill.  It is very easy, when someone takes the time and trouble to put down a Bill, to identify the faults in it.  That is not intended to be a hurtful reflection on the person who has taken the time and gone to the trouble to draft the Bill but to indicate why it would be wise, because of the complexities, for legislation to be produced by the Government.</P>
      <P>I should like to put on record my wholehearted compliments to the Deputy who has taken the trouble to highlight the issue.  The greatest service Deputy Fennell has done is to force us to debate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> I do not have the experience Deputy Fennell has of the wrongful incarceration of people in mental treatment institutions but I do have some experience of people who have been wrongfully incarcerated in penitential institutions here and in the UK.  I know from my dealings with those people the extraordinary turmoil that is caused not just because of the injustice but because of the sense that life is passing them by.  How much greater that turmoil must be to some person who is wrongfully incarcerated.  I acknowledge that a great service is being done in forcing us to focus on this issue.  Indeed, I carried out some research on this issue and I must compliment the Deputy for forcing me to look at this important issue which clearly requires attention.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Health acknowledged that the law must be updated to keep pace with and facilitate service developments in this area.  He further made the point that the law must be adjusted to conform with modern concepts in relation to the rights of the individual. The Minister of State said something similar earlier tonight in his short time in office, the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, has given clear evidence that the area of mental treatment will receive his attention.  He has shown himself to be a man of compassion, he has experience in the medical field and his compassion and experience will serve us well.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month, the Minister commented that the legal framework in which mental treatment services are based and the services themselves are inextricably interrelated and his proposal that we move forward with a Green Paper marks a radical shift in the delivery of psychiatric services which we all welcome.  It is right and proper to say, again, that these welcome moves were initiated as far back as 1984 in the report &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.  The Minister of the day deserves praise for that.</P>
    <P>In shifting the emphasis, we need to update the legal basis of the services &mdash; this issue lies at the centre of Deputy <Col N="2102" /> Fennell's Bill.  It has been recognised in relation to the mental health legislation which was introduced almost half a century ago that we have reached the point where a radical review is needed.  Indeed, that legislation is well past its shelf life.</P>
    <P>While that legislation was considered to be progressive when it was introduced, it is now outdated.  Indeed, when one reads it, one can see that it is based on a different psychological approach to mental treatment.  It is interesting to note also that our thinking in this area has changed dramatically over the years.  We are now dealing with what is as much a human right as an issue related to the law and to care.  One of the most significant changes has been the move from an institutional psychiatric service.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Minister of State outlined some of the things that must be done in any new legislation.  He suggested, for example, that a new Bill must reflect society's concern for the welfare of those who are mentally ill, it must conform with European convention obligations and UN principles relating to the care of the mentally ill, it must provide a firm basis for psychiatric services for the next 50 years and, above all else, it must provide not just for those who are in need for a service but for comprehensive safeguards, in particular for the individual who might be placed in institutional care.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Fennell will excuse me, given the shortage of time, for passing to some of the criticisms I have to make of the Bill.  If time was available I would deal in more positive terms with the positive sides of the Bill, but unfortunately, the provisions of the Bill, meritorious as they are, fall short of what is needed.  As the Minister of State dealt with these issues in some detail, I will avoid duplication.</P>
    <P>The Bill has two primary points of focus.  It deals with two of the primary elements, reception orders and the proposal to establish mental health review boards, which I welcome.  As the Bill deals with admission proceedures only in <Col N="2103" /> a summary way it is less then comprehensive. I have already acknowledged the value of what is being suggested but, apart from these two areas, the Bill does not attempt to deal with a range of issues which should be dealt with in new legislation.</P>
    <P>Any new legislation should and must acknowledge the establishment of centres of care for in-patients and deal in detail with the legal obligations of the service providers.  In a short Bill, given the difficulties outlined by Deputy Barnes, it is not possible for a private Member to do this in a comprehensive way.  New legislation must cover in detail such issues as the responsibility for the delivery of services, the designation of centres and the licensing and control procedures of such centres, all these issues which should be addressed in detail have not been dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Other serious issues which require attention include the question of guardianship as we move towards community based services, and providing protection against exploitation.  The question of patient advocacy groups, how they should be established, their legal basis and how they should be funded also need to be addressed.  There is a great tradition of voluntarism in Ireland but in a difficult and complex area like this where medical practice and law intertwine, funding and specialist knowledge will be required which are beyond the capacity of voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which require debate and examination.  The fundamental question of what represents mental illness, for legislative purposes, requires consideration and debate at this time.  The question of whether global terms such as &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; should be used to encompass mental illness, personality disorder and mental handicap needs to be established.  Deputy Browne touched on this.  The extent to which these terms should be defined for statutory purposes, if at all, needs clarification, <Col N="2104" /> and no further legislative provision can be proceeded with without clarification on these issues because they go to the heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>No provision exists for the compulsory admission, detention or supervision of mentally handicapped persons.  It has to be decided whether this should continue to be the case and whether mentally handicapped persons should be subject to the same legal provisions as the mentally ill and, if so, whether these conditions will be covered by the blanket term &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;.  I think that would be unsuitable but only a ministerial Bill could deal with this.</P>
    <P>The question of admission to a hospital or a psychiatric centre needs greater consideration &mdash; I do not say this as an unfair criticism of the Bill &mdash; than possibly can be provided in a Private Members' Bill; neither does the Bill address voluntary admission or its replacement by informal admission.  Clearly any new legislation must incorporate this change so that patients can enter psychiatric hospitals or centres in the same way that a person can enter a general hospital.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the question of compulsory and emergency admissions or whether people should be admitted for observation or treatment. Somewhat surprisingly, the Bill does not specify with any degree of clarity the need for a certifying doctor to spell out clearly, and the procedures involved, patients' rights or the right of a patient to have a second opinion.</P>
    <P>I realise that in making these criticism I may be seen as nitpicking, but that is not my intention.  I wish to illustrate the extraordinary span that has to be dealt with in this area.  I could go on in more detail but I would like to make the following point.  Deputy Browne and Deputy Barnes asked why the Government cannot accept the Bill.  I do not think the Government's non-acceptance indicates that they do not care about this area &mdash; I think Deputy Fennell would accept the Government's good faith &mdash;<Col N="2105" /> or that they suffer from Ministerial vanity.  We have had no indication from either the Minister or Minister of State yet that they have fallen into this deadly way.</P>
    <P>The reality is that this area is so complex &mdash; I have already complimented Deputy Fennell for putting it on the political agenda &mdash; in particular for the lay-person who makes up the bulk of Members, given the medical terminology used, that the wise approach would be to introduce the Green Paper.  This will allow the widest possible discussion. Because the area is so extraordinarily complex and multi-faceted, it is impossible for us to deal with one element only, important though that element may be, and it is beyond the capacity of a private Member to deal with this in a Bill.  While this may be so for technical reasons, a great service has been done in bringing forward this legislation, and I do not say that in a patronising way.  By highlighting the issue, as Deputy Fennell has done we have seen yet another area in which human rights can be trampled on.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary case mentioned by Deputy Browne is hard to believe.  It is incredible to think that in the nineties this kind of thing can happen.  I hope that the mere highlighting of this extraordinary state of affairs will help to prevent it happening again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me an opportunity to raise a matter which is causing widespread unrest and dissatisfaction among farmers, particularly in the west.  I am shocked that in this day of so-called, overall management techniques which are supposed to exist in the Department of Agriculture, it is necessary to suspend this useful scheme of pollution control from 14 April.  I am <Col N="2106" /> sure that telephone calls to the Minister's office have indicated the depths of frustration in the country.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the scheme was one of the best introduced for quite a long time.  I have to accept that it is not the first time the Department of Agriculture have done something like this but why was the impression given to every farmer who wanted to control pollution that the EC funded grant would be available for the duration of the five year programme? Why, half-way through the period, did the Minister's office ring all the FDS offices around the country and instruct them not to take any more applications? It would not be so bad if a date had been given and that any applications sent to the office by that date would be eligible for the grant, but the decision was much worse.  It meant that farmers who had made an application, who in certain cases had made deals with their bank managers and who had visits from departmental officials, having applied for planning permission, are now in limbo.  They do not know whether their applications will be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will people who have already received approval be allowed to go ahead with their plans?  Will the Minister also outline the position in regard to people who have approval but who had to apply for planning permission which has not yet been granted?  I also understand &mdash; correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that it is intended to write to people who have outstanding approvals and to give them three months in which to complete the job.  Failure to do so will mean they will not get the grant which will be redistributed to others on the waiting list.  I am not criticising the concept of ensuring that a farmer will not have approval for an undue length of time but why was it necessary to suspend the scheme?  The officials in the Department must have known the number of people who were in receipt of grants and they must have been able to monitor exactly what was happening.  Why was it necessary to bring down this blunt instrument <Col N="2107" /> on 14 April just before the silage season?  I do not have to inform the Minister of how important this time of the year is to farmers.  It was a very insensitive decision which will mean that people will not bother trying to control pollution. This will even apply to those who were visited by a fisheries inspector and a member of the local authority to ensure that there would be no pollution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this matter.  I fully agree that the scheme is a very important one.  It is to the credit of our farming community that they have responded in such a positive way to the problem of dealing with farm effluent, which is obvious from the very large number of applications received.</P>
      <P>The scheme for the control of farmyard pollution (CFP) was introduced here in 1989 as an operational programme.  The scheme was to last until 1993 and estimated expenditure was £94 million.  A sum of £66.4 million was allocated out of the Structural Funds to finance this expenditure.</P>
      <P>To date 27,000 farmers have applied for the scheme and approvals have issued in 25,000 cases leaving over 2,000 to be dealt with.  These approvals exhaust the estimated expenditure of £94 million and the corresponding expenditure of £66.4 million from the Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that all the outstanding approvals will not reach completion in which case there would be money available <Col N="2108" /> to finance some more approvals.  It has been decided, therefore, to cancel those approvals where the completion date has expired in an effort to find out how many approvals are likely to be completed.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Connaughton acknowledged that this was a useful exercise within the Department because there is no point in having many applications on departmental records without having at least some indication as to whether they will be implemented.  I do not have to remind Deputy Connaughton &mdash; who has experience in the Department &mdash; that to proceed without trying to establish whether these grants would be taken up, would be wasteful in terms of the money allocated to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That could have been done in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected that the situation will be clarified within a month or so.  If by them it is established that a certain number of applicants are not going ahead with their approved work, additional approvals can be issued.  While it is too soon to make a definite forecast of the outcome it is likely that it will be possible to deal with a substantial number of the applications on hands within the current financial allocation.  While new applications will continue to be accepted it will not, however, be possible to deal with them pending a commitment from the EC as to additional funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the importance of this scheme in the control of farmyard pollution and the interest which farmers have in it.  For this reason, in the programme being prepared by the Government for submission to the European Community for a new allocation of Structural Funds, additional finance for this scheme will certainly have priority.  In my recent discussion with Agricultural Commissioner Ray MacSharry I specifically pointed out that there were not sufficient funds to meet the current Irish <Col N="2109" /> demand.  I impressed on him the importance of increasing the allocation under this subhead to meet the level of applications currently in the Department.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Connaughton's concern and I assure him and the House that we will be doing everything possible to ensure that all the applications within the Department are implemented by way of additional funding as quickly as possible. I should like to pay a tribute to the agricultural community who have responded magnificently to this essential national scheme.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Unemployment Assistance Eligibility.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I will be raising an individual case but the issue probably affects thousands of cohabiting couples in this State.</P>
      <P>The case concerns a young woman who had been working for ten years and paying tax and PRSI.  When she lost her job she qualified for unemployment benefit in the normal way.  Eventually her unemployment benefit ran out and she went on to unemployment assistance about a year ago.  As Deputies will know, unemployment assistance is means-tested. First, the woman's entitlement was reduced because one day per week she worked in a local pub, which she declared and for which she paid the J rate of social insurance.  She has no dispute with that deduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The woman's grievance concerns a further deduction of £52 per week from her remaining £59 per week.  That deduction was in respect of &mdash; as was stated in a letter from the Department of Social Welfare &mdash;&ldquo;benefit and privilege from common law husband's net weekly earnings after allowing for travelling expenses.&rdquo;  In other words, the young woman is regarded as a dependent by the Department of Social Welfare and is paid £7 per week by that Department for herself and her three and a half year old child <Col N="2110" /> because of the income of her common law husband.  That might be understandable if the woman's common law husband could claim income tax relief for her as a dependent, but he cannot.</P>
    <P>The couple have been living together for seven years, they have a three and a half year old child and are jointly purchasing their house.  They cannot get married because the man was married before and this State does not permit divorce and remarriage.  The State's money-collecting arm, however, the Revenue Commissioners, recognise them as single people and under our tax law will not allow the income tax relief normally enjoyed by married couples. When it comes to paying out money, however, the State, through the Department of Social Welfare, considers them as if they were a married couple.</P>
    <P>There is clearly an anomaly here.  The woman has exhausted the Department of Social Welfare appeals procedure and has asked me to take the matter up in the Dáil.  I know there are many couples who are in perfectly stable family relationships, unable to get married because of our perverse attitude to divorce and losing out financially because one arm of the State considers them to be married and the other arm considers them to be single.  I appeal for consistency in this matter.  Either the Department of Social Welfare should recognise relationships such as this or the Minister for Finance, and the Revenue Commissioners, should regard them in the same way as the Department of Social Welfare, that they are effectively married, and should allow them to claim the normal married tax allowance.</P>
    <P>If it is not possible for the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that this young women is paid the level of unemployment assistance to which she would be entitled if she was considered a single person then it is incumbent on the Government, perhaps in the context of the Finance Bill before the Dáil, to remedy the tax anomaly and permit cohabiting couples such <Col N="2111" /> as this one to benefit from the normal tax allowance available to married couples.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to apologise for my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, who is unable to attend to reply to Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers first claimed unemployment assistance in May 1991, having exhausted her entitlement to unemployment benefit.  Her means, which were assessed at £52.50 per week from 29 May 1991, were derived from the benefit of her partner's earnings. The decision in relation to the person's means was upheld on appeal in February 1992.  The person is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £8.50.</P>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts, the payment of unemployment assistance is subject, among other things, to a means test.  Means are any income a person may have, or property, excluding their home, or assets which could provide them with an income.  In the case of a married person or a cohabiting person, the means of his or her spouse or partner are also taken into account when determining entitlement.  If the spouse's or partner's income is derived from employment, his or her gross income, less tax and PRSI, is taken into account and a personal allowance of £45, along with an allowance for travel expenses, is deducted. The balance is then divided in two, and the resulting amount is assessed against the claimant as means.</P>
      <P>This treatment of cohabiting couples arises from a Supreme Court decision in 1989 to the effect that married couples could not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples in respect of unemployment assistance payments.  As a result, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1989, extended the rules which applied to married couples to cohabiting couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain other provisions within the <Col N="2112" /> existing code which were identified as involving less favourable treatment of married than of cohabiting couples were amended in the Social Welfare Act, 1991, so as to provide for a non-discriminatory method of dealing with the payments in question.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision which found provisions of the equal treatment legislation to be in conflict with the Constitution raises the whole question of the treatment of different household situations within the social welfare code. In view of the complexity of the issues involved, the Government established an independent review group to examine the social welfare code as it affects households with particular regard to the equal treatment provisions and the requirements in relation to the treatment of married couples arising from the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The report of the group has been published and submissions have been invited from interested parties on the contents of that report.  The Minister is currently examining the options available for improvements to the system.  The current situation is that the Department of Social Welfare now treat all couples, whether married or cohabiting, in exactly the same way with regard to assessment of means.  This practice has been shown to be equitable and in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The different treatment of married and cohabiting couples within the tax system is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me raise this question on the Adjournment.  I wish to ask the Minister to consider the introduction of a new house sales scheme.  In Dublin since the millennium year people have not been able to apply to purchase their homes.  I realise that the same problem applies around the country.  Many people who applied to purchase their homes <Col N="2113" /> during the millennium year have still not had their applications cleared.  I can understand that that might have something to do with staff levels or industrial relations matters concerning Dublin Corporation but that should not prohibit the sale of houses to tenants, some of whom have been in their houses since before 1939.  Some of those involved are elderly people who were not in a position during the millennium year to apply to purchase their house but are now in a position to do so.  Having been in their house since 1939 or earlier, they want to be in a position to leave the house to a loved one so that the house continues in the ownership of the family.</P>
      <P>The rules are that a sub-tenant must have resided with the tenant for two years or for ten years out of the past 15 years to be considered as a successor in the case of a tenancy.  However, if somebody becomes a sub-tenant shortly before the death of the tenant it is not possible to become the tenant-purchaser because he or she has not resided there for the past two years.</P>
      <P>There are many anomalies in the scheme.  For example, there are people who live in flats who were given to understand that they would be able to purchase the flats and there are people living in maisonettes who were given to understand they could apply to purchase their maisonettes.  Thre are people living in houses &mdash; some of whom are in their eighties and many of them in their seventies &mdash; who are very concerned that they will have nothing to show for the 53 or 54 years they paid rent to Dublin Corporation.  For most of those people their homes would be their only real asset if they were able to purchase them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The millennium scheme offered to tenant purchasers a 50 per cent deduction on the market value.  This was attractive to some people.  Previous schemes operated on a different basis.  The market value system did not operate for all tenants. Many people said that they would wait until 1989 or 1990 for a new scheme <Col N="2114" /> and that they would apply under the new scheme as it would be more advantageous. Other people simply could not apply to purchase their houses.  Many people whose children had emigrated were left on their own with limited income, and so could not purchase a house.  Now because their family has come back and is living with them they are in a position to make extra repayments and are anxious to be able to leave the house to a son or daughter living with them.</P>
    <P>Since the millennium year the rent for many people is now more than the repayments would be.  Those who pay a little tax, can set the interest against the tax and their repayments are even less.  It is grossly unfair not to allow them to purchase their houses.  The argument that we want to keep these houses within the housing stock is not valid, because we are probably talking about a very small number of houses.  Even if it takes some years before these sales are cleared, I appeal to the Minister to approve a new house sales scheme in the interests of fairness.  It would leave a lot of old people with a certain amount of happiness in the autumn of their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1988 tenant purchase schemes was a special &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; scheme which offered particularly generous terms in order to encourage the maximum number of local authority tenants to become owners of the dwellings in which they lived.  It was introduced at a time when there was a degree of instability in many local authority estates following the departure of tenants who had availed of the £5,000 surrender grant. and when the numbers on the housing list were less than they are at present.  All eligible tenants received a basic discount of 40 per cent off market value and those living in pre-1960 houses received an extra discount of 10 per cent.  The scheme was extremely successful and it is estimated that some 30,000 of the 40,000 applications received have now been <Col N="2115" /> dealt with.  The processing of such a volume of applications did, however, put a strain on the resources of some local authorities.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation received some 11,000 applications and while they have made considerable progress in finalising sales they had, at 31 December, 1991, still over 3,600 applications, in respect of houses and flats, awaiting completion. Certain difficulties in relation to the sale of flats and, in particular, to the disposal of common areas in a complex were brought to my attention in late 1991. The recently published Housing Bill, on which the Second Stage debate is due to commence later this week, includes new provisions to overcome these problems. The corporation are aware of the position and it is now a matter for them to ensure that all other aspects of the sales procedures are completed so that sales can be finalised as soon as the Bill becomes law.  I am, anxious that sales under the 1988 scheme would, as far as is practicable, be completed before I consider the introduction of a further scheme.  I share the Deputy's concern at any delays in completion of sales but I am satisfied that the existing well-established procedures of authorities can cope with any problems that may be caused by the delays in matters such as rights of succession and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing authorities are, at present, dealing with the various schemes introduced under &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;. An important aim of this plan is to reduce the traditional degree of dependence on the direct provision of local authority housing by the introduction of new measures to provide for a greater choice in housing leading to a more efficient and equitable use of the available resources.  Among the aids available under the plan to local authority tenants who wish to become home-owners are the mortgage allowance and shared ownership schemes together with increased house purchase loan and <Col N="2116" /> income limits and the provision of subsidised sites.  It is necessary that authorities be given the opportunity to promote and implement these measures. We must also bear in mind that it is necessary for authorities to retain a pool of housing which can generate vacancies for those persons on the waiting list whose circumstances are such that direct local authority rented housing is the only option.  In these circumstances the introduction of a sales scheme could tend to prevent authorities from focusing their attention and efforts on the wide-ranging options contained in the plan.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances I have no immediate intention of introducing a new tenant purchase scheme but I will continue to keep the matter under review in the light of developments.</P>

      <P>With regard to the lack of Government policy on regional airports I am concerned about the way in which Waterford Regional Airport is being treated by the major airlines, specifically the national airline, Aer Lingus and the largest independent airline, Ryanair. Waterford Airport has had a considerable amount of public money invested in improvements in recent years, together with a huge amount of investment from the local community in Waterford and surrounding districts. Something in the region of £4 million to £5 million has been invested.  The runway at the airport was lengthened and widened. Navigational aids were brought in and a modern terminal building is just being completed.  Aer Lingus and Ryanair have seen fit to virtually abandon Waterford.  Less than two years ago Aer Lingus withdrew the one service operating in and out of the airport.  That was a feeder service which was operated in the middle of the day rather than earlier in the morning or late in the evening, when it would be of some use to commuters <Col N="2117" /> to Britain and other destinations.  Ryanair have seen fit to cut back their services from three flights a day to one flight a day and that flight is now in the middle of the day and is not of great value to people who wish to do business in the UK and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I agree that 1991 was not a good year for airlines in general.  It is a very poor year on which to base financial predictions.  Apparently both companies are using the figures for 1991 as an excuse for not continuing to use the airport as it should be used.  Early morning and late evening flights in and out of the airport are profitable.  We would expect the Government to see to it that Aer Lingus and Ryanair provide a service to help the airport to survive.  It is hard to see them surviving as a viable entity unless the national airline at least, does something about it.  We are looking to the Minister of State, Deputy Kenneally, who is here this evening, to assist in getting the type of service needed, seeing that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, announced such a service for Galway the week after she was appointed to the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Deasy having raised this matter in the House this evening, one to which I can respond without any departmental brief because I served on the board of Waterford Regional Airport until my recent appointment when I had to resign.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to the development and expansion of Waterford Airport.  To date, over £2.6 million have been made available to the airport through Exchequer and EC sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tangible evidence of the Government's commitment to Waterford Airport will be the opening of the new terminal building shortly.  Furthermore, the necessary regulatory arrangements have been negotiated with the United Kingdom and the EC to facilitate services <Col N="2118" /> operating through regional airports like Waterford.</P>
    <P>While facilities at Waterford Airport are being upgraded and expanded to offer an improved standard of service to airlines and passengers alike, traffic through the airport has been hit severely by the impact of the international recession in air transport, particularly in the United Kingdom, which has resulted in Ryanair reducing the scale of their frequency through the airport this year, compared with last year.</P>
    <P>Ryanair currently operate a scheduled service between Waterford and Stansted on a six-times weekly basis.  However, Ryanair have indicated to me that it is their intention to expand services through the airport should there be an improvement in traffic demand and are closely monitoring the situation.  I should add also that Ryanair have recently reduced some of their fares through the airport to boost traffic.</P>
    <P>The provision of air services through Waterford Airport is primarily a matter for the commercial judgement of the airlines concerned.  However, I know that the airport company are most anxious to attract Aer Lingus back to Waterford to reintroduce the previous Waterford &mdash; Dublin link.  I have spoken personally with the Chairman of Waterford Regional Airport PLC on this matter and have asked Aer Lingus to re-examine this question.  I expect to be following up this initiative within the next two weeks and will keep my constituency colleague informed of any developments.</P>

      <P>Coastal erosion, in particular associated drifting sand, is creating a very real threat to large tracts of fertile land between Roughley and Knocklane in North Sligo, the area known locally as Trá Bhúi.  This is the second occasion on which the moving sands of Trá Bhúi have figured in Parliament, the last occasion being in the House of Commons in the last century when a select committee were informed that 2,000 acres of land had been covered <Col N="2119" /> in drifting sand, many people having had to leave their homes, some who held on to their homes having to gain entrance through the roofs, the doors and windows having being blocked up.  That select committee were told that that formidable evil was stopped by bent-grass introduced into the area by Lord Palmerston without which the whole of Maugherow would have been converted into a Sahara.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, I do not have to report to Dáil Éireann any such impending disaster. The most of Maugherow remains green and fertile and became famous for the production of early potatoes and early vegetables but there is a new, very dangerous threat from the sands.  I believe this orginated from a break-up in parts of the bent-grass protection planted by Lord Palmerston.  Serious coastal erosion is recurring.  The result is that previously productive fields have been ruined by flooding, with even greater damage being caused by the blowing sands.  I had the opportunity of seeing this myself last week along with local Councillor, Joe Leonard, when I was amazed at the damage, the inroads that are visible.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have the technical knowledge available to him on how best this should be tackled.  I believe part of the answer may lie in the resowing of bent-grass, replacing it where it has been damaged.  Sligo County Council undertook some work of this nature with a somewhat similar problem in nearby Mullaghmore which I understand is proving to be effective.  In order to encourage the Minister, Dr. Woods to take such action I might give a gentle hint that some time after planting the bent-grass on the Sligo coast, Lord Palmerston twice became Prime Minister of his country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that parts of the County Sligo coastline are subject to coastal erosion, <Col N="2120" /> as is the case with many other parts of our coastline.  I am very familiar with this and fully appreciate the case made by Deputy Ted Nealon in that I have experienced the same problem in many parts of my constituency.</P>
      <P>In relation to County Sligo and the areas to which Deputy Nealon has referred, I should say my Department have been in touch with maritime local authorities &mdash; including Sligo County Council &mdash; with a view to establishing priorities for coastal protection.  My Department's policy is to facilitate the implementation of permanent schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  It is proposed to draw up a programme based on information furnished by local authorities and on the advice of my Department's engineering division.  A considerable amount of information has been compiled already.  I am aware that county engineers are in the course of preparing an overall report to assist this process.</P>
      <P>Knocklane and Yellow Strand were among the areas addressed by Sligo County Council in their submission to my Department, it being stated in their report that re-routing the road to Knocklane and Yellow Strand would appear to be a more expedient, economic solution to the erosion problem in the area rather than undertaking expensive protection works.</P>
      <P>The proposals of Sligo County Council, including that for rock armouring at nearby Roughley to protect dwellings, and a road will be considered <i>inter alia</i> in the light of the funds available to my Department for coastal protection in ensuing years along with the funds available to the local authority consistent with the priorities submitted by other maritime counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the difficulties erosion is causing in many areas, including this one.  The Deputy can rest assured that my Department will closely examine the submissions presented by the maritime councils, in particular that of Sligo. <Col N="2121" /> Perhaps one might suggest it is time to examine the matter of bent-grass. Whether it be myself or the Minister who may follow in the footsteps of Lord Palmerston is a decision we must await.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over five weeks ago large globules of oil were washed up on the Kerry coast, with over 90 per cent of Kerry beaches, from Derrynane in south Kerry, to Beale on the Shannon estuary being affected.  Kerry County Council took immediate action and had their workmen deployed on the beaches immediately when, at one stage over 100 men were working on the clean-up.  The problem has receded considerably over the past two weeks.  Nonetheless small amounts of globules were washed up on Beale beach this week.</P>
      <P>To date Kerry County Council have spent over £70,000 on the clean-up. Unless the Minister for the Marine can reimburse them this expenditure such funds will have to be extracted from our already meagre county roads funds.  At the April meeting of Kerry County Council, the Minister's colleague, Deputy Tom McEllistrim, stated that the Minister, Dr. Woods, had given him a personal commitment that Kerry County Council would be reimbursed their expenditure 100 per cent immediately by his Department. It was also reported in the <i>The Kerryman</i> that the Minister had given a similar commitment to our County Manager, Mr. D'Arcy, on his recent visit to Fenit port.</P>
      <P>I contend a special fund should be made available on a permanent basis to coastal counties to enable them respond immediately to any such emergencies in the future without the attendant fear of their losing their meagre county roads allocation.  Otherwise they will be reluctant to spend large amounts of scarce resources on similar clean-ups.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister's response will be a positive one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On 16 March 1992 <Col N="2122" /> my Department were advised of the oil pollution found on the beaches of north Kerry.  Immediately all the facilities of the Department including the Sikorsky S61N helicopter based at Shannon; were made available to assist with the clean-up work.</P>
      <P>When faced with such a predicament such as the oil pollution which affected our west coast obviously time is of the essence.  When the pollution was observed I am advised that the local authorities concerned responded as soon as practicable.  Later when concern arose about the costs that might be involved my Department were contacted by those authorities.  In order to prevent the oil spreading further along unaffected areas of the beaches, my Department liaised with Kerry, Galway, Clare and Mayo county councils requesting them to complete the clean-up operation.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to the clean-up costs is that the polluter must first be identified before the shipowners and cargo owners and/or their insurers can be requested to refund the costs incurred in the clean-up operation.  In an effort to trace the polluter my Department contacted the United Kingdom Marine Pollution Response Unit and the International Maritime Organisation in London requesting any information they might have concerning damaged vessels. Unfortunately, they had no report of damaged vessels.  My Department also asked the United Kingdom Coastguard and Lloyds whether they have any knowledge of vessels missing off our west coast but, to date, we have had no success in tracing the culprit.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the concerns of Deputy Deenihan.  Recently I had first hand experience of this when a Russian vessel, the <i>Victor Lyagin</i> went on the rocks off the Donegal coast with 80,000 gallons of oil on board.  I appreciate the costs involved, that the council have difficulties and that ever effort must be made to try to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also note the concerns of the council's <Col N="2123" /> esteemed chairman, Deputy McEllistrim, who has obviously discussed this matter with the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods.  I have asked the county councils concerned, including Kerry County Council, to supply my Department with comprehensive details of the <Col N="2124" /> costs incurred.  I will raise the matter with the Government as soon as the details of the costs have been finalised with my Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 April 1992.</P>

      <P>The reconstruction of the economies in Central and Eastern Europe, a process aided largely by the technical assistance programmes of the European Commmunity, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), creates an enormous range of opportunities for Irish experts in almost every area of economic activity.</P>
      <P>Since the end of 1989, therefore, my Department has played a key role in informing and advising a wide range of organisations here in relation to these opportunities, working closely in this process with An Bord Tráchtála.

      <P>Specifically with a view to assisting these CEE countries with the provision of technical skills and services from Ireland I established, last year, an Eastern Europe Group, under the auspices of my Department, to act as a forum for exchange of information and ideas about development opportunities provided by the various technical assistance programmes in Eastern Europe.  It consists of representatives of a wide range of interests including the Confederation of Irish Industry, DEVCO, IDI, TDI, some Irish banks, ABT and the Department of Foreign Affairs and has been structured to ensure the fullest possible dissemination of information among all parties interested in the services and consultancy areas in CEE countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1988, the Government decided to institute a programme designed to review statutory and information requirements which impact on business and industry.</P>
      <P>The principal points of the Government decision of 29 March 1988 were:</P>
      <P>1.  Each Minister should appoint a principal officer in his Department to be responsible for this programme and to report on requirements which are no longer necessary or which can be simplified, including a timetable for such action.</P>
      <P>2.  The Industrial Costs Monitoring Group (ICMG) should establish a formal liaison with appropriate industry representative bodies.</P>
      <P>3.  Each Minister should arrange to have compliance cost assessments made in his Department of all proposed new, or changes in, regulatory requirements affecting industry.</P>
      <P>Results of this Initiative</P>
      <P>Since March 1988, the following work was undertaken on this programme:</P>
      <P>Department reports were received by the ICMG from all Government Departments. These reports were assessed by the ICMG and reported on to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Following the ICMG's liaison with the industry representative bodies, industry submissions were received from a number of business representative organisations. From these submissions almost 100 separate proposals were considered by the ICMG.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of these recommendations included the following areas: Labour legislation and regulations; Taxation procedures; Customs and Excise procedures; Planning regulations; Company Registration Office procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the proposals put forward by the industry representative bodies would <Col N="2000" /> have had a relatively modest impact, if considered individually; 54 of these proposals were the subject of recommendations by the ICMG for further action.</P>
    <P>My Cabinet colleagues were asked to seriously consider the various recommendations of the ICMG with a view to their implementation.  Of the 54 recommendations made, positive departmental responses were received in regard to 11 proposals.  Negative responses were received to 23 proposals, while the balance of 20 proposals were being kept under review in the Departments concerned, or were not the subject of a definitive response one way or another.</P>
    <P>Following communication to the various Government Departments of the requirement to introduce compliance cost assessments in regard to new proposals affecting industry, the ICMG subsequently reported to me that Government Departments were including such cost assessments in the relevant proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>This programme for reviewing the impact on industry of statutory requirements etc. was completed in June 1990 when the ICMG reported to me on the overall results of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> With the enactment of the Companies Act, 1990, I am satisfied that the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, contain satisfactory provisions against malpractice and ensure proper accountability in the operation of limited liability companies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In so far as the involvement by individuals with off-shore companies is concerned, directors of companies are now required under section 195 (2) (f) of the Companies Act, 1963 (as substituted by section 51 of the Companies Act, 1990), to register particulars of any other directorships of bodies corporate held by them, whether those bodies are incorporated in the State or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Moreover, section 194 of the Companies Act, 1963 obliges directors who are interested in a proposed contract with their company to disclose this fact at a meeting of the directors of the company. This would include the fact that a director is a member of another company or firm with which the first company proposes to enter into a contract.</P>
    <P>Section 158 of the Companies Act, 1963 and section 16 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986 also provide for disclosure by companies of details of bodies corporate in which they have a shareholding of a certain size.  These disclosure requirements apply irrespective of where the other body corporate is incorporated.  Depending on the type of company involved, the information will be disclosed in the directors' annual report to the shareholders or in the notes to the annual accounts or a separate statement annexed to the annual return.</P>
    <P>I consider that these provisions require as much information in relation to disclosure by directors and companies of their interests in, and dealing with, off-shore companies as it is appropriate to require in company law, and I do not propose to introduce any amendments to company law in this matter.  These provisions apply to State bodies which are registered as companies under the Companies Acts and to their directors. For those State bodies which are not so registered, however, I have to point out that Company Law is not the medium of <Col N="2003" /> regulation of their activities.  Their regulation is catered for within the context of the provisions establishing them and is a matter for each sponsoring Minister.</P>
    <P>As for concerns regarding monitoring of any dealing between State bodies and off-shore companies in which the executives or directors of State bodies have an interest I feel that these are best dealt with by the guidelines, announced in March by the Minister for Finance, which express the underlying principles that should govern relationships between Departments of State and the State bodies under their aegis.  The guidelines relate equally to subsidiary and associated entities of State bodies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Development are the two State industrial development agencies operating under the aegis of my Department.  Both agencies offer assistance for suitable manufacturing and international service business ideas and such assistance is available to all entrepreneurs regardless of gender.</P>
      <P>In 1986, the then Minister of State for Women's Affairs, Deputy Fennell, launched the Women in Business Programme. The programme, which was completed at the end of 1987, was designed to help stimulate an enterprise culture among women at a time when it was considered that the number of female business promoters was very low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> The programme was never intended to last indefinitely, rather it was intended as a short term measure to help raise enterprise awareness among women.  The late 1980s saw a significant increase in the number of projects by women approved by the IDA: IDA now estimate that over 20 per cent of the total projects approved by them are from female promoters compared to some 3 per cent in 1984.</P>
    <P>I believe that this increase is more likely to be attributable to general cultural changes rather than specific short term industrial promotion programme changes.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to introduce a further programme of this nature in respect of the agencies and business areas under my Department.</P>

Competition in the bread industry is frequently described as &ldquo;price wars&rdquo; and there has been a number of such rounds of price cutting at retail level in recent years.  As I have said many times in this House I welcome competition, as long as it remains within the law.  I would be concerned if there was no such evidence of price competition.  In this respect I am pleased to say that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade was successful in a recent action against a number of bakeries which had attempted to fix the price of bread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that to determine the precise yield from the taxation of the private use of business cars in any year would require identification of all the cases involved and an examination of the income tax returns of such cases.  Such an examination could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>However, it is tentatively estimated that the yield from taxing the benefit associated with the private use of an employer-provided car has been of the order of £35 million annually over the period referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The changes announced in the 1992 budget would have yielded an estimated additional £27 million in a full year with £16 million arising in 1992.</P>
      <P>While satisfied that the BIK increases announced in the budget are fully justified compared with the cost of private motoring, I have decided to make certain changes which will reduce the impact of the increases on employees, such as company representatives and commercial travellers, who drive very high business mileage.  The Finance Bill, 1992 provides for the phasing-in over five years of the minimum 25 per cent charge allowable under tapering relief.  This concession will mean that the minimum charge will be 5 per cent in 1992-93, 10 per cent in 1993-94, increasing by equal amounts to 25 per cent in 1996-97.  The new tapering relief tables are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>This concession will not affect the full year yield but will have an impact on the Exchequer during the transitional period.  The cost of this concession will peak at almost £4 million in 1993.</P>

The yield from health contributors is one element in the appropriations-in-aid which is taken into account in determining both the total spending and the net financial requirements of the Health Vote.  Health contributions revenue is not additional to the level of expenditure approved by the Government as set out in the annual estimates.  The yield from health contributions in each year from 1971-1972 to 1991 is as follows:</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked his question in four parts, and the reply deals with each in turn.  First, the general rules governing the amount of Irish pension payable to old age pensioners living in Ireland who are in receipt of UK pension; one of two types of Irish pension may be payable in this circumstance: (a)  a contributory (social insurance) old age or retirement pension which is decided on the basis of the claimant's social insurance record, or (b)  a non-contributory (social assistance) old age pension which is decided on the basis of a means test under which the UK pension is included among the claimant's means. People with a UK pension who also satisfy the contribution conditions for Irish contributory pension are entitled to that person without abatement.  Those who have insufficient Irish social insurance contributions to qualify for a minimum Irish contributory pension might be entitled under EC regulations to a <i>pro-rata</i> Irish pension in addition to the UK pension.  The <i>pro-rata</i> pension is based on the proportion of the pensioners' Irish insurance contributions relative to their total social insurance contributions in Ireland and any other <Col N="2016" /> EC country (including UK).  Similar arrangements apply in relation to any country with which Ireland has a reciprocal agreement.</P>
      <P>Second, whether a full UK pension disqualifies Irish residents from any Irish contributory pension even though they have a contribution record in Ireland: a person who has been insured in more than one member state in the EC may be entitled to a pension, full or partial, from each of those States, provided the particular qualifying conditions for pension entitlement applicable in each State are satisfied.  Receipt of a full rate UK pension, or any other pension, has no bearing on Irish contributory pension entitlement.  Claimants who satisfy the contribution conditions for Irish old age contributory-retirement pension are entitled to an Irish contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Third, the formula for combining Irish pensions and UK pensions, and whether this ensures that the full amount received from the two pensions is no less than would be received from the full Irish contributory pension: there is no formula for combining Irish and UK pensions. However, there is a formula for combining insurance records in Ireland and the UK (and in any other EC State or countries with reciprocal agreements with Ireland), if pensioners have insufficient contributions to qualify for an Irish contributory pension.</P>
      <P>In this circumstance, pension is calculated in proportion to the periods of insurance completed in Ireland relative to the total combined insurance in any relevant State.</P>
      <P>Fourth, the circumstances, if any, where the combination of part Irish pension and part UK pension can exceed the total of a full Irish contributory pension: it is quite possible that a combination of both Irish and UK pensions, whether standard or EC <i>pro-rata</i> contributory pension, would exceed a full Irish contributory old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to a booklet published by my Department, entitled <i>Social Security Rights in the EC.</i> This booklet is a summary guide to how EC regulations affect all relevant social <Col N="2017" /> security entitlements, including retirement and old age contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has any particular case in mind, I would be pleased to have it investigated on receipt of the details.</P>
